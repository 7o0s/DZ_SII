{"name": "Worms 4: Mayhem!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-4-mayhem.html", "text": "Worms, bazookas and drownings Worms 4: Mayhem closely follows Worms 3D, and limits itself to adding extras and features on the type of 3D interaction introduced by its predecessor in the series. Worms is a turn-based strategy game in which every move takes place by controlling one worm at a time within the 3D environments, hopping and crawling and selecting the various attacks to launch against the opposing team's worms. The attacks include the traditional bazookas, mines and hand grenades, but also a set of explosives and hilarious offensive means such as bombing sheep, napalm grannies, TNT bananas, fat people to drop on the enemy (obviously subject to explosion) and the traditional and beloved ~holy hand~ bomb, complete with a golden cross and sound sample of divine invocation that accompanies the launch of the devastating bomb. Then there are parachutes, jet packs, ninja ropes and other means to move or overcome otherwise insurmountable difficulties with only the basic jump or pike available to our worms. Worms, bazookas and drownings Worms 4 adds new features to this set, in the form, for example, of a nice aiming rifle capable of zooming in and eliminating even enemy worms inaccessible to simple rifle fire from the face of the levels. The aim of the multiplayer levels, which has always been the real fulcrum of the game, is generally, and with typical variations on the theme (protect the statue, all against all, team against team) to fire and eliminate all the opposing worms using the weapons disposition. Another way to eliminate worms, more subtle and fun, is to take advantage of their aversion to water, which is lethal on contact. Thus, among the weapons there is a simple push with the index finger: if a worm is on the edge of a bridge, just push it into the water to make it feed the fish without wasting ammunition. The strategic component of Worms gives the game a reason for living devoted to multiplayer, guaranteed here by a series of unlockable maps and the possibility of engaging in various game modes, customizing the phrases and look of your teams and building/buying sets of strategies which include the variety and recurrence of certain weapons and other strategic factors that can greatly vary the approach to the challenge. There is also a single player mode modeled on a Story Mode, a series of Skill Challenges, a space to customize the look of your worms and a shop where you can use the credits earned in Story Mode to buy sets of aesthetic accessories and phrases for worms, but also maps, weapons and playstyles to use at will. In short, on paper, Worms works. There are worms and grenades, weapons and humor seem to be there, the strategies could be many and the game fun. Unfortunately, Worms 4 often disregards these basic premises. Slow as a worm Since it's been in 3D, Worms no longer works and Worms 4: Mayhem is the confirmation of a lack of will to improve defects already evident in the way of functioning in three dimensions of a game series much better than how it is continuing. Let's overlook the fact that, aesthetically or as a real innovation in gameplay, there is nothing really new in ten years. That said, the first major flaw of Worms 4 is a superficial technical realization, which runs through the game in the way in which every element of it has been transformed from an idea on paper to something playable. First of all, the collisions, the control of the worms in the environment in its platform components and in general the interaction with the environment take place in an unsatisfactory way, with a general sense of slowness and inadequacy to overcome obstacles, sometimes with obvious bugs that nail the worms in absurd positions or force us to face platform tasks out of reach compared to the quality and variety of controls. Walking through the levels becomes so slow and annoying and, seriously, it often becomes not a means to the blasting mission, but an end to platforming missions that are beyond the real scope of the game. This is especially the case in Story Mode, which features a ridiculous plot, poorly done and dubbed introductory scenes and torture missions whose only reason is to secure credits to spend on uninspiring sets of verses and accessories and caps for our worms. team. Slow as a worm The slowness of the action is worsened by a criminal use of the cameras: either too far or too close to the action, chronically out of place in representing the ideal situation of visibility, they are very slow to move and allow a 180 degree turn in the view at the cost by a truly excessive amount of seconds, especially considering the fact that game turns are governed by a quantitylimited by seconds. Finally, the game physics moved to 3D. But instead of working to make environments of greater complexity than those in 2D easier, the programmers have well thought of leaving the player at the mercy not only of the intrinsic difficulties of pointing, moving and shooting in 3D, but also of those relating to collisions inaccurate, excessive and undetectable jammers (the wind blows and affects projectiles, but in a way that the ratings make it impossible to objectively measure), bugs that include platforms that eat worms, and bad timing of explosions and sound effects. The addition of the ability to alter the landscape with explosions is certainly welcome, and adds a dash of destruction feel to sending bazooka blasts under an enemy worm eating away the ground and sending it flying to its death in the water. Collisions, the control of worms in the platform components and in general the interaction with the environment take place in an unsatisfactory way, with a general sense of slowness and inadequacy to overcome obstacles, sometimes with obvious programming bugs Slow as a worm However, the pleasure that derives from these moments is generally spoiled by an exaggerated slowness of play, and by a feeling of little control over grenade throws that practically become random attacks. What is unforgivable for a game that features graphics that are not at all rich or complex, and which indeed seems to come almost from a previous hardware generation, are then the unjustified chronic slowdowns and the continuous and long loading, not only between one level and another but also between intro, mission and level, between which a direct retry option is missing. Monty Python is dead All these flaws undermine the core of the experience, turning Worms 4: Mayhem into a game in which the player is constantly plagued by trying to enjoy the enjoyable aspects of the game despite the outline realization prevents him from doing so. If the substance does not work, then the customizations of worms with mustaches, hats, hands of all kinds capable of arousing hilarity, designed to customize teams and join different vocal sets (cave worms, ~me -me, medieval knight phrases, and so on). On the other hand, even the aesthetic aspect has undergone an involution of two types. That of the first type is of a technical nature: with the out of place claim to intersperse each action with the short, useless, few comments of the worms, which are perennially repeated, a further slowdown of a game action with already pachydermic rhythms was produced, endowing it with dead times and even more desolate rhythms. The second aesthetic involution is instead related to the intrinsic quality of the latter: the surreal humor of the landscapes and dialogues of the first episodes has gone, in favor of a cartoonish characterization in the deleterious sense of the term, of a humor that often makes one blush for the 'naivety, of worms with a style a little too Rayman (it would have been better to take the road of Conker), of landscapes stupidly perched on the hackneyed stereotypes of the western canyon, of medieval antiquity, and so on. Never attempting to break through to a wider and younger target has thus definitively destroyed the possibility of finding a unique identity for a series. Unless, of course, you're misunderstanding the programmers' intention to voluntarily create a game that's really creepy slow and trivial like a second-rate cartoon. Worms 4 could have been strategically fast-paced and exciting. Instead, it's slow and boring. It could have leveraged 3D for a new multiplayer approach to annelid warfare. Instead, it made it impractical, inaccurate, and frustrating. He could have built an ironic and intelligently violent look, with a minimalist, fast and functional technical realization. And instead he has sweetened the original aesthetic, producing a look for children with an embarrassing humor. Everything is then put into motion very badly by sleeping cameras, unjustified slowdowns, superfluous loading, soporific interludes, silly plots. Everything that Worms 4 could have been, and is not, is also what is expected of the programmers for the next chapter of a series otherwise unlikely to return to the right path. It's not that Worms 4 is entirely bad: often and willingly it manages to entertain despite everything, but always with that ~but~ too many, with that unnerving wait, with those ~ifs~ and ~buts~ that incessantly remind us that, in basically, it's not even a game of a certain level. Pros: Killed worms of violent death Valid multiplayer Nice possibilitiescustomization options Cons: No major innovations or improvements Design not always brilliant and problems with collisions Slow and unnerving interaction Continuous and prolonged loading <strong>Worms 4: Mayhem</strong>! The Worms series was born about ten years ago with a simple premise, well reflected in the gameplay: strategically commanding worms, with the sole purpose of destroying other worms in the most cartoonish, violent and humorous way possible. The happy intuition of Team 17, however, did not suffer the transition into the third dimension unscathed. Worms 4: Mayhem, like the previous Worms 3D, seems to have lost the formula that made it so fun to attack enemy worms with a grenade or try to drown them in water (lethal element for comical, warlike annelids) by removing the ground from underneath the feet~. In part, the problem with the new Worms chapters is a not too happy transition to 3D. On closer inspection, however, the major problems of the new approach - including 3D creation - seem to arise from a superficial realization at various levels: of design, technology, characterization. Worms 4 is a title at times good, not without reasons of attraction and fun, but it seems to constantly remind the player of questions about how this or that aspect would have been fun if only it had been implemented better or there wasn't something in between unbearable.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
