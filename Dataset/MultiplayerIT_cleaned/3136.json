{"name": "Fallout 76: Wastelanders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fallout-76-wastelanders-recensione.html", "text": "Fallout 76 was immediately a particular and divisive project. Our sweaty and painful review after more than fifty hours of play had tried to explain clearly what the positive and negative aspects were, confirmed by those players who had dedicated their time to the title, without labeling it as biased. After a year and a half Bethesda beats its chest, retraces its steps and drastically brings the Wastelanders experience closer to that of a classic numbered chapter. Fallout 76 to date is a bit Fallout 3, a bit Fallout 4, with some small splash of dialogue taken from New Vegas and these three factors only push the hard core of fans who have never abandoned the game even further, managing to bring even many who just hadn't digested it. The risk of schizophrenia that we had presented during the previous test is mitigated by the overview, however bringing to light a series of narrative inconsistencies and a mass of initial contents that risk burying new players. Wastelanders is meant for veterans first and everyone else second. We can only say that it seems right to us. Gatherings in Appalachia What Fallout 76 aimed at at launch was to tell the story of the first exit from the Vaults with the consequent need to repopulate America. This element alone was sufficient to justify the lack of human non-player characters, requiring the players themselves to take the place of merchants and allies. The feedback from the public and critics has certainly not helped the game in its growth, but it hasn't prevented a hard core of players from spending a year and a half in the Appalachia moors, without ever losing the incentive to return to Bethesda's servers .The addition of a subscription service - the Fallout 1st we talked about a few days ago in this trial - has given veterans the push to support the development team even more, which has already been at work for a few months after its release. Wastelanders, initially scheduled for last fall and then pushed back to April 14th. The fundamental premise of this expansion is similar to what happened years ago to that Final Fantasy XIV which with A Realm Reborn had transformed a bankruptcy game into a very large-scale success. The fundamental ingredients of that recipe were listening to public feedback and the desire to strongly believe in a project that evidently contained a good deal of interesting elements in itself. One year after the events of the Fallout 76 basic campaign, a large group of people have become aware of the resumption of life in Appalachia and, for this, the gargantuan game map has been repopulated with human NPCs. Whether you choose to take back your character or start from scratch, from the very first moments you will be able to meet the first supporting characters who will kick off the missions of the brand new campaign. Just the possibility of choosing how to move represents the greatest added value and the worst approach for new players at the same time. Regardless of one's personal perception, it is certainly confusing to find oneself managing two different narrative lines which already by themselves contain an exaggerated amount of content and which, unified, really risk confusing anyone who embarks on this adventure only now. Leaving aside this detail, which is of average importance for the purposes of general quality, one cannot fail to note Bethesda's great ability to retouch a large part of the old missions, adapting dialogues and situations both for the old robot NPCs and for human beings which is now possible to encounter during the basic campaign. Now facing the mission at the McClintock training camp means also finding a human recruit inside it, who if little changes for the purpose of the objective, adds a totally different value to the experience from an empathetic point of view. We would certainly have preferred an indicator on the PipBoy that gave a clear idea of which are the tasks of the original and which of this expansion, but from this point of view the work done on the interface relating to the quests is still appreciable, which now allows easily distinguish main and secondary missions, as well as read a general summary from the map and decide which and how many to keep active. entity. Over the course of the fifteen hours needed to complete the expansion (timescales which as usual vary incredibly based on equipment, level and willto get lost on the map) you will have the opportunity to meet a large group of inhabitants, as well as to get to know the two factions present in the game: raiders and settlers. Anyone who has rightly suffered from Fallout 4's lack of dialogue will be happy to know that here we are on a completely different level, bringing Fallout 76 closer to the previous two chapters, the ones that made the series famous in the last decade. Many options, an excellent log that takes into account the discussion in progress, the real consequences and many possibilities to exploit one's own S.P.E.C.I.A.L. to get out of it as best we believe. Getting to the crux of the matter will mean discovering interesting consequences for the Fallout lore, bringing to light an old Vault of vital importance for the recovery of the post-atomic society and which, slyly, will also add the real element useful for the endgame of the game. We have no intention of revealing anything to you, but know that if the main campaign faced very serious ethical questions, here we are more in the direction of espionage, all seasoned with that very healthy dose of black humor which returns by popular demand and which has always distinguished the series. Lots of news We come to what are the real innovations in terms of mechanics, some of which have already been mentioned above. Wastelanders adds two different factions to the game. These are nothing more than groups of people who have returned to Appalachia to re-colonize the most beautiful territory that Bethesda has ever drawn for a chapter in the series. One mainly aimed at construction, while the other devoted to physical confrontation, can both be carried out with their own tasks, up to a specific choice that will put us in front of the need to side with one or the other group. By completing tasks for the two groups it will be possible to earn reputation, divided into seven levels and as many benefits. The tasks to be completed represent the usual basis of rescue missions, hunting for specific objects or the search for some missing member, all elements which however never hide the unknown factor of the exploration of one of the hundreds of areas present on the map of the 'Appalachia. It must be said that this phase, for new players, will only really begin after reaching level twenty, pushing you to continue the base campaign or side events, before you can fully launch yourself into the most important Wastelanders quests.A the Allies are then positioned alongside the factions: a group of secondary characters who can be helped by following specific dedicated missions that are unlocked near their shelters. Once we have helped them, the allies will come to flesh out the ranks of our camp and we will also be able to build them structures specially designed for them. From that moment they will be able to assign us constant daily missions and our relationship with them can be deepened up to establishing a real love relationship. When the campaign is over, gold bars will be added to the mechanics. These are refined starting from another collectible that can be recovered through public events (two have been added here too, very useful for ingot purposes), daily and weekly missions and which can then be spent in specific points of the map to recover powerful new items and blueprints. You can only accumulate a certain amount of ingots per day, but there is no limit on the object from which they are generated, allowing you to farm as much as you see fit. The projects really cost a fortune, but we are talking about a quantity of new possibilities between weapons, armor, structures and various amenities that really frightens any other production of the genre. We will return later on the general quality of the endgame for obvious reasons of time and space, but the feeling is that for Fallout collectors there really is a lot of irons in the fire, not to mention that Wastelanders is certainly not a point of arrival. On the contrary, it is the starting point of a new course that really promises to make the game attractive even for all those who had not been able to appreciate it for what it was, above all due to Bethesda itself. In the midst of all this infinite series of positive elements, unfortunately there are still some critical issues that cannot be hidden, even if they are inherent in a game system that cannot and does not want to change. Inventory management, mutation management, hunger and thirst management, as well as the equipment crafting and repair system still don't convince us, often leading to frustration and the desire to trovary new items rather than worrying about repairing your own. The same can be said for the loot, which has never been a flagship of the series, which even now is schizophrenic, ending up giving away extraordinary and lowly objects regardless of the importance of the task completed. Last but not least, an aiming and shooting system that was ugly and remains ugly, without ifs and buts. That engine now inexcusable Unfortunately, we really can't compromise on this anymore. Wastelanders brings together a whole series of improvements from a technical point of view which are not negligible, but which at the same time represent a cleaning job that was already expected at launch. Where bugs, glitches and crashes were the order of the minute, not the day, now the game is incredibly optimized, much more attentive to the issue of bugs and we have not even once closed arbitrarily. This does not mean that we are faced with an engine that was already old five years ago with the fourth chapter, even less justified there by a small map and an offline infrastructure which, at least from this point of view, demonstrates the progress made for Fallout 76. The fact remains that seeing tiny areas divided by loads of several seconds, all seasoned with backward models and low definition textures, certainly does not represent a great business card. At least the excellent music and the Italian dubbing are light years away better than that of Fallout 4 are elements that allow many to enjoy a narrative of excellent level, a detail that should not be underestimated for a title of this saga. The hope is that Bethesda is really working on this blessed technical update for its next projects, otherwise the risk is to find ourselves in the hands of games from the twenty-year-old technical sector, which none of us hopes will come true.", "date": "2020-04-20", "grade": "8.0"}
