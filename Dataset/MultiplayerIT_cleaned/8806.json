The official sequels have only been seen on Nintendo platforms, while now the turn of the high resolution remake has finally arrived for the digital delivery channel, let's see this nostalgic dive into the past in detail. New weapons The team chosen for the production is InXile entertainment, a relatively young studio, but led by a veteran of the sector (Brian Fargo of Interplay), and already responsible for full-bodied projects such as Hunted: The Demon's Forge. In Choplifter HD the original formula is quite faithfully reproduced, we are still faced with a horizontal scrolling tactical shooter, based on various rescue objectives. The player, driving a helicopter, must rescue the survivors, loading them on board, and bringing them back to the base located at the end of the map. It is also necessary to keep an eye on the fuel level, to be restored in specific locations, and the level of overheating of the weapon mounted on board. The area is dotted, in fact, with various enemies to be eliminated before proceeding with the withdrawal. The programmers have substantially revised the fire system, if in the original there was the possibility of shooting only in three directions, in Choplifter HD a laser sight is proposed that allows you to shoot at 360 degrees and which is used after combined use of the directional stick and trigger. In all honesty it is a less intuitive system than the original, often cumbersome, but which actually allows greater offensive freedom. The helicopter can also launch lethal missiles, which are limited in number. My war The main campaign unfolds through four distinct scenarios, for a total of around forty levels. The former perform the function of a mere tutorial, while continuing in the game we are faced with increasingly intricate situations along typically warlike objectives. We are, to understand each other on the edge of the liberation of hostages from Middle Eastern regimes or populated metropolises, but there are more imaginative elements such as the assaults of ravenous zombies, which represent a serious threat in the more advanced missions. It is precisely in the last blocks that Choplifter HD shows its side with an excessive increase in the difficulty curve, becoming rather frustrating and unbalanced in the proposed challenges. As already mentioned, the fire system fails to adapt quickly to the large number of required objectives, thus resulting in truly confusing moments where the desire to continue is greatly jeopardized. Xbox 360 goals Choplifter HD features the canonical 200 player points split across 12 objectives. Among these we mention the killing of 100 enemy soldiers in a single level, the perfect rescue of all the prisoners and the completion of the entire campaign, up to obtaining a five-star rating for each individual stage. Overall, these are rather demanding objectives, which will take you away a fair amount of time. Good luck! Unreal Engine and nostalgia Technically we are facing a good job, the developers have made use of the popular Unreal Engine with pleasing results. Despite the development of the action on a single plane, the scenarios are embellished with various side elements such as explosions and bombings, which give the illusion of depth. To be picky we have to point out the absence of the distinct personality of the original, here replaced by a rather conventional aesthetic without particular highlights. The idea of presenting everything like a television news is nice. The music is decidedly less inspired, limited to military jingles that leave the tempo they find. The spoken language is in English with Italian subtitles, the dialogues are excessively laughable and make everything look like a noisy comic strip. A feature that honestly didn't drive us crazy, even if we are here on an exquisitely subjective level. Choplifter HD can be purchased on the Live Marketplace for 1200 Microsoft Points, and on Sony Playstation Network for 14.99. Live Marketplace purchase link", "date": "2012-01-20", "grade": "6.2"}
