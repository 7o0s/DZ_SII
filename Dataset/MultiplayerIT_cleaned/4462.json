To seal this trend has recently arrived none other than Sid Meier's Civilization VI in its substantially integral form on the iPad, just to demonstrate how technology has now bridged the gap between mobile and PC hardware on this gaming front, after seeing several important conversions such as XCOM and the like. From pure strategy to variations on the theme, we arrive at this particular board game particularly well adapted to touch screens by Tim Conkling and Versus Evil, demonstrating how even a small and little-known project can represent an equally valid choice, if not even superior, compared to the aforementioned high-sounding names. Antihero combines strategic features in the classic 4X style with the staid style of turn-based board games, enriching everything with a remarkable complexity and a very particular characterization, which never hurts. The protagonist of the game is a ~master thief~, who tries to reach the top of the antisocial ladder in a Victorian London full of crime, fog, dark alleys and gas lamps. In this fascinating setting we find ourselves moving the protagonist and his henchmen like pawns on a chessboard represented with an isometric view, with the aim of achieving some main objectives to win the game in turn against the various opponents and aspiring ~anti-heroes~, essentially stealing, bribing and murdering. Anti-hero gaslight The aim of the game is therefore to win against the opponent present on the same map, whether this is managed by artificial intelligence or by another human player in multiplayer. Victory is achieved by completing a list of objectives involving various criminal activities located in the streets of the city. There is a solid strategic structure at the base of Antihero, supported on a system of complex and stratified rules, apparently even a bit cumbersome but nonetheless inserted in a sensible way and logically linked to each other, presented with a progression that makes them easily assimilable, within the single player Campaign. It starts from the base of the guild which also serves as the headquarters of all the operations of the management sector, and from this the maps are explored entirely covered by the classic ~fog of war~, to be revealed progressively. The economy is based on the collection of gold (which can be obtained by robbing the various buildings with the master thief) and lanterns, which are accumulated by taking control of commercial activities and the like through the use of henchmen. The game is won by the first contestant to reach all the required ~victory points~, which are set goals of bribery, killing and various extortion in this race to the most politically incorrect character. A particularly successful element is precisely the diversity of approaches granted to the player, who can decide the sequence with which to reach the various victory points and the general behavior to adopt, preferring theft, control of the commercial and social activities of the city or killing brutal. The evolution system of the protagonist reflects this variety of facets, allowing to deepen the deception, theft or killing through skills to be unlocked progressively in each of the three sectors, even if a more or less balanced growth in all sectors is usually required to complete the most advanced missions. The cartoonish graphic characterization does an excellent job of giving a particular tone to the classic Victorian atmospheres and the interface adapts well to the use of the touch screen. The biggest weakness probably lies in longevity, given that the mechanics reach a saturation point at a certain point and once the Campaign is over, the multiplayer based on dry skirmishes may not last long.", "date": "2018-01-15", "grade": "8.5"}
