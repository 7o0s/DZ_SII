The fact is that the discipline in question has been the protagonist on consoles of great titles such as 1080 Snowboarding, Cool Boarders, SSX and Amped which have long entertained fans of the genre. But if tables and snowy peaks are currently not very popular by developers on home platforms, on the contrary in the mobile sector there are decidedly numerous products in this vein, declined in genres that are also very different from each other. After the beautiful Alto's Adventure, which exploited the endless runner formula, it is therefore the turn of this Snowboarding The Fourth Phase which offers a decidedly different approach. Snowboarding The Fourth Phase proves to have several qualities, but unfortunately also numerous defects Trick and trak Produced by Red Bull, which in the past has associated its brand with other mobile games based on extreme sports, Snowboarding The Fourth Phase (which anticipates a documentary of the same name to be released at the end of the year) stands out as a product capable of standing out primarily for its graphic component. The Canadian developers of Roadhouse Interactive have in fact chosen the cel shading technique, which has made it possible to give personality to settings and characters, with a comic look that goes well with the over the top atmosphere that can be felt from the first moments of game. While not reaching the extreme situations offered by the aforementioned SSX, Snowboarding The Fourth Phase in fact places the emphasis on the tricks that represent a fundamental component in the development of the action. In fact, the main mode offers a series of competitions divided into different locations (British Columbia, Wyoming, Alaska), within which you find yourself competing alone trying to complete a series of objectives, in most cases related precisely to the achievement of a certain number of points or to the realization of certain evolutions. Questionable in this sense is the choice of allowing only one objective to be completed at a time, thus preventing, for example, the condensing of two or three different challenges into a single descent. A decision probably linked to the desire to extend the time spent on each descent, but which tends to make the action repetitive as well as the progression a bit cloying. As an alternative to the career, it is also possible to take part in online competitions to challenge other users in a global ranking, or to face a mission mode that actually appears slightly redundant. However, the ultimate goal is to obtain gold coins, thanks to which you can buy boxes of different costs within which it is possible to find better equipment, which ultimately allows you to increase the multiplier to guarantee a higher score. The good thing about the Red Bull product is undoubtedly an unobtrusive freemium element, which allows you to play without pressure from advertising or particular paywalls. Where, on the other hand, Snowboarding The Fourth Phase fails to convince is in a fundamental aspect such as the track design: while understandably wanting to thicken the experience in short sessions and therefore more suitable for the mobile environment, it is inevitable to notice a heavy flatness and repetitiveness in the available slopes , which often differ only in some elements of the setting and little else. The development of the same is in fact almost always translated into a straight descent, initially wide and then with a narrower slope, within which there are trampolines to be exploited to perform one's tricks. All this lasts a handful of seconds, race after race. It is clear that, faced with a greater variety and length of slopes, one could have found a much richer and more rewarding experience, destined to hold up much better in the long run. A pity, because all in all the control system is also appreciable, even within the usual limits associated with the lack of physical keys.", "date": "2016-02-29", "grade": "6.5"}
