{"name": "Le So Tutte! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/le-so-tutte-recensione.html", "text": "I know them all! is a good quiz game, suitable to be enjoyed together with friends or family. However, it suffers from a perhaps too slow pace of play, due to the numerous interruptions and rather useless mini-games between the questions, and a single game mode which, despite the numerous questions, will tend to get boring quite quickly. The decidedly unusual cost for a quiz game, higher than even the most important productions on Nintendo Wii, certainly doesn't help to increase the attractiveness of this title. Pros Tons of questions Heterogeneous and diverse categories A game for the whole family Cons Slightly slow pace Few game modes High price for a Quiz game The great success of Nintendo Wii among all age groups has generated the creation of dozens and dozens of titles dedicated to those who, for the first time, approached video games with this console. Software for ~casual gamers~, one would say; it is no coincidence that Electronic Arts, the US giant among game developers and distributors, has decided to create a branch of its own company called ~EA Casual Entertainment Division~, a sector that is mostly dealing with programming in favor of a target of people who have just approached this kind of entertainment. One of the first works of this very fresh division of EA is ~Le So tutte!~ which has recently made its appearance on the Italian shelves. A game for everyone Electronic Arts has evidently smelled the smell of greenbacks, looking at the installed base of the Wii which has now crossed the threshold of 20 million units worldwide. On Nintendo's small white console, a genre that has recently been riding the wave of success was still missing, that of Quiz Games, brought to the fore by titles such as ~Buzz!~ for Playstation 2 and the famous television format ~Who wants to be a Millionaire?~. The common denominator is fun A game for everyone EA Casual's statute is clear: ~All over the world, consumers are playing games that don't require hours of intense concentration. The common denominator is fun. Whether it's Harry Potter on Wii or downloading the latest Madden 08 on their mobile, the philosophy of fast, frustration-free fun is bringing new gamers and new age groups to entertainment.~ I know them all! it responds precisely to these needs: it's easy, it's immediate, it's fun and it's designed to bring the whole family together in front of the television, for active and collective fun. Who wants to be Trivial Pursuit? We must hold the remote control as if it were a pistol and hit as many points as possible if we like the category of the question and we consider ourselves prepared, otherwise we must try to limit the (probable) opposing points by hitting the red centres, which are negative and they decrease the score assigned to any correct answers. A slightly convoluted mechanism that doesn't actually produce fun but rather, after a few laps it starts to become an annoying obligatory passage to be performed with clenched teeth and with the greatest possible diligence. As if that weren't enough, after having spun the wheel, chosen the genre, established the score for each question, here comes a new minigame to interrupt our ravenous desire to answer. This time it is a ~dance~ interlude: the more we move well (and much), the more the points can be multiplied and increased. It is, frankly, yet another unwelcome interval, which breaks the rhythm of the actual game and slows down the enthusiasm of the pure and simple competition between the participants. How much does it cost? 19, 29, 39, 59. I know them all! can count on almost 20,000 different questions (and it's all in Italian, of course), thus ensuring excellent longevity and a great variety of games. It will be difficult to find two quizzes that are the same, even after numerous games. Moreover, the questions are always set and set according to the age of the player, following the data provided by the Mii. For example, the more difficult questions are automatically cut out for younger players. The ~package~ of Le So tutte! however, it is not as varied and heterogeneous as the questions it proposes. Very little happens on the screen, there is no conductor, there are no animations, there are no options or modes that are particularly innovative or different from the base game. It is therefore a matter of spinning the wheel, choosing the category, scoring points, multiplying them and answering. the questions are always set and set according to the age of the player, following the data provided by the Mii How much does it cost? 19, 29, 39, 59. All with a fairly slow pace and repeated until you get to the final winner. An average game lastedabout half an hour, while the short ones 10 minutes less. Having to talk about the technical, graphic and sound sector of this game is quite simple: there is little or nothing on the screen, and a handful of sound effects come out of the TV speakers and the guiding voice that nicely tells us what to do from time to time . The style adopted is minimal, colorful and nice, but extremely simple and poor. Watching a game like Buzz! it is clear that much more could have been done, despite the fact that the genre certainly does not lend itself to the exciting hardware performance of the console. Furthermore, the price chosen by Electronic Arts is not very ~casual~ and popular as the brand of creation could lead to assume: in fact, it is positioned among the most expensive titles for Nintendo Wii, with an even higher label than the major Nintendo productions. Too much for a quiz game. I Know All!, to elaborate and create the characters, draws from the list of our previously created Miis. Once we have chosen our identity and the number of players, up to four, we start with the game. It is a mix between Trivial Pursuit and the Millionaire: the questions are multiple choice and include four possible options, but before being formulated the category must be decided. At the beginning of each round you have to spin the wheel, miming the gesture with the Nintendo Wii remote control. A purely arbitrary and formal movement, as in reality we have to move the remote as if it were a crank, rather than a real ~wheel of fortune~. Just like in Buzz! quick reflexes are essential. To book you have to raise your hand, the fastest automatically acquires the right to choose the answer. Each guessed question earns a certain number of points, previously established by a funfair-style ~shoot the ducks~ mini-game.", "date": "2008-02-06", "grade": null}
