Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Mobile games often try to imitate console gaming, but the goal is not always achieved due to a series of objective limitations. However, it sometimes happens that these limitations are transformed more into peculiar abilities and become the basis for the birth of new experiences, such as, for example, gestural fighting games in the Infinity Blade style or drag racing games, i.e. driving games arcade in which we are not asked to control the car as in a true racer, but to act on the ignition, the gearbox and possibly the boost to beat an opponent along a straight line. Of course, these are races in which the fastest wins, but there is a certain margin which depends on our timing and - why not? - gives a pinch of strategy, also in terms of vehicle management and the credits needed to purchase the modifications. We all know the success story linked to CSR Racing, which by exploiting this type of concept and a freemium model has set up a business not to laugh at, and we have seen how commitment and investments can make the difference in terms of quality with Fast & Furious 6: The Game, which could also count on an important license to attract fans of the genre. Now it's the turn of Cie Games with Racing Rivals, also a freemium that is rapidly climbing the charts and which adds a large number of interesting elements to the mix, such as greater attention to upgrades, the presence of real cars and the possibility of challenge other players online. Racing Rivals introduces a number of elements of great interest in the sub-genre of drag racing games I'll give you the cotton The introductory part of Racing Rivals appears very accurate, with the game that in practice takes us by the hand and accompanies us through the various options, illustrating their functioning with practical and immediate examples. Having purchased one of the available cars, belonging to brands such as Subaru, Dodge, Mitsubishi, Ford, Scion, BMW, Acura and others (the list is being enriched), we are given the opportunity to access the single player campaign, made up of various increasingly complex tournaments, try our hand at the daily challenges or face the online multiplayer. In the latter case, you are immediately placed in a lobby with other users to organize races or watch those played by other people. The functioning of these mechanics has been studied very well, in fact a few touches are enough to do everything and the interface is always very clear and stylish, really well done. The same goes for the substantial part dedicated to upgrades, in some ways even too large and therefore a bit slow to consult in its entirety. Each component has a price (both in virtual currency, credits, and in real currency, diamonds), a value in terms of power and, depending on the complexity, requires a period of time to assemble. Period that can be reset by spending the aforementioned diamonds, which are also used to buy cars and which after a few games already pose as the obstacle to overcome for those who want to enjoy the Racing Rivals experience without putting a hand in their wallet. In fact, the freemium dynamics feel and act as a limiter, forcing us to ~grind~ where possible, even if it must be said that the usual ~energy points~ have not been entered and that therefore you can play as much as you want without having to stop. Going into the specifics of the in-game action, unfortunately, expectations are a bit disappointed: although fun, the Gie Games title seemed less solid than Fast & Furious 6: The Game, with an often unrealistic rendering of the upgrades due to too large performance margins. Even the graphics, although well done, are inferior to the production by Kabam, which however was actually truly spectacular, while there's little to say about the sound: it's bad.", "date": "2013-09-21", "grade": "7.5"}
