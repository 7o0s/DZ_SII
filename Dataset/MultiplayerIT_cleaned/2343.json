Overpopulation has reached such high levels that it has become necessary to build super-elevated structures to give space to its inhabitants. Over time, these structures have grown dramatically, until they cover the entire surface of the planet, and stratify one on top of the other, creating a sort of urban beehive of immense dimensions. Of course, the sunlight is no longer able to pass through the intricate levels of this enormous megalopolis and, thus, the more one descends towards the ground, the more the degradation becomes evident, until it transforms what, in the 'surface', is a true paradise in a dark hell. Which damned souls will populate the deepest areas of the planet? What madness has grown silent among the outcasts of the underworld? This is the scenario in which our story will develop, but let's see better what dark path destiny has traced for us. We will enter the game following an accident that occurred at Real Meat, a meat factory (factory is precisely the right term), in which an entire team of maintenance technicians disappeared. We will lead a recovery team that will have to investigate the fate of these men and, if possible, bring them back to safety. Our four alter egos are part of the Urban Protection Agency - U.P.A. - (which is practically a kind of police force) and they report to a command center with which they will communicate via radio and which will act as a strategic section for them. Each member has a different characterization and plays a specific role within the team. In essence, this means that we will have an engineer who will take care of the repairs, a hacker who will penetrate the systems, a cyborg who will be able to venture into highly hostile environments without suffering damage and a chief who will take care of the intelligence section. As we progress in our adventure, we will have the opportunity to meet increasingly aggressive opponents (obviously) and we will witness their terrifying mutations. Descending through the various levels, however, we will come into contact with an underground world made up of expedients and poverty, but also dignity and a lot of courage. Our four agents will therefore come into contact with an outcast humanity, relegated to the rank of survivors without rights. Only those who live within the ~city limits~ can be guaranteed these rights, while outside this area, where the law does not reach, groups of fanatics, gangs of criminals have arisen, but also agglomerations of people who do not give up and they want an organized and free life. All this frames our mission and we will be called several times to explore the darkest recesses of this world, waiting to shed light on the mysterious Eden Project that is hidden in the depths. the Agency and the tools of the trade The characters that make up our team are distinguished by a characterization strongly oriented towards the division of roles. Each of the four members deals with a specific area of intervention and only with that. Let's get to know our fellow adventurers better and see who is behind the command directives: CARTER - 36 years old, Carter is the foreman and is the one who is authorized to interrogate suspects and suspects. He is also the only one who can access the UPA reserved areas. With a strong personality, she is the most suitable to lead the entire operation directly from the field.Minoko - 20 years old, orphan. Since the age of 9, when she was able to join the UPA youth training program, Minoko has always shown flexibility and great ability to adapt. She is the hacker of the group and her ability helped her become operational at 17, the minimum age required. He doesn't have much experience, but he's a natural talent.Andr - 32 years old, Andr is the team's 'technical department'. Able to repair almost anything, he has a strong penchant for electrical and mechanical systems. Enlisted at the age of 25, looking for new emotions, Andr has always shown a slightly unruly character. Amber - 27 years old, Amber is a woman, contrary to what her appearance might suggest. At the age of 19, following a serious accident, Amber chose to acquire a cyborg body, instead of being surgically reconstructed. Now she's a cool, determined agent capable of dealing with any hostile environment unharmed.Mission Control - While command of the team belongs to Carter, there is a fifth man directing operations from afar. He is a retired agent, aged 48, representing,along with Carter, the team's intelligence. The heterogeneous composition of the team is one of our strengths and will allow us to deal with complex situations through the appropriate management of the different members. Before examining the resources available, however, let's get to know the mechanisms to which we must rely to proceed in the adventure. the Agency and the tools of the trade Everything is ENERGY. In our world, UPA agents enjoy the curious property of turning into energy and being regenerated if their vital functions are irreparably damaged, in other words, when they die. In short, when a UPA agent dies, it is regenerated at a specific point in the current level. Each level, in fact, is littered with REGENERATION POINTS that are activated simply by passing near them. From then on, whenever a team member dies, they will respawn at the triggered point. Similarly, weapons and all equipment will be subject to this matter/energy duality (well, we're in the future, what do you want) so we can finally stop worrying about looking for ammunition for our rifles, we'll reload them with a simple battery or, even better, to one of the charging nodes. This introduces an important aspect of the game: it is not possible to be defeated. We don't die, we have no lives to run out of or ammunition to run out of. The player just has to concentrate and move forward. This choice betrays a precise desire of the developers to create a title that is as friendly as possible for the player. That is, the gaming experience shouldn't be 'ruined' by frustration or anxiety about getting new lives, armor or ammunition, but should be enjoyed without distractions. Praiseworthy, on the part of the programmers, especially since they fully succeed in their intent. But let's get back to our team. The group is free to act, united or separate, as it sees fit, the levels have good connectivity and there are often multiple ways to reach the same point. However, the interaction between the members is reduced to a minimum and, just to give an example, it is not possible to pass an object from one to another (except in some particular cases, but these are foreseen events). Fortunately, however, we can call our companions, provided they are within a certain range, with a simple command. And yes, because we can let other members follow us as long as they are close enough to hear our order. In fact, when a companion enters the communication range, the icon appears alongside, in the hud and, conversely, the icon disappears if we move too far away. It is therefore very convenient to lead a single character and have the rest of the team follow him, rather than moving all four of them separately. We have just mentioned the game's HUD, but let's see better how our interface is organized and how it fits in with the development of the adventure. Through the right mouse button (default), we can call up a menu that allows us to group companions within the communication range, select the type of weapon and the fire mode, but also to access the information section which will contain the objectives in progress, the e-mails that we will periodically receive from the headquarters, and will provide us with updated data on what we will be dealing with, and the transcript of all the dialogues. But, in addition to (more or less) human resources, we also have a good selection of equipment available to use during the adventure. First of all, let's see which weapons we can use to make our way through the debris of the lower levels, knowing that each of them has two different fire modes:PULSE RIFLE - it is the basic weapon of the whole team and can shoot energy pulses. Primary Fire: Fire rapidly, without pausing; Secondary fire: holding down the fire key, the weapon charges and, when released, fires a shot capable of inflicting greater damage;ION BOMB - throws, explodes, deals damage. More to add? Ah yes: the two fire modes... Primary fire: CONTACT. The bomb explodes upon contact with an object; Secondary Focus: PROXIMITY. The bomb does not explode right away, but hangs around until an enemy is nearby;MISSILE LAUNCHER - [AMBER only] Classic missile launcher found in all games. Primary Fire: Fires a single missile; Secondary Fire: By holding down the fire key, you can select up to four targets for the missiles to follow, in homing mode; DISK LAUNCHER - launches an explosive disc. Primary Fire: So it simply throws a disc that explodes on contact; Secondary focus: this way, instead,a laser sight is activated which shows the trajectory of the pucks and how they will rebound;ASIMILATOR - it is a tool that allows you to recover energy from your opponents. Primary Fire: Absorbs energy from opponents and sends it to the player's weapons. If the weapon's energy is full, then it goes to recharge the energy cells in the inventory; Secondary Fire: In this case, energy is fired at the enemy to damage them. The beam can be split up to three branches, in case there are multiple enemies;TIME DISPERSION - this device has very limited time manipulation. Primary fire: in this way, any target will be hit will be stunned and slowed; Secondary fire: in this way, however, the weapon will not hit a single target but will slow down a small area around the point where the projectile explodes;SENTINEL - there will be turrets, which can be positioned by the player, which can fire automatically or can be controlled in remote.Furthermore, in order to be able to complete the mission that has been entrusted to us, we will also be able to count on special equipment to be controlled remotely, which will allow us to access areas that would otherwise be unreachable. So, we will have a ROVER and a MOBILE CAMERA at our disposal. The rover is nothing more than a small controlled vehicle, through which we will explore the most hidden corners and infiltrate enemy outposts. It's a ground vehicle. The camera, on the other hand, thanks to a propulsion mechanism, remains suspended in mid-air and, therefore, we can use it to have a bird's eye view of particularly critical areas, as well as, obviously, using it to infiltrate the various tunnels and openings that we will find along the way. The soulless inhabitants of a dying underground We've seen what gadgets we've been equipped with as UPA agents. Now let's see how intelligent are the people who will use it and the ones we will meet on our way. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the four protagonists is at the minimum necessary for this type of game, that is, they will limit themselves to firing at nearby enemies and following us when we order them to, provided that the path is not too tortuous. As for the enemies and, more generally, the non-player characters (NPCs), we will soon discover that the AI routines are quite scarce, but - fortunately - functional for this type of game. Opponents will cover each other and try to evade our fire but, if we look more closely, they will follow random paths instead of, for example, seeking cover or rushing to the weaker companion. And so, NPCs will have a limited set of behavior patterns but always framed in their role within the story. This means that any witness will not have to rack their brains to avoid enemy fire, as there will be no enemies to threaten him. All in all, then, not having to deal with digital Einsteins for us is not a big problem, given that the gameplay is oriented in a direction that does not involve too much the IQ of non-player characters. A final note to point out the choice, by the programmers, to completely exclude the player from making jumps to the four UPA members. Our four agents will absolutely not be able to do such a thing and to overcome an obstacle they will only be able to climb or go around it. This limitation, of course, will cause a good deal of frustration at the beginning, but only for the first few minutes of the game, since Core have been able to make sure that it is almost never missed, allowing freedom of movement high enough, nonetheless. Being yourself in an artificial multitude Something very strange and unusual, it was decided to implement a multiplayer mode within a title that seems to have been created exclusively for single-player play, but we are certainly pleased with this since it lengthens its longevity a lot and offers an alternative to the classic gameplay. Connection via LAN or internet is foreseen and there is a large list of game modes: DEATHMATCH - it is the most classic mode, in which each player fights against all the other players; CO-OPERATIVE - it is a game mode recently returned to flip and which allows several people to play together the levels of a normal songolo game. Each player plays a UPA member;CAPTURE THE FLAG (CTF) - borrowed directly from the various UTs and Tribes, this mode pits two opposing teams who must penetrate the opposing defenses and bring home the enemy flag;ROVER RACE - a kind of game within game,", "date": "2001-11-27", "grade": null}
