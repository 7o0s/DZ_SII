This is precisely the case of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, developed by Ubisoft Quebec with the aim of making the most of the Wii features and trying to involve even the most casual users. Castles (of sand) in the air Just to make things clear right away, the Wii version of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands has nothing to do with the film with Jake Gyllenhall just released in theaters, much less with the homonymous product made for Xbox 360, PlayStation3 and PC, starting with a plot that is absolutely unrelated to any reference to the other chapters of the series. Ubisoft Quebec's will was clearly to make the title attractive even to all those unfamiliar with the franchise, but it is undeniable that the developers have gone too far: the game has an incredibly thin storyline, which basically puts the user at the commands of the Prince without providing a background worthy of the name. A few lines of text explain how our hero came across Zarah - a spirit who will constantly accompany him in his ups and downs - and soon after we find ourselves already intent on scurrying through the ruins of a mysterious city fallen victim to a curse, which the Principe intends to bring it back to its former glory practically only for pure adventurous spirit. In short, we are talking about a mere pretext that wearily drags on until the end credits without giving any emotion other than the boredom derived from the mediocre (and fortunately sporadic) cutscenes. The obvious shortcomings of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands in terms of narrative are fortunately compensated for by a very solid play structure, which starts from the foundations of the franchise without however limiting itself to revisions and introductions of unpublished mechanics. The heart of the product is always made up of the mix of platformers, environmental puzzles and fights that fans of the saga know well, with a clear imbalance towards the first two elements mentioned: most of the time is therefore spent driving the very agile Prince between jumps , stunts, climbs and so on, moving between settings full of buttons and levers to activate, blocks to move into the right position and so on. The clashes with monsters of various kinds contribute to breaking the routine, which in fact constitute the probably least successful aspect of the Ubisoft production: the moves available are not particularly elaborate, and the need to shake Remote and Nunchuck to carry out the attacks soon becomes boring, reducing this aspect to a practice to be done as soon as possible to return to the much more satisfying exploratory component. However, a warning should be addressed to the fans of the previous chapters, accustomed to a level of challenge that they will certainly not find in this Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands: the exemplification work of the developers involves every aspect of the adventure, from the difficulty of the puzzles to the dangerousness of the traps, even touching the prince's own movements, which appear almost remote-controlled in order to avoid as much as possible the sense of frustration generated for example by a badly calibrated jump. This is certainly not an encroachment into casual gaming, but there is no doubt that the most experienced users will be able to complete the title without shedding even a drop of sweat. Remote Spells We spoke at the beginning of original elements included in the classic structure of the franchise, and most of them involve the use of the Remote, confirming Ubisoft as one of the third party software houses that are most committed to giving importance to the Nintendo peripheral. The constant presence of a cursor on the screen appears useless in the early stages of the adventure, but it is enough to acquire the first magical power to understand the reason for such a choice. As he explores the cursed city, the Prince will be able to learn various spells whose application takes place by pointing at the target in question and pressing the B key: in doing so, for example, it is possible to create handholds on the walls or sand vortices on the ground, but also temporarily paralyze enemies or knock them into the air. The emphasis on these activities is such that the product includes a bizarre co-operative mode, in thewhich the second participant is called to take care of all the tasks delegated to the pointer. Another key aspect of the series, such as the rewind function in the event of death, is also proposed here in a new and easier to assimilate guise: the game automatically manages the ~resurrections~ of the Prince, and the user only has to worry about collecting a certain number of units of sand, essential to allow this procedure. These same collectibles also serve to unlock upgrades relating to the various skills, however in a system with a fixed progression that does not allow the player to arbitrarily choose which aspects to improve. In purely content terms, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is not a particularly long-lasting experience or characterized by a truly stimulating level of difficulty, but there are some rather interesting extras, all unlockable by satisfying particular objectives during the adventure: in addition to costumes and alternative weapons for the protagonist, Ubisoft has made available a remarkable range of thematic stages, in which one inspired by the two-dimensional gameplay of the very first Prince of Persia dated 1989 stands out in particular. Moving on to the technical front, one can only appreciate the work done by the developers with the modest Wii hardware, especially as regards the settings, all wide-ranging and characterized by a good level of detail and a clever use of lights and colours. A little less positive is the opinion of some really woody animations of the Prince and of the virtual camera which often needs to be called to order using the C key. Finally, a negative sign for the sound: the music is not very present, the sound effects are repetitive and the constant comments from Zarah and the Prince soon become irritating.", "date": "2010-05-19", "grade": "8.0"}
