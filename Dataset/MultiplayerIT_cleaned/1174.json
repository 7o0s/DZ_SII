As already mentioned, the console version of Purple Haze is a sort of lightening of the PC one; lightening that shows the side as much on the controls as on the difficulty, both on the cosmetics and on the depth of what still remains one of the best shooters ever. The technical front is marred by an excessively limited and ~embellished~ visual horizon, in the open spaces, by the notorious fogging so dear to the first Nintendo64 productions, by polygonal models reduced to the bone and curtailed by the surprising range of animations that masterfully characterized them on PC, from a decidedly tarnished and monochromatic texture sector and from a frame rate calibrated to 30 fps well disposed to inexplicable, however sporadic, shots in moments that are anything but chaotic. I am forced to note even two very unpleasant crashes. I'm not just talking about an unforgettable sound track... how much about a masterful dubbing work. Dirty sons of... That Coyote Developments was not a work of chisel was certainly not guessed from the incredible amount of goodies and preciousness unfortunately lost in the conversion phase, but rather from the embarrassment already betrayed by the much less pretentious interlude films, however relevant in a game that makes the atmosphere one of its cornerstones, no longer in real time but rendered under the dull guise of indigestible full motion video sequences worthy of the quality of a flaming Sega Saturn. Fortunately, a very different fate has befallen the sound front. I'm not just talking about an unforgettable sound track, in which pieces such as I Wanna Be Your Dog by the Stooges or a cover of Hey Joe by Deep Purple just to name a couple stand out, but rather a work of dubbing that has something masterful about it. I admit that I was the first to have given up on the ~pulp, too much~ language during the adaptation phase, but with great pleasure I can assure you that no censorship has been made to what remains the meanest, most scurrilous, obscene dialogues and dirty, however divinely scripted to say the least, that you've ever heard in a video game: ask the sergeant's ~unfortunate son of a bitch~ at the training camp, this last session, which you won't have to miss for the world... As for the gameplay, know that Purple Haze is a team shooter in which, putting yourself in the shoes of first class sergeant Steven Hawkins or Warren Douglas, you will put yourself in command of a platoon to which you can give orders in real time. At the press of a button you can order your men to scatter, attack, stand still or follow you by simply opening a submenu. The Vietnamese guides, regularly enlisted in the American army, will always know which are the paths to follow to reach the set objective; however, you will have a map of the region that can always be consulted, but I advise you to keep them in the front row anyway because, unlike you, they know how to recognize the traps of the Cong. You will also be able to talk to the members of the team or call them individually at any time in which case you need their help, so the doctor will come to heal you if you are injured, the engineer will bring you ammunition when you run dry (you will handle the beauty of about thirty weapons), the wireless operator will allow you to contact the field and so on Each member has their own psychological profile, although the characterization is not as convincing as in the PC original. Each member has their own psychological profile, although the characterization is not as convincing as in the PC original. But here is yet another tile that falls on this adaptation: the poor AI of your men. It will often happen to see them launch themselves on the hidden enemy and make a clean sweep under a rain of fire, completely oblivious to the danger. Occasionally someone will scream in pain and curse, but you'll see him there, stoic in the crossfire, getting riddled like a Terminator until he's gunned down the wretched Cong hiding in his crevice. And with the Cong the situation is even worse, since even Galaga's spaceships could boast more sophisticated attack routines. And here is the real and most insurmountable limit of a version that is too resized compared to the original: the excessive ease with which the various missions are completed, already in themselves clearly streamlined, curtailed and resized, which will keep you busy as hell about 7 or 8 hours of play. I don't know what content will be downloadable via Xbox Live in the future, but the manual mentions it. The game is obviously playable entirely online like the PC counterpart and I can guarantee you that it is, on balance, remains one of the best aspects of the playful package here.. Vietcong fails to relive a second youth on consoles due to an excessive lightening of the technical and above all playful contents that occurred during the porting phase. Much of the charm of the original has been lost, leaving the field for a considerably (too) simplified and decidedly short product to be completed even in Vietnam Mode. However, it remains the leading exponent of this authentic wave of games inspired by real war conflicts available on consoles, waiting for the upcoming Men of Valor: Vietnam, Call of Duty: Finest Hour and Brothers in Arms. A meager consolation for a title that had to and, above all, could, do more. Much more Pros: Good feeling and atmosphere although far from the glories of the PC version Ability to control an entire team in real time Very good dubbing, unforgettable dialogues Exceptional SoundtrackMultiplayer and extra content usable via Xbox Live Cons: AI of teammates and enemies reduced to the bone Disarming ease Just 8 hours of gameplay in Single Player mode It has lost a lot compared to the original PC The original Vietcong landed on the PC market last year thanks to a valuable work done jointly by Illusion Softworks and Pterodon Team, immediately attracting, and rightfully so, the attention of the public and the specialized press although the spotlights were on in quite other directions. Not even a year after its publication, Vietcong: Fist Alpha has already echoed it, a dutiful expansion with little original title and content, except for the new and versatile editor and the 8 multiplayer maps, and the canonical box set, containing game and expansion, this time more lyrically baptized Vietcong: Purple Haze. Well, let's start immediately by saying that the Vietcong here: Purple Haze in Xbox format does not enjoy, alas, all the contents of the PC counterpart, far from it. The Coyote Developments team, in charge of the porting operation for the console market after the unconvincing Die Hard Vendetta and ZooCube, essentially limited itself to a sort of adaptation by taking 17 missions from Purple Haze in PC format, streamlined and lightened here and there , and going to combine them with two completely new missions which, however, also turn out to be the most insipid of the entire playful package. In fact, thinking of being able to enjoy the depth and complexity of a team strategy that requires the keys of an entire keyboard and a good mouse to be played did not fall within our most optimistic expectations, but the aspect that without what disappointed us most was seeing that unique atmosphere inexorably diminish, that emotional and damned engaging experience that only the stars and stripes filmography inspired by the tragic and controversial conflict had been able to give us back before the advent of the Vietcong on the PC proscenium. Yes, because Vietcong, the original, has little or nothing to envy to the transport of classics such as Full Metal Jacket, of which the game training is a very refined cameo of quotes, Hamburger Hill, Apocalypse Now and above all the award-winning Platoon, films from which Illusion Softworks and Pterodon Team have drawn heavily giving life to one of the most convincing war games in the entire videogame history", "date": "2004-10-19", "grade": null}
