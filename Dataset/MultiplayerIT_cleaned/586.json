{"name": "Super Monkey Ball Touch & Roll", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-monkey-ball-touch-roll.html", "text": "Roll, roll, roll... The basic idea has remained unchanged: the spheres with a nice little monkey inside, selectable without any influence on the gameplay, must be led to the goal, through a path full of obstacles and often twisted beyond belief. However, it is not the sphere that is controlled, but the labyrinth itself, which will be tilted to induce the ball, physically, to tilt and slide in the appropriate direction and at the right speed. In previous versions, control was entrusted to the analog directional stick: in a game where precision and input response is really everything, this choice was a winner. Unfortunately, Sega's will to exploit at all costs - even understandably - the DS touch screen has literally killed Monkey Ball: Touch & Roll can in fact be played in two ways, one worse than the other. By controlling the environment with the stylus, pressing on the touch screen to tilt the path, we obtain a good result in orienting the sphere but we lack a precise and instinctive response to our inputs; au contraire using the d-pad, the best quality in terms of feedback is counterbalanced by a poor precision in the inclinations. If initially these two defects are not noticed much, it is already from the fifth or sixth course onwards that they emerge forcefully, when the speed of rotation and movement come into play and are combined with a flood of obstacles of all kinds, mobile and non-mobile . Monkey Ball is actually all here, and considering these two negative aspects of fundamental importance in the game structure, one could also avoid adding anything else. However, even in this version for DS the traditional mini-games of the series could not be missing: therefore Bowling, Golf and other amusements that we have known in previous incarnations are back, accompanied by some brand new ones, conceived for DS and which unfortunately they misuse the touch-screen, proving to be real design messes. ... roll, roll, roll... Technically Monkey Ball is a bizarre contradiction: the three-dimensional environments are fabulous, masterfully made at the level of pure polygonal background, with excellently modeled paths and with an original and well thought out design. The sphere containing the little monkey, made in a cartoonish 2D, moves together with the environment at a constant 60fps, and in such a product where fluidity is an extremely important element, the care taken by the programmers for the visual aspect of Touch & Roll... if it weren't for the camera that is always completely screwed. The player's real obstacle, in Touch & Roll, is precisely the camera, which does not want to sit still and often and willingly makes senseless evolutions that lead prematurely and all too often to Game Over. On the other hand, the frustration comes thanks also, and above all, to the soundtrack, which is simply bad: the tunes croak as if they came out of a Fisher Price sound reproducer from the 80s, they are repetitive and incredibly annoying. The sound accompaniment should relax or encourage the player in a title of this genre, that of Touch & Roll only helps him to choose as quickly as possible the next cartridge to insert in the handheld. Comment Monkey Ball is a prime example of how a franchise with an excellent reputation can be completely destroyed and distorted by the desire to abuse the technical characteristics of a console, when these do not fit the basic concept. In Monkey Ball it is the analog directional stick and tactile sensitivity that make the difference, but Sega has deemed it appropriate not only to take care of the digital control as little as possible, but to rely almost entirely on the touch-screen when this is unable to offer the user as needed to fully enjoy Monkey Ball. Bad camera programming and a forgettable soundtrack are the other sore points of a cartridge that relies practically only on mini-games to delight the player ... far too little to justify the purchase. Pros Concept and minigames are always fun Great graphics Cons Bad camera Unforgettable soundtrack Rough and imprecise controls Monkey Ball was Sega's original reworking of Atari's old concept behind the historic Marble Madness: lead a ball to its destination through an intricate maze. Thanks to the cute character design of Sega's monkeys and the technology of 2000, Monkey Ball has managed to win a massive amount of fans: the ingenious level design and the generous amount ofmini-games to be played alone or in company have made the various titles for home consoles, Gamecube especially, little jewels of digital entertainment. Unfortunately, this DS edition does not live up to our expectations.", "date": "2006-03-15", "grade": null}
