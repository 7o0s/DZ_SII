More than the act of gratuitous carnage itself, Doom 3 bases its entertainment on its ability to scare the player. As in any self-respecting horror film, the greater the perceived tension, the greater the effect achieved by the inevitable, frightening, dramatic scene and the consequent enjoyment of thrill seekers. Obviously, both game design and technological availability play a crucial role in all of this. Literally rivers of ink have been spent on Carmack's new engine, so we can safely avoid getting lost behind the technicalities, in favor of a discussion of the game's aesthetics applied to gameplay. Obviously the fixed point, and it could not be otherwise, is that the graphics are simply beyond compare. The 3D models boast a certainly important (but not exceptional) number of polygons but what impresses the eye above all is the fantastic lighting system, the dynamic textures and the practically ubiquitous bump maps, which give the whole an unprecedented ~body~ . More than the act of gratuitous carnage itself, Doom 3 bases its entertainment on its ability to scare the player Journey to Hell, round trip. A graphic majesty that borders on ostentation even in the level design, everything is so rounded, curved and convex that it almost makes you dizzy! Beautiful graphics, beautiful lights and beautiful shadows of course. So beautiful that they will never be taken out of your sight, because in Doom3 it is always terribly dark: a precise choice of game design that some will not fail to appreciate, while others will detest with all their hearts. Going along dark corridors or plunging into the dense darkness of a room sporadically illuminated by an agonizing neon tube is a good way to raise tension, but the impression is that you let yourself get carried away a little too much: when you immerse yourself correctly in the character you remain rightly terrified by the claustrophobic, dark and oppressive settings, but it is enough to let the tension ease because a certain annoyance takes over in not understanding where the hell we are going (or at least why, in the year 2145, the protagonist can't hold flashlight and rifle at the same time!). Unfortunately, there are several causes for a relaxation of tension, and they reflect some of the limitations of a gameplay that is not exactly in step with the times. ''Survival Horror means, will come through windows'' Let's start from the most relevant aspect, namely the combat experience. We have no choice but to admit that these really are awful (hence beautiful) and beautifully animated enemies. Too bad their behavior leaves something to be desired. The best that the AI will extract from the hat is to try to exploit walls and obstacles to avoid our bullets, but beyond this, all enemies follow the same behavioral pattern, simple and - alas - rather predictable. After less than half an hour of play we will know with mathematical precision that in every dark room or cave and behind most of the blind corners, one or more monsters await us, which instead of coming to meet us, or wandering around the level in search of prey, they will pop out suddenly from the most unexpected directions (ceilings, windows... obviously never from the main door) only when we go beyond a certain trigger threshold. Doom 3 is perhaps the most scripted game in history - scripted with care and method, we agree, almost as if it were a real film - but at the thirtieth monster that leaps out of nowhere it is difficult not to detect a certain repetitiveness in the game scheme, in addition than a perceptible rush in trying to constantly invent something new in the formula ~enter the room, make the monsters come out suddenly and in the most terrifying way possible~. In a short time we tend to literally enter the level designer's head, guessing in advance how that medi-pack left in plain sight will activate the monsters on the opposite side of the room, or that from that dark corner - far too dark - one will surely come out zombies as we get close. The excellent audio, in Italian, helps us to accumulate healthy ~horrific~ thrills. ''Survival Horror means, will come through windows'' Difficult to remain ~terrified~ for too long with this awareness, lucky that the pure and simple act of ~fragging~ of the monsters is the most satisfying we have seen in an FPS recently. The excellent audio, in Italian, helps us to accumulate healthy ~horrific~ thrills. The sound of Doom 3 is undoubtedly very unconventional and really scary. Beyond the heavy meta themel of the introductory menu, the game is substantially devoid of a real musical theme, but compensates by drawing the attention of the gamer's ears exclusively to the disturbing and frightening sound effects that accompany us along our entire journey. At every corner we will happen to hear screams, metallic noises and gruesome sounds of all kinds, which leave us only to imagine what horror may be hidden just a room away. Furthermore, the only way to identify a monster before it leaps from its hiding place behind us is often to guess its position thanks to the noises it emits: moans, growls, hissing disembodied voices, shuffling of feet or clicking of clawed paws on the steel. In these cases, having an adequate 3D audio reproduction system offers a considerable improvement in the gaming experience. Certainly, however, you will want to know something about the weapons, so here you are satisfied: assigning them an overall judgment, they do their job well, have a sufficiently aggressive look and communicate good sensations. The lack of secondary fire modes and the very fact that beyond the different ranges, each of them does not present particular characteristics that make it more or less suitable for certain situations, such as was the case for Far Cry weapons (see box previous page). The criterion for using one rather than another is therefore almost always the mere availability of ammunition. This makes the firefights more linear, thanks to the control system which does not include keys to protrude from the corners, but only the good old directional cross. Someone could say that it is an ~old-school~ gameplay model that refers us to the masterpieces of the past and does not pretend to have ambitions for renewal. This is certainly true, but it must also be said that the ~run&gun~ FPS like Serious Sam or Painkiller have best interpreted the spirit of the old Dooms, while DooM 3 has much less in common with its illustrious predecessors and is indeed similar to the first 2 Quake, in which the use of new technologies limited the number of enemies on the screen just like they do now. However, the fact that the difficulty in progressing through the maps infallibly lies in the old ~find the door and look for the key~ system and that no effort has been made to disengage from this mechanic as old as the genre itself, can only confirm the lack of commitment to introduce some small innovation outside the technological aspect. Interesting is the idea that the keys to be collected consist of the individual PDAs of the Martian base personnel, complete with the vocal logs of the previous owners. But the very fact of standing there listening to a minute or two of recorded speech (and in many cases we will have to do to keep going) knowing that no monster will attack us in the meantime, helps to break the tension. Imagine having managed to accumulate the right amount of ~excitement~ to fully enjoy the withering appearances of monsters or the cinematic sequences of effect: here it is slipping away on the words of a bored technician whose brains we have just blown out, jotted down before transformed into a bloodthirsty man-eating zombie. Speaking of background, the effort made in describing the structure and the type of operations conducted on Mars is commendable, both through dialogues with the NPCs and through sorts of advertising bulletins (or propaganda, in full Starship Troopers style!) on the screens of the base . A real pity, however, that in the era of videogame brands built around the success and charisma of a leading character, we find ourselves once again impersonating a marine with no name and no verb. It is however interesting to note how Id Software has learned Half Life's lesson. In fact, in the first level, instead of ending up immediately catapulted into the action, we find ourselves in the classic military base, peaceful and somewhat reassuring, we witness the inevitable ~accident~ firsthand, and we retrace the road we have just travelled, with the 'addition of corpses and streaks of blood on walls and floors. A classic, which still makes a good impression. What about multiplayer? The mods will take care of it. The multiplayer mode, long considered discarded and finally included, deserves a final mention, more for the sake of completeness than for its intrinsic qualities. Inexplicably, a maximum cap of 4 players has been set (already circumvented in the servers currently in operation), which in any case is well suited to the limited size of the 5 maps included, rather well done, unlike some of the singleplayer ones,certainly forgettable. While waiting for the inspiration of the community to create new ones, we note the lack of particularly innovative game modes, in accordance with the declared commitment to devote oneself mainly to the single-player campaign. Or perhaps the lack of success of some of the most original proposals of recent years (Bombing Run docet) has led Id Software to focus on the classic once again. Whatever the reason, we find the inevitable Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, to which are added Last Man Standing and Tournament, which consists of a series of one-on-one clashes, in which the winner remains in the game and the loser is promptly replaced by one of the spectators, becoming in turn one of them. Quite fun, even if electing a winner sometimes tends to become a rather long affair... Strangely, some variant of the classic Capture the Flag is missing, and above all of the Cooperative, much loved in Doom 2. However, considering the number of small modifications already available a few days after the American release, it is clear that the community is already in turmoil and we are confident that this kind of gaps will find a valid substitute as soon as possible. So an overall satisfactory multiplayer mode, which entrusts fans with the essential contribution because it also becomes varied and long-lived, as was the case for most of the classics of the past (Quake 2 and Half Life in primis). In any case, the graphics engine provides all the potential you could wish for. Comment Along a perhaps excessively critical disquisition, we wanted to clarify how DooM 3 is by no means the definitive shooter that perhaps it would like to be, the ~grand old man~ who returns among young people to show them what First Person Shooter means. This without detracting from the general quality of a title that will go down in history for the technological contribution to the sector (the graphics are really something to show to friends) and for some of the most lightning-fast heart attacks that have ever occurred in a video game. But while drawing heavily on much of what FPS and Survival Horror have created since the days of Half Life and Resident Evil, DooM 3, in its attempt to be faithful to its roots, finds itself inextricably anchored to a perhaps antiquated conception of gameplay , finding himself unable to offer anything really new after the first couple of hours of play. Sometimes, however, it is not only the ~novelty~ that counts and it is no coincidence that sales in the United States have already reached astronomical levels and bookings in Italy have broken through any previous ceiling. Also note that Activision (recently active in our area with an all-Italian branch) presents us for the first time an Id Software title entirely localized in Petrarch's language. Perhaps in the previous games there was no great need for it, but since Doom 3, after all, has some narrative ambitions, it was certainly a good title to start with, and judging by the result it would seem it was worth it. To be played strictly alone and in the dark. Pros: Technically superb Excellent audio sector Has style to spare Localized entirely in Italian It's scary enough ... Cons: ... if you let yourself be scared Old-fashioned gameplay Poor interaction Not exactly cinematic plot ... and the Care The arsenal available during our ordeal against the demons may not be the last cry in terms of originality, but it will not fail to make the happiness of the old aficionados who can't ask for anything better than to take up a shotgun once again. .. indeed THE shotgun! Group photo for the arsenal ... and the Care FISTS: slow and almost harmless, but enter berserk mode and sparks will fly. FLASHLIGHT: Not exactly a conventional weapon, but you can use it to hit weaker monsters. ELECTRIC SAW: you will find it only quite later in the game, but fun is guaranteed! PISTOL: Weak, but quite fast and very accurate. Aim for the head! SHOTGUN: the myth. An Id Software game just wouldn't be the same without a worthy shotgun. Devastating at close range. UZI: canonical uzi, fast, but with a not too large magazine. Extremely accurate. MACHINE GUN: Another classic. Conceptually identical to the previous one, it boasts a higher rate of fire. PLASMA GUN: another welcome return, similar to the machine gun, but with much more lethal plasma ammunition. GRENADES: Nothing new under the sun, but don't they bounce a bit too much? MISSILE LAUNCHER: it could not be missing. Not exactly an exhilarating look, but the important thing is that it works. SOUL CUBE: the only novelty.
