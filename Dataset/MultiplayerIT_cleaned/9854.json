Mediatonic is a semi-unknown English independent development team based in the heart of London's West End and creators of some of the most played web and iPhone games in the world. Or so the members of the group claim on the homepage of their official site... Joking aside, it must be said that this statement seems credible all in all, especially if the products in question possibly have the same quality as Monsters (probably) Stole My Princess, an old-style platform game available for download on the PlayStation Store for a few weeks at the price of 3.99 Euros. It is in fact one of those hit and run titles to play (and replay if you want to unlock everything) that is extremely fun and graphically accurate, as we will see later. Even original in some ways. The plot, if it can be defined as such in view of its smallness, is the simplest and most classic that can exist since the days of Ghost and Goblins: the mad vampire called The Duke discovers that ~his~ Princess has been kidnapped (watch out for the ~ probably~ contained in the title of the game) by one or more mysterious individuals. For the noble undead, despite the lack of clues, there is no doubt: only a monstrous creature could have dared so much. So he sets off in search of the girl who, to tell the truth, has very little princely as she looks like an even more tamarre version of Paris Hilton. The aim of the game is therefore to find your loved one through six scenarios (one is to be unlocked) and twenty-four levels full of obstacles and increasing difficulties. Monstrous kidnappings The structure is broadly the classic one of the old two-dimensional platformers of the past and perhaps for this reason the game could particularly appeal to the ~older~ among our readers. Duke's character can in fact jump to the right or left and up on the screen. But in reality the title has a peculiarity: the concept, which is different from other products of the genre. Specifically, the character controlled by the user must not collect objects and knock down or avoid little monsters, but rather literally chase the fleeing enemy of the moment (the creatures run away at the sight of the friendly vampire) accused of being the author (or one of the perpetrators) of the kidnapping of the beloved up to face him at the end of the area with special moves. The underlying concept is therefore very simple: jumping from platform to platform, accumulating points for the combos and ending up with one of the latter, the monster guilty, perhaps, of having kidnapped the maiden from the castle. The combo is in fact ~built~ just like that, jumping from one point to another while running after the fugitive, but avoiding touching the same base more than once. Otherwise you have to start the countdown from the beginning. A number that appears above The Duke indicates the corresponding group of consecutive platforms reached with jumps as well as a colored trail that changes in intensity from blue to purple to red signals the accumulation of magical energy. There are three types of combos that can be obtained for the final attack: these are divided into simple, medium and finally large which specifically allow a deadly attack from above: the ~duke~ sprouts two black wings with which he can fly up into space from where it slingshots then fired by a kind of bright laser beam at the hapless enemy on earth. The bigger the combo, the more points will be obtained from the execution of the same in the final ranking of the level. And this will allow you to get one medal rather than another (gold, silver, bronze). Medals and music In addition to the medals, however, there are several in-game trophies to unlock and these, among other things, are then used in turn to obtain new images and information on the various characters and game settings to be kept in an album that can be consulted under the Scrapbook entry. Returning to the game itself, it should be noted on the left of the screen of the various levels the presence of a vertical bar where an icon depicts the fleeing monster and the character controlled by the gamer respectively. As the first one escapes, the corresponding avatar on the bar goes up. Ditto that of the vampire who chases him. If he gets close to his goal he can obviously hit the opponent, but his purpose is actually, as we mentioned earlier, to accumulate points to perform the final combo that will serve to knock down the enemy. It is also possible to cackle loudly or preen in front of monsters to further terrify them and earn more points. Graphically Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess is probably one of the most beautifulsuch products of recent times. The scenarios are very colorful and detailed (speaking of 2D) and the few creatures that populate the universe in which the events take place, ranging from one of the Cthulhu myths of Lovecraftian memory to a sort of King Kong, are well represented and arouse more sympathy than disgust despite their features. Ditto the interlude skits or introduction to the levels that are always full of humor such as when the duke kicks a small enemy and happily begins to dance like John Travolta for the easy victory, only to discover behind him that the real monster against to fight is another, huge one. Finally, the soundtrack and effects generally perform their task perfectly, giving audio moments absolutely in line with the rest of the production. In particular, we note a series of pieces that are nothing more than rock-like arrangements of famous classical music re-titled in a particular way with names such as Toccata and Fuga Demonic or Doomlight Sonata (respectively Toccata and Fugue in D minor by Bach and Sonata al chiaro di Beethoven's Moon).", "date": "2010-08-11", "grade": "7.0"}
