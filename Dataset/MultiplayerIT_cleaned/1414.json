{"name": "MotoGP 21", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp21-recensione-ps5.html", "text": "Since they began to specialize in two-wheeled driving games, the Milestone guys have had ups and downs, but the developer's willingness to improve in any aspect of the games produced is undeniable. We sadly recall the wavering physics of MotoGP 07 or the ~surprising~ SBK 09: Yes, we're talking about the Paleolithic, but we're only doing it to make you understand that the point where motorcycle games have reached today owes a great deal to the Milanese team. This MotoGP21 is the sum of everything they have managed to learn over the years, even if unfortunately it brings with it congenital defects and unexplained shortcomings. Let's start by saying that the title is the official game of the 2021 world championship and includes all the official categories, therefore the Moto3, the Moto2 and the MotoGP queen with all the original race graphics, riders and bikes. We will be able to take control of all our favorites, from Valentino Rossi to Marc Marquez to Pol Espargaro and singer company, and doing so is always exciting. When you find yourself cornering at 150Km/h banging your helmet against the fairing of one of the riders in the game, you can't help but feel that shiver on your skin that inevitably comes to all fans of the genre. We will have all the tracks of the regular world championship available to be able to compete in the official pre-Covid circuit, or we will be able to complete the races of the real championship of this particular year. Once on the track the feeling is really good. The glance, although not hyper-realistic, is still on excellent levels and the textures are generally of good quality. The changeable weather is fantastic and forces us to stop in the pits to change wheels and do a quick check. The rain is then rendered really well both visually and in terms of driving reactions; finding yourself giving a kiss to the asphalt is a matter of a moment. In short, a convincing experience as we will see in the MotoGP21 review on PS5. Game mode down to touch the hot asphalt The game modes are the classic ones. We will have the opportunity to participate in a single race, a time trial or an entire championship. Once inside the choice of category we will be able to decide between all the official riders with the addition of three other historic classes: the 800 4-stroke, the 990 4-stroke and the 500 2-stroke. Inside we will find, apart from a disproportionate choice of ~Valentini~, rightly so, all the riders who have given an important contribution with their races and/or victories to the reference categories. We will therefore have the various Max Biaggi, Loris Capirossi, Marco Melandri, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo and the always loved Marco Simoncelli, obviously all with their factory bikes. Apart from the riders, we will have the possibility to choose even only the official teams, freeing ourselves from the high-sounding names and concentrating only on bringing the brand to glory. Once the driver has been chosen, we will also be able to decide where to compete by creating our own personalized championship; In this case, the game also provides us with historical tracks such as the fantastic Laguna Seca and its deadly corkscrew. However, the MotoE championships, present until a few chapters ago, are missing. The ability to customize our rider and our bike is the mode that most entertains the ~obsessed~ with liveries and colors. In this edition the editor has been further enhanced giving the possibility to choose from a myriad of accessories and decals, helmets, overalls, gloves, boots, liveries, exhausts, rims and so on and so forth, all naturally divided by brands officers. The only flaw that we can point out is the lack of variety of faces available, even if deep down we understand it: it is not so fundamental to give the possibility to modify a face that is almost never visible, but in any case a few more options would not hurt . We will then have the possibility to create our own stickers and personalized equipment, being able to then share them with the community. Looking for the right strategy you can get to win the championship The main mode of the game is definitely the Career. For a couple of editions now this modality has become truly multifaceted and profound, even touching some small role-playing chords, if you want. At the beginning we will have to choose whether to face it with an existing team or driver or whether to create one from scratch and take it to the top of the world. Once decided, we will also be able to choose which category to start our adventure from, an option that was not possible in the past. We always recommend starting from the bottom with Moto3 to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and tracks and then get to compete for the first places in the MotoGP. Career is dividedin weeks during which you can fine-tune the bike, hire technical personnel, essential for making improvements and facing the races. Each team member has specific skills that enhance the different abilities of the bike, from aerodynamics to electronics, passing through the chassis. During your career you can then accept contracts offered by other teams for your fantastic feats and look for better people for your team. We still remain with the doubt of the multiplayer mode since the servers were still not stable during our tests. Gameplay Pad in hand and wheels on the track, the game, as mentioned above, gives an excellent feeling. We have the possibility to set three types of riding: one to have more fun in the early stages, an intermediate one and a ~pro~ one with which only the best can try their hand. The pseudo-simulation nature of the title in fact requires the player to learn to his detriment to control the bike between acceleration folds, braking with loss of grip, drifts and electronic systems, and trust me that at a pro level you will have to be real wizards to be able to keep at bay The beasts. Fortunately, you will have the cornering and trajectory indicators available to help you, but sometimes even with those it is difficult to keep the bike straight. Don't misunderstand though, all this is not a bad thing, on the contrary, ~feeling~ the bike, thanks also to the exclusive adaptive triggers of the ps5 version, is always a fantastic sensation, and being able to finish a GP in the first positions is a crazy satisfaction. As far as electronic systems are concerned, a separate reasoning must be made. With these small tricks we enter the more simulative area of the title, given that they make the real difference, especially the use of the 3 engine power levels, indicated in the lower right corner as the last item during the race. By switching between them you will see that your fuel range and wheel wear will change drastically. By strategically using power and consumption you will have even more satisfaction in completing a race. The effects of damage to the bike can then be set only visible or even real, so that the bike also reacts to bumps and ~brackets~ with other riders. Commentary is absent except at the beginning and end of the races. Hearing Guido Meda commenting on a race, and not just the preparation of the riders and the state of the track, would have been truly fantastic. Last note on audio and effects of truly valuable level, each bike is rendered wonderfully and the engines each ~speak~ their own language. the rain is made really well", "date": "2021-04-22", "grade": "8.5"}
