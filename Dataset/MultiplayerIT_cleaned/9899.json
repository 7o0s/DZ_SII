Yet beyond personal tastes and nice preambles, Zombie Shock is part of the ranks of the above titles that are absolutely valid, sold at an affordable price and of superior quality to many more famous ones, perfect for a portable device such as the iPhone or an iPad Touch. The main mode sees the protagonist, a biologist named Abel, locked up in a sort of asylum due to a mental disorder despite having found the vaccine for the AIDS virus in the past. During its ~permanence~ a new virus called FEAR has put the population in check, transforming all the inhabitants into zombies, which in turn are literally eating the few survivors. Still dressed as an ~inmate~, the biologist therefore finds himself having to flee and reach New York airport to try to escape the danger permanently. I'll split your brain in two Zombie Shock can be defined as an action title with some Tower Defense elements; in fact, the horizontal game scheme sees the main protagonist running backwards chased by hordes of zombies while with the classic dual stick control it is possible to move him within the available area and calibrate the viewfinder of the weapon at one's disposal in height, for then shoot by simply touching the free right part of the screen. On the left, therefore, different hordes of zombies arrive constantly, and the aim is to repel them by eliminating them and preventing them from coming into contact with the protagonist. Positioning the crosshair of the weapon is necessary because there are different types of enemies that also differ in height and movement speed; it is therefore necessary to alternate the movement of the biologist up and down in order to strike from the best position. Equally the choice of weapon is important; in fact, in Zombie Shock you acquire money for each massacred zombie, and if you execute combos - which are linked to the consecutive number of opponents eliminated with a headshot - the amount of money increases exponentially. At this point it can be spent between one level and another to acquire new weapons (each one divided in turn into three levels by power and amount of ammunition in each magazine) or upgrades related to the maximum amount of energy, defense, attack, speed and so on, elements that add a minimum of planning because the accumulation of resources is extremely well balanced and therefore one must be weighted in the order of choice of one's upgrades. The actual gameplay is certainly simple in its mechanics, but it is extremely fun and well thought out. Getting the better of the enemy hordes never tires thanks to the strategic elements above, but also in the face of the excellent control system and the flow of the action; you have to choose which weapons to bring with you (for a maximum of three) and organize yourself to never run out of ammunition, given that although they are infinite, they require a waiting time between using one loader and another. Even the duration of the main adventure, made up of 5 chapters of 10 levels each, is not bad and the different types of zombies and the bosses who face each other at the end of each chapter, more difficult and needing more attention, ensure variety. strategy related to the movement of the main character. The technical sector behaves very well for this type of production, equally simple but excellent from an artistic point of view, it does its job well as a graphic impact and has a very good musical accompaniment, together with the sound and the dubbing of the protagonist biologist. As the only additional mode we have the Survival one, where as the name suggests you have to resist the highest number of ~zombie-like~ waves.
