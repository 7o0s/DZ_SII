Joe, a line of toys produced by Hasbro that had some success in Italy between the 80s and 90s. Inspired by a series that even dated back to the 60s, these action figures stood out for the enormous number of articulation points, which allowed the characters to perform a large number of movements (whereas many other toys barely allow the rotation of the arms) as well as throughout the series of accompanying vehicles, some of which are really huge (see the planes). Following a revival that in recent years has also led to the creation of two films dedicated to Transformers, G.I. Joe have recently landed in the cinema with a film directed by Stephen Sommers (former director of ~The Mummy~ and ~Van Helsing~) which narrates the adventures of Hawk, Duke, Scarlett, Snake Eyes and their companions in the eternal struggle with the terrorist organization called ~Cobra~. As always happens, the cross-platform tie-in was not long in coming... The cobra is not a snake The Nintendo DS version of the game was developed by Backbone Entertainment and comes in the form of a top-down shooter, a la Smash TV (or Gauntlet, to stay on the classic). During the early stages we take on the role of Heavy Duty, a member of the G.I. Joe with a penchant for heavy weapons (as you can guess from his code name) who is assigned to control the cell of the Baroness, a leading member of the Cobra captured after a furious battle. Things don't go as they should, however, and the base is suddenly overrun by the enemy, who somehow has found a way to evade the surveillance systems. The Baroness manages to escape and takes Heavy Duty prisoner, who then disappears without a trace. At this point the real game begins: we have to choose an agent among Duke, Scarlett, Snake Eyes or Ripcord and then set off in pursuit of the enemy, not only to free Heavy Duty but also to thwart the Cobra menace once and for all . Each character has different characteristics in terms of speed, resistance and offensive capacity: Duke has a very effective machine gun but his secondary weapon does not shine for precision, while on the contrary Scarlett is equipped with a primary weapon that is not very incisive while the secondary one can really do bad. Snake Eyes represents a bit of the joker of the situation, having a sword that acts as a secondary weapon and which allows him to eliminate opponents very quickly when they are close. I look down on you As mentioned earlier, G.I. Joe: The Birth of Cobras is a shooter with a top view, characterized by a rather simple and linear action: you eliminate the enemies that arrive from their generators (you have to destroy them because they stop churning out), then follow the directions on the map to activate the switches that allow us to continue. From time to time it is possible to get behind the wheel of different vehicles which certainly increase our firepower but do not change the cards on the table that much. The control system is classic and does not use the peculiarities of the Nintendo DS in any way: the d-pad moves the character, while the main buttons are used to open fire with the primary weapon (B), activate the weapon secondary (Y), sprint to the side (A), or strike up close (X). The back keys L and R are used respectively to reload the primary weapon (the bullets are infinite, however) and to use the special attack. The latter becomes available only after having collected a certain number of objects left by eliminated enemies, a practice which at the same time enhances our character by improving his skills (a level up, in short). Similarly, our secondary weapon only works when the relative bar (located on the left side of the screen) is charged, therefore it can only be used after a few seconds. Gang shootings In addition to the single-player mode, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra offers a multiplayer mode for four players in which you have to face cooperative missions or simple ~arenas~, each choosing a character from the series. The idea is quite interesting and adds points to the product, but you need four consoles and four copies of the game to make it happen. Support for online multiplayer could have really made a difference in that regard. Technical realization The graphics of the game are fully polygonal, but the top view made it very difficult to create recognizable characters with good animations. The result, unfortunately, is far from spectacular and the rreveal all their simplicity in the moment of game over, when we see them lying on the floor. The enemies are more or less always the same, terribly anonymous, but at least there is no slowdown even in the presence of many moving objects at the same time. The scenarios are well differentiated from each other, especially in terms of color, but internally they suffer from a certain repetitiveness of the elements. The rendering of the vehicles and their movement leaves much to be desired and appears unrealistic. The sound sector accompanies the action anonymously, without being noticed too much.", "date": "2009-08-26", "grade": "5.0"}
