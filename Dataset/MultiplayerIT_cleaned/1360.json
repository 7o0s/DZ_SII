{"name": "Forbidden Siren", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forbidden-siren.html", "text": "Sightjack Sigtjack mode is certainly the most interesting, original and disturbing feature of Forbidden Siren. Pressing the L2 key causes the appearance of a static screen, such as that of a television screen with no signal. At this point, it is up to the user to rotate the left stick in search of frequencies capable of putting the character's mind in contact with that of the surrounding Shibito, allowing him to see through their eyes. Spectacular, but not only: the Sightjack proves to be indispensable both for knowing the position of the enemies and the relative movement patterns, and for identifying points of particular interest on which the Shibito usually dwell. It goes without saying that observing the limping movements of a zombie from the inside is an experience of considerable impact... Fear in the eyes This is the narrative incipit of Forbidden Siren, a new survival horror developed by SCEI behind which lies the brilliant (as well as exquisitely perverse) mind of Keichiiro ~Silent Hill~ Toyama. But the illustrious paternity of the product subject of this review must not mislead: Forbidden Siren is not a simple replica of Konami's masterpiece, but a title with an innate originality, so marked that it can even be unsettling. The adventure puts the user in command of ten characters, different in gender, age and physical characteristics. The events of each individual protagonist unfold over three days, within the ten different scenarios that make up the village of Hayato and its immediate vicinity. What makes the progression within the game absolutely peculiar (and terribly captivating) lies in the almost total lack of linearity of the narrative structure. In essence, the user is faced with a whole vast series of stages that are apparently unrelated to each other, relating to different characters and scattered almost randomly over time. It therefore happens to follow the exploits of the young Kyoya Suda at one in the morning, to then have to guide the teacher Tamon Takeuchi at 9 pm and continue with the priest Kei Makino at 5 on the same day, and so on. Forbidden Siren does not provide points of reference to the player, who finds himself pleasantly forced to unite shreds of different stories in order to make sense of the stupendous plot that governs the entire adventure. The messy narrative structure of the SCEI title was not adopted by chance, but goes perfectly with the palpable feeling of loss that is felt even during the actual game session. In Forbidden Siren there are no radars or on-screen indicators: furthermore, the map that is provided to the user does not indicate its position within the scenario. The player is therefore left totally alone, enveloped in darkness or in a thick fog, driven to have to rely exclusively on his sense of direction and on the peculiar ability provided to all the characters in the game: the Sightjack. Thanks to this power, it is possible to connect to the mind of the monstrous Shibito that populate the scenario, looking through their eyes. A feature that appears only initially as a pure accessory, but which actually reveals itself as the game progresses in all its emotional and strategic potential. Hot river blood The main function of the Sightjack is to provide clues about the position of the Shibito, inviting the user to avoid contact with them as much as possible. In this sense, Forbidden Siren has a strong stealth component: the physical confrontation with the Shibito, as far as possible, should be avoided here more than in many other survival horrors. This is due both to the characteristics of the characters (some are totally incapable of fighting, others possess crude offensive tools, still others are equipped with firearms, but with scarce ammunition), and to the abilities of the Shibito themselves: in addition to being often supplied of flashlights, the zombies of Forbidden Siren are able to call for reinforcements once the player has been identified, and moreover they cannot be killed, but only stunned for a rather short period of time. Not to mention that some of them are armed with rifles and pistols, which they know how to wield with deadly precision. It goes without saying that the feeling of anguish that one feels when facing the Forbidden Siren stages is very palpable: the player advances slowly in the darkness of the scenarios, hearing the plaintive grunts of the surrounding Shibito, and then perhaps activating the Sightjack and discover that a zombie is watching him from a ledgeza... well, the fear effect is guaranteed. In Forbidden Siren you die. And often too. This fact, if on the one hand it can push the most passionate users to make a greater effort to find a solution, on the other it could discourage the less savvy players, used to titles with greater accessibility. In fact, the SCEI stock cannot be defined as an immediate product: it requires patience, dedication and strong nerves. So much so that one of the most fascinating aspects of the game could be cumbersome and meaningless to many: each mission has a rather simple main objective (which most of the time is resolved in reaching a certain point on the map), accompanied by a series of secondary objectives that do not affect the current scenario, but help make actions of other characters viable in the related stages. It may therefore seem useless to the elderly Akira Shimura to unlock a gate that does not lead to the desired exit, but this gesture of his may be of vital importance for the young Tomoko Maeda, several hours later... Navigator The Navigator intervenes to help the user extricate himself within the complex non-linear narrative structure of Forbidden Siren, a scheme in which all the stages faced by the player relating to the ten different characters are gradually pigeonholed. Given the intricate plot that regulates the links between one mission and another, the Navigator proves to be particularly useful for understanding what needs to be done to unlock new game levels. Each stage, in fact, has a main and a secondary objective, each of which leads to distinct branches within the Navigator (and therefore to different missions). Quite complex, but effective. The Technique of Terror Fascinating from a narrative and playful point of view, Forbidden Siren is nevertheless attractive in terms of graphics. Fog and darkness are the masters within the scenarios, highlighting good quality effects both in the creation of the mist and in the light effects of the torches that pierce the darkness. The landscapes prove to be faithful mirrors of the atmosphere of the game: blood-red water springs, ransacked houses, abandoned cars on the roadside and more contribute to instill in the user an enthralling feeling of bewilderment, despite the just brilliant of the textures. The polygonal models of the Shibito (certainly among the most ~attractive~ zombies in history) and of the protagonists appear well defined and characterized, the latter in particular endowed with impressive facial textures for photorealism and expressive capabilities. On the sound front, Forbidden Siren makes sparing and veiled use of the musical accompaniment, favoring the exceptional sound effects: thrilling, in particular, the verses of the Shibito, often and willingly able to make the blood freeze in the player's veins. The Italian dubbing is also good, played by actors capable of giving discreet emphasis to the various scenes (even if there are a couple of voices with dubious dramatic abilities). Comment Original, frightening, disturbing, captivating. But also complex, irrational, sometimes frustrating. Forbidden Siren is all of this. An absolutely atypical product, which by virtue of its diversity is the bearer of a rare charm. An adventure that requires dedication, attention and patience, but which reserves touches of pure class and masterful twists at every corner. Precisely for these reasons, Forbidden Siren is absolutely not a product suitable for everyone. The complex structure of the narrative, the angular gameplay, the absolute solitude in which the player is called to face the adventure could make the SCEI title appear to many as specious and frustrating. But those who let themselves be captivated by the sound of the siren will find Forbidden Siren a unique title in many ways. Pros: Exceptional plot and narrative structure Complex and deep gameplay Technically well done Cons: Hardly accessible Puzzles sometimes too subtle Can be frustrating for some Japan, Hanuda village. The sound of a siren pierces the darkness of a rainy night. A blood-red ocean surrounds the area, isolating it in an unreal limbo. The river loses its original appearance to turn into a dismal rivulet of crimson fluid. A few hours later, the town finds itself orphaned of the vast majority of its inhabitants; the streets became crowdedanus of monstrous beings, zombies, the Shibito. In this apocalyptic scenario, ten survivors find themselves forced to fight for their survival against an inexplicable evil. None of them are heroes, but they all share the same gift: the power to see through each other's eyes. Their existences are destined to intersect, different plots of a single destiny. And the siren will sound again...", "date": "2004-03-24", "grade": null}
