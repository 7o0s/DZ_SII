The Sherlock Holmes series by Frogwares represents an exception from this point of view, given that despite some missteps and a couple of moments of less lucidity during its journey, it was still able to gather a loyal group of enthusiasts. and to arrive with Crimes and Punishments in the seventh official chapter, the first to also land on the new Sony and Microsoft consoles. The new adventure of the greatest detective ever restarts for certain elements from the basis of The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, to which, however, a series of substantial changes are added which have served to modernize and make the product more attractive. The decision to partially renovate the gameplay is in fact part of an update work that involved various aspects of the adventure. Starting with the structure, where the gamer is made more involved in the investigations than in the detective's previous adventures, and where instead of a single long case to solve, he finds himself living about half a dozen different stories, each of which is unrelated to each other and self-contained. Of these, four seemed to us well thought out, both in terms of plot and type of investigation, two placed there almost to make up the number. With Crimes and Punishments, Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes makes an interesting and decisive change of course New investigations for Holmes The events narrated in Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments are on the one hand inspired by the original stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, on the other by the episodes of the 80s BBC television series starring actor Jeremy Brett. So instead of continuing to iterate the same typically graphic adventure formula, although there had already been concessions and contaminations from other genres, Frogwares has opted to build a cinematic experience that at some point recalls the excellent L.A. noire. Just as happened in part in the Rockstar Games game, the gamer is called here to investigate, collect and combine objects, interrogate suspects, solve puzzles, some difficult, others a little less, and scan the environments in search of points of interest. interaction. It is also possible to observe certain key objects through a special ~investigative~ mode which is activated by pressing one of the back buttons of the pad, visually not dissimilar to the Listening mode seen in The Last of Us, to search for clues and more hidden cues, useful for Holmes' deductions. All without disdaining the need to resort to some tricks and disguises to deceive suspects, or to use the so-called Talent of the imagination to hypothesize the shape of missing objects, reconstructing them and visualizing them in Holmes's mind. At the end of the interrogation and environmental analyses, put together a good number of pieces, you can decide to corner a suspect, closing the case, or, if you are not sure, to better analyze the material collected to eventually understand where to direct the rest of the investigation. In fact, some tests require further checks, therefore a supplement of checks in which Holmes' personal archive made up of encyclopedias and newspapers, the support of Watson and other characters, or the chemical skills of the Baker Street investigator can be exploited. Still others, on the other hand, need real field tests, with a series of mini-games, which honestly don't seem to add anything to the experience, and which on the contrary sometimes end up boring, not being very well done in general. However, they can be skipped without problems simply by pressing the touch pad of the PlayStation 4. Each assignment, step forward in the investigation, document, or file of the interrogated characters are collected in a special menu which can be accessed when you want with the simple pressing a key. In this way it is possible, among other things, to review the evidence collected, read a summary of the dialogues that took place with the other characters or move to the various areas of investigation by selecting the point on the map that you want to visit. In fact, the title does not provide for the free exploration of the game world, but only of those portions useful for the purposes of the investigation. The sour note, in these moments, consists of the excessive length of the loads: every time you move from one point to another on the map, you see a loading screen that shows Holmes or Watson or both aboard a carriage. The average duration of this phase is generally around 12-17 seconds, and considering that sometimes you are forced to move to three different locations within a period of time.few minutes, it becomes a little annoying in the long run. Playstation 4 trophies The new adventure of the brilliant Baker Street detective offers twenty-five trophies divided into six bronze, twelve silver, six gold and one platinum. To get them, just play the whole adventure and fulfill the requests, such as not skipping any of the 25 mini games, collecting all the available objects or completing the various cases, up to the final prize, the platinum one, which is obtained by unlocking all the others. Moral choices Going back to the menu, all the pieces of the puzzle can be put together through a special screen where the most important information learned during the investigation appears. These must then be combined following a certain logical thread, but also according to the player's ideas on the probable culprit. In fact, in the game there are always three/four suspects, each of which, at a certain point, may seem to be responsible for the crime. Obviously this game setting assumes a certain number of alternative roads and crossroads. It is up to the gamer and his analytical ability to try to understand who among them had the strongest motive for committing the crime and, having formulated the accusations, to make a real moral choice: to acquit the criminal on duty, perhaps because he acted humanly understandable reasons, such as self-defense, or bring him to justice? A final ranking will summarize the gamer's work in this sense, with the score that from time to time will be calculated on the basis of the number of clues and bonus objects found during the investigation, on the exactness of the identity of the convict, and so on. . However, the choices made have repercussions on the alternative endings and on the reputation of the detective, therefore on the way in which people interact with Sherlock Holmes in the following cases. For example, some individuals may prove to be unwilling towards him if they become aware of the fact that he has conducted the previous investigation in an unprofessional manner, possibly sending an innocent person to jail. Of course, don't expect anything particularly complex in this sense, given that the level of depth of this function does not reach that seen in other productions, and in this context it seems that it can still be improved. In any case, it is still possible to remedy your mistakes by changing the ending of each case, but this is a solution that we strongly advise against in order not to ruin the experience. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments rests on Unreal Engine 3, consequently giving the player well-made graphics (excellent if compared to its predecessor) where the close-ups of the protagonists stand out, the excellent light and shadow, and the locations chosen for the cases. The greater computing power of the new consoles has given the image a remarkable cleaning and the designers the opportunity to create environments richer in detail, allowing them to better reproduce portions of Victorian and noisy London, or the English countryside with its evenings misty or the quiet and gloomy days. In particular, the lighting effects have taken a decisive and highly visible leap forward, especially in the exteriors. The textures that cover the scenarios, for their part, vary from the complex ones of certain interiors, the faces of the characters or the fabrics of the clothes, to more flat ones, which in some ways seem to betray the cross-gen nature of the product. In such a context, unfortunately, the shots that sometimes accompany the exploration of Sherlock Holmes are out of place, a phenomenon that occurs, however, only in some areas. For the audio, on the other hand, the dubbing is generally excellent, strictly in English with Italian subtitles, and the sound effects, while the music, which pops up in some junctures of the adventure to underline its drama or specific important moments, plays its ~job~ quite well, contributing to the user's identification.", "date": "2014-10-01", "grade": "7.6"}
