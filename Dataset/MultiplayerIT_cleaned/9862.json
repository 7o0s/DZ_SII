Sixteen years later, here is the title back thanks to the work of Gameloft, who wanted to keep the playful characteristics of the single-player adventure unchanged, but adding a multiplayer mode, some bonus levels and polished graphics for the occasion. . Worm to the rescue Today as then, the storyline that forms the backdrop to the action is as thin as a sheet of paper: a suit with mysterious powers falls to earth right on the earthworm Jim, who jumps at the opportunity to transform into a superhero and rush to the rescue of a princess. In this new HD version, the introduction unfolds through a series of pleasant comic book-style illustrated tables, but everything always translates into a jumble of bizarre, if not totally meaningless, settings and characters. A feature that also involves the succession of levels - detached from any connection with each other - and which can leave you dumbfounded, especially if you have never been familiar with the franchise. As can be guessed from these first hints, Gameloft did not want to touch the supporting structure of the title, an operation that will surely make the most intransigent fans happy but which on the other hand opens the way to problems relating to the many years that the product has been carrying on the rump. The basic gameplay has therefore remained unchanged: the user must run and jump within the various stages, shooting enemies with his trusty gun and using Jim's head as a whip to hang on certain grips or rotating it like a propeller to glide following a leap. There is no shortage of bonuses, in the form of blue orbs that perform the dual function of increasing the score and regenerating the protagonist's health. In between levels, the action is broken up by sections in which Jim rides astride a rocket and has to race his rival Psy-Crow, all within a sort of meteor-infested space conduit which, when hit, they lose valuable speed. Earthworm Jim HD is undoubtedly enjoyable and fun, but it's impossible not to turn up your nose at some aspects that today appear objectively too dated. To begin with, Jim's move sector is extremely limited: you cannot shoot while jumping, the aiming of the whip and the pistol is blocked at 45  intervals and so on. Even the control system does not shine for reactivity, and it is not uncommon to lose a life for a leap made too late by our Jim. Fortunately, Gameloft has added three ~standard~ difficulty levels alongside the original (really prohibitive) one, allowing even less hardcore users to enjoy the game despite the problems just mentioned. Xbox 360 goals Earthworm Jim HD offers 12 objectives for a total of 200 points: two of these are reserved for multiplayer games, while the rest are linked to the completion of some tasks in the single-player adventure. All affordable, except one that requires you to complete the game on the maximum difficulty level in 50 minutes and another that forces you to get to the end without even losing a life. Real hardcore stuff... Invertebrate friends With the main mode left intact, the developers were able to vent on the front of the extras, undoubtedly of good quality and which integrate well with everything else. There is little to say about the three bonus levels, except that they lengthen the life of the single-player adventure a little; multiplayer (local or via Xbox Live for up to four players) is instead surprisingly well done and engaging, and has the undoubted merit of not distorting the basic gameplay. Being able to count on a dozen stages created specifically for the occasion, users must try to reach the finish line by fighting each other to grab the greatest number of bonuses, but without neglecting the cooperative aspect: in fact, one must not help the other only to eliminate enemies, but also to overcome special sections characterized by simple environmental puzzles. It's not something to waste your nights over, but it's still an unexpectedly enjoyable divertissement. As is evident from the suffix HD, finally, the title has subito a full-bodied technical upgrade designed to make the visual sector at least in line with current standards, mission basically successful, but with some reservations. On the one hand, the good work done by Gameloft on the backgrounds and animations of Jim is undeniable, on the other hand, a couple of legacies of the original title make one turn up a bit: above all, the fluctuating care for the sprites of the opponents and above all an often insufficient demarcation between background elements and real platforms, which makes it difficult to understand which surfaces are passable and which are not. The sound, on the other hand, was promoted without hesitation, thanks above all to music inspired by the original but properly remastered.", "date": "2010-08-06", "grade": "7.4"}
