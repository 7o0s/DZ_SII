{"name": "The House Of The Dead 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-house-of-the-dead-2.html", "text": "Goldman... As already seen in the coin-op and in the indistinguishable Sega 128-bit conversion, a high-speed machine approaches the place of the assigned mission: James and Gary (in which case you play in pairs) have been called to solve a difficult mission, to find out why a city has been stormed by monsters of all kinds and where these creatures came from. It had been 2 years since the events of THOTD, Curien now lies buried together with Magician, his perfect creation (he was the fortissimo last boss) but behind him there was someone even more ruthless and crazy, Goldman. The task of the 2 special agents of the AMS, together with the precious (?? NdLL) help of Amy and Harry will be to thwart the plans of the mad criminal, but it will not be easy: the enemies to kill are really many and decidedly difficult are the abominable creatures that preside over every sector. To give a certain sense to the plot, Wow Entertainment has inserted some cut scenes in real time to underline some topical moments of the story, such as for example the kidnapping of your 2 collaborators or when the second boss at the end of the level is shown on television intent on doing massacre of men. In the last 2 levels you will have to face the first 3 bosses you met again and then confront a revived Magician (as always in great shape) before arriving in the presence of the ~definitive creature~ (as Goldman calls it), conceived by your deranged enemy for his mad plan of world conquest. (almost) Arcade perfect! Empire Interactive has hit the target with what is technically the best conversion from Naomi/Dreamcast: beyond the only available resolution (640x480x32, as in The Typing Of The Dead), it doesn't seem to me that there have been further cuts to the game graphics that travel continuously at sixty frames per second; therefore, texture definition aside, if you know the coin-op, there would be no need for further explanations but it is good to say that the number of polygons on the screen is decidedly high, that there are many interactable elements of the backdrop (many times they hide bonuses more or less useful), that the car and motorboat sections convey the sense of speed well and that the bosses are really well thought out and, some of these, are decidedly big and soooo bad. Therefore, the minimum requirements to be able to play this perfect conversion of The House Of The Dead 2 are medium-high (predictable given the visual size): P2 450, 128 mb of ram, 16 mb accelerated video card and half a gig of free space on HD (obviously with my P3 933, 256 mb of ram and GeForce 2 GTS I haven't had any problems whatsoever). Even the sound has been well converted in this version for Windows, so we find the more than discreet jingles, ad hoc sound effects but recycled from dozens of existing games and the speech not exceptional, both in terms of acting and in terms of the cleanliness of the sound, but the original wasn't qualitatively better than the one here, so there's nothing to reproach Empire for. Of course, to fully enjoy this coin-op conversion you'll need to buy the gun that will bring the coin-op frenzy to your home as well. Not having the light gun (sold separately, to be attached to the USB socket of your PC), the game is very enjoyable even if you play it with the mouse, while some reservations emerge if you use a joypad. In addition to the audio-visual sector, the gameplay has also remained the same, as has the game structure: to find the same patterns used by enemies to attack you or to kill as many innocents as possible, you will once again have to find the best way to hit faster possible the weak points of the bosses and be very careful in avoiding killing random passers-by, on pain of losing a life point (on the contrary, if you save many, at the end of the levels you will have extra energy!). To give the game a minimum of variety, Wow Entertainment has created alternative routes, which can only be traveled through particular actions: if you fail to save a guy on the motorboat attacked by a zombie, this will crash on the seabed preventing you from continuing in that direction or if you don't hit the padlocks or keys lying on the ground, you will go in other directions and so on, excluding the final two levels which have only one main branch. Before going to the conclusions, it is good to underline the presence of extra modes compared to the coin-op, taken from the Sega Dreamcast release: we have the training mode to practice, the boss mode to challenge the individual bosses in the shortest possible time, the multiplayervia lan (only) and the much more interesting original mode: the game is fundamentally similar to the arcade mode, but once you have played your first game, at the beginning of the second you will have the possibility to use the previously collected items ( chess machine guns, autoreloaders, extra health points and so on) by imposing a minimum of strategy since the space in your backpack is limited (Resident Evil docet). dieeeee... The House Of The Dead 2 is the best coin-op conversion for computers and those who love this game (and have already played it in the arcade or on the Dreamcast) shouldn't hesitate even for a moment to rush to their favorite retailer to grab a copy , even better if accompanied by a nice light gun. For those who don't like this kind of videogame or have already finished the coin-operated version dozens of times, the purchase already becomes much less hot, given that the patterns of enemies and bosses are the same for each game (being pre-calculated) and therefore boredom may come sooner than expected, despite the extra modes and alternative routes. Thumbs up then for Empire Interactive which has churned out three excellent conversions of equally fantastic Sega games; we look forward to the next releases, namely Sega Bass Fishing (fishing arcade) and Sega Gt (a good clone of the ~Yamauchian~ Gran Turismo released on Dreamcast). A classic coin-op Despite all the misadventures that have occurred, Sega remains for many fans who grew up on bread and coin-ops like yours truly, the big ~S~: from the time of Frogger, passing through Space Harrier, Hang-on, Shinobi and arriving at Virtua Fighter, Daytona , Sega Rally and Bass Fishing (coming soon for Pc!!) Service Games has always been a software house guaranteeing quality, fun and in many cases original and pioneering coin-ops; how is it possible to forget our first time on cabinets now attached to our dearest memories such as those of After Burner, Out Run, G-Loc and Thunderblade? Among the many great coin-ops that are really worth remembering, Sega was also one of the first videogame developers to give more than a boost to the gun shooter sector: we owe it Virtua Cop, the first shootem'up with light gun attached in 3d graphics, thanks to the then very powerful Model 1 (Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter bar board). Then when Model 2 came out (with its jaw-breaking impact at 60 fps with textured polygons and gouraud shading in masterpieces of the caliber of Virtua Fighter 2, Daytona Usa and Sega Rally), AM2 (always one of the most renowned internal groups of Sega headed by Yu Suzuki), couldn't help but release the inevitable follow-up, more of a remake with graphics updated to the features of the new motherboard and some car sections to give more adrenaline to the final package. As cool as it is, Virtua Cop2 had to give way to Namco's Time Crisis, at least until AM1 released The House Of The Dead Also powered by the same bar card as Virtua Cop2, THOTD takes the player into a gloomy mansion that takes the place of luxurious buildings, ports and bases that had characterized the bilogy of AM2: no more soldiers, criminals and mafia bosses, now we have zombies and monsters of all kinds (slow, armed with chainsaws, owls, genetic mutations, worms repugnant, etc) and the onerous task of foiling the machinations of Curien, the classic mad scientist of the case. Painfully converted for Sega Saturn and PC (available at a low price and DVD package), THOTD had by now ensnared so many fans that a sequel was almost inevitable which promptly arrived on the much more performing Naomi card (converted verbatim in a couple of months on Dreamcast): equipped with excellent graphics, the same possibility of choosing between multiple paths and enemies bordering on the absurd and the grotesque, Wow Entertainment (formerly AM1) achieved great success, both in the still very popular arcade version and in the console, enriched by some extra mode. Now it's finally the turn of the home computer version: after the poor conversions from Model 1 and 2, Sega Rally 2 (Model 3) and The Typing Of The Dead (Naomi, spin off of THOTD2, strangely released on pc before his muse inspirational) were excellent conversions from coin-op: despite some elements too many in 2d of the Sega racing game (people, trees, etc) as well as some clicks and the presence of only 640x480x32 resolution of TTOTD, nobody would have ever suspected to play on computer conversions of this level and if the proverb non there is 2 without 3 it is true, something tells me that we will see some good ones once again thanks to Empire Interactive", "date": "2001-07-23", "grade": null}
