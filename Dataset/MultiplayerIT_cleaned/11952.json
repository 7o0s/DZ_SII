{"name": "Delta Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/delta-force_a.html", "text": "As is well known, the best videogame developers are those who are well aware of the technical characteristics of the systems on which their creations will run. In the case of wireless gaming, this maxim is extremely true, because you find yourself dealing with a device that was not born for this type of application. So you have to compromise, find the best solutions to get a product that on the one hand is beautiful to look at and on the other is beautiful to play. In general, the approach that considers the mobile phone as any portable console turns out to be wrong and can lead to constant disappointments. Thankfully, Vivendi Games Mobile hasn't made that mistake with its new title, Delta Force. The starting screen of the game allows us to start a new campaign or to continue the current one. Before tackling the real action, we'll have to go through a tutorial that will explain how to control our three characters, how to fight and how to take advantage of each one's peculiarities to get the better of the enemies. Then we leave: a textual briefing illustrates the objectives of the mission, then we will find ourselves with our group in enemy territory and we will have to look around carefully to identify hostile presences, hidden mines or dangerous snipers. The top view shows us a section of the city that shakes when we move the group in any direction, and the control is typical of real-time strategy (of which Delta Force is a clear exponent), with the joystick moving a cursor on screen: when the target is in the shape of feet, we can move to reach that point; when it becomes a crosshair shape, we can fire at an enemy, and so on. If the cursor determines the type of action we can perform, we need to use the numeric keyboard (key 0) to alternate with the command of our rifleman, sniper or engineer. You can move all three characters simultaneously by pressing the hash key instead of FIRE (or 5) after locating a point with the cursor. Each of the three soldiers has different characteristics and weapons: the rifleman is ideal for open-face assaults, the sniper allows you to hit enemies from far away (using an original interface with on-screen crosshairs) while the engineer can discover traps, defuse bombs but also order air strikes on hard-to-reach targets. There is no shortage of extra weapons, to be collected within the stages, nor alternative sections to the normal action, such as when you have to cross a city in a vehicle, shooting anyone who wants to ram into it. The technical realization of Delta Force is excellent. While not doing miracles, the game features well-made graphics, decent quality animations, not too jerky scrolling and a good number of different sprites. The presence of missions that take place at night helps to decrease the feeling of ~already seen~ relating to the elements of the scenario, which inevitably end up repeating themselves. As for the sound, it is well done but essential: an introductory music and some good quality effects. The control system, as mentioned, uses the joystick to move the cursor and the FIRE (or 5) key for action. The response to inputs is quick and precise enough, so much so that it is possible to manage complicated situations such as when you are aboard a vehicle and have to fire at targets that are around us.
