It's just a pity that in this merger attempt, the developers also brought with them the most unpleasant feature of arcade titles, namely that of repeatedly stealing money... Armor Riders is thought out and executed well, but there's too much emphasis on in-app purchases Small but caciarone Although a game like Armor Riders doesn't need huge introductions, we have to underline how the developers really did their best to make everything incredibly difficult to understand in the first stages: you are thrown into the action without a shred of introduction or tutorial, having to come to terms with a control system and gameplay elements that would certainly have deserved some more explanation. It is therefore necessary to arm yourself with holy patience and understand by yourself the dynamics that regulate the game, first of all with regard to the contents of the application: Armor Riders boasts of offering over 900 micro-levels, and this is true even if the calculation includes a campaign that can be tackled with a second character characterized by more difficult versions of the same stages. However, the number remains very remarkable, also considering the presence of a handful of extra modes that can be unlocked by progressing in the adventure: it must be said that the structure of the scenarios does not shine in terms of complexity, duration and variety but for a free to play title it is still of a lot of stuff. At the command of a mercenary who, depending on the case, can fight wearing an Iron Man-like armor or even riding a sort of battle motorcycle, the user is called to complete the levels trying to kill all the enemies present in the shortest possible time and without exceeding a certain damage threshold: three factors which, if satisfied, allow you to obtain the inevitable stars that determine the evaluation of your work. To do all this, a fairly simple control system is used, which provides a virtual stick for movement and two keys for jumping and firing: it takes a little practice because the character moves in a decidedly ~slippery~ way and the shot works automatically, being aimed by the software at the address of the closest enemy, but the problems initially are quite different. Also thanks to the very small size of the sprites on the screen, in the first games it is really hard to understand what is happening, reaching the end of the scenarios almost by chance: gradually you begin to gain confidence with the situation, managing to extricate yourself from opponents, bullets and explosions that crowd the display, and Armor Riders proves to be an action game that may not be refined but certainly enjoyable. Just when you begin to enjoy the gameplay of the Macrojoy title a little, however, the consequences of being a free product fall upon the user with particular violence: in addition to revealing itself full of commercials and timers of all kinds, Armor Riders in fact rests on a decidedly obnoxious in-app purchase system which provides for the recharging of some parameters of the protagonist (ammunition, vital energy, armor and so on) through a series of resources that are impossible to collect only by playing and which therefore becomes necessary to buy by spending virtual currency or even the real one. A bottleneck that the developers apparently intend to eliminate - or at least limit - with future updates, but which for now stands out as the biggest flaw of an otherwise more than appreciable title. Beyond the amount of content and the pleasantness of the gameplay, in fact, Armor Riders also stands out for a valuable technical realization, with two-dimensional graphics that compensate for an almost non-existent originality with an obsessive attention to the most microscopic details of the sprites, flanked from excellent animations, explosions galore and a frame rate that does not give up but with no slowdown.", "date": "2016-04-23", "grade": "7.0"}
