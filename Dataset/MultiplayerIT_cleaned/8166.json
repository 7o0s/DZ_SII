We are talking about Zone of the Enders HD Collection, a collection containing Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: Second Runner, two action games with a third person view seasoned with some RPG elements, released a few years ago on PlayStation 2 and produced by Hideo Kojima. In detail and to refresh the memory of some of our readers, let's say that it is a series in which the gamer is in command of an Orbital Frame, a robot equipped with an advanced artificial intelligence system and several attack solutions. As the user progresses through the game levels, the Jehuty, this is the name of the mech, acquires new skills and secondary weapons, which then enrich the main one, namely a powerful ion sword. The beating heart of the two Zone of the Enders is therefore the pure action associated with frenetic fights that take place mainly against other robots to try to knock down in numerous settings. Closed this quick summary parenthesis, let's focus in detail on the two games of the compilation. The first in chronological order is set in the year 2172, a historical period in which courageous travelers leave for new worlds in which to build colonies, and where to start a new life, far from that planet Earth which has now become too small and overcrowded. On one of the colonies created by humans, Antilia, stands a majestic orbiting station that revolves around the planet Jupiter, enclosed by a dome that protects them from space. And it is precisely in that area that an army of rebels aboard combat Orbital Frames attacks bringing death and destruction. The first Z.O.E. Influenced to the right extent by the Japanese productions of the various Gundams, Evangelion and company, the story then develops starring Leo, a fourteen-year-old sole survivor of the attack by the Bahrams, as well as a character controlled by the gamer. On board Jehuty, the majestic Orbital Frame managed by ADA, the computer that moves the robot, the user is thus immediately catapulted into a series of action situations in which to face hundreds of enemies who become increasingly fierce and resistant as time goes by. time. Without forgetting the classic and massive end-of-level bosses that you will have to face at more or less regular intervals. The frenzy of the fights is enhanced by the usual robot control system, very intuitive and which in this high definition version ~gives~ more reactive commands than in the past, probably also thanks to the new framerate which, although not quite fixed at 60fps, plays your job well. What has just been described, combined with the spectacular weapons available, many of which must be discovered like Jehuty's new features, these two elements which constitute the only or almost RPG aspects of the product, give the user an intense degree of fun. At least for a certain amount of time, given that unfortunately, as the adventure progresses, everything seems to slip slowly towards a certain monotony. The enthralling initial plot slowly begins to prove to be quite poor in content, i.e. without that variety of situations or twists and turns useful for reviving it, and the gameplay in the long run becomes repetitive since you always find yourself performing the same actions, with good few variations on the theme. Xbox 360 goals Zone of the Enders HD Collection offers 50 achievements for a total of 1000 G points. These can be obtained in various ways, for example by finding all ten secondary weapons or access keys, or again by defeating all the Naritas in less than 90 seconds right after the initial Vic Viper battle. Second Runners Zone of the Enders: Second Runner is the better of the two titles contained in the collection, and on balance everything that the first chapter should have been, that is an enjoyable and replayable 3D action thanks to a greater variety of action and situations. The basic mechanics of the gameplay is always the same, but everything is certainly reproduced in a more complete way than seen in the predecessor. This time the gamer controls the researcher with a dark past Dingo Egret aboard his Jehuty, grappling with the threat posed once again by the Bahrams and the crazy Nohman, who this time threaten the safety of Mars and the whole galaxy with a worthy plan of a madmanpsychopath to conquer the universe. The story develops this time in a more interesting way than in Zone of the Enders and proposes some truly epic passages, as in the case of the assault on the fortress of Bahram. In this context, a note of merit must be given to playability, which can count on a certain variety and on a robot control system. The latter, in fact, in turn boasts a good response to commands, thus allowing you to do practically everything on the screen, taking advantage of all those features introduced by the developers in this sequel, such as for example greater interactivity with the environment and the possibility to grab objects and enemies in order to use them as a weapon or as a defense against attacks. Compared to the previous title contained in the Zone of the Enders HD Collection, here there are several types of opponents to defeat and the levels must always be tackled in a different way (in fact, they range from the protection of allied LEVs to the pursuit of a particular objective, passing through attacks with white weapons to encirclement solutions) with specific and quite varied strategies to follow to defeat the opponents, especially the bosses, up to being in some cases completely customized for the type of enemy. Like in an anime Also in The 2nd Runner, as you progress through the game levels, the Jehuty will acquire new skills and secondary weapons that will enrich the main one, namely a powerful ion sword. For the rest, a good replay value ensured by the possibility of unlocking various secret missions, new difficulty levels and a fairly entertaining Vs mode should be noted, and a flaw that remains from the original product on the Monolith, namely the camera, which in some situations does not manages to keep up with the action, frenetic on more than one occasion. From a technical point of view, the Konami production obviously does not take full advantage of the hardware of the home consoles currently on the market, but it is fair to underline how in these cases, that is, when titles from less performing platforms are proposed again, only by adapting them as a format, there is no one can expect miracles from those hosts. The textures are basically the original ones from the PlayStation 2 version for both games in the compilation, however the graphic restyling seems to enhance their colors quite well, giving the player the most beautiful environments, albeit not very varied, a generally sharper and robots made with great detail, which boast an excellent character design curated by Yoji Shinkawa, which reaches high peaks especially with regard to the main Orbital Frames. Then the particle effects, the explosions and the plays of light that accompany them, embellishing it, the entire visual sector are beautiful, especially in the second title, and the unpublished animated sequences in anime style and the 16:9 support are spot on. Finally, the work done by the software house as regards the sound sector is excellent, which finds in the musically Finnish-inspired pieces and in the sustained rhythm of some songs a worthy accompaniment for every game situation.", "date": "2012-11-22", "grade": "7.8"}
