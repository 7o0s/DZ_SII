Weapons of Destruction, the first episode released for PlayStation 3, remains one of the best exponents of the platform genre in every respect; the sequels, on the other hand, were received more coldly and it is now evident that Insomniac does not have clear ideas on what to do with this bizarre universe. In short, there seems to be a real identity crisis underway, and this Ratchet & Clank: QForce is a clear demonstration of it. Developed cross-platform for both PlayStation 3 (the version we played) and PlayStation Vita (arriving at the beginning of next year) and offered at a budget price, the new adventure by Ratchet and associates tries to give a sonorous twist to the brand, with mixed results. Tower Defense! A peculiarity of the series has always been the sparkling and well-told story of practically every episode, characterized by irresistible characters and dialogues. In Ratchet & Clank: QForce this feature has remained only partially unchanged: the plot develops through a series of short cinematics, but it is only a pretext that keeps the game up and links the missions to each other. In short, the eccentric Captain Quark asks Ratchet and Clank for help in defending some planets from the invasion of an alien army that has discovered how to penetrate their defences: this incipit doesn't seem to develop practically in any way and although the interlude skits are always very funny, they don't leave the slightest mark. The story seems designed only to justify the new mechanics studied by Insomniac for this chapter, which integrate the characteristics of ~tower defense~ games into the usual somewhat platform and somewhat action-adventure structure. How it is possible, it is easy to say: in each mission of the campaign our main purpose will be to defend a base from enemy sieges. To do this we will have to strengthen the defenses by buying upgrades and replacing the destroyed systems; consequently, it will be necessary to collect the bolts scattered in the area surrounding the base, practically the monetary unit of the game, necessary in exorbitant quantities both to improve the defenses and to expand the traditional, crazy arsenal of weapons. The latter is particularly important because it represents our ~build~: each weapon works differently and allows us to put various strategies into practice. The core is actually just this: balancing exploration in search of bolts and new weapons with the defense of the base whenever it is under attack. Unfortunately Insomniac has not managed to manage this transition well: the defensive systems are practically useless without our contribution, so we will often find ourselves giving up exploration to return immediately to the base, defend it in case it is under attack and start the cycle again until we have restored all generators scattered in the area, ending the mission. Playstation 3 trophies There are not many Trophies that can be earned in this Ratchet adventure: in addition to the inevitable Platinum, there are eight Bronze, seven Silver and seven Gold. Most are unlocked practically by themselves, by completing the campaign, but for others you will have to work a little, for example by defeating enemies in particular ways or other players in multiplayer mode. More Lombax for everyone In short, on paper, the idea is more than captivating: the combat system and the level design of the series lend themselves well to this type of structure, but the balance between the two activities that make up each level of the campaign is nothing short of precarious and makes the experience more repetitive and frustrating than compelling. From this point of view, Ratchet & Clank: QForce almost seems to have been designed specifically for multiplayer, with a single-player campaign added only at the last moment. The missions are already easy from the start, but tackling them cooperatively eliminates any difficulty: in that case it will in fact be possible to send a player in search of bolts while the other thinks of defending the base; with a little organization you become practically unbeatable and even the tough bosses go down which is a pleasure. Unfortunately, this type of approach further reduces not only the difficulty, but also the longevity of the title, which is not particularly generous in itself: the campaign missions are only five and it is possible to complete Ratchet & Clank: QForce, alone, in little more of four hours. The competitive multiplayer mode tries to alleviate this problem, resulting in the most valuable content of the package, although not without some difficulties. You can play one-on-one or two-on-two, either waymatch structure changes significantly compared to the single player campaign. Each match is in fact divided into three phases, each with a time limit. The first is entirely dedicated to exploration for the collection of bolts and the activation of special bonuses; during the second we will have to quickly choose how to upgrade our base by spending the collected bolts; finally, the third phase is that of attack: we will have to besiege the enemy base to destroy the generators, escorting our troops around the map, but also defend our position from the enemy ones. The multiplayer games are extremely fun, but unfortunately they tend to tire very quickly: although the ~arenas~ differ from each other, there are still only three. In short, the variety is lacking, and the intrinsic repetitiveness of the gameplay will hardly keep a robust community of players alive for more than a few weeks.", "date": "2012-12-24", "grade": "6.8"}
