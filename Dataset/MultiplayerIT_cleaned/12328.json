{"name": "Worms HD - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-hd-recensione.html", "text": "Worms HD offers one of the most entertaining and complete multiplayer for 4 players of the entire panorama, and we are not just talking about the Live Arcade. The game is developed around a simple and evergreen concept: destroy by any means possible all the enemies on screen! Even those who have never tried it will have no difficulty learning the controls and game mechanics. Players are catapulted into automatically generated 2D platform maps: you can choose from an infinite number of moves, weapons and options selectable from an easily recallable pop-up menu. Worms works in turns, one at a time you decide how to move and finally which weapon to use, and then remain comfortably seated on the armchair to enjoy the effects caused. It's sort of a cross between minigolf, war strategy and non-scroll platforming. The level design is always intriguing and intelligent, despite being random: the CPU processes maps full of ravines, traps, hiding places, hard-to-reach points and shelters, so that the matches are never the same and the longevity of the title is ensured. The worms are equipped with a grappling hook that allows us to climb walls and climb wherever we want, and obviously they can walk; like in chess we have to make a movement move, after which we have to decide how to fire. In this sense there are many points of contact with Nintendo's Advance Wars. There are many variables to take into consideration; wind, direction and firepower must always be calculated to try to hit the enemy worm lethally. Worms HD offers one of the most fun and complete multiplayer for 4 players of the entire panorama, and we are not just talking about the Live Arcade Hitting an opponent causes unexpected and often incalculable consequences. He can die (obviously), but also be catapulted into the air and land on another point of the map, or fall into the water and then drown with untold suffering. The unpredictability factor is unique in Worms, also because until we shoot we cannot know what the consequences of our attack are, and if it will eventually be harmful to us. The variety of selectable weapons in this version is certainly not less than that appreciated in all its classic editions, even if some classic weapons are missing such as the baseball bat and the sacred hand grenade, which will surely be included in some update package. Lonely as worms! Worms HD also has a full-bodied single player mode, which is certainly not the most delicious range of the whole game but can still be appreciated. We can command a team of four invertebrates against the enemy CPU, through 20 levels with a smooth but rapidly growing difficulty curve. The enemy artificial intelligence is obviously of a very different kind than human opponents: the worms will adopt infinitely less sophisticated strategies but will have incredibly high shooting accuracy. In close quarters the CPU has a great advantage as it rarely misses a shot, but Worms is a game that offers an endless choice of possibilities, tactics and ways to win, so it will not be that difficult to complete this mode. As for the multiplayer, in addition to the online one, it is also possible to play in 4 live and with a single joypad as it is a turn-based title. Technically Worms HD has bright, sharp and very colorful graphics, just like a cartoon. It is still the first in high definition on consoles. From the sound point of view, the accompanying music is simple and catchy, never intrusive or annoying, but decidedly few and repetitive in the long run. Goals 360 Like any title downloadable from the Live Arcade, Worms HD also offers 200 points as a prize, instead of the canonical 1000. Some objectives are linked to the single player mode, and are the ones that are conquered faster, others are unlocked by winning ranked matches while others still by performing particular moves. Worms HD immediately gratifies the player with some achievements, but getting them all won't be easy at all. Comment Worms HD is a simple game to learn, but very fun and deep once properly tamed. Multiplayer is the real engine of the game, both live and via Xbox Live, and is always exciting thanks to its unpredictability and sympathy due to the colorful worms that are the real protagonists. Too bad for the small number of themes available and for the lack of an online team mode, which would certainly have been explosive. Pros: Graphically clean and nice Easy but deep Multiplayer perfect for Live Arcade Cons: Few themes for the maps Lack of online multiplayerine in team Worms is one of those few titles that made history in multiplayer on all formats where it was released. Consoles, PCs, laptops, for more than 12 years now many enthusiasts have been arming the cute little worms protagonists of the game to the teeth and dedicating themselves to exhausting combat sessions against friends, in LAN or on the internet. Worms has entered everyone's heart a bit because it is very nice, colorful and funny but at the same time irreverent and mean, with its small and sweet animals capable of performing roundhouse kicks worthy of Chuck Norris, energy spheres like Ryu from Street Fighter or annihilating enemies on enemies equipped with bazooka and machine gun. The title that made the legendary Team17 famous has recently also been available on the Xbox Live platform! Arcade, in recent times well stocked with old glories, unpublished games and small pearls. This HD version is very similar to all the classic 2D Worms, of which the latest in chronological order is ~Open Warfare~ released almost a year ago: luckily the 3D way seems to be temporarily abandoned, thus returning to the glorious origins of series.", "date": "2007-04-27", "grade": null}
