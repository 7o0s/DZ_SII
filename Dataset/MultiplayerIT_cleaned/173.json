It seems to be a solid RTS full of vehicles and customizable units available. Instead it does not go beyond a title that follows, in some situations even well, all the best production of recent years. It is the classic average product, excellent at a budget price, destined to trudge amidst the big calibres. Too bad then that the premise underlying the background of the game has been exploited in a decidedly shallow and superficial way. Pros Budget price Many units and means available Excellent localization Cons Mediocre graphic sector Little innovation and originality in the game mechanics Poorly reactive artificial intelligence Oscar-winning localization and audio. Series B graphics. Nice price! Graphically, the game denounces a cosmetics decidedly not in step with the times. Both detail and polygonal modeling are decidedly mediocre. No vehicle or unit stands out against a general greyness. The environments then have a very sparse appearance, with poorly detailed and clean textures. This impression of lack of originality (but the average product is just that) also pervades the construction, the design of the two factions. Both human heavy metal and the repulsive alien mush show little inventiveness with trivial examples of cyborgs, self-propelled cannons, spiders, giant jellyfish colored like the blue fairy and alien heroes that look like a strange cross between Alien and Terminator. Therefore, the sum between mediocre technical realization and borderline tacky design is decidedly negative. Instead, I applaud the almost psychedelic light effects that give the game a very 80s look! The surprising part of this title is instead the excellent localization performed. Everything has been translated into Italian from the manual to the texts on the screen. The dubbing is very well-kept, with decidedly in part and well-inspired actors.

The fact that a valuable localization like this has been carried out for a game sold at a budget price cannot fail to be a huge note of merit for a title like this. Hopefully, far more ambitious and larger projects than this will take an example of this. Look for the upgrade entry in the RTS Bignami on the page And this is the big problem afflicting SC. We are faced with an average product in all respects which, quite simply, has borrowed all the developments in the real time strategy field of recent years, without however having anything to stand out from the crowd. We have many units available, each with its own characteristics, to be developed and carried forward in an almost RPG perspective. We are faced with an average product in all respects which, quite simply, has borrowed all the developments in the real time strategy field of recent years, without however having anything to stand out from the crowd We can specialize our army, or our alien bloodlines, as we please, employing ordinary soldiers as cannon fodder and sipping the use of veterans. We can do many things. Unfortunately all this has been implemented without that spark that makes the gaming experience something really exciting and fun. Everything seems to have already been seen, from the non-necessity of collecting resources (which in fact are found only in specific areas where they are collected automatically by particular self-propelled units that also provide for the construction of vehicles and units), to the presence of heroes/generals/special vehicles equipped with special skills and armaments. Even the balance of the two sides is completely flat and monotonous. Different technologies and DNA are not enough to significantly differentiate humans and aliens. Each medium, each unit has its direct counterpart. However, the impression is that, apart from the graphics, they are completely the same. Even the game mechanics, the gameplay follows the general trend of the title. After the refinements of Company of Heroes any game has a heavy comparison to bear. In this case, doing them is completely superfluous. Amassing units, taking advantage of the anomalies that occasionally appear on the map (and which give us bonuses and special attacks) and attacking the enemy head on, also because the artificial intelligence does not seem to be very developed, is the only Street. Many times we will have to see our units get stuck behind a bush, or wander leisurely around the map, not caring if in the meantime our general is on his deathbed. In general the missions don't seem to be very varied, consequently they suffer from a certainbackground repetitiveness. Science fiction, uchronies and the Red Army! As soon as I saw the first screenshots of the game some time ago, I was very intrigued to see in the same image what appeared to be a Russian T72 tank grappling with a strange alien crap. I searched for more info and, with my great pleasure, I read that the plot of the game mainly revolved around 3 factors: alien civilizations, the Tunguska incident (historical) and the Red Army! And go I thought! Here they have created a nice spin off of the Invasion of Turtledovian memory saga, obviously with all the necessary distinctions! All the premises seemed to be there for an RTS with an original cue and with many good ideas to develop. But let's proceed in order, the story: at the dawn of 1908 a spaceship carrying a powerful alien race carrying advanced technologies accidentally crashed on Earth in Tunguska. In 1967, in the midst of the Cold War, the aliens return determined to recover the wreck and their leader Shiva. Obviously the Russians have hoarded the alien technologies literally rained from the sky, by making the already very good scrap metal available to their army. Consequently, together with T72 and rpg we will have troop teleportation, shields around our units, ion cannon and a thousand other similar amenities. Practically zero inventiveness.
