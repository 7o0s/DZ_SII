{"name": "Metal Slug X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-x_a.html", "text": "The war is beginning Since this is the Jappo version of the game (but the American version is already available, while I don't have certain news for the European one) it is almost impossible to understand anything about the plot. In principle, you will control one of the four characters that can be selected from a special screen and your aim will be to defeat the army of a dictator who wants to conquer the world with the help of a mysterious alien race. The first rule in a self-respecting shooter says that, to complete your mission, all you have to do is advance through the enemy ranks and destroy practically everything that comes your way and Metal Slug X does not want to be an exception: using a of the numerous weapons available (between flamethrowers and homing missiles you will be spoiled for choice!) you can dedicate yourself to a healthy ~blasting~ action against enemy soldiers but also surrounding objects such as vehicles and elements that make up the landscape . While I'm at it, I would like to point out that to upgrade your armament, as well as to obtain other useful bonuses to increase your score, you will have to free the prisoners of war scattered around the playing area (simply by approaching them). Another rule that the game doesn't escape is the one that wants you to be busy with the end-of-level bosses; in this case we are dealing with mechanical means (with some exceptions) of truly considerable size and wickedness. So far so normal but those who know the MS series know that there is a massive dose of humor that, of course, could not be missing in this episode. The comedy shines through in every element and being able to use the bizarre means of offense (ranging from the camel equipped with machine guns to the tank complete with a cannon) only feeds the comic side of the title. I assure you that the developers really went out of their way to be able to make you laugh (even one of the end-of-level bosses falls into the water defeated and ends up being devoured by an orca!), succeeding in the difficult task of making a war look like something of funny. And finally, in order not to break the rules of shooters, it is possible to tackle the game with the help of a friend. The name-calling fights over who gets to get the next power-up are back and I have to say they were missed. Moving on to something more technical, the view is an old (but no less valid) third-person side view and if you have looked at the photos and are wondering where the polygons have gone, the answer is only one: simply not There are! A game from another era... This is a game from the past, when a little sprites and a lot of imagination were enough to have fun, in spite of the number of polygons, multiple views and special effects that we can no longer give up. Pure playability is the cornerstone on which every element of the game is developed: the interface, for example, is so simple that the first game will be enough to practice the controls, allowing you to immediately immerse yourself in the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. Immediacy is precisely one of the main advantages of MSX: you will no longer have to go crazy with the settings (which are limited to the difficulty and the number of lives available), with the view, with the inventory, with the save points, here you play and enough and if you want to save you will have to finish the level! In short, an old-fashioned title that does not give up on clean and fast graphics, capable of moving a large number of elements without any hitches (but the improvements compared to the previous version are limited to less frequent uploads) and a more than honest sound sector, made of nice music that goes well with the rhythm of the game. The same can be said for the not very numerous but fun and well-crafted effects. Not all that glitters is gold! At this point, having only talked about the positive sides of the title, all that remains is to list its (few) defects: first of all the not exceptional longevity (after all, it was originally a coin-op) to which the programmers have found a partial remedy by setting the difficulty of the game on really high levels: play hard and finish MSX will be an impossible task even if, for newbies, it is possible to lower the level and get infinite continues. Again to meet the low longevity, once all the missions have been completed, you will be able to tackle mini-missions and access the typical extras of Japanese products such as a collection of black and white drawings and the possibility of listening to all the music tracks. Another marginal defect is the lack of some animations present in the theater version and, more generally, in the senrendering of a barer scene perhaps due to a reduced color palette. Last but not least.. However, after all this talk, let's get to the point: is it worth buying? The answer is naturally yes, so if you feel like a new Rambo, if you love excited and amusing situations, if you are incurably nostalgic or, more simply, you love video games and are looking for a fun title to spend some time with a friend , the only thing to do is run and buy it. It is not an absolute masterpiece, but perhaps one of the few titles worthy of attention left in circulation for the console most loved by Italians. pros: immediate two player mode playability cons: not excellent longevity, some continuous animations are missing From the hall to the house Some time ago an original shooter faithful conversion of the cabinet that was very popular in the arcade was released in the land of the rising sun! The game in question was ~Metal Slug~ which, despite its success at home, never arrived in our area, forcing us poor Europeans to turn to the parallel import market. Now, perhaps out of pity for Western users, the SNK bosses have decided to distribute the sequel ~Metal Slug X~ (but if I'm not mistaken this is the third chapter of the series) also outside Japan, saving us lengthy research... and some money too!", "date": "2001-03-08", "grade": null}
