{"name": "Thief 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thief-2.html", "text": "For those unfamiliar with Thief, it was simply the first very successful attempt to do something different with a typical Fist Person Shooter engine. In fact in the Thiefs, instead of going around shooting (at least mainly), the player's task will be that (as can be understood from the rest of the title) to enter unnoticed in the various houses and steal various objects from this. To provide an experience suited to the player's expectations, the Thief engine was built for the occasion. In fact, one of its main features is to focus attention on two features mainly not exploited by the majority of engines, namely lighting and sound propagation. The main objective of a thief is precisely to go unnoticed, and logically for the professionals in the trade (at least of the time) it is necessary to avoid going where there is a lot of light. In fact, the game's ~HUD~ shows a sort of ~gradient~ of light that lets you understand ~how much~ you are illuminated. Depending on the amount of illumination, the guards may or may not see you. The other factor, that of sound, is equally important, in fact in addition to going unnoticed, you will also have to ensure that the guards cannot hear you. This factor is influenced by a number of characteristics, namely the speed at which you walk and the type of material you walk on. Basically if you run in a perfectly lit room with a marble floor, your career probably won't last long. To help you in your craft you will have a series of tools such as lock picks, arrows with a tip full of water, useful for extinguishing torches, arrows with a string attached, etc. etc. Technically, the game uses the exact same engine used in Thief 1 (and repurposed for System Shock 2). Nothing has changed regarding the graphics.. if Thief 2 weren't written on the box, even more so the game could look like a gigantic mission pack for Thief 1. However... ~something has changed~, and in fact due to the he technological advancement that elapses between the two episodes, in Thief 2 you will also have to deal with gadgets similar to cameras, which will certainly remind most of System Shock, as the functioning of the same is identical to that of SS. Where we find the real changes, is in the style of the missions. In Thief 1 we had a series of missions set mostly in luxurious villas or other similar places, and another kind of mission set in catacombs, abandoned cities and other more ~mysterious~ places. Many fans of the first episode complained about this last kind of missions, as there were too many enemies, too many ~monsters~ that could not be eliminated by the same means as humans and for which this turned Thief into a sort of botched FPS , according to many. So in Thief 2 this kind of missions will be decidedly absent and everything will be set for the most part in more ~urban~ places, or rather more ~rational~. But in addition to this change, the structure of the missions has also undergone an improvement. In fact, it will no longer be a matter of ~simply~ breaking into the various homes and stealing this or that object, but the way in which this will be done acquires remarkable spectacularity, passing from the ~batman-like entrances~ (complete with an arrow-rope launched on a balcony) to the most hasty escapes. The style of play is therefore decidedly different from most of the FPS, in Thief 2, of course you can not think of killing everyone you meet but act mostly out of cunning (at least if you are serious people and play at an adequate level of difficulty in which it will be mandatory not to kill people. In fact in Thief, the difficulty levels do not affect so much the difficulty of the enemies, but the number of objectives to be achieved to complete the mission. At a low difficulty level you will usually have to achieve a main objective and escape. At the highest you will have a number of additional secondary objectives, in addition to the aforementioned not to kill anyone). In fact most of the time if you get surprised by some guards you will have little chance of getting away. But how can a thief succeed in his mission? Well you will mainly have to study the path of the various guards present in the building and if necessary proceed to stun them, approaching them without making a noise (or being seen by some other guard) and then proceed to hide the body in some well-sheltered area. In short, the game consists in wandering around the area without being seen, making too much noise (such as to attract the attention of the guards), this as regards the missions in whichyou will have to steal some objects, but there are also others in which the objectives are very varied. In short, don't worry, you won't have to repeat the same thing until the end of the game, in missions that only have the environment different. The environments in which you will move are not made excellently from the point of view of graphic quality, but from the point of view of ~content~ they are (still) valid, although the engine of Thief 1 is old now. In fact, this kind of setting, such as medieval villas and other houses, are certainly not represented very often with a certain quality, above all if we consider the fact that the latest role-playing game (the games that are certainly more likely to represent these environments) in first person who allowed to enter the houses was Daggerfall. Thief 2 is therefore a game that will be very nice for those who played the first episode and for those who like this kind of action, which for some can be highly spectacular (in short, I personally find wandering around unnoticed very beautiful and engaging) for those who looking for more action everything can become extremely boring or even frustrating, because a small mistake can make your mission fail, especially at high difficulty levels, where you will be unable to kill someone, and if you are caught, unable to kill him, you will have to often reload the last saved location. The frustration itself mostly comes from having to wait for a period of time which is quite long even on ~midrange~ computers (ie my P2 400 with 128 MB RAM). In short, if you have to reload, forget the fraction of a second used by Half-Life, but get ready for times that are around the minute or so. For the rest, it's a great game, perhaps a little easier than the previous one, and perhaps the plot is also a little less engaging, as the ~irrational~ element has been removed. So Thief 2 is what is defined as ~more of the same~, as it was the first to have been the real revolution (...unheard, given that Thief is the only title of this type), Thief 2 has traced the same steps by not offering anything that is overly new or innovative. And it will be for Thief 3 that real and drastic changes are expected. The new chapter of Garret's adventures sees him move into a new era: the Metal Age, the era of metal. In fact, once the threat of the Hammerites was foiled, Garrett returned to his job, that of ~the best thief the world has never seen~. But soon he will find himself involved in the intrigues of a new ~sect~ originating (and judged as a ~heretical~ movement by them) from the Hammerites, namely the Mechanists, a sect that sees in machines and everything connected to them a manifestation of the ~Builder~, the deity or supposed one that was prophesied by the Hammerites. This choice responds to the ~rationalistic~ needs that arose during the first episode.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
