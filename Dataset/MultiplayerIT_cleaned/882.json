{"name": "Kirby: L'oscuro disegno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kirby-canvas-course.html", "text": "Pink suits you In fact, Kirby Canvas Course shares the basic concept with Yoshi Touch & Go, i.e. proposing a platform game to be played not using the keys and the directional cross, but rather using the stylus supplied with the new Nintendo laptop. For the occasion, the obese pink protagonist has lost the use of his legs due to a curse, thus taking the shape of a perfect and rolling sphere. The game mechanics are beautifully integrated with the possibilities offered by the DS, thus offering a convincing all-round experience that, above all, would not be possible to replicate with a traditional control system. Let's start from an assumption: Kirby always rolls, whether he likes it or not. What the programmers have allowed us to do is change the direction of this rolling, thanks to a series of more or less complex stylus maneuvers. By clicking on Kirby it is in fact possible to make him jerk forward, perhaps after having stunned an enemy again by quickly pressing the stylus on one of them; or by drawing a vertical wall you can force our hero to reverse direction. But the main component of the gameplay offered by the Nintendo production lies in the possibility of drawing lines, of the shape and length that you prefer, destined to have the function of a real path that the pink ball will follow diligently. Obviously this solution has repercussions within the game in a multitude of different situations; in fact, creating the route does not only serve to allow the reaching of otherwise out of reach platforms or unreachable areas, but also and above all to avoid contact with the aforementioned enemies or with elements of the level threatening to Kirby's health. Example: a series of dangerous stalactites appear in front of the path? A stroke of the nib under them will block their fall, thus allowing a passage in complete tranquility. Obviously it is only an expression of the multiple situations destined to confront the player, and it is precisely the variety of these that is one of the strengths of Kirby Canvas Course. Perpetual motion Obviously the programmers have not forgotten the aspects that have always characterized the character of Kirby, first of all the possibility of acquiring, once defeated, the special abilities of some enemies. Shooting electric beams, inflating like a balloon or running in the form of a tire are just some of the transformations available, which allow you not only to gain greater offensive power but also to obtain particular skills to reach certain portions of the levels. However, the exploration of the latter is not an end in itself, but is part of the possibility of searching for and therefore obtaining special tokens - 3 for each stage - scattered in strategic points often far from within reach. These tokens will then be expendable to purchase extras that start from simple pieces of music to then get to real extra modes and abilities that actually affect the gameplay. An intriguing incentive to replayability therefore, which confirms the intelligence and care with which this Kirby Canvas Course was packaged. The same goes for the battles with the bosses, which go beyond the mechanics of the game in the strict sense, instead taking the form of authentic absolutely hilarious mini-games. As for the technical aspect, the Nintendo title is a real show in 2 dimensions. The upper screen shows the few necessary indicators and the level map, really useful for exploring every available corner without frustration. The lower screen is instead the center of the real game, and it is also the one that will attract the player's attention for most of the time. The variety of settings is excellent, but what amazes is the style of the stroke and the use of colors, truly splendid. The world is obviously Kirby's usual one, sugary and lively, but the attention to detail and the general inspiration with which the various levels were created places Canvas Course at the top of the category. The sound is also very good, always spot on and of excellent quality. Comment Kirby Canvas Course is simply among the best games currently available for the Nintendo Ds. The effort of the Japanese team Hal Laboratories has not only managed to take full advantage of the console's features, but has also done so by packaging a truly fun and innovative product. The variety of the situations proposed and the depth of the gameplay amaze moment after moment, all accompanied by a very close-up 2D graphic that certainly does not make you regret the third dimension. Ultimatelya, Kirby Canvas Course is a real little manual on how to make a game on the 2-screen Nintendo laptop, as well as a purchase that no big N lover should pass up. Pros: Perfect game mechanics Beautiful graphics Exemplary use of DS features Cons: No multiplayer mode Not particularly long-lived From the moment of its introduction, the peculiar capabilities and unique characteristics of the Nintendo DS have stimulated the curiosity of both programmers and users not only regarding the new gaming genres it could introduce, but also in the different approach that dual screen and touch would have resulted in classical strands. And speaking of classics, the 2D platformers cannot fail to come to mind, historically the true flagship of the production of the great N. To tell the truth, however, the first encounter between the platforms and the stylus was not so good to leave its mark, with that Yoshi Touch & Go that tasted more like a tech demo than a real game. Luckily DS owners didn't have to wait long to get their hands on a worthy representative of the genre...", "date": "2005-07-12", "grade": null}
