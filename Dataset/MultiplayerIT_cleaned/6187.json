In Italy he is probably less known than in other countries, where the likeable little monster in fact enjoys a certain fame, to the point of having also seen various videogame transpositions. The first of which dates back to 1991, the year in which Hugo arrived on the Commodore 64: over time, the troll then became the protagonist of a real series of games, which also landed on the Amiga, PC and PlayStation. In more recent times, the software house Hugo Games has tried to bring the character back into vogue in the mobile world, exploring different genres up to Ronaldo & Hugo: Superstar Skaters, which we are dealing with today. It is an endless runner in which together with the good Hugo we find none other than Cristiano Ronaldo, star of the world of football who for the occasion has crossed over from the various FIFA and PES with a very different task from hitting a ball. What is the world's most unlikely couple doing in a mobile video game, but more importantly, is this free title worth downloading and playing? Let's find out together. Cristiano Ronaldo leaves the ball alone to go racing on a skateboard! Paparazzi in Tokyo Ronaldo & Hugo: Superstar Skaters takes us to the capital of Japan, where our CR7 is busy escaping from the paparazzi on duty, intent on taking a picture of him at all costs. It is naturally the pretext to start the endless run that we have to carry out in the game, where the Real Madrid striker also has a skateboard at his disposal: not a simple aesthetic gimmick, given that, as we will see, the board used becomes an integral part of the mechanics . Cristiano Ronaldo can count on Hugo's hand for his escape, which in practical terms translates into the ability to use one of the two characters to play: to the delight of all those who love to collect objects as much as they can, the couple allows to obtain different elements depending on the character used, thus lengthening the time necessary to collect everything. In terms of raw gameplay, Ronaldo & Hugo: Superstar Skaters makes us run through three different lanes, between which it is possible to scroll with a horizontal swipe on the screen; you can also jump or slide to avoid the obstacles that arrive in front of us, represented by long limousines, forklifts and other vehicles that are found around Tokyo. Along the way, coins are collected to be used to buy items of clothing, or different types of skateboards to obtain particular effects or bonuses, depending on the price paid: there is, for example, the magnet-board, with which to attract even the coins placed in lanes other than ours, or the one that doubles the number of coins collected. The skateboard is a non-permanent consumable, to be activated with a double tap on the screen to use it on the route for a pre-set time. For this reason, if you aim to obtain particularly high scores, you will need to buy different boards to use during the game. Like many similar titles, Ronaldo & Hugo: Superstar Skaters also offers a system of micro-transactions, where you can buy packs of coins or gems to invest in the various ways offered by the game, including the possibility of continuing the game in case of defeat . There is no shortage of additional elements, to be collected during the game to obtain special rewards or abilities, including that of accessing a super-air mode in which to collect coins by flying. Run Christian, run From a graphic point of view, the game by Hugo Games is presented in a quite pleasant way, putting the player in front of a Tokyo full of colors where day and night alternate. The various areas of the city that are visited range from the streets to the soccer field, inevitable given the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo (who appears rejuvenated by at least ten years), offering a good variety of situations also thanks to the use of the skateboard, capable of change the dynamics of the game a bit. By activating the latter, the player can in fact make some evolutions, for example slipping on the railings placed by the developers to break the monotony of the race and get some bonuses. There is also the social component, thanks to which you can challenge your friends via Facebook by sharing your result with them, thus giving life to a series of comparisons to the last score. All the texts are translated into Italian, while as far as the audio is concerned, the main tune is quite pleasant and soon enters the head, but after the first few games you will still tend to put on your own soundtrack.", "date": "2015-07-18", "grade": "6.0"}
