{"name": "Le mie miniere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130188-platformines-le-mie-miniere.html", "text": "There are games like La Mulana, Spelunky and Rogue Legacy that enjoy granite internal consistency. They have clear and armored rules right from the start, excellent controls and content that (almost) never ceases to amaze. They also offer a progressive level of difficulty that the more difficult it gets, the more rewarding it offers. The result is that you don't stop playing it even for many months, maybe years. Platformines, Magiko Gaming's debut game, follows the same principle, even if it doesn't reach the levels of excellence of the titles mentioned. Understanding what it is about is simple, you can find it written without many frills on the Steam page and the game itself tells you before starting. In the bowels of the world of Platformines you have to jump from one platform to another, shoot everything that moves, collect as much loot as possible to buy upgrades and find the hidden parts of our spaceship. This last point adds that touch of ingenuity that distinguishes Platformines from a generic shooting and platforming game. In fact, our miner, male or female (you decide), is trapped underground. In order to get out to the surface and leave the dark mines, he needs to repair his spaceship. In game terms it means that we will have to solve a puzzle. In this regard, the details matter little; suffice it to say that once you have found all the block-shooters of different colors you will have to assemble the spaceship as you do with Lego bricks. A fairly simple feat compared to the hellish effort it takes to get all the necessary pieces. In fact, Platformines is not a docile game, and indeed it knows how to be sneaky bastard, but thanks to a few simple tricks it becomes accessible to a wider audience than just the hard core of the video game, for whom there are extra modes and the ranking online with which to try to stand out from the masses. Well, now that you know how to play, we just have to choose the initial features of our funny miner and pull the trigger as soon as possible. In Platformines, on the other hand, if you shoot you're not wrong. Platformines is the cousin of Spelunky and La-Mulana with the cigar in his mouth! Fogs of War The world of Platformines is randomly generated but, once created, it always follows the same rules. First of all, the mines are pervaded by a fog that only dissipates as we explore them. The range of our vision, which works like a kind of magic eraser that erases fog, increases in proportion to the amount of energy we have. Therefore, the more we suffer damage, the less we see around us. So imagine how relaxing blind jumping can be. And in fact very often we find ourselves banging our nose against a wall which forces us to go back. Or it may happen that we see a treasure that seems close at hand and which instead, when we go to investigate, turns out to be inaccessible due to the path we have followed. In these cases, fortunately, the map comes to our aid, essential for deciding how to move. As you may have guessed it is not uncommon to find yourself in trouble at any moment. So that challenging mechanics like the fog one don't become a cause of frustration, the developers have come up with simple but effective solutions. Like the fact that our miner can perform up to five jumps in a row - even more with the right equipment. The real lifeline, however, are the teleporters. Through these portals scattered throughout the mines we return in the blink of an eye to our home base, where we can access the shop and the spaceship, save the progress made and, above all, recharge our energy in seconds. However, it happens that the teleporters are in mid-air or besieged by a swarm of enemies, so that the final leap before losing the last drop of energy becomes a kind of leap of faith: either you live or you die. Another help comes from the indicator that shows us how many meters away the next block shooter is and in which direction. These tricks open up Platformines to a wider audience of players than a La-Mulana, for example, but don't think that finishing the game is a walk in the park. The color of the fog changes from one area to another, signaling the transition to a higher level of difficulty, and the changes are noticeable. Furthermore, the mines, as well as being intricate, are full of traps and enemies; some passages are really treacherous, especially if there is treasure nearby. As always, it is those cursed caskets that lead us astray and cause us to die, even if fortunately the deaths are not permanent. Indeed, we have a clone generator. However, the price to pay in the event of death is different, because one losesnot all items collected up to that point and a percentage of the accumulated money. It can be deduced that to cross the most challenging areas it is necessary to equip yourself properly, and to do this we need to explore the areas within our reach several times and kill as many monsters as possible to pocket hard cash, perhaps by opening some chests along the way. Platformines is like this: you jump, explore and try to loot as much as possible before you run away. To do so, hundreds of magazines need to be emptied. What else is there to say? Something else, otherwise it would be perfect. Intense but never epic Platformines has an old-fashioned look, admittedly inspired by the era of 16-bit machine video games. The reproduction has an authentic feel, but it lacks the distinctive artistic touch, those original and unique choices that infuse a game's appearance with personality. Characters and monsters are uninteresting to look at, and the same goes for traps or environments. Not even the soundtracks excite. These are classical music pieces that sound as if they were played by an Amiga, which unfortunately do not pump any adrenaline in our veins of runaway miners. Furthermore, after five or six hours of play, if you have not yet completed the normal mode, the repetitiveness makes itself felt. The rigid rules of Platformines never evolve and nothing is added to the basic scheme by introducing the novelties necessary to stimulate the player once he has thoroughly mastered the basic mechanics. There are lots of items to find and buy, yes, and the most avid players will return to the game several times for the extra modes, but we imagine that the majority will abandon it before the end, after a few hours that we still consider well spent. Or, even if they reach the end, they will probably feel, like us, that more could be done. Excellence is not far from where Platformines is, but achieving it is always very difficult. With such a good first try however, Magiko Gaming has every chance to make up for it in the future. Needless to say, we are waiting for them at the gate.", "date": "2014-04-04", "grade": "7.6"}
