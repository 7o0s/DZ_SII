{"name": "Hungry Dragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hungry-dragon-recensione.html", "text": "The mobile panorama is full of examples of titles capable of inaugurating new sub-genres which in turn lead to the birth of innumerable products all a bit similar to each other eager to climb - more or less worthily - on the bandwagon: it is the case of Temple Run, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and many others, and these names can certainly be added to that of Hungry Shark, a Ubisoft title that has generated not only several sequels but also a large group of imitators. In order not to leave even the crumbs of this success to others, the transalpine producer has well thought of cloning himself, replacing the sharks and the underwater setting of Hungry Shark with hungry dragons that flutter in a fantasy scenario, leaving all the rest. The result is the Hungry Dragon here, which also suggests its intention to maintain the status quo from the name. The shark and the dragon Anyone who has played one of these ~all you can eat~ videogames even for five minutes will immediately feel at ease with Hungry Dragon: the aim is simply to move around the screen literally eating every living thing that comes within range, avoiding obstacles and pitfalls to survive as long as possible. The control system follows in all respects that of the previous Ubisoft products of this vein: a virtual stick allows you to move the winged protagonist, while a key on the opposite side of the touchscreen allows you to increase the speed by sacrificing the energy represented by a special gauge that fills up over time or by assuming certain bonuses. To devour one's prey, it is sufficient to go at him, bearing in mind, however, that only creatures smaller in size than the dragon we are commanding can be swallowed. An element that, as for Hungry Shark and singing company, represents the central pivot of the playful experience, not only because it instills a minimum nuance of depth to the gameplay, but also because it determines the main sense of progression of the title. In fact, the coins earned by playing are used to unlock new and larger specimens of dragons, capable of eating bigger bites and with which to start the round again aiming for the next upgrade. In this sense, one of the (few) introductions of Hungry Dragon consists precisely in having provided the user with intermediate steps in the path that separates one dragon from another: by collecting coins or completing certain objectives it is therefore possible to obtain alternative costumes that modify specific attributes or small creatures that flutter to your side providing bonuses in attack or defense. It's not much, but it's still something that acts as a further stimulus to keep the player glued to the screen, and which adds up to a gameplay that - despite having completely exhausted its originality - still remains pleasant and captivating. Thanks also to a scenario that in Hungry Dragon proves to be more dynamic and multifaceted than usual: having abandoned the subdivision into distinct settings typical of the Hungry Shark series, here you can move freely in a single large open world complete with secret areas, areas which can only be accessed after upgrading and collectibles to collect, all in favor of a decidedly more marked exploratory component than in the past. But dragons couldn't be defined as such without the proverbial ability to breathe fire, and Ubisoft has fulfilled this task with an indicator at the bottom of the screen that fills up as meals are consumed and which once filled allows you to enter for a few second in a sort of berserk mode, with the protagonist who repeatedly releases flames that incinerate the unfortunates, also multiplying the prize in coins. Finally, thanks to a respectable technical sector (even if the sound is at a minimum wage), it is really difficult to feel bad about Hungry Dragon, which manages to entertain without too many pretensions thanks also to a monetization model elastic enough to allow those who wish to to continue even without spending a Euro.", "date": "2018-09-06", "grade": "7.5"}
