In this review you will necessarily find some advances on the plot of Final Fantasy XV: read at your own risk! The true identity of Prompto Argentum (we could easily consider him Noctis's best friend, given that Ignis and Gladiolus cover more the figure of mentors) has always been the secret of Pulcinella of Final Fantasy XV, also due to a somewhat clumsy promotional material which identified him as the biological son of Verstael Berithia already in the official strategy guide of the game. If you have already completed the fifteenth Final Fantasy, perhaps that name will not tell you anything anyway, since the character in question appears briefly in the main campaign: he is an important scientist in the pay of the emperor Aldercapt, the same one who created the Magitek soldiers and the other nightmarish technologies of Niflheim. Episode Prompto, the new Final Fantasy XV DLC, explores the link between the blond traveling companion of the prince of Lucis and this mysterious and disturbing figure behind the scenes, taking advantage of a twist in the closing lines of the campaign that isolated Prompto until the end of the infamous chapter 13. Do you want to know if this time we have in our hands a more significant DLC than that Gladio Episode that had left us with a bad taste in our mouth a few months ago? Read on. You quoque, Prompto? Episode Prompto takes place between Prompto's fall from the train to Niflheim and his rescue at the end of chapter 13. In fact, we discover that Prompto was not simply captured by Imperial soldiers and that he had a great little adventure in the region enemy in the company of an unlikely ally: Aranea Highwind, the mercenary dragoon we had met in some chapters of the campaign. On a narrative level, Episode Prompto tells a much more interesting story than Episode Gladiolus and succeeds in the difficult attempt to deepen not only the protagonist, but also the figure of Verstael and some important details concerning Noctis' enemies, starting with the complicated Ardyn Izunia. The DLC, in this sense, is not afraid to finally lean on the multimedia universe of Final Fantasy XV, citing the feature film Kingsglaive and the episode of the animated series Brotherhood which shone the spotlight on the little overweight Prompto who did everything to become friends with Noctis. Anyone who hasn't watched that episode might be a little perplexed, but those who instead had taken the trouble to delve into Final Fantasy XV through the other productions will be pleasantly surprised, also because the short DLC campaign is told through numerous cinematics, audiologs and collectibles which help to give it a tone more from Resident Evil than from Final Fantasy. The feeling is sharpened as soon as you hold the joypad and understand how to play as Prompto. While the combat system of Gladiolus in its DLC was reminiscent of a slightly modified version of that of Noctis, here Square Enix has invented a third person shooter gameplay in which very little melee attacks are used to focus on everything on firearms. Prompto is always armed with a common pistol with unlimited ammunition, but he can wield three other types of weapons, perhaps after having snatched them directly from the hands of the imperial soldiers. Each of these weapons is used in a different way and the gunplay, while not exactly exceptional, soon proves to be fast-paced and fun enough, thanks also to Prompto's secondary abilities which include final blows, three special attacks and the spectacular ~super move~ by Aranea. However, it is not the action itself that amazes, but the broad scope of a DLC that strongly detaches itself from that corridor that was Episode Gladiolus: at a certain point, in fact, we will be free to explore the length and breadth of the snow region riding a snowmobile. In these circumstances we will be able to simply follow the indicator of the main campaign or face a series of secondary missions that will allow us to upgrade the vehicle, even if in reality they serve more than anything else to unlock achievements and trophies. Once the main mission is completed - a couple of hours ignoring the secondary objectives, at least a couple more if you want to perfect the save - it is still possible to access a series of secondary challenges from the main menu, such as the time battles with the already defeated bosses and a rather difficult extra fight. Needless to say, this time around, the content definitely lives up to the price.", "date": "2017-06-30", "grade": "8.0"}
