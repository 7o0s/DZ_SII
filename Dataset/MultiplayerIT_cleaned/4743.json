Strengthened by an undisputed success in radical-chic living rooms, the guys from Fullbright, a tiny software house based in Portland, have decided to give an encore with a ~spatial~ version of their narrative experience. In Tacoma (nothing to do with the Toyota pick-up) we wear the overalls of Amy Ferreira, a Californian researcher sent to the lunar station, hence the name of the game. An accident occurred three days before his arrival and there are no traces of the six-person crew: Administrator EV St. James, Special Operations Manager Clive, Mechanical Engineer Bert, Programmer Nat , the physician Sareh and the botanist Andrew. Entering the structure and having made the acquaintance of ODIN, the virtual assistant who will teach us how augmented reality works, we will have to explore the three rings that make up the base: biomedical center, engineering center and staff quarters. A little tension rises in the first minutes because we expect to find some form of hidden life that makes us do the classic jump on the chair, but we soon realize that it will be a solo experience. The Theater of Heroes The only figures to interact with are the holograms of the missing astronauts, whose last memories have been preserved by the station's artificial intelligence. Approaching these ethereal shapes, a sort of theatrical curtain is triggered in which everyone plays their part, but, to get an overview of what is happening, it is necessary to repeat the animated sequences several times, moving behind the actors. An example helps to illustrate this better: the first memory is started in the control room of EV St. James. Standing next to her, you can hear the notes she dictates to ODIN and some reflections made aloud. At one point she is called by her colleagues to the room where a party is taking place: we follow her and watch the toast. Of course, having focused our attention on her, we missed the dialogues of the remaining five crew members: we must therefore rewind the tape and position ourselves near the other actors to better understand what is happening. Amy Ferreira, assigned to investigate what happened on Tacoma We thus discover that a meteorite hits Tacoma during the obsolescence festival and that in a very short time the oxygen supplies are drastically reduced. The six, aware that help from Earth would not arrive in time, devise a desperate plan. Impossible to continue the story of the plot without the risk of ruining the experience for those who want to try it, especially in relation to the very short duration of the game. However, we can say that in this race against time the emotional tension grows as you get closer to the last module, even if the convenience of wrapping the memory tape allows you to get to know the astronauts more deeply, perhaps rummaging through their personal objects or snooping through emails, at least the ones ODIN managed to keep from deletion. Wandering around the lunar station, one comes across numerous objects, mostly useless, which however tell stories of real life, just as happened in Gone Home. In two or three circumstances you will have to collect some hidden key that provides access to documents that may be important, but you can ignore even these basic puzzles if you wish. Isn't four years for three hours too many? The Fullbrights are confirmed to be very good at shaping protagonists with well-defined personalities, not forgetting highly topical issues such as homosexual relationships or the ruthlessness of capitalism. However, the impression is that the narrative canvas from which they started to concoct Tacoma is too compressed and that it would have been necessary at least twice as much work to adequately explore the characters who in practice reflect the sit-com stereotypes a little too much new Yorker. More or less explicit love stories intertwine in the small melting pot that has formed within the spatial structure, such as the one between St. James and Siddiqi, who however are the least successful figures, given that they leave the scene almost immediately. The real superstar is little Nat, an expert in communications, who doesn't hide her rebellious nature and lives with the carelessness of the younger ones what would seem to be the last moments of her life. The companion Bert instead acts as a supporting actor and did not seem excessively convincing, unlike Andrew, the botanist involved in a desperate attempt to sbreeding of the team and which manifests with an excellent stage presence the doubts of those who are aware of going towards death. Finally, Sareh is the classic Grey's Anatomy doctor, internally torn between her own fragility and the responsibilities of a role that requires her to trust others. The toast is ruined by a disastrous explosion: it is the beginning of the end The graphics, although functional to the narrative purpose that the programmers had set for themselves, are nothing special. The Unity engine proves its inadequacy in the first person view and the designers haven't done much to mask its limitations. Of course there are some good textures here and there, but in 2017 it is legitimate to raise the bar, especially considering that the ~levels~ are not many and that the play offer is reduced to a minimum; at least the hardware requirements are within everyone's reach. The audio sector is of another level: the dubbings are excellent and stand alone at least half of the project of the Oregon developer. The study of the musical tracks that occasionally peep out among the memories of the astronauts is also very refined. The adventure is offered for 19.99 euros and is available for Windows and Xbox One; the absence of Italian dubbing could be a problem for those who are not too familiar with the English language.", "date": "2017-08-04", "grade": "7.0"}
