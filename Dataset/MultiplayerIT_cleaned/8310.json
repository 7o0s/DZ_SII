Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Many development teams have tried, so far, to create a good action RPG for mobile devices in the Diablo style, i.e. characterized by a three-quarter top view and spectacular combat in real time. Adopting the now consolidated freemium model, GLU has tried to pursue the same goal with Eternity Warriors II, a title that you can download and play for free although the action becomes very difficult very quickly, trying to entice us to put our hands on our wallets to buy a pack of gems or more powerful weapons. But let's proceed in order. There is no real plot behind this product, just a warrior who, no one knows why, is determined to go through the forty dungeons that make up the single player campaign, divided into four scenarios that are unlocked as as we level up and complete missions. The initial impact is really excellent, in particular due to the excellent technical sector, which makes a fine show of more than discreet light effects and, above all, of great fluidity, evidently thanks to a well-optimized engine, which suffers only slightly during the most tense situations. The enemies are also well done and well animated, while the locations boast a good level of detail but perhaps should have been made more varied even within the same ~area~. I break everything In each stage our task is very simple: kill anything that moves. From zombies to golems, from giant spiders to knights moved by black magic, we will find ourselves facing a truly enormous number of opponents, each characterized by an attack pattern unique, which we will have to memorize in order to be able to better defend ourselves. It is possible to move the character using the virtual analog stick at the bottom left of the touch screen, while on the right side we find three buttons and possibly two icons. The biggest button is the one that allows us to attack, while the other two are used to perform a special move (which consumes the rage bar) and to parry blows with the shield. This last maneuver soon becomes fundamental, because performed at the right time allows us to carry out a devastating counterattack, sometimes the only useful maneuver against the toughest bosses. It is a pity that the size of the button is too small, which often results in a failure to receive the input and therefore, in extreme cases, in a decidedly avoidable game over. The two icons, on the other hand, activate the potions for restoring health and the aforementioned rage bar. Scattered within the scenarios we will be able to find objects that enrich our equipment: new weapons, more resistant armor parts and so on, which we can manage in a very intuitive way using the appropriate screen, together with the upgrading of both weapons and special skills. The first games with Eternal Warriors II go by like a pleasure and we almost don't notice the time passing, but at a certain point the balance of the difficulty makes a sharp turn and the enemies begin to not particularly accuse our blows, even if maybe we're returning from a nice general boost. It is a choice that certainly aims, as mentioned at the beginning, to promote the use of in-app purchases for the acquisition of virtual currency and/or new objects, but if you want to look at it in a positive way, it is an expedient capable of give us an undoubtedly hardcore experience. Do we want to play for free with such a well done title? Ok, but then we have to commit ourselves. A speech that fits everything, in our opinion.", "date": "2012-09-22", "grade": "8.0"}
