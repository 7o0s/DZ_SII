For manufacturing companies, these are often low-cost commercial operations that focus heavily on the nostalgia factor to obtain good sales, while for enthusiasts they can prove to be the right occasion to be able to relive certain emotions, or to try them for the first time if they have not could have played a title at the time of its original release. What has just been described can easily also apply to Resident Evil: Origins Collection, a collection that contains within the same disc two of the most successful episodes of the historic Capcom series, namely Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, in a remastered edition in High Definition. Here because. Resident Evil Origins Collection brings back two classics of the survival horror genre in high definition Nightmare at high speed Even if released later, let's start our review from the prequel, since most of the facts narrated in the game happen chronologically before those of Resident Evil. Following the disappearance of a group of campers and the succession of strange accidents in the mountains near the town of Raccoon City, on July 24, 1998 the Police Department sends the BRAVO team of the special S.T.A.R.S. department to investigate. However, due to an engine failure of the helicopter they are traveling on, the agents are forced to make an emergency landing in the woods. There, after casually discovering the bodies of two security agents apparently killed by the prisoner they were escorting, a certain Billy Coen, who escaped soon after, they decide to split up to find him and arrest him again. But what seems like an ordinary manhunt soon turns into a terrifying struggle for survival. Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster presents a slightly more action game structure than the ~sequel~, of which it still maintains the main characteristics. Basically the style is quite similar, and as always it is necessary to explore areas, solve puzzles, collide with zombies and assorted creatures. But the presence of atypical monsters (giant insects, apes, etc) and with particular characteristics often forces the player to take a more decisive approach in certain areas, and to bring out all the paraphernalia to try to advance to the next door. Fortunately, the characters are controlled well, thanks also to the new system that allows you to move in a much more agile way having the user's view as a reference, it being understood that you can opt for the old-fashioned ones. Another aspect that differentiates this game from the other first episodes of the saga is then the possibility of using the two protagonists, Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen, at the same time, making them act as a team, switching from one to the other when needed with the simple push of a button. This element adds a slight strategic component to the gameplay, given that the different abilities of the characters, also linked to their physical size, allow the gamer to sketch out some strategies, especially in solving some environmental puzzles, using for example Billy to move crates or some large blocks that block the passage, while perhaps the agile Rebecca covers his back. Also noteworthy is the disappearance of the trunks: in the game it is possible to carry a higher number of objects than in the past and abandon those that are not needed on the street to make room for the new ones. If necessary, you can always go back to pick them up. As for the technical aspect, Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster offers both the traditional 4:3 format and the new 16:9 widescreen, with a resolution of 1080p. However, compared to the edition for personal computers, this console has a frame rate anchored at 30 frames per second, slightly lower anti-aliasing, shadows and some elements of the scenario less defined. For the rest, excluding the upscaled 2002 computer graphics movies and the still a bit stiff character animations, we are faced with an excellent graphics sector, with well-finished scenarios enhanced by the use of detailed textures, and by the skilful use of light sources. In short, the game does not leave you speechless for the amount of polygons or effects, but it still has some interesting aspects especially in the care taken by the Capcom graphics to ensure that the settings and shots really arouse fear, thanks also to the good sound accompaniment in dolby surround 5.1. Side note for the extra content that consistin a series of costumes linked to pre-orders and in two modes that are unlocked once the campaign is completed, namely the old Leech Hunter, also present in the original edition of Resident Evil 0, and the unpublished Wesker Mode. In this mode the player can control the infected Albert Wesker with all his special powers, instead of Billy and alongside the usual Rebecca. That villa in the woods A few hours after the disappearance of the BRAVO team, Police Chief Irons decides to send the second team of STARS, the ALPHA, on their trail. But even this, attacked by what appear to be a pack of angry dogs, ends up cutting off communications with the base. Four of the members of the team flee and manage to find shelter inside an old stately villa, where, however, they find themselves facing a real nightmare with open eyes. The mansion, in fact, belongs to the Umbrella Corporation and hides in its bowels secret laboratories where lethal pathogens and biological weapons known as BOWs are tested, which escaped the control of scientists ended up infecting all the occupants of the area, transforming them into extremely aggressive mutated creatures. Thus begins a desperate struggle for survival for the agents, in the last attempt to escape from the building and put an end to the horrors that lurk inside. This is in a nutshell the plot of Resident Evil HD Remaster, progenitor of the saga which in this remastered edition had already been released last January but in a digital version. In the game, the user can wear either the role of Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, in two converging but separate adventures, playable one after finishing the other: choosing to play one agent rather than the other changes the approach to the game, given that with them the type of automatic defense weapons, the arrangement of certain objects in the villa, some things to do and the characters you meet vary. The gameplay and the game structure remain unchanged for both characters, with many environments to explore in search of clues and objects useful for survival, traps to avoid, puzzles to solve and monsters to eliminate or avoid when possible. In this sense, the bestiary offers everything from the traditional slow but lethal zombies if encountered in confined spaces or in large numbers, to the terrible hunters, creatures similar to enormous humanoid reptiles able to clean off the heads of their enemies, up to animals mutated and creatures called the Crimson Head, a more aggressive and faster variation of the ~normal~ undead. As well as for Resident Evil 0, then, here too we have the classic fixed cameras and cinematic shots that change constantly even within the same environment, which among other things help to increase the tension. The fact of sometimes not knowing what awaits him around the corner, pushes the user to stay alert, and often forces him to stop for a moment in silence, to listen to a moan, a musical note or other sounds that can betray the presence of an enemy not yet framed by the camera. Inevitable, then, the doors that open only after a short film, the ~magic~ trunks where to keep the objects that are not needed at the moment and take up space in the few slots available in the protagonists' inventory, the bullets and ink ribbons to sip to save the game at the right time using the appropriate typewriters. Playstation 4 trophies The collection offers two blocks of trophies, one for each game. Resident Evil offers as many as 45, including secret ones, of which 28 are bronze, 15 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum. Resident Evil 0 instead has 48. In both cases, to obtain them, as always, you must progress in the adventures and satisfy some specific requests, such as destroying the legs of a zombie or finishing or recovering all the weapons. Technically speaking Also in Resident Evil HD Remaster there is an optional dual control schemes, which offer the possibility of playing with the classic ones or with a completely new set that uses the upper backbones of the left and right pad of the PlayStation 4 pad to aim and shoot, or the analog sticks to manage the position of the body and the movements of the protagonists, which occur simultaneously with the position assumed by their bodies on the screen. We had a great time with the new ones, but we don't deny that in some points we opted to use the traditional ones, perhaps more functional for certain moments of the adventure. As far as the technical part is concerned, given the nature of the production, it obviously isn't thereto expect no graphic upheaval such as to suggest a change of those capable of transforming the visual system into something avant-garde. However, it should also be emphasized that the Capcom graphics have also done a decidedly valid job here considering the material, not limiting themselves to some simple aesthetic retouching, but committing themselves to making a whole series of modifications and optimizations that have returned a product of good workmanship, quite different, positively, compared to the GameCube edition. Full HD resolution at 1080p, with the game running at 30 frames per second, restyling of the polygonal models of the characters and more detailed textures for the backdrops and objects, plus various post-processing and light and shadow effects, which despite sometimes return with their clean cuts very dark scenarios, help to render well the atmosphere of scary places from which one would only like to escape. As far as the audio component is concerned, nothing to complain about: both the sound effects and the beautiful original soundtrack are reproduced in all their splendour, digitally remastered with the new dolby surround 5.1 multi-channel audio standard. At this point, if you have had the patience to read the entire article up to here, you will have already understood that in principle we liked this Resident Evil: Origins Collection: technically the versions of the two games it contains are the best that we have could be expected considering the starting material, while from the point of view of the gameplay they are the confirmation of how even today certain typical schemes of the old survival horror, if well elaborated, can fascinate and scare fans of the genre. Especially if the latter are willing to gloss over certain elements which, when compared to those of more modern productions, appear largely outdated.", "date": "2016-01-22", "grade": "8.0"}
