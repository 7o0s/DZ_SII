And it's not that the results of recent years, with the due exceptions of course, are able to deny us. Fortunately then comes a title like The Mummy Demastered to prove that there is always an exception to prove the rule. Do you know the latest remake of The Mummy, recently released at the cinema, with very questionable quality? Here: WayForward, father of Shantae among other things, has managed to bring out a real gem, for the happiness of metroidvania lovers. Sand, mummies and machine guns There are very few points of contact between The Mummy Demastered and the new film of The Mummy, but we do not feel like considering it a defect. WayForward has obtained the license to make a themed video game, but apart from the context, the title goes its own way, that of a very solid metroidvania in a fascinating retro style. The narrative premises are therefore few, the excuse to take up the gun and start putting a few mummies back to sleep. Princess Ahmanet, an ancient pretender to the throne of Egypt, has awakened after a couple of millennia; in the meantime his desire for domination has grown, and now his aim is to conquer the whole world, unleashing sand, devastation and an army of infernal creatures on it. Fortunately, a security team has been set up against this type of supernatural retaliation: Prodigium. We are one agent among many all alike, and somehow we must stop Ahmanet before there is nothing left to save. Action, adventure and exploration make The Mummy Demastered an incredibly successful product within the metroidvania genre, as perhaps not seen since the days of Axiom Verge (and in truth the writer also preferred it to the latter). Moving within rigorously two-dimensional environments, developed according to the case in length or in height, we will massacre enemies continuing along a partially guided narration, but which leaves a lot of freedom of action to the player. The enemies on the screen are many, varied and fierce, each with certain attack patterns, and at the beginning we will not have our full arsenal available. However, the learning curve seemed to us to be studied in an excellent way and will allow both the novice to learn mechanics of a very particular genre, and the veterans to feel at home without everything (at least up to the final levels) seeming too easy. After all, Egypt can be very insidious. Playstation 4 trophies The Mummy Demastered platinum is relatively easy to obtain: a large part of the work consists of completing the story, exploring the entire map and collecting all the weapons, artifacts and collectibles. It must be said that unfortunately the latter are not traceable, so you will not be able to check at any time which ones you have already collected and where. There is also a trophy that requires you to complete the game without dying once. Honest as we are, we would never suggest using cloud or USB stick saves for peace of mind... but know that at the moment it is perfectly doable. A jump into the past There's a reason for that little ~Demastered~ touch of class in the title. The production of the guys from WayForward seems on the one hand to make fun of the invasion of today's market by the many remastered, on the other it recalls a very specific trend, that of the pixelated metroidvania, whose return to the scene is never sorry. Thus, ~demastered~ is basically the graphics themselves, created in a sublime retro style in pixel art, the developer's real workhorse in other productions as well. There is not even a bit of healthy violence as an end in itself a la Metal Slug, made up of small environments in which it is possible to proceed madly by leveling the machine guns, in Run & Gun style. In all other aspects however, The Mummy Demastered rewards foresight, strategy, study of game environments and enemies. We must proceed with caution, especially in the initial stages in which we will be very vulnerable, looking for the classic secret rooms in which to find health enhancers and then for the ammunition capacity. Furthermore, the protagonist can gradually learn new skills by recovering the artifacts of the Egyptian deities, acquiring, among other things, the ability to jump higher, breathe underwater, charge enemies and so on. Although a handful of hours are enough to complete the main story, the developers have adopted some strategies to favor backtracking: above all the presence of 50 well-hidden medalsste in the seven different game areas. But there are also optional weapons that can make your life easier (even too much), each designed for a specific type of enemy. And again: areas that can only be reached after obtaining a certain skill, continuing the adventure. A ~negative~ aspect that we would like to point out is perhaps that of the excessive simplicity of the title in its final stages, when we will now have all the upgrades, all the weapons and all the artifacts available. The final boss itself becomes a piece of cake.", "date": "2017-11-22", "grade": "8.5"}
