{"name": "Devastation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devastation-2.html", "text": "OK, I'M A SUBVERSIVE, BUT WHAT DO I GET? Well, first of all you will become the cool protagonist of the situation! Aside from this tempting role we've been playing since the dawn of video games, what immediately emerges is: let's do it in style! And the feast of the eyes is the first obvious manifestation that this game has the numbers to emerge from the wild pile. The thorny question ~a game isn't fun just because it has nice graphics~ here I would prefer to leave it out, dedicating myself exclusively to my sensations and the aesthetic impact that is offered to us. As the name of the game says: devastating! You will immediately be plunged into a sinister, gray and oppressive setting, always surrounded by violence and degradation. The inviting fresco is powered by the same engine as Unreal2, and this is already a serious business card that is slapped in our faces. By exploiting the technological capabilities of such a monster, the detail is pushed to excellent levels, without sacrificing too much performance, I add, unlike the illustrious father. But above all, the various settings will always be coherent without obvious tacky choices full of all kinds of objects typical of the place where we are. So if we find ourselves in a small port we will be surrounded by barrels, garages and sheds with boats, tavern signs where lobster is served, life jackets and sea bream (the famous holiday rats). But if we find ourselves in the corridors and rooms of a genetic laboratory there will be a sense of aseptic, cold and detached, with computers and security cameras. Said like this, it doesn't seem anything different from the usual, but I guarantee you that the images speak for themselves, try wandering around a former asylum under the effects of drugs on a stormy night and you will discover that nightmares can come to you even out of the heat of the your cot. HAND PLAY, VILLAIN PLAY This is the old popular saying, but if noble intentions of freedom are hidden in dexterity and practicality, then it is welcome to get your hands dirty. In addition to shooting and hitting the thugs' heads, you'll also have to interact with computer workstations, crack security system codes, cut chains with shears and more. Even if everything is materially limited to holding down the action key, it should be noted that in the context of the game the dynamics of the events are more than good. Want to kick some barrels at Grathius' henchmen (the super villains) and blow them close? You can do it! Do you want to activate a disused tram to make it crash into a series of stationed machine guns? Yes you can. And the examples could go on. In fact, the objectives of the mission are the main events in the continuation of your wanderings and will greatly influence the style of play and the way in which you will have to manage your surroundings. The next ~step~ in support of the main objective always remains clearly visible, but changing dynamically, make sure you always keep an eye on the white dot in the radar at the top right of the screen, because that is where the next key point of the plot is located . These factors mean that the events are in any case linked to a big common thread and the freedom to wander at will is sometimes less, but it is expertly hidden by obligatory paths, and without forcing (read: no invisible walls). Personally I agree with this choice, the game is frenetic and never distracting, but leaves all the breathing space needed in some moments, to give the player the opportunity to familiarize himself with his surroundings. Versions and Fixes by Max 'Kappa' Monti A small note of Devastation that must be mentioned: reading here and on the net, you can find some comments about alleged instabilities of the game, while in the review phase none were found. This is mainly due to the difference in releases: The European one, in fact, has enjoyed a significant revision of the code, which has practically canceled almost all of the problems previously present. Our contacts ~from above~ confirm what we have been able to verify: the buglist of the European version is infinitely shorter than the previous ones, and does not include any critical bugs. YOUR MEANS IN THE FIGHT Did someone shout water guns? Well, it makes you smile because in the end, only those are missing! Devastation boasts one of the largest weapon arrays I've ever seen, with around forty offensive means in your inventory. It starts with clubs, glass bottles and knives. Passing through automatic and semi-automatic pistols and assault rifles, or with sawed off barrels we come to nice gadgets such as futuristic bazookas and chainguns, without forgettingsniper rifles, grenades of various types: disruptive, smoke or blinding, up to unconventional weapons such as the legendary rat-bomb, which remotely piloted will allow you to pass through the smallest crevices. Discount at the checkout for those presenting the points card. Making the necessary considerations, the number of weapons should be reduced a little, because it is true that the more there is, the better, but different weapons are placed exclusively to make up the number. In the first place obviously not every type of realism should be considered (tell me if there is a person who carries around three types of sniper rifle at the same time) and then the purpose of a weapon is to hurt, in a video game we also like to do it in a different. Ergo: we will become attached to those weapons that really carry different consequences. Some then, are rather badly balanced, wanting to be forcibly specific but not very effective, such as the nail gun, with a small charge compared to the very little threatening effects. Let us dwell on the concept of ~reloading a weapon~. Always do it! Many times this factor tends to be overlooked, but in this game it is vital, given that in a few moments without counteroffensive to enemy fire you are dead. And then hand in hand comes the saying retrieve a bailout. Do it often! It seems to me that with this game I have approached a record of quicksave reloads worthy of the most treacherous Tomb Raider leap! In particularly difficult points you will have to use wisdom as well as firepower. Yes ok, but if there are ten of them out there armed to the teeth and I'm here with my pink pistol that came out of the Easter egg? Here come my comrades to the rescue! HURRY UPEHM COVER ME, SMALL THICKS! Often in the missions you will be accompanied by some allies who will join the fray with you, making some phases of the game really exciting and fun. By recalling the menu, you can quickly impart a behavior to each of your friends or to all of them together. In this case: attack, follow me, defend, wait. The tactical implications are there, although obviously not everything is rosy. Artificial intelligence fluctuates in performance. We go from moments of pure action in which everyone seems to behave as they should, going forward or defending a position to decidedly rhythm-breaking moments in which you will have to constantly remind the forgetful what they need to do, such as the subtle art of not getting shot. The enemies, on the other hand, behave in a rather standard way for a shooter, trying to make you mush as quickly as possible, although it must be said that in some situations someone even manages to amaze us, hiding behind a barricade or demonstrating bullet-dodging skills as a Shaolin monk. Still speaking of friends and foes, a praise goes again to the graphic sector, which compensates for our efforts with a particular and captivating design both of the most popular companions during the missions and of the fleeting extras waiting for a shot in the mouth. WE ARE A GANG Speaking of multiplayer, Devastation offers everything the shooter genre has based its strength on in the past: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, territory. I think that for the first three modes no more explanations are needed, if not a mention for the available arenas, which are well made and tailor-made to give the maximum in the respective game mode. Apart from some excessively narrow space, the dynamics of the entrances / exits and the aesthetic taste placed in the construction of the maps are well in line with the high standards of the game. The fourth game mode has already been seen, but it's always nice to find it in a multiplayer session. A series of intermediate objectives must be completed to get the better of the enemy. Classic example, recovery of codes and hacking of the access network to the enemy base and consequent extermination of the adversary. A sort of very concise miniplot, in a nutshell. Of course, a powerful editor attached to the game could not be missing, with which those who feel more inclined for editing and modding can give vent to their skills, perhaps even becoming part of the community of developers specially created for Devastation, so not to leave your creativity unexpressed. EMINEM WOULD BE PROUD Don't say that the protagonist doesn't look like him! In conclusion, Devastation has arrived in the community as a game ~to give a chance~ and instead we are the ones to say ~one more game!~. Undoubtedly we note that all the care of those who want to experiment technically has been placed in this title even if in some cases there is no feeling of being faced with something new, which does not know it has already been tasted. But if hardcore gamers couldI was finding it a bit anchored in the past, the vast majority of more or less hardened gamers could seriously find a nice engaging pastime, above all for the attention paid to placing the player in a futuristic setting, therefore exaggeratedly violent but credible. Not without its flaws, but rewarding and certainly more than just a workout for your hardware! Pros: Super graphics without sacrificing performance too much Compelling environments and tight action Cons: AI. with fluctuating performance Some weapons are superfluous ~Same old~ gameplay, for long-time fraggers AGAINST ANY ABUSE OF POWER Are you tired and frustrated by what seems like a flat life in the pay of the institutions? Do you think there is more to it than working every single day for less than measly wages and coming home early in the evening because there is a curfew? Well, then join the Resistance! With us nothing is written, nothing prevents us from changing the gray future that awaits us under the yoke of the Conservatives. Join us and we will bring down the totalitarian regime under which we are forced to live. Brothers, to arms! That's more or less the slogan of the faction you'll join as a key player in the Resistance! But let's go in order. Devastation is a classic FPS, which will throw you into an urban decay setting of the near future. The economy is falling apart, and in any self-respecting similar scenario, only a few have the fate of humanity in their hands. Mega corporations and multinationals have taken over, and now have the power to decide our destinies with the sound of genetic experiments. It's time to put a stop to the matter.
