{"name": "Age of Heroes III: Orc's Retribution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-heroes-iii-orcs-retribution.html", "text": "Similar to its predecessors, Age of Heroes III offers a rather complex narrative background full of characters and twists. In this new adventure, the user plays the role of Rackgul, leader of the orcs, who finds himself forced to repel the offensive of the elves, who had taken advantage of the infighting between the different clans to take control of the territory. From these premises moves a story told mainly through the numerous lines of dialogue that fill the game, which make the succession of the various battles quite exciting even if they do not shine for strictly stylistic qualities. Having said that, Age of Heroes III must be given credit for being very ~professional~ from this point of view, faithfully imitating the characteristics of the most famous titles for PC: every chat with the character on duty therefore takes place in a screen that houses the image of the same, its dialog box and a part reserved for questions and answers that can be asked through Rackgul. Certainly the meticulousness of Age of Heroes III is not limited to aspects that are after all accessories like this. By the developers' own admission, the game is inspired by milestones such as the Heroes of Might and Magic series, and it shows: there are tons of stats, artifacts, items, spells and so on and so forth, without obviously forgetting the inevitable experience points that lead to the various level-ups. A truly considerable amount for a mobile product, to the point of almost constituting an impediment to gameplay: if less savvy users could in fact find themselves initially disoriented (also given the substantial lack of a proper tutorial), at the same time fanatics of strategic-rpg the interface of Age of Heroes III can be indigestible, so full of menus and windows that inevitably tend to confuse. For this and other reasons, the Qplaze title is not really suitable to be enjoyed in short sessions in spare time, in what is an advantage for those who consider mobile games too superficial but a defect for those looking for mobile entertainment a simple pastime. The entire play structure of Age of Heroes III is in fact decidedly ~slow~ and reasoned, and is mainly divided into two sections: the first, in which you move around the map where enemies, dungeons, cities, NPCs and so on are displayed away, and the second relating to combat. In the latter case, Age of Heroes III follows the basic rules of any self-respecting tactical RPG: acting in turns, the two factions move their units on a grid, obviously in an attempt to annihilate the enemy. Different types of warriors are made available (for example wizards, berserkers, archers, etc.) each with specific characteristics to make the most of on the battlefield. Even if boring at times, Age of Heroes III proves to be a valid exponent of the genre, strengthened by a truly excellent technical realization: beyond the appreciable static images that stand out during the dialogues, absolutely noteworthy is the wealth of details of the map and the skilful use of colors. The combat screen, on the other hand, is a little less exciting, while the sound accompanies the action worthily without surprising in quality. PRO Neat and complete Excellent graphic design Challenging and long-lived AGAINST Quite slow and cumbersome Difficult for the inexperienced Not suitable for short gaming sessions", "date": "2007-04-10", "grade": "S.V."}
