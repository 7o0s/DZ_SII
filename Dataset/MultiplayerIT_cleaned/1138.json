The rapid rotation of the large blades of the helicopter that dominates us flying grazing above our heads at low altitude, generates strong gusts of wind. This swirl, in addition to making the surface of the stream in the middle of which we find ourselves ripple and foam, makes the lightest objects in the scenario twirl nervously around us. Firmly gripping our crowbar, we look around for another moment: we could hardly believe it but instead it's all true. Let's smile. We're back. Gordon Freeman is back. It's time to wear it again What you have just read is not the fruit of the sick fantasies of the writer. Nor a fictional excerpt from the introduction of Half-Life 2, and not even an account of the numerous cut-scenes that will accompany us along the complex and fascinating And your gaming life will never be the same again narrative plot drawn up by the screenwriters: it is the description of a very normal game situation managed by the latest Valve title. Yes, all right, perhaps for many it is still not normal... but don't worry, we assure you that, after about twenty/twenty-five hours of playing with Half-Life 2, it will become so for you too. And your gaming life will never be the same again. Scotty, activation! Attention, to play Half-Life 2, even in single player mode (the only one available after all) you need to have access to the Internet to validate the CD-Key! Without Internet access, for now, it will not be possible to play Half-Life 2. Make sure you can connect from the PC where you intend to install the game so as not to waste money unnecessarily. Half-Life 2 for dummies: why it's a game to buy Half-Life 2 is basically a first-person shooter with a strong exploratory component and a markedly adventurous soul. Furthermore, as per Valve tradition, the story is certainly not a mere pretext to introduce the various ~levels~, rather it has the same importance as all the other game elements and, as such, must be savored and discovered calmly, in order to get the most out of the gaming experience. After all, Half-Life 2 wants to represent the other half of your life. At least for a few days. Precisely for this reason, as far as possible, we will try not to tell you too much about the plot or all the different characters that animate it: enjoy every discovery you make during your adventures and make a good treasure of it, you don't often have experiences like this. One caveat: if it's not the first time you've grabbed the crowbar, you'll hardly (re) experience the emotions of the first Half-Life: the sense of bewilderment, the taste for discovery, the joy of revelations. Yet, objectively, the plot of Half-Life 2 rests on solid and mature foundations which, once concluded, will leave you with that pinch of rhetoric that usually makes you think. And then, for once you won't have to save the earth from an invasion of ravenous and evil Aliens... The game begins with a dream, perhaps better to say a nightmare. A familiar face greets you and introduces you to the world of Half-Life 2. Welcome. ~The right man in the wrong place can make the difference~: these words still echo in your head, when you realize that you are - again - a passenger on a train. You are far from Xen, the alien world of the first chapter and, rather, you realize you are in a city, presumably in Eastern Europe. The name ~City 17~ will soon mean home to you, or at least something very close to this concept. Hardware performance The game was tested in Valve's offices in Seattle with the following configuration: Pentium 4 3.2 Ghz Extreme Edition 2 Gb RAM DDR400 Radeon X800 XT Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound HD Western Digital 160GB SATAWestern Digital 160GB SATA HD With these components the game it performed very well at a resolution of 1280*1024 with filters activated at maximum and AA set to 2x. We only noticed sporadic stutter in two situations, and in both situations the bottleneck seemed to be the RAM/HD mix, as the PC had to load texture and sound data from the hard drive. In all, about 6 seconds total out of over 20 hours of gameplay. Unfortunately we have not been able to test the title with other configurations, however the programmers have assured us that already with a Radeon 9600 Pro and a 1.5 Ghz system with 512Mb of RAM, the game will be able to run at a more than acceptable level of detail and will allow you to enjoy all the graphic wonders offered by the Source. Hardware performance Hardware performance Hardware performance Once terundermined the introduction, dry your tears, find your jaw crashed to the ground and have erased that expression of dazed happiness from your face, you can finally (re) take control of Dr. Freeman and admire the game world that is the result of more five years of programming and can be summed up in one word: Source. The Source (literally, Source), is the game engine developed by Valve - starting from the spring of 1999 - which also thanks to the implementation of the famous Havok 2, in addition to presenting us with state-of-the-art graphic routines, is able to manage all game elements in a believable way (from characters to objects), following the physical laws of the real world. To all this we add all the options of a modern graphics engine, such as normal-mapping or the skeletal animation of the ~Ragdoll~ type body and others that are almost unpublished such as facial animation which, in a completely automatic way, allows move probably as many as 35 virtual muscles on the faces of all the game characters, allowing them to move their lips in sync with what they are saying at that moment (yes, even in the Italian version) and to make them express, as never before, the typical human emotions such as joy, apprehension or dread. Thus, for example, once we start the game we will see the G-Man again  animated, like all the game's cut-scenes, in real time and not with pre-rendered movies, as well as being able to see the pores of the skin or the veins in transparency, we will see him emphasize certain sentences with the expressions of his face and eyes. Or, when we are deafened by the explosion of a grenade that occurred a few meters from us, we will still be able to understand the mood of our comrades by literally reading the terror in their eyes, and no longer having to hear their screams or curses. The flexibility of the Source is at times astonishing and even the most fussy will notice marginal things such as the sky that does not move, or other more choreographic but significant ones such as a management of the lightshadow games perhaps not yet up to those of Doom 3, on the other hand it will be impossible not to appreciate the game possibilities and the great scenic impact that this game is able to offer to the player. If Doom 3 is a room, Half-Life 2 is the whole world outside. You will notice it when you find yourself driving a battered Dune-Buggy along a mountain path and perhaps humming a tune by Oliver Onions, at a certain point you will notice, already from a considerable distance, a checkpoint. Maybe you won't care and force the blockade, or you will go down, find a way to rout the enemy opposition, enter the buildings to look for ammunition and medicines, get back on your means of locomotion and you won't have time to start whistling again when you have to deal with an air attack. All this, without any solution of continuity. The only game intervals will be represented, just like in the first Half-Life (or like in Morrowind), by a certain number, more or less frequent depending on the memory allocation of your system, of ~temporary~ interruptions designed to load the rest of the level. The use of normal mapping and bump mapping is commendable: unlike other titles that use them, one does not notice their presence but their use can be deduced thanks to the detail of the models and the extreme realism of the textures. Similarly, many special effects that test the shaders of your graphics cards, such as refraction, reflection and so on, are never lacking, but are never used inappropriately and enter when they really feel the need. For example, the water is of an almost absolute realism, as are the energy shields of certain fixed positions or the optical effect that occurs when the Striders, the enormous mechanical vehicles that dominate the city streets, use their weapon more lethal that distorts - literally - space. Doom 3 is a room, Half-Life 2 is the whole world outside Even the use of the physics engine, although it is no longer a novelty in the world of video games, in Half-Life 2 takes on a new meaning and demonstrates all the real potential of next generation video games. In fact, if some games like Max Payne 2 or Painkiller have already introduced physical routines for a more or less choreographic purpose, and others like PSI-OPS (on consoles) have exploited them obsessively and without real inspirations (and aspirations) worthy of note, in Half-Life 2 the physics engine allows you to introduce a new game variable into shooters and - as we will further explore in the course of our review - to give a new meaning to the concept ofthe cause/reaction. Driving sessions included. The glass breaks, the bullets shatter the wooden planks behind which we have sought shelter from the common fire, the fire spreads from one body to another, all the objects in the scenario can be picked up, pushed, thrown, some can be destroy, others will float and still others can be used as a barrier and these are just some examples. Not even the audio system was left in the background. On the contrary. A 5.1 system is practically mandatory to fully enjoy the game and all the positional audio effects, the samples used are of the highest quality, as are all the dubbing sessions. The soundtrack, although almost absent to make room for the environmental effects, peeps out from time to time to emphasize some moments of the game and to increase its drama. In short, high class also from this point of view. God is in the details The details make the masterpieces. And viceversa. Here is an example: among the new features of the new ~suite~ that we will have as standard, we mention that of the intelligent viewfinder: without taking your eyes off the viewfinder, in fact, two indicators always present in the center of the screen will tell us the energy level and the number of ammunition left in the magazine. More goodies? Here are just a few: Trying to throw cans of white paint at enemies will turn them white. Throwing circular saws at them, on the other hand, will make them cut in two (and you can also try to do a 3-in-a-row!). Whenever possible, try to lure enemy creatures into the water - they will drown. Or, try to set it on fire by exploding nearby barrels of petrol, they will start to burn and can spread the fire to the surrounding environment. Have you ever seen a priest with Converse? The characterization of Half-Life 2 characters is also this. Try to ~break~ a box... instead of shattering it will open showing the typical ~cross~ structure. Always keep your eyes open and, when you can, use the monitors you will meet on the street, who knows you may not happen to see some old acquaintances again... Half-Life 2 in depth: why it's a game to be lived The pace of playful action is an important thing for Valve. One of the secrets of the first Half-Life, and predictably also of this second chapter, is precisely the careful planning of all game times. Getting bored will therefore be extremely difficult: Half-Life 2 is so full of ideas and intuitions that, if they had been implemented individually by other titles, they probably would have been exploited to the point of boredom and would have represented the entire soul of the game (Mr Carmack, take it badly, Editor's note). Half-Life 2 is not a simple FPS but represents a new interpretation that will lead, almost paradoxically, to the breaking of the rigid cataloging schemes leading to a new form of meta-genre. At Valve they had fun quoting or introducing ever-changing game elements, continually displacing the player and keeping him constantly on his toes, presenting him with new situations from time to time and forcing him to tweak the way he tackles the game. Exploration however free, in the end often resolves itself into a linear and obligatory funnel Half-Life 2 in depth: why it's a game to be lived Thus, if some sections of the first part of the game, with their treacherous use of slimy and slippery surfaces, even reminded us of the prehistoric Ultima Underworld, others, such as the gloomy village of Ravenholm infested by an endless horde of Zombies, reminded us brought to mind the old MOD trilogy They Hunger. Many of you will notice obvious references to literary masterpieces such as ~The War of the Worlds~ or cinematic ones, such as the Matrix trilogy or... Tremors. The game, especially in the last parts, is full of epic and spectacular moments, but at the beginning instead the frenetic and chaotic situations will be the masters, there will be moments of pure terror just as there will never be time to catch your breath. Perhaps leaving the player the pleasure of discovering the setting through one of the innumerable details - such as a scene to watch or a dialogue with any character - useless for the purposes of the game but decisive for the story's credibility, or by putting him in front of puzzles, some of which are worthy of certain graphic adventures. Also in this regard, we mention the much anticipated introduction of the driving sections. In the wake of several other shooters - such as Halo - in Half-Life 2 it will be possible to take command of a Hovercraft first and then a Dune-Buggy. The control system is almost always optimal (Bu", "date": "2004-11-16", "grade": null}
