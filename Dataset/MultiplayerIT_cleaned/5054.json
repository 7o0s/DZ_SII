Some may be fun, some less, but it doesn't matter. Usually even those who make continuous appeals for the end of degradation on the web are no less and fill their days with garbage, published for the lol, that is, to have a laugh. The author of Bloody Boobs must have thought he could achieve some success by creating a trashy title featuring scantily clad girls, and so it was. It won't sell millions of copies, but it has already placed enough and it has been shared and commented, so much so that it is worthy of media attention. It costs very little (three euros at full price), it is talked about very badly, yet it has not been ignored as it deserves. Evidently boobs work and the desire to appear nice and politically incorrect turns many into easy prey for the silliest commercial operations. We tried Bloody Boobs, a really bad game. But really a lot. Don't believe it? Buttocks in the wind Eduard Bulashov's third-person action adventure, announced some time ago, tells of pretty girls imprisoned to be sacrificed to an ancient god. That's all. No, we are not avoiding anticipating who knows what plot twists. The substance is really all here. Facing life in thongs. An interesting philosophy. More on that later. Before starting a game you have to create your own avatar, choosing the hair, the size of the breasts, the dress (if we want to call it that), the color of the skin and little else. The clothes are actually two provocative costumes that look straight out of a porno, while the rest of the editor offers very few choices compared to what one might expect from such stuff. There is also the option to disguise the girls with a paper bag on their head. But that's about it. Since this is the most successful part of Bloody Boobs that says it all. Unfortunately, however, you can also start playing. Here a nice blocking bug would have come in handy, the ones that send your PC to mush preventing you from continuing, but the game started normally and we ended up with the newly created girl, pleasantly called Blowjoba, inside a musty and dusty dungeon. We looked around for possible interactions, but nothing, so we headed down the only available corridor and started testing the controls, explained by a screen upon starting the game (which stays on screen for three seconds) and not configurable. Our she can walk, run or crawl. At first one thinks of some stealth system, but in reality it is not like that. That is, the stealth system should be there, but it doesn't work. All you have to do is not let enemies see you, whether you're running or crawling. Indeed, to be honest, going slow can prove counterproductive. So stride away and let's find out what can be done in this labyrinth. Let's pray The only thing you can do in this damn game is pray (which is quite paradoxical, given the underlying theme). The girls' goal is to find four altars and worship them. There really is nothing else. In fact, legends say that bombs can be recovered from somewhere, but they are completely useless when the (fixed) position of the altars is known. For the rest we can use the right mouse button to do the middle finger, but that's really all. Bloody Boobs is a kind of ugly hide and seek, the meaning of which is hard to understand. The editor is the best part of the game Monsters have an artificial intelligence of their own If you want you can also play cooperatively, but why do it since collaborating is totally useless? Once you practice the control system and understand how enemies work, Bloody Boobs can be completed in less than twenty minutes. Enemies, poor things, are of two types: there's a demon that crawls on the ground and makes a lot of noise, and there's another demon that walks upright. Both behave in the same way: like good marpioni, when they see the protagonist they run after her trying to kill her. But artificial intelligence works terribly. There are some occasions when enemies seem relentless (even running you can't escape them), while in others they forget about their prey after a few moments. Whether you run or crawl changes little and you get attacked regardless. Demons have very good eyesight and can spot us even from many meters away. In some cases the only way to get past one is to chase them hoping they will quickly forget themyou of our existence. If you get hit, conspicuous red marks appear on the screen, indicating the damage. After many swipes the screen fills up with this very annoying stuff which makes it difficult to continue playing. Graphically, Bloody Boobs isn't despicable, but it completely lacks artistic direction. The dungeon seems made at random with assets remedied and placed just to give variety. For example, at one point there is a closed luminous tree in one of the rooms. Its function? None, it's just there to decorate. And the sewers? Apart from that they are ugly but, above all, why are there sewers in a temple dedicated to ancient gods? Why is one of the altars placed behind wine barrels? Why did anyone want us so badly to produce this stuff? It's really hard to find anything that saves itself in this playful disaster, of which the fact that the protagonists are semi-naked and their boobs have an absurd physique is the least of the problems. The rich quantity of documents that explain the reason for the kidnapping also deserves a final mention. Do you think that going around the dungeon you can find zero. Few but well written, one might say. Attention to detail is everything.", "date": "2017-02-13", "grade": "1.1"}
