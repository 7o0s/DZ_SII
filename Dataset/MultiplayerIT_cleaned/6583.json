It is a small and fierce team of veterans from the most disparate American software houses, within which elements even from the creative substrate of the very first Game Boy lurk. Other Ocean has evolved over time and has been able to gain the trust of the biggest developers in the world thanks to many outsourced games such as Castlevania by Konami (for Xbox Live), Monkey Ball by SEGA, Dark Void by Capcom, Mortal Kombat by Midawy and endless important licenses (we mention only Tron, Yu-Gi-Oh, Toy Story, Spongebob, CSI, Spider-Man and the X-Men, to give you a broad overview). All this premise just to put a firm point, namely that #IDARB is an innovative and ~fresh~ project, but it has a truly expert and shrewd team behind it. Other Ocean publicly admits that it was mainly inspired by Super Smash Bros. and Bomberman: their game, difficult to describe in words, is basically a sports title because the goal is to drive the ball into the opponent's net, but at the same time an action/ platform as the level is full of structures on which to climb, jump, climb. It's also a beat'em up when it comes to ~killing~ opponents with specials, combos and forbidden moves. We also see many other games in it: Soccer Brawl, Speedball, Sensible Soccer... but also the recent Super Meat Boy and N+ in terms of graphic style and character control. The developers started from a box of red pixels to get to all this simply by asking their Twitter followers what they wanted from the game and how they wanted to continue development. Added to this is the fantastic Hash Bombing option: in the event that a player broadcasts his game on Twitch or simply connects his Twitter profile to the live stream, users who observe the matches can write specific comments in the chat that can suddenly change some game mechanics, updating the game live with new variables and shots that were not initially foreseen. Obviously this feature can be turned off, but having that touch of unpredictability is definitely tantalizing and is part of the very nature of the game. Speaking of this last aspect, we must say that its structure, however variable, is easily and quickly usable by anyone thanks to only three main commands: pass, shot, hit. Obviously jumping and climbing within the labyrinthine playing field. It is mostly played online only, up to eight players simultaneously and in teams of 4 against 4. You can also do a sort of story-training in solitude, but it has very little sense and appeal. #IDARB matches last four times like in basketball, but the scores of each ~basket~ or goal vary according to the difficulty of the shot and the distance. In the middle of the game, the players are then involved in a minigame that changes every time and which is an excellent multiplayer pastime, even if it has no consequence on the outcome of the game. In addition to the matchmaking and training option, a third line appears in the main menu, namely the editor. With a powerful pixel-by-pixel creation program you can create new characters and give our team's jerseys colors and themes that are always different and personalized. The limit is only the imagination, in #IDARB there are already many well-known characters from video games and beyond, dozens and dozens of selectable players to throw into the chaos of his frenetic games. Xbox One goals #IDARB puts the canonical 1000 points on the plate to unlock through 12 main objectives. Most are very simple to obtaineras and it's just a matter of getting some practice in online multiplayer. For example, you have to create a personalized team, score a 15-point goal, create new characters, songs and much more using the appropriate editors. Some of them are obtained only by having the Kinect camera activated, a factor that can make those who love to complete objectives turn up their noses but find themselves without this device. Otherwise, all quite agile and fast, exactly like in the spirit of the game itself, #IDARB will be able to give you satisfaction in this sense too. Simple but multifaceted The points management system is very intelligent and gives moderate satisfaction. In practice, a point is earned by entering the opponent's goal on foot. Two points with a direct throw. Instead, by shooting from distance we can activate a multiplier that doubles the points for each time the ball bounces off a surface, until we get 20-point goals. With some special moves you can disturb the opponent and take possession of the game ball in a more or less ~sporty~ way and through a dense network of passes go on the break to the other side of the level. The characters are controlled satisfactorily, but not as precise as, for example, happens in similar titles such as Super Meat Boy (where the refinement of the controls is a key feature). #IDARB is much more chaotic and confusing, especially when played in four against four, and the feeling that some goals are quite fortuitous and the result of a wild ~button mashing~ often takes over the effectiveness of the controls. Online multiplayer is supported very well by the Kinect camera which acts as a group microphone, to talk and shout to friends all over the world, all together. The camera can also be used to scan QR codes found on the official site, which unlock new characters and teams. What works little of the Other Ocean game is not so much the idea behind its frenetic gameplay, rather the lack of alternative options and secondary game modes. Let's think above all of the game arena, very simple and unavoidable. Let's also think about the amount of mini-games possible with such a concept, let's talk about competitive and multiplayer modes, not simple fillers between times. On the purely audiovisual front, there isn't much to say. #IDARB is a tribute to the 8-bit era in all respects, starting from the fired colors and ending with a soundtrack entirely created with an 80s-flavored synthesizer, with typical sounds of the games of the time and a rhythmic musical accompaniment and pressing as he used to do twenty years ago. We don't feel like making great criticisms of a game that, moreover, is given as a gift and only for this reason must obviously be tried and tested thoroughly, discovering all its strengths and weaknesses firsthand. For all pixel nostalgics, a download not to be missed and an added value for a title that you will be passionate about, but we are probably talking to a very limited niche of players.", "date": "2015-02-06", "grade": "7.0"}
