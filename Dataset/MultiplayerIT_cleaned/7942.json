Dozens of software houses tried their hand every year in an attempt to stand out and entertain and characters like David Perry, creator of Aladdin or Cool Spot, owe their fame and fortune to this type of game. A lot of water has passed under the bridges, the genus flounders and, apart from the eternal plumber, one of the few houses that still boasts three more or less active mascots on its platforms is Sony, thanks to the sagas of Ratchet & Clank, Jak & Daxter (with a mysterious episode in the pipeline for years) and Sly Cooper, the raccoon King of the thieves. Just Sly, after an HD reissue of the chapters published on PlayStation 2, returns with a brand new title and four years of silence, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time to try to satisfy the appetites of all those who between one jump and other have found their home. intramate Our hero is now half-retired. Retired from crime, he enjoys life with his beloved Carmelita, the FBI agent fox who, after years of chasing him, fell in love with him, leading him to the right path. However, a raccoon loses his hair but not his vice and, faced with a very rare and irresistible artefact, he absentmindedly organizes a coup of his own, under the eyes of his fiance, but finds himself catapulted into an intrigue that takes him through five levels and as many time eras, always grappling with one of his ancestors and with very shady characters that the villain of the moment has teleported from the present day in an attempt to alter the course of events and get rich in the most atrocious ways. In addition to Sly, the ancestors and Carmelita, the faithful companions of all time return, the turtle Bentley and the hippopotamus Murray, each with their own skills and levels in which to be the protagonist. Where the action with Sly and relatives follows the canons of the more classic platform, with the turtle you access a series of mini-games with which to penetrate the computer systems of Sly's opponents, while with Murray you pass more often to sequences in which necessary to lead your hands with small digressions from a scrolling fighting game. The beautiful fox, on the other hand, becomes the protagonist of the sections in which you have to shoot like crazy, between scrolling levels and sequences of driving bizarre vehicles. Each era is characterized by a central hub that acts as a link in which, before accessing the actual action sections, one must alternate with the commands of the protagonists, studying the situation, collecting photographs to understand what to do, generally following the instructions on a small map displayed on the left side of the screen. All introduced by a long series of interlude scenes halfway between cartoon and comic, all well done, but with very uninspired and far too long dialogues. In short, between these and the connecting phases, unfortunately, the pace slows down, gets lost and with it all the good done in some of the tighter platform sections, due to the dead times and an uninspired level design precisely in the long phases intermediate. Even the great variety does not help Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time, given that some of the bizarre mechanics linked to Sly's ancestors bring mini events and situations far from being thrilling to the track. However, when the developers focus on a few well-studied things, the levels work and, undoubtedly, you have fun as it doesn't happen so often in recent years. Playstation 3 trophies Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a long game, full of objects to find and secrets to discover, above all due to the backtracking which forces, if you want platinum, to revisit the locations with the costumes gradually acquired. In short, it will take patience, but the game is all in all simple and platinum should be within the reach of the most willing I level up Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time also has a minimum of depth since in the levels, by collecting coins that come out by eliminating enemies and smashing objects, you grow loot that you can spend in a shop where you can buy new moves to upgrade the different protagonists. However, it is a rather simple game and these power ups only serve to give the player a sense of progression, not resulting in solving any situation. When you slow down in progress it is for some more difficult passages (and there are progressing) during the purest action areas and it is precisely there that you have fun, in essence, without ever making the experience too frustrating. Back, of course, the possibility for our hero to dress up, acquiring further skills, and to return through the levels already overcome to collect every last secret object, especially for trophy hunters. In short, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is already a rather long game in itself, with a campaign that can be completed in more than ten hours, to which are added all the time it takes to explore each hub area thanks to the powers. The problem is that this length was obtained by lengthening the stock a little and it's a shame because the foundations are there and, above all, there is the absolutely attractive price. Between ups and downs, however, what doesn't help is the graphic design which, while captivating and cartoonish, rests on a polygonal system and graphic effects that make PlayStation 2 a little too much and, when the action frays, not helping to hold one's breath, this limitation makes itself felt all too much, further turning up one's nose. It's a shame because the audio definitely does its duty, even on a musical level, and because, as mentioned, a more concentrated experience based only on what the level designers obviously know how to do, would have helped a lot, giving us a positive title below all points of view.", "date": "2013-03-20", "grade": "7.7"}
