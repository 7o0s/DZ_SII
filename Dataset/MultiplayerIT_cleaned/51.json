{"name": "Destroy all Humans! 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destroy-all-humans-2.html", "text": "Time to act As soon as the KGB agents attack Crypto, knocking out his disguise, we will have to take immediate action and make our way among dozens and dozens of enemies intent on killing us. We will start with only a shock gun, a not very effective weapon, but we will almost immediately be able to access our telekinetic powers, which allow us to lift objects and people, and to throw them far to use them as improper weapons. Once we reach the flying saucer, we will also have access to a ~shop~ where it is possible to buy, ~spending~ the objects collected, numerous upgrades and so on. The acquisition of new weapons generally takes place with the completion of the missions, which is the fulcrum of DAH2: we will have to complete a sequence of objectives one after the other, passing from those focused on action to those on intrusion, passing through missions in which we will have to protect characters. The rules of the game are quite clear: immediately after the very first sequence, which sees us busy reaching the flying saucer to be updated by the alien electronic brain on what the situation is, in the environment around us there will once again be a quiet unawareness from part of the citizens, and we will have to ensure that things do not change. [C] Crypto, the charismatic protagonist of DAH2. The radar in the lower left will help us; to guide us through the goals. The graphics of the game are perfect. more oriented towards the quantity & agrave; than towards quality. [/C] Invasion of the Body Snatchers By approaching a person and pressing the Triangle key quickly, we will be able to enter his body and use it to get around without arousing suspicion, as well as to obtain the information we need to complete missions. A practical example: in the early stages of the game, we will have to find and eliminate a dangerous hippie who has created a drink capable of annihilating people's will, transforming them into easily maneuverable puppets. To find out where this guy is, we'll have to enter the body of a fanatic and ask around our fellow humans. Asking for information in the role of a policeman obviously will not have the same effect, quite the contrary. In the act of taking possession of other people's bodies, we will also have to pay attention to who sees us: once identified as ~body thieves~, we will have to behave like in most stealth games and therefore quickly move to a different area or silence the witnesses , in this case by erasing his recent memory again thanks to our mental powers. One of the fields in which DAH2 excels is precisely that relating to the speeches of the characters, full of humor at times ruthless and clearly ironic towards what were the fashions of the 70s. Alien technology Technically speaking, the new Pandemic Studios title uses an engine that closely resembles the various GTAs, therefore a multipurpose solution that manages a large number of polygons in order to represent an urban cross-section in the most convincing way possible. As long as you remain on foot, it works quite well ... but once on board the flying saucer, intent on disintegrating tanks and missile launcher batteries, we will notice the heavy ~fog effect~ that affects landscapes that are not in the immediate vicinity. vicinity. And the frame rate, in general, is not crazy: we are clearly below 30 fps, fortunately without too many uncertainties. The present characters themselves boast a good design, but limited to few categories: normal citizens, hippies, policemen, military and KGB agents... As far as the sound sector is concerned, things are much better: the game boasts a translation in Good quality Italian, which however is limited to the texts on the screen. Not bad: the original voices are really funny, especially it makes Crypto smile when he tries to speak in hippie slang to find information. All this is seasoned with sound effects and music that mimic classic science fiction cinema, with good results. Comment The step forward from the first Destroy all Humans! is clear, on all fronts: DAH2 is a product that offers a certain type of entertainment, sometimes reasoned and sometimes not but always characterized by a brilliant humorous vein. It is necessary to give the game the opportunity to conquer us, but once it has happened we will not be able to help but appreciate its atmospheres, situations and mechanics in general. This does not mean that we are dealing with a game without defects: the technical aspect is just above sufficient, and the presence of some dead spots could make those who prefer pure action turn up their noses. If you enjoyed the first episode of thethe series, however, Destroy all Humans! 2 is really a recommended purchase. Pros: Very funny situations and dialogues A large number of missions of different types Sound spot on Cons: Only decent graphics Some dead spots between missions Inaccurate combat system The Destroy all Humans! series, created by Pandemic Studios, finally produces a sequel that has every intention of making up for the shortcomings of the first episode. DAH2 is set in the late 1970s, with the Russian secret services busy uncovering an alien invasion in progress... an invasion that even reaches the top levels of the American administration. In fact, the president of the United States is none other than the terrible Crypto alien in disguise, and it is he who we will control throughout the game.", "date": "2007-03-06", "grade": null}
