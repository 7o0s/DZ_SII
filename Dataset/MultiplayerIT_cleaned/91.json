{"name": "ArmA: Armed Assault - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arma-armed-assault-recensione.html", "text": "An heir found In addition to winking on numerous occasions to its prequel (you will find, for example, Captain Armstrong), the title takes up the same game mechanics of Operation Flashpoint: you will face a series of missions connected to each other by a simple narrative plot, following the evolution of the conflict from different points of view, from that of a simple infantryman to the extremes of a fighter pilot. A first pleasant surprise, particularly welcome, is given by the possibility of choosing to finish a series of secondary missions before tackling the main one, so as to obtain benefits in the latter: from a tactical map, in perfect Rise of Nations style, you can choose whether to embark on a sabotage mission, so as to reduce the number of armored vehicles in the main mission, or prefer an air raid, cutting off the supply bridges of your enemies. Two Humvees Wrecked: The Start Isn't Easy promising The usefulness of these missions, although not essential at the beginning of the campaign, will become increasingly necessary as the conflict evolves, as well as obviously representing an excellent trick to increase longevity and offer alternative routes. However, applause goes to the developers who have cleverly managed to avoid a trap that would have damaged the entire gameplay: even if you decide not to face any secondary mission (even if you would miss some decidedly fun missions) the main one will never be unfeasible. even if it will require a much higher dose of skill, in addition to the usual, evergreen, dose of luck. Graphically speaking Realism, however, is not only given by the current context, but also by a decidedly well-made graphic rendering: the models are rich in details and the animations are decidedly valid and made with maniacal care; when reloading a weapon, your soldier will perform exactly the same gestures that his real counterpart will do, without forgetting even the shutter pull. The engine manages to create scenes close to the real ones The extraordinary nature of the engine lies, as already happened in Operation Flashpoint, in being able to move a good 400 square kilometers of map without any loading or swapping during your game, except for the initial one: you will therefore be free to get on a fighter, fly as long as you want, parachute over a forest and walk to the beach, where you can still take a boat and sail, all without ever encountering a suspension due to a loading. The richness of details, of the environments, of the models and the complexity of the effects is paid, unfortunately, at a high price: the hardware requests, in order to be able to enjoy the island of Sahrani in its most magnificent splendour, are decidedly high: in fact, you will have to have a high-end card compatible with DirectX 9, but you will be safe from any slowdown with an Nvidia 8-series GPU (please refer to the box on this page). We would like to underline an important aspect in our opinion: at the time, when Operation Flashpoint came out, many were disappointed by the exorbitant hardware requests, but after less than a year, with the evolution of the components and their price adjustment, OPF became a title that can be enjoyed by most players, and we are sure that the same will happen with Armed Assault as soon as the market is flooded with mid-range video cards compatible with the new DirectX libraries. But how luck? Well yes, Armed Assault (ArmA for friends) introduces an absolutely new variable in the panorama of video games, namely luck: as (we assume) it is in real war, the probability of getting shot will be extremely high, and even more probable is that you get it from someone several hundred meters away, without having the faintest idea of who is shooting at you: You will see dozens of scenes like this, unfortunately... during our games we have repeatedly seen our teammate die who moved next to us, allowing us to identify the enemy and engage in a firefight; reloading the same point, demonstrating a dynamic AI, the lethal bullet hit us and, reloading a third time, the enemy sniper killed neither of us. Although this may not please the purists of the FPS genre, it certainly helps to increase the already high feeling of realism, bringing the tension to impressive levels during any mission, forcing you not to get distracted even for a few seconds, which could be the fatal ones. the probability of getting shota will be extremely high, and even more likely you will get it from someone several hundred meters away But how luck? The downside is an unparalleled involvement, which will lead you to breathe sighs of relief when you see reinforcements arriving, and curses when your last tank is destroyed due to your carelessness, all with the tranquility of sitting at your desk and to have the quick loads available. Hardware requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz or AMD equivalent, not optimized for Dual Core RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 64Mb (AMD 9500 or Nvidia FX) Disk Space: 3.0 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1024 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 256Mb(AMD X800 or Nvidia 6800) Disk Space: 3.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700, 2.7 Ghz RAM: 2 Gb Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTX, 768MB There is no more religion... Another point in common between ArmA and its prequel is the variety of missions: often your initial briefing will be distorted by the course of events, sometimes forcing you into ruinous retreats or sudden and clumsy assaults, not only in the role of a simple soldier, committed to fighting meter by meter, but also as a special forces agent, with missions behind enemy lines and at very high risk, or even as a fighter or attack helicopter pilot and, the inevitable guest, as a tank driver in the army of the United States, aboard the timeless M1A1. Armed Assault therefore offers you the opportunity to enjoy spectacular all-out battles, obviously always in the most absolute realism: if therefore, in the distance, you see the branches of the trees bending inexplicably, expect that, at any moment, a helicopter will take off ; they are small touches of class which, in our opinion, make the gaming experience something unique, and with which the game is full: although they may seem irrelevant, thanks to your correct intuition, they will allow you to earn those few precious seconds which will lead you to successfully complete the mission, as well as saving your virtual life in multiplayer. In particular, it will be necessary to learn to think as it would happen in reality, deviating a bit from videogame canons: if you have to shoot down a helicopter to save your life, you will not have to waste time looking around for some solution offered by the developers, but you can also start shooting the tail rotor with what you have hoping that your shots will land, or perhaps aiming directly at the pilot. You will therefore enjoy a vast freedom of action, which already characterized the first Operation Flashpoint, and the developers, demonstrating this, will never provide you with a better solution than others, but only a vast sampling of possibilities, thus also increasing the title replayability. What's up with the rush However, ArmA is not a perfect title, although it manages to score many of its hits: the sound impact of the title disappoints, especially for the radio voices used by your fellow soldiers: for some absurd reason the developers have preferred to resort to a vocal synthesizer (and not even of high quality) to reproduce the communications, and these appear decidedly too artificial, almost as if they were pronounced in small pieces, without the normal continuity given by human intonation. Sometimes you will not have time to get out of your vehicle, which you will already be; dead Even some sound effects, especially for some firearms, are too muffled, while the sound produced by explosions and debris thrown into the air are represented with excellent quality, with hisses and dull thuds. In terms of gameplay, although the European version arrives on the markets fixed in many respects, for older video cards problems of overlapping textures at different resolutions can arise, due to a not exactly excellent mipmapping programming, omnipresent throughout the game; this defect, although limited only to the aesthetic aspect, weighs heavily on the feeling that permeates all the games, taking away a lot from the involvement. However, it should be noted that they are rather frequent bugs in titles of this magnitude and many of these already afflicted the previous versions of Operation Flashpoint: fortunately Bohemia has proved to be very willing to provide the community not only with the tools, but also with continuous patches to improve and correct many of these aspects: considering that just one month after the release on the Czech market, the developers had already released a patchand a fixed exe, we are sure they will continue on this path for Armed Assault (v1.05 is currently in the works, which also adds new vehicles and weapons, as well as improved performance). Everyone's war Before concluding, and arriving at the fateful final judgment, it is necessary to dwell on the multiplayer aspect of ArmA: in addition to offering the typical ~Conquer the flag~, ~Eliminate the target~ and Deathmatch modes, the developers have also recovered the fun cooperative mode , where a team of human players will face CPU-controlled opponents: this game mode reaches its climax when the team members are your friends, or clan members, all in contact via a TeamSpeak server and a comfortable microphone : in these cases the feeling of actually being inside a conflict, with your fellow soldiers who often scream when they are under enemy fire and whisper during stealth operations will allow you to experience unforgettable moments, we can assure you. The multiplayer component has some stability and lag problems in version 1.02, but the European version (updated to 1.03) has fixed many of these bugs. Conclusions At the end of this long review, as a title of the caliber of ArmA deserves, we can undoubtedly recommend the purchase to all Operation Flashpoint lovers because they will not be disappointed and will find many of the mechanics already seen in the previous Bohemia title; those who are interested in testing what it can mean to be at war (subject to all relevant references, of course), or wish to try an alternative game to the usual arcade FPS, will surely be able to discover a little gem of modern military tactics. We do not recommend the purchase to those looking for an immediate and undemanding title, given that some missions have significant difficulty peaks and could lead you to prematurely uninstalling the game. Bohemia Interactive has shown that it is possible to churn out an excellent product even when you don't have an emblazoned publisher behind you, and we are happy to crown their efforts with a decidedly above average vote.Pro The Operation Flashpoint Heir Extremely realistic and engaging Great graphics Cons Excessive hardware requirements May not like Some graphics and audio issues Marines, Vista and 8800 Armed Assault presents some serious stability problems with high end configurations: installing the game on Windows Vista together with an 8800 GTX, with each fast loading, ArmA crashes returning to the desktop, reporting a generic error: on the official forum, the developers have already informed that he is working on a special patch, so as to make the title enjoyable for those who have burdened themselves with spending sprees for the first DirectX 10 compatible GPUs. We just have to wait! Introductions to warfare The Operation Flashpoint phenomenon introduced a new variable in the universe of action games: realism; a blow to the head was enough to bring you prematurely to game over, a wound in the legs prevented you from running or even squatting, forcing you instead to crawl, while faithfully reproduced vehicles moved around you, planes and attack helicopters, troops dropped in the fray and missions from Spec Ops: a real digital warfare. The success of this title has been confirmed by numerous official expansions, including the excellent Resistance, as well as a whole series of mission packs and real campaigns created by the very active community of modders, managing to prolong the longevity of this title until to the release of its sequel, keeping alive the hope of playing the uncomfortable (and dangerous) role of a soldier thrown in the middle of a conflict... Armed Assault, although christened differently (due to a copyright problem), can be considered the official sequel to Operation Flashpoint, and this time you will be transported into a real modern conflict, with a sad nod to recent events in Iraq. You will then be called to move to the enchanting island of Sahrani, a real natural paradise, but a burning political hell: you will be involved in a bloody war between two governments, but your mission will not be to restore peace, let alone impersonate the hero of turn and drive out ~Evil~ by saving poor innocents: your only goal will be to bring home the skin, and we can assure you that it will be anything but simple.", "date": "2007-02-15", "grade": null}
