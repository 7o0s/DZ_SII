Once a good number of troops have been collected, you can set off to conquer the world with the foresight of continuing to generate replacements that go to fill the ranks of our army, after the inevitable losses in the most heated clashes. It seems to have returned to the dawn of RTS when we fought on Dune with the wonder of those who know they are facing something revolutionary. Here, today that marvel is no longer there, because the revolution has long since passed, but the things to do are always the same. Oh well, no one complained about the latest Command & Conquer... originality probably doesn't interest gamers who, on the other hand, love to defeat opposing troops always in the same way by throwing immense and unbeatable armies at them. We hoped at least that the three armies differed in something, so as to have more to tell. Instead nothing, they are practically identical, apart from some secondary detail that has little effect on the progress of the battles (the Persians have more animals at their disposal than the others, the Egyptians are good alchemists and can exploit chemistry to their advantage, while the Spartans have more weapons). it seems that the brave Leonidas was able to stop a million Persians with three hundred men, but it also seems that he had great difficulty in taking the entrance to the most tortuous paths, often ending up walking empty against the rocks Heroes and quests We will talk about the naval battles in the paragraph dedicated to the defects of the game, given that these are particularly sad and uninspired moments. For the rest we have to talk about the heroes, or rather those individual troops that can be developed during the course of a campaign and which will have the purpose of carrying out quests and activating dialogues with the other characters. Again, there is nothing new under the sun and aside from the allure of the various historical figures, there is very little that distinguishes the heroes from the regular troops. The quests are very classic: destroy a village, find the missing troops, eliminate an enemy general and others that never shine for inventiveness and that are often received and carried out without even realizing it. The cracked shield If you have read up to here, you will surely have understood that Sparta: The Battle of Thermopylae is a title with a trivial design but which, if you love traditional RTSs, may like it, also by virtue of its excellent longevity (more than 20 hours). Unfortunately it is not possible to overlook some major defects that compromise the overall judgment. Firstly, the movement patterns of the troops which, in some cases, seem to come out of games more than ten years ago. Here at the beginning of the game our five men get stuck on the edges of a bridge. It seems that the brave Leonidas was able to stop a million Persians with three hundred men, but it also seems that he had great difficulty in taking the entrance to the most tortuous paths, often ending up walking empty against the rocks. At the beginning this gives few problems, but in the advanced levels, when there are many troops to manage, losing some along the way is annoying: it's not so much having one or two more troops in the fights, but it's the waste of time having to recover them saddens and frustrates. The pattern problem also emerges vigorously on other occasions, i.e. when there are too many men in the troop assembly points and the new ones, probably prey to ecstatic delirium, finding their place occupied, go for a walk around with the risk of run into some enemy group. Obviously this is an unforgivable defect in the middle of 2007, above all because it ruins some moments of the game which, otherwise, could have been exciting and also because it is not conceivable to see what works very well elsewhere not working. Let's take naval battles: ships are very large troops that handle themselves in the same way as others. Not bad if they worked properly. Unfortunately, it often seems that our orders produce unexpected and harmful effects: it is not nice to order a ship to attack an enemy vessel and see it leave for the ring road, then turn, then travel a short distance and, finally, get into position 'attack; also because in the meantime the enemies have not been watching and have riddled it with bullets.

Comment Sparta: The Battle of Thermopylae is a dull game that can be enjoyed by hardcore RTS fans, those who adore classic gameplay, and those who aren't chasing innovations. Everyone else can pretend it doesn't exist. Too bad for the bugs that compromise the final judgment, not completely sufficient. Pros Three distinct campaigns Well-tested gameplay Tough enough Cons Troop patterns to be redone Naval battles are laughable A little more variety would have been nice The Italian version The Italian version of Sparta: The Battle of Thermopylae is characterized by being completely translated into our language (both text and dialogues) and being the latest patched version of the game. The dubbing is of an excellent level as is the translation, and the bugs fixed thanks to the updates, combined with the competitive price at which the game is published in our country, earn it some votes compared to the international version to which the text of the article refers . However, most of the main defects remain, so the purchase must always be weighed and evaluated on the basis of what is expressed in the text. Sparta: The Battle of Thermopylae is available for PC. Let's start immediately by saying that Sparta: The Battle of Thermopylae (before Ancient Wars: Sparta) has nothing to do with the film of the screamed kick in the face and subsequent flight into the well, but the historical/mythological basis from which both start is the same. In reality, the Spartans are only one of the selectable peoples, and are used in the first of the three campaigns in which the game is divided (the others are the Egyptians and the Persians). We are dealing with one of the most classic RTS, in short, those in which you spend your time collecting resources and building buildings, with which to generate a large and powerful army that will allow us to destroy all the enemies hidden on the map, covered by the typical mist Black. The resources are: wood, which is obtained by cutting trees, food, which is obtained by cultivating the fields and gold, which is obtained by digging in the mines. To carry out the less noble jobs there is the classic production troop to be assigned to the various tasks. Handymen are produced from the Acropolis, the building that represents our power center, while military troops are trained from other buildings. The military troops are the only original note of this production: it will in fact be possible, through a simple and intuitive editor, to assign different equipment to each soldier, based on the weapons obtained in the shops. Obviously a club costs less than a sword but, equally obviously, it is less effective. Unfortunately, the costs of weapons and troops are very high and, until you get to the maps with more excavatable mines, it is difficult to raise a well-armed army, also because the enemies are decidedly aggressive and do not give much time to organize before attacking. The costs rise further if you want to equip each soldier with a horse, an activity that requires the construction of a special building with the relative monetary investment in fresh horses. Horses are used to speed up and harden troops, providing greater impact power during mass assaults.", "date": "2007-11-27", "grade": null}
