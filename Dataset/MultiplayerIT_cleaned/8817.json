In the case of Running With Scissors, however, the situation is different: Postal is the only franchise ever given birth by the team, and we can say without fear of contradiction that the reasons for its popularity (a film has also been made from it, moreover the best that the fearsome Uwe Boll has ever directed) are not to be found in the quality of the product, but in its being decidedly over the top as regards the topics covered and the visual violence. The first episode, released in 1997, saw us control the protagonist, Postal Dude, in an action context with an isometric view, in which our goal was simply to kill as many enemies as possible to go to the next level, without the minimum plot supplied. With the second episode, released in 2003, the team chose to transform everything into a first person shooter, providing the character with a certain freedom of action, pushing the accelerator even further on gratuitous violence and adding to the mix a humor of very low league, full of references to sex and racism. This actually made the series famous, albeit in the wrong way, so much so that Postal was even banned in some countries. Eight years have passed since then, and Running With Scissors has decided to once again change the shape of its creature, moving on to the third person shooter genre. Postal Dude finds himself stranded in the seemingly quiet town of Catharsis and has to do some work to raise the money needed to fill up his car and start again. The structure of Postal III is based precisely on the nature of these ~jobs~, assimilated to single and practically self-contained missions: suffice it to say that the first task we will find ourselves carrying out is to collect, using a vacuum cleaner, the paper handkerchiefs used by the customers in the ~masturbation booths~ of a large sex shop, then defend the shop from the onslaught of a group of angry feminists. And it's certainly not the lowest point of the game, in fact it's literally just the beginning. Going Postal One of the (few) strengths of Postal 2 was represented by the enormous number of weapons available to the protagonist, able to kill anyone in any way: from guns to swords, through ninja stars, hammers and flammable liquid, it was possible raging both on armed people and on unsuspecting passers-by, tearing them to pieces and possibly urinating on their corpses (here, let's hope that no one makes a comparison with the recent - and shameful - news stories concerning the Marine Corps). Most of these elements have been taken up for the third episode, and in fact using the mouse wheel it is possible to equip the most disparate tools, which this time include a laser pointer to incite the faithful pitbull Champ against the lower parts of an enemy, one pepper spray (using it on officers in riot gear clearly represents a quote from what happened to some protesters of the Occupy Wall Street movement), a heavy machete capable of tearing enemies to pieces, grenades, pistols, rifles and so on. Tanzen was here... The problem is that the scenic effect of most of the most imaginative weapons does not go hand in hand with their effectiveness, and the degree of difficulty of the game will force us to equip only the most reliable and effective tools, setting aside everything else . This is just one of the limits deriving from the almost total lack of balance of the new Running With Scissors production, which stands out in particular for the artificial intelligence of the opponents, equal to zero: the NPCs move following predetermined patterns, once alerted they simply come towards us and attack, however without flinching when we return fire, until they fall to the ground lifeless. If the flaw ends up being partially ~masked~ during firefights, it reveals itself in all its drama when we have to fight with our bare hands, highlighting one of the worst collision detection systems ever seen in a video game: Postal Dude throws punches in the air, the enemy moves as if nothing happened and we even have to chase him to keep hitting him. We'll have proof of actually hitting him when, after a series of jabs, he finally hits the ground. The very little sensation of impact is amplified by the lack of support for controllers: managing an action game in third person with mouse and keyboard is not in itself the best of life, and in this specific case the experience proves to be particularly frustrating, cumbersomeand badly made. ~I'm on the side of good!~ The developers have tried to insert an element of novelty by providing the player with the possibility of choosing between two different ~alignments~ from a certain point in the adventure, to be precise, being on the side of the police (and therefore facing enemies with non-lethal weapons) or side with the evil mayor Chomo (played by Ron Jeremy, a veteran of porn made in the USA) and with Uncle Dave, therefore using the classic arsenal without making too many problems if some civilians are killed. It goes without saying that the second option proves to be the most faithful to the philosophy that has always characterized Postal, as well as the least bad due to the high degree of difficulty. Beyond this factor, unfortunately, there is very little worth buying Postal III, currently on sale only on Direct2Drive and GameFly, at a price of 29.95 and $39.99 respectively (the on Steam, scheduled for the end of December, has been mysteriously delayed). It is in fact a very badly made title, very frustrating due to the poor combat system and non-existent artificial intelligence, with repetitive missions that involve the elimination of a certain number of targets or the defense of a specific subject, and which they differ only in the themes, each time more ~scabrous~ but unable to elicit the slightest smile, their level is so low. The only thing that is saved is the technical sector, powered by the tested Source engine (and therefore able to run even on low-medium range PCs), which offers a good amount of fairly well-crafted scenarios and characters (although most are clones of each other). On the other hand, the loading times are very long, while on the glitch front we point out the presence of a lot of more or less serious problems, to be solved through patches.", "date": "2012-01-16", "grade": "3.0"}
