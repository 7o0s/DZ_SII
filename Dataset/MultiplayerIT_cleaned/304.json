{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-12.html", "text": "Not a real evolution But let's now analyze the game in more detail, starting from what interests the enthusiast most, namely playability, the one that has always made the difference between the Konami title and the competition. Pes6 gameplay looks almost perfect. In some ways even better than the Japanese counterpart. It was enough to reduce the speed and recalibrate the physics of the impacts in some situations to obtain a more reasoned, interesting game system. The physics of the ball is different when compared to that of Pes5 or WE10, the ball appears heavier and more believable in the movement, in the rebounds, with the consequence that the shots and passes are even more real. The contrasts between the athletes are less excessive, they determine a smaller number of useless fouls (light hold-ups) called by the black jackets and therefore the game becomes less fragmented. The same control over the players is total, to the point that they respond more reactively and immediately to your commands, thanks also to the numerous new animations that allow our virtual darlings to perform a whole series of movements with each single pressure of the pad keys . Those of the goalkeepers are beautiful: the extreme defenders seem more confident and reactive than those, however valid, seen in WE10. Thanks to the aforementioned physics that manages the movements of the ball and the even more valid intelligence of the athletes, the various phases of the game during the match offer an excellent level of challenge. During the construction of the action, for example, the players move lucidly. Ditto when they have to go to conclude. The multiple shooting solutions once again allow the user to decide practically ~entirely~ where and how to kick the ball, i.e. whether inside or outside, toe or full neck, with the simple pressure of the Cross Directional in the right place. And the exact direction. With a less evident CPU influence than in Pes5, but more similar to that of the Japanese version. So almost nothing. Same for headers. Now if you manage to soar high with your man by catching up with the opposing defender, you will be able to perform more precise headers, but watch out for holds that can throw you off balance. Grim defenses The teams controlled by the CPU in turn move in a very credible way, according to the schemes adopted by their respective real counterparts (Arsenal, for example, play exactly as it happens in reality and are difficult to deal with, especially if they start on the counterattack - Ed -), of the elements that make up the squad (a poor team will hardly try to impose their game but will take care of defending) and of the situations that occur during the match. Just think, it can happen that towards the ninetieth minute, the opponent's attacker starts wasting time protecting the ball near the corner flag, or that he starts playing along with his teammates in midfield. Or that the coach managed by the CPU brings out a striker and enters a midfielder to cover himself more by changing the scheme. In the defensive phase, the players react more convincingly to the dangerous situations that appear in front of them than in the previous title of the series. Their AI has undergone notable interventions and now more than ever the defenders appear more attentive in marking, in anticipating and in sensibly reading the opponent's offensive action, ready to intervene to help their partner in difficulty, in doubling, or to close on the cross by positioning himself well between the ball and the opposing attacker. As for shots, when we control a player in the defensive phase, depending on his position, the pressure of the X key and the point of the D-pad on the pad that he ~touches~, he will perform a different movement, intervene in semi-slide, elbow, hold. But beware of fouls and free kicks that arise from them: the various Ronaldinho or Beckam are always lurking. Let's challenge each other online In this sense, the introduction of a new feature is interesting, that of the free-kick taken quickly. Immediately after the referee's whistle, just press the R1+L1 keys simultaneously to make the player closest to the ball throw it on the ground and kick it forward towards a teammate. Just like it happens in reality. We haven't talked about the various game modes of Pes6 up to now, also because by now we already know them and globally they are always the same. So we will quickly point out the most interesting ones. These include the unprecedented ~International Challenge~, which will allow you to play the entire qualifying round for the World Cup with your favorite national team, and the ~Random match~ which allows the user to chooseQuickly to the CPU before a match a lineup drawn from the staff of three selected teams. For example, if you choose Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid, the CPU will immediately form a team made up of the best players from these teams. And online gaming. The network game offers for the first time the possibility of challenging PC users on the same servers, in addition to those who own the Sony Monolith. Furthermore, the mode includes matches for up to 8 players via the web (four more than the previous edition), and other goodies, such as being able to create your own very personal ~clan~ with which to play a tournament, or the ~Assist~ mode, which allows you to watch the games played by others as in front of the TV. The only flaw, to date, is the difficult login to the servers, probably very full, which require users a lot of patience and connection attempts, waiting for Konami to solve the problem. The Pes6 graphics have not undergone any upheavals, and on the other hand it could not be otherwise since the engine is always the same. However, the good things we had already seen in the last edition are now being presented to us even further and improved. The television cut given to the event by the KTYO team, from the race presentation phases to the interlude between one action and another during the matches, makes the title in question visually splendid. A real match The players are faithfully recreated, in height, weight, physical structure, way of running or kicking, each one is different from the other. Stuff that the competition can't even dream of. Ibrahimovic, just to give an example, is now equal to his real counterpart, given that the polygonal model of his face has been recreated from scratch on the real one, with all the imperfections of the case... Furthermore, dozens of new faces have been added like those of Zaccardo, Barzagli, Blasi, Barone and Chiellini, just to stay in the national arena, or that of the new Argentine Phenomenon of Barcelona Leo Messi. The stadiums are beautiful, structurally perfect and with an audience that in some facilities is strangely spread across the stands, but which when framed in close-up, with its scarves around its neck, its billboards and jumps, totally immerses the player in the atmosphere of a real game. Also noteworthy are the choreographies that the fans themselves stage in the most important matches, just before taking the field, and which range from the classic smoke bombs to the composition of phrases of encouragement for their favorites or the gigantic display of the emblem of their team. Too bad that the same quality has not been reserved for the audio sector. Once again sound effects, buzzes from the audience and various atmospheric background sounds sadly echo the anonymous choirs that are absolutely poor and not up to par with such a well-finished production. It is not clear why KTYO persists in not wanting to put real or at least credible bend ~songs~. And least of all we understand why, but in this case the ~problem~ must be sought elsewhere, not in the Japanese sofcto, we continue to rely on Marco Civoli and Mauro Sandreani for the soporific commentary of the matches. A Caressa or the usual Bruno Longhi I don't think the public would mind and in fact, they would further raise the quality of a splendid title anyway. Comment Also this year the Pro Evolution Soccer series did not want to deny itself: this is the ~real~ game of football that can be played from... the armchair at home. The umpteenth (semi) evolution of an increasingly realistic title. In fact, Konami has once again managed to improve what already seemed perfect. These are not epochal changes as mentioned in the review, but ~simple~ tweaks, where necessary. But then why not give it full marks? Simple, because after so many years and so many versions of the game, we believe that KTYO can and should do more, the time has come to refresh some aspects of the gameplay, to complete it through additional game options, licenses, real competitions and so on. While waiting for all this, the sixth chapter of the most loved football saga by gamers from all over the world still proves worthy of maintaining the scepter of King of football simulations, with the plus of online sharing between PS2 and PC. And as we already wrote on the occasion of the WE10 review, in life there are very few certainties. One of these is Pes. Pros: Gameplay improved further. Online shared between PS2 and PC. increasingly sophisticated AI. Cons: Absence of licenses for some leagues. Choirs and commentary not up to par. The Bundesliga is missing. Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the PlayStation 2 version and the online game provides the possibility to challenge users of the PC and PlayStation versionstion 2 between them. For the review of the Xbox 360 version, follow this link. ~October: wine and cellar from evening to morning~ says an old popular saying. October, we add, is the ~bridge~ month between Summer and Autumn, between the end of the beautiful sunny days and the arrival of those equally beautiful for some, cold. There are two important appointments for the football fan in this period: the Champions League, which has entered one of its hottest phases, and the arrival on the shelves of our shops of the undisputed King of football simulations for consoles: Pro Evolution Soccer. The sixth (western) chapter of the KTYO football saga gains this year in certain respects, but loses in other respects. While on the one hand we have in fact a respectable gameplay and the acquisition of new licenses such as the one inherent to the entire French championship, Ligue 1, which adds to the now traditional Serie A, Eredivisie and Liga, each of which complete with rosters, logos and official shirts of the current football season for all the teams participating (only a few errors in the squad, such as Amauri who does not play for Palermo, but for Chievo), and various international teams such as Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, England, Italy, Manchester United, etc, Chelsea (unlicensed, now has a fake name) and the German championship literally disappear! That's right, for a mysterious, inexplicable reason, the Bundesliga, one of the most important tournaments in the world is no longer part of the football leagues playable in Pes. The only German team available in the DB of the game is Bayern Munich, present, with official shirts and logos, among the clubs of the Rest of the world. In this section we also find Juventus: despite the upheavals of this summer, Konami have not forgotten the importance and prestige of this club in the world and the enormous number of fans it has scattered around the globe, therefore, while not obviously being among the Serie A teams, the black and white lineup has not been cancelled.", "date": "2006-11-01", "grade": null}
