Let's see if this MySims Racing will fall into one of these two categories, or if it will go beyond this fluctuating trend in some way. Between saying and doing The basic concept of MySims Racing is anything but specious: the idea is to combine the Mario Kart arcade play structure with the unmistakable style and ~social~ and personalization features typical of the series inaugurated on Wii. In the middle there is also a sketch of a storyline, however of a negligible nature from every point of view. Speaking of the actual game, MySims Racing could only start with the character creation screen: you can change skin color, hair, clothing and so on, even if the editor denotes the problems already highlighted in the previous ones franchise releases. The decision to base it entirely on icons makes it as intuitive as it is uncomfortable, when one is forced to follow the predefined pattern of selections before arriving at the desired element. However, the customization options of the EA product primarily affect the car being driven, which can belong to three distinct families (compact, medium or large) differing in road holding, acceleration and top speed: regardless of this choice, the The user will be able to buy new parts or get them as a reward for some victories, and then install them on his vehicle -alas always through the cumbersome menus mentioned above- modifying its performance or look. If the first aspect is self-explanatory, the second deserves special mention, given that the customization rate is truly remarkable: beyond the color and the decals that embellish the bodywork, you can literally indulge yourself in the construction of the car, producing authentic monsters on four wheels as well as improbable gimmicks equipped with all kinds of ridiculous gadgets. Too bad that a just sufficient technical realization debases everything a bit: even if one certainly could not expect a masterpiece in graphic terms, MySims Racing proves to be really flat, with empty and anonymous scenarios, too stylized cars and characters and special effects cut to the bone. It could be said that the minimal style that worked very well in MySims Kingdom therefore turns out to be substantially unsuitable for a racing game, however arcade and disengaged. Turbo missions On the purely playful front, MySims racing does not always manage to correctly translate some good conceptual intuitions into gameplay terms. This is the case, for example, of the game map, devoid of any function that goes beyond simple aesthetics: EA has decided to limit the information on the screen to a minimum in order to meet the casual public, however making it made this section useless. Even the well-known social aspect - inevitable in a member of the large Sims family - appears incredibly sketchy here, with a ~likeability factor~ of the NPCs that grows hand in hand with the victories in the competitions related to them, but on which the user does not has real decision-making freedom. Even speaking of missions, the sensation is that of a mixed bag: however commendable the intention of the developers to diversify the races by adding particular objectives, these are resolved in most cases in simple time attacks or in scenarios that require collection of a certain number of objects within a limited time. It's a pity that the outline of MySims Racing is not quite up to the convincing driving model, capable of entertaining without great pretensions: the car responds promptly to the user's commands (especially if you take advantage of the Nunchuck + Remote combo), and the The inevitable presence of turbo and various power-ups to be exploited to your advantage are both aspects which contribute to making the rides quite lively. The fact that the tracks are covered with colored essences to be collected and then used as a bargaining chip in the phases of purchase or upgrade of new parts for your car is also fairly original. The main problem of MySims Racing, however, is that it is basically a product with little soul: the track design is fluctuating, the level of challenge is minimal, the game modes - including multiplayer - fall within the classic canons of the genre. In short, while undoubtedly pleasant, the EA title struggles to find una own identity, and this is a major obstacle for a product that relies entirely on immediate appeal. Not to mention that, of course, those who have always snubbed or resented the MySims series will certainly not change their minds thanks to this latest release.", "date": "2009-06-18", "grade": "6.7"}
