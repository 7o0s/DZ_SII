Interest in the title is still high and this DLC is an ideal investment for those who have already played the single player campaign. However, the approach here is significantly different. If in the Arkane Studios title the emphasis was placed on the story and the free roaming elements, in this case we are faced with a series of challenges completely detached from any narrative context, if we exclude the specious incipit that forms the context for each mission. Therefore, no story and all action, a factor that naturally places this content at the end of the main campaign. But let's see what it is. The thief, the murderer and the warrior Let's go back again in the role of Crovo Attano, engaged in ten levels divided into four types of game that substantially amplify the characteristics of the base game. It begins with the search for specific objects to steal in a villa, and then in the identification of a target to assassinate. This second test in particular makes it necessary to discover a series of clues capable of leading us to our victim, while the peremptory condition of acting in the shadows elevates one of the most exciting aspects of Dishonored, that of its superfine stealth mechanics, to the highest levels. The maps, although less free than the campaign, are always widely interpretable in terms of level design, a factor that therefore makes them decidedly replayable. The next two phases focus on combat mechanics, adapting them to decidedly out of the ordinary modes. It is essentially the old horde system that forces us to face an ever-increasing and dangerous number of opponents, but the analogies stop there. In Dishonored - Dunwall City Trials it is necessary to make the best use of the resources made available, in addition to the exploitation of any hostilities between the enemies themselves, the recovery of objects in the arena and the style with which we kill the opponents, practically essential for obtaining high scores in the end of each session. Very little is left to chance. This peculiarity opens up the universe of online rankings, in pure style of digital delivery titles, offering the possibility of comparing one's own results with those of friends. There is obviously no shortage of new objectives to increase trophies and player score. Observer in the shadows More action with the Puzzle mode, where the aim is to kill a series of enemies while keeping the combo chain active, i.e. without allowing enough time to interrupt the multiplier. Even more interesting is the variant, where we have the option to observe the scenario before acting, in order to plan the perfect strategy. The latest missions force our friend Corvo to face a series of paths where the aim is to reach the finish line within the set time, or to reach specific check points. These stages enhance the purely acrobatic aspect of the game, curiously bringing it closer to another exponent full of personality and style, Mirror's Edge, even if they are significantly weaker. The variants introduced in advanced difficulties, unlockable once the missions are completed, are in any case capable of dramatically raising the bar of the challenge. Dishonored - Dunwall City Trials is an excellently crafted content that smells genuine and does nothing but confirm the talent of Arkane Studios. The level design is more channeled than the base game, but shares the exciting variables in such a way as to always be fresh, no small factor in such a controversial market as that of additional content. The low price (about 5 ) is the proverbial icing on the cake that convinces us to recommend the DLC without reservations, waiting for those that await us next year, certainly richer in terms of content and able to recover the narrative aspect that we loved so much in the main campaign.", "date": "2012-12-27", "grade": null}
