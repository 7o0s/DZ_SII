An idea prior to Accel Word, but subsequently created for editorial reasons, the series of short novels shows no sign of losing ground or reaching a definitive conclusion. Thanks to the serial setting on one side and the idea of interactive virtual worlds on the other, it could potentially last an eternity. After the planetary explosion conquered through two animated series of questionable production value, the videogame iterations certainly could not be missing. So here we are, a year after Lost Song, at the judgment of what is the fourth main title in the series, Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization. Let's go back to playing Kirito in the new title dedicated to Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization There is always death wherever you connect For those who have lived in the clouds in recent years, Sword Art Online - better known as SAO - bases its key concept on one of the most abused ideas of the last fifteen years of fiction, adding that pinch of Japanese ~nerdance~ that never hurts . We find ourselves in a world in which virtual reality has reached its maximum limit, with the possibility of totally immersing yourself in a videogame dimension and taking possession of a virtual body. Leaving aside the explanation of all the various narrative arcs released so far, what is important to know is that the basic incipit concerns the creation of software within which players are trapped until the game is completed. Forcibly removing hardware from the head in the real world, or killing it in-game itself, leads to real-world death via a microwave-like electrical shock to the brain. Between fights to the death, love stories and embarrassing dialogues, the protagonist Kirito and his friends manage to escape from Sword Art Online. From here start a series of narrative cycles always based on different games and situations on the borderline between reality and fiction. Hollow Realization, for its part, is the first title to base its cycle within a totally new game. Kirito and his companions are to all intents and purposes beta testers of Sword Art: Origins, a new VRMMORPG based aesthetically on the progenitor but within which it is not real people who die forever, but the non-player characters, who are then reset and replaced from new iterations modified in body and ~mind~. The whole main campaign, which will take you between thirty and forty hours, moves around the presence of a non-player character unable to complete his quest, because he is deprived of all his programming data. As crazy and demented as the pretext may seem, it is easy to understand how the protagonists' attachment to this artificial intelligence is not so dissimilar from those felt for real people. Don't expect the best storyline in the history of Japanese RPGs, but fans of the title will certainly know how to enjoy it. Playstation 4 trophies The road to the coveted platinum will be tougher than expected. With the simple closure of the main quest, the percentage will certainly not satisfy trophy hunters, who will easily have to reach triple figures in terms of hours, if only because of the affinity with all friends. 44 bronzes, 6 silvers and 2 golds is the total number of awards to collect to have the most important trophies! Too bad you also have to play It's when the title abandons the cutscenes and requires you to use a pad to continue that a series of almost insurmountable problems arise. The writer grew up on bread and JRPG, or at least responds to that stereotype of the Westerner sick of Japanese culture to the point of going beyond all the defects and woodiness that the genre has been carrying around for at least a decade. Hollow Realization succeeds in the incredible feat of importing a number of combat and party management mechanics, but they never mix in the right way during the entire span of your game. Going in order: the fights are managed by pressing the square button for what concerns the classic slash. Alongside this, you can chain a number of skills together with your other AI-managed party members. Everything is quite simple and fun, at least until the impossibility of managing the party's equipment and skills in the best possible way. To have full access to the management of companions it is necessary to increase our affinity withthem via a series of minigames. These hopelessly bring the title closer to the dating simulators so dear to the friends of the Rising Sun. While it may be fun to chat and stroll with one of your favorites once or twice, realizing the grueling time required to reach a rank of five with all the characters is more than daunting. What comes out of it is the total abandonment of the hopes of managing all the paraphernalia. This will certainly not preclude you from advancing along the campaign, but will make everything decidedly more anonymous and less immersive. As if that weren't enough, leaving out the bosses at the end of the area - managed like real MMO raid bosses with lots of additional teams in tow - the rest will soon translate into the repeated pressing of the attack button, alternating with that of the skills to create some combos capable of dealing more damage than normal. All this is a great shame, considering some good ideas grafted into the title: such as skill chains or the possibility of putting the so-called ~palette~ on the screen. The latter translates into a series of free slots in which to insert objects and skills useful in combat, along the lines of the more classic MMOs. God Save Multiplayer! Let's spend a few words also regarding the multiplayer mode. From the main menu it is possible to enter a real lobby screen in which to create a private game, search for one according to specific parameters such as the level or the region or leave the choice of the quick game to the game. Each group of players is made up of four members and it goes without saying that being able to complete hundreds of identical hunting tasks together with other real people makes it surprisingly more bearable. Cross-gen is nice, but not so much From a purely technical point of view Hollow Realization looks like a title strongly close to the last generation. It is clear that its nature as a double version - the one for Playstation Vita also being present complete with Cross-Save - has not allowed the developers to push much on the polygonal aspect, but what we are faced with is sometimes bleak for lack of detail and very low resolution textures. The same cannot be said of the artistic sphere which is instead able to give rather interesting glimpses, both outdoors and inside some dungeons. The sixty frames per second often clash with unsustainable aliasing and the lighting certainly doesn't reach the average of current titles, but at least the models of the protagonists are faithful and pleasant to look at. We have not had the opportunity to test the version for Sony's portable console, but we are ready to bet on the fact that the small screen size and the panel of the Japanese jewel can easily improve the visual impact that the title leaves to the players.", "date": "2016-11-18", "grade": "6.8"}
