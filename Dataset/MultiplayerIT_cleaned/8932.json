{"name": "To the Moon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95522-to-the-moon-voglio-la-luna.html", "text": "The panorama of independent developers has accustomed us to witnessing the arrival of real gems over time: above all, just think of two examples such as Limbo and Bastion, able to offer decidedly interesting ideas, both from the gameplay point of view and from the stylistic one, taking advantage of the freedom granted by this slice of the market to those who are not obliged to deal with demanding publishers and exaggerated(n)ti sales numbers. In recent months, among the many titles in development in the indie scene, To The Moon has aroused a lot of interest (thanks also to a well-chosen launch trailer), created by the studio called Freebird Games led by Kan Gao and presented to us as a mix between role-playing and adventure game, driven by retro-style graphics. To The Moon has arrived on the market just in these days, and is sold on the website of the same developers at the price of 11.28. Money well spent? Reminding you that on the aforementioned site there is also the possibility of trying the game for an hour, and thus leaving the final decision up to you, let's find out together. The last wish Let's face it: the stories told within video games, however good they may be, always remain ~video game~. Especially in recent years, more and more developers have preferred to favor other aspects of greater impact for the mass of the public, making sure that (with a few exceptions) even the best video game plot could be embarrassed by the one told by a film or a book even mid-level. To The Moon tries to make this last statement a little less true, making history its strong point: Neil Watts and Eva Rosalene are two scientists from Sigmund Corp, a company specializing in giving people on the verge of death a ~ second chance~, entering their minds to trigger a series of cascading memories of facts that didn't actually take place, but thanks to which they can grant a last minute free from regrets before their departure. Through the eyes of the two characters controlled by us, we therefore know what the real protagonist of the game is: Johnny, an elderly widower who has now reached his last moments of life and eager to go to the moon. Thanks to the machine they have, Neil and Eva then begin a journey back into Johnny's memories, starting from the last chronologically available up to his youth, where to proceed with the graft of the last wish. In what we can define as a mixture of the various Inception, Memento and Se Mi Lasci Ti Cancello, the story of the elderly man will prove to be full of twists and turns, inevitably involving the two doctors (and above all the player) also from an emotional point of view . Role playing game? Although the graphics of To The Moon may evoke that of a Final Fantasy from the golden age of Super Nintendo, giving hope for a real role-playing game, the reality is quite different: in fact, Freebird's fatigue shares no other with what may be the classic canons of this genre, which means no experience points, no level advancement and no choice to make, if not purely marginal and not decisive for the purposes of the story. Wanting to place this game in a category, we could then insert it among the graphic adventures, but even in this case the comparison with a Monkey Island would risk not doing justice to To The Moon: although there is occasionally a puzzle, some classic adventure puzzles there is no trace here. We have an inventory, but it's limited. We have some elements to unlock to move forward, but it all boils down to going around Johnny's memories in search of links (not so hidden) between the memories related to the various phases of his life. There are puzzles and minigames like the one where we can even ~shoot~ zombies, but they're completely marginal to the game's economy. On balance, To The Moon can be defined as an interactive story, mainly driven by the element we described in the upper paragraph: its story, capable of keeping the player literally glued to his seat. The plot of this game is in fact written and told in a way that borders on perfection, leaving very little to guess what will happen with unexpected twists but above all touching the heart of those who are in front of the screen. Neil and Eva are the perfect representation of the strange couple: he is cynical and always ready to make a joke, she is determined to do her job, in a relationship made up of continuous question and answer which also contributes to lighten the more dramatic moments from which the tale. The whole forcourse of the game then contains a series of quotes from movies, other games and TV series (phenomenal above all the one from How I Met Your Mother) which will hardly leave lovers of goodies of this type indifferent. Long live 16-bit As you know by now, the graphic style of To The Moon is the unmistakable one of many ~Japanese-style~ RPGs of the glorious 16-bit period. Even if we imagine that this may not go down well with everyone, Freebird's choice also proves to be right in giving the game that extra touch of nostalgia, also guaranteed by the choice not to resort to dubbing to create dialogues, relying on the old-fashioned way of written texts. The soundtrack is also simply applause, able to accompany the game perfectly throughout its duration, helping to properly define the different moments that we find ourselves experiencing: the various original compositions were created mainly with the use of the piano by Kan Gao himself and by Laura Shigihara, already ~heard~ at work in Plants vs Zombies. Ready to bet that the main reason will remain indelibly in your head for a long time.", "date": "2011-11-17", "grade": "9.0"}
