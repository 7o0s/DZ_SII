{"name": "Kao the Kangaroo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kao-the-kangaroo-recensione.html", "text": "The past of video games is full of mothballed characters who have been featured in a handful of moderately appealing titles and have since been forgotten. Many didn't even achieve negative results, but not such numbers as to withstand the exponential increase in production costs that has occurred in recent years. So they rest motionless forever in sarcophagi of memories displayed in the great virtual cemetery that makes up the history of video games, celebrated by the lamentations of the most stoic fans as objects of worship and regret. However, it happens from time to time that someone manages to return from the realm of the dead and has a second chance, as demonstrated by the review of Kao the Kangaroo, the game you don't expect that arrived at the right time to give you some joy. 3D platformer The levels of Kao the Kangaroo are very varied Kao the Kangaroo has never been a very prominent character. It had its notoriety in the early years of the new millennium, especially in Poland where the first chapter, published for Windows and Dreamcast, sold very well. Two sequels and a spin-off were produced, which landed it on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, GBA and PSP, but after 2006 it was never heard of again. Yet in some countries they continued to love it, so much so that Tate Multimedia, the developer of the original series, decided to revitalize the franchise under the pressure of community requests. Evidently years dedicated only to motorcycle stunt games, made very well moreover, must have made the entire studio feel a certain nostalgia for the boxer kangaroo. Let's start from the basics: Kao the Kangaroo is a completely new chapter in the series (so no remastering or remake), in which some of the characters from the previous chapters return, but which can also be played without knowing them. It's a pure 3D platformer. It is to the point of being almost cheeky in some moments. At the beginning of the game, the young marsupial sets off in search of his father Koby and his sister Kaia, who have disappeared who knows where and who knows why. Her mother doesn't really agree, but she can't help it. Ours is accompanied by his martial arts master, Walt, and by a pelican particularly versed with mechanics, Gadget, who has the task of repairing and driving the vehicle that allows movement between the various connecting areas, those from which access the actual levels. The latter are variations on the theme of their reference biome. For example, when Kao reaches the frozen mountain, he has to face levels full of Tibetan-style buildings, but also ice racing and ravines, fighting in the meantime against anthropomorphic goats led by a particularly spiteful kind of holy lady. In the jungle, however, the enemies will be monkeys and the levels will be full of lush vegetation, as well as waterways. In total there are four biomes, for a dozen large levels. Objects The game world is filled with items to collect The progression in Kao the Kangaroo is very linear: each level is accessible only after collecting a certain number of magical runes, which allow you to break through the barriers to access. The runes are found in the hub areas and in the levels themselves and are distributed in such a way that only one level can be unlocked at a time. Other items to collect during exploration are coins, which are used to buy bonuses in the shops of the connecting areas (pieces of heart to increase the character's health, extra lives, and so on), diamonds and the letters that form the name of the protagonist. Normally diamonds, stones and letters are well hidden and in the long run they become the main drive to replay the levels, at least the ones where you haven't found everything. Around the maps there are also special accesses, which lead to bonus stages, useful for obtaining more diamonds and for collecting some extra coins, as well as for testing yourself (they are on average more difficult than the regular levels). These challenges, when unlocked, become accessible directly from the link areas, so you can repeat them at will. Gameplay Looks like something out of the late 90's/early 2000's In terms of gameplay, Kao the Kangaroo is a very classic platformer. So expect to hop from platform to platform, hanging from ledges and using a few slides to run around the levels. There are secret walls, not very visible passages, tunnels in which to roll, bodies of water to overcome by hanging on magical ropes, barrels to avoid and all the rest of the sample that can be expected from such a game. Are you thereThere are also some more peculiar mechanics, which take advantage of Kao's eternal gloves (we won't reveal anything about them because they are closely linked to the main plot) to offer real puzzles, very simple in most cases, but at sometimes quite challenging (although without ever becoming impossible). So Kao can activate stones that create energy fields that make some ethereal objects (usually platforms) tangible, he can use boomerangs to hit buttons and distant enemies and, above all, he can collect spheres of fire, ice and wind that give his boxing gloves their powers. For example, the spheres of fire allow you to melt the ice or to free the passages from the cobwebs, as well as to light the ovens and activate the platforms. Ice balls, on the other hand, allow you to freeze water, while wind balls are used to pull objects. The three powers are intertwined throughout the levels, some of which have entire sections built around them. Combat system The combat system is very simple Having spoken of enemies in the other paragraphs should have made you understand that from time to time you also fight. After all, Kao is a boxer and wears sentient boxing gloves, so it's also right that he shakes his hands. Actually the combat system is the simplest part of the game. We don't call it weak because, in its essentiality, it fits well with the rest of the gameplay. Furthermore, playing it becomes clear that the developers wanted to give priority to the platform part, given that the clashes are often less present. In any case, beating is equivalent to punching the snout of enemies with the repeated pressure of a key, dodging when necessary. After several successful hits in sequence, it is possible to use a super move that literally wipes out enemies and which becomes more powerful if spheres have been absorbed. The enemies of them have quite basic attack patterns. There are also some puzzles, very simple Usually they just attack Kao head on, without producing who knows what tactics. However, there are also opponents who attack from a distance and other bigger ones that require many hits to go down. In general, it's a basic system and very easy to master, so much so that throughout the game we never died fighting, except against the bosses. The latter are bigger and badder enemies with more structured attack patterns, placed at the end of the visit to a biome. Compared to normal enemies they are more demanding, but even they do not offer too complex a challenge, since it takes very little to understand their attack patterns and react accordingly. In reality, it would not have made much sense to make them very difficult, given the setting of the experience, designed as it is to flow as smoothly as possible. Of our own we have taken them as yet another variation on the theme, that is, as another way found by the developers to make the gameplay more varied. From this point of view they do their job perfectly. Immersed in the past From a technical point of view Kao the Kangaroo is without infamy and without praise. Compared to the previous chapters, Kao's model is more beautiful and detailed (God forbid), the levels are larger and more colorful and the enemies are more varied. On the other hand, it can be seen that the team was unable to take advantage of infinite resources, especially in the animations and in the modest interludes. Everything has a strongly classic flavor, a flavor that becomes stronger when you meet the numerous quotes from the classics of the genre scattered throughout the levels. Yes, because whoever made Kao the Kangaroo knows well the 3D platformers of the late 90s and early years of the new millennium. It contains Super Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot, Rayman 2, Spyro and all that slovenly and good-natured cheerfulness that characterized many characters born in those years, children of a great enthusiasm and an equally great illusion. It's the perfect game for a retrotopic society that struggles enormously to find anything interesting in the present, other than trying to re-enact the past. And the problem is that it works. The biomes are varied, but all too predictable There is a desire to talk bad about it, because the camera occasionally throws a tantrum, making the action unreadable (not very often, fortunately), here and there there are some annoying glitches, which on a couple of occasions forced us to restart the levels, and from a stylistic point of view we are facing the creativity fair on sale, but despite everything we cannot say bad things because overall we liked it, and not even a little. It's one of those self-aware titles chand flaunt their limitations instead of trying to hide them. The levels are varied, designed with great skill and offer always new challenges and mechanics until the end of the adventure. Moreover, as already mentioned, they are full of secrets to discover and objects to collect, which never cause the saturation effect to take over. The duration of about ten hours also helps in this, net of replayability (for completionists it will certainly last a few more hours), which includes all the funniest activities and does not include broth extensions made of tasks to be repeated to exhaustion. You go through all the biomes, if you want you can repeat the levels or challenges in which you haven't found everything, but you go on and you get to the end without feeling any tiredness. Sure, there's nothing really amazing, also considering that we're talking about a medium-small production, but there's still the great satisfaction of having been able to live the experience without it oppressing you in any way.
