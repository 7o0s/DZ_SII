Today comes the new guy: he calls himself Pliffy D, but even if he's a bit snooty he seems really smart; apparently he is a game designer, and he will be working on our new game for PlayStatus 2 together with Shigeto Minamoto. We have to move though, because the Christmas holidays are around the corner, fans are waiting impatiently and the game is still full of bugs to fix. Once you start a game of Game Dev Story for iPhone it's really hard not to get carried away. The management of the Japanese Kairosoft team starts from a premise that has never been seriously explored: the player is the head of a video game development team, and will have to reach the top of the market by creating quality products, advertising campaigns, participating in events and winning prizes. In short, the dream of all those video game enthusiasts who have never been able to write a line of code. Curiosity Those who don't have an iPhone or are looking for a more complex experience than what Game Dev Story offers should take a look at GameBiz. It is a management system in which you are the head of a development team, characterized by a rather questionable graphical interface, but also by an unparalleled completeness and depth. GameBiz 3 has been on sale for the last few days, but older versions can still be downloaded for free. From the bedroom to E3 Those who have played the management classics by Bullfrog will probably find more than one element in common in Game Dev Story. In particular, the game strongly recalls that perfect alchemy between a sense of humor, simplicity and completeness that characterized titles such as Theme Hospital. Starting from a small office and a few thousand dollars in the wallet, it will be necessary to hire the personnel necessary to develop the first game of the newborn company. This is how you scroll through the list of candidates: there is a good programmer, a poor artist and a not bad designer; each of them, thanks to their own skills, will be able to lend a more or less relevant hand in the realization of the project. Once everything is ready, it is finally necessary to choose the genre and the type of game to make, bearing in mind that some combinations will marry much better than others: an RPG with a fantasy setting has more chances of success than a dating game in the Second World War. At this point it will be up to choosing the platform on which to develop the project, and here things start to get quite interesting. In fact, Game Dev Story traces the last twenty years of the history of the video game industry, proposing it again in the form of a hilarious parody: it starts from the first computers, to then see almost all the main portable and home consoles announced. The names of companies, games and platforms have been revised, but are entirely traceable to the originals; the Game Boy thus becomes the Game Kid and Microsoft is now Microx. However, in addition to the order in which the consoles are launched, the developers have also chosen to keep the success they have had at a market level consistent, which, on the one hand, makes it even more pleasant to relive these twenty years from the inside , on the other it means that the player can easily predict big deals and flops: no one will be foolish enough to develop a game for the Virtual Boy (sorry, Virtual Kid), while immediately supporting the equivalents of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could lead to large revenues . Game Dev Story is intuitive, accessible to anyone right away, yet it is surprising how much meat there is on the fire: from time to time a company could hold a press conference and announce a new console to the public, old platforms are withdrawn from market after some time, while video game fairs are excellent opportunities to advertise your products. There are also the annual awards, in which a jury awards the best games of the year in the various categories. During the development of a project, however, the player will never remain idle: in fact, he will have to train his employees in order to cultivate their skills, buy the development kits of the various consoles, send announcements and look for new personnel , keep an eye on the market trend and continuously invest in advertising. In fact, it is essential to keep the interest of fans high, create hype and see players line up days before the game is released, while sales can also increase thanks to good reviews in specialized magazines. And again, making a sequel to a successful game means already starting with a good chance that the gioco venda, while the player can decide whether to invest everything in an ambitious project or to create small titles in a very short time, until a sufficiently large budget has been reached to be able to create and market his own console. Unfortunately there are small inconsistencies or aspects that clash with real facts: it is indeed strange to see that the first employee of a small indie team is a secretary, where deadlines are not imposed and sales drop if you decide to specialize in a single genre.
