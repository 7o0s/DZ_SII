In fact, there are not a few who consider it very simply the best Final Fantasy ever. For new players who were introduced to the series thanks to its success in the era of the first PlayStation, Final Fantasy was a sci-fi RPG. Those who followed the Square Enix work from the time of the NES knew very well that Final Fantasy IX was not only a return to the origins, but also represented the quintessence of the brand: medieval kingdoms, bizarre anthropomorphic creatures, fixed professions and simple and intuitive mechanics. .. It was those characteristics that made Final Fantasy special and that shone in that revival between two generations. Not to mention that Final Fantasy IX had Vivi and the other Final Fantasy did not. For all these reasons, Final Fantasy IX would have deserved a remastered version with all the trappings, a re-edition in a grand style like that of Final Fantasy XII. Instead, only the lazy PC conversion released on Steam last year arrived on PlayStation 4 with its few merits and many defects. The melodies of life Rivers of words have already been spent on Final Fantasy IX in at least two reviews and several specials, so it is useless to review it again. Let's summarize everything like this: if you haven't played it, drop any other title you're on right now and fix it. Square Enix, for better or for worse, now allows you to solve the problem even if you only own a PlayStation 4, so take advantage of it. Why should you play Final Fantasy IX? Let's see... as we said above, it's the title in which the two souls of Final Fantasy coexist perfectly: the traditionalist and the pioneering one. It is a JRPG that tells a great love story and investigates the meaning of life. The protagonist is not a curmudgeon: Cloud and Squall fans don't want them, but Gidan's optimism and cheerfulness are contagious and make the adventure even more fun, as if a varied cast made up of really funny characters like Steiner and Quina. It is also the favorite Final Fantasy of Hironobu Sakaguchi, who created the series, and Nobuo Uematsu, the longtime composer, once said that the music of Final Fantasy IX is the best he has ever written. Those reasons should be enough to give him a chance. Even the plot is surprising and full of twists and turns, starting with a daring prologue in which the villain Gidan takes advantage of a theatrical performance to kidnap Princess Garnet. In reality, the latter turns out to be happy to leave the castle, wrong-footing the protagonist and starting an incredible adventure in which our heroes will discover themselves and the mysteries of the planet Gaia. In Final Fantasy IX we laugh and cry, get angry and moved: it is a tidal wave of emotions that closes in a clear and transparent ending that leaves no room for doubts or interpretations. Playstation 4 trophies There are 52 trophies up for grabs with Final Fantasy IX: in addition to platinum, we count 3 gold, 4 silver and 44 bronze. Obviously you will have to complete the game and each minigame, but also collect numerous collectibles and reach special goals: are you ready to jump rope a thousand times? It took more effort In the face of such lavish praise, it's easy to see why this remastered edition has disappointed us so much. Beyond the price, not particularly outrageous but not cheap either, the PlayStation 4 edition of Final Fantasy IX drags along the same, identical problems encountered a year ago on PC. It is a hasty and listless conversion: the developer has simply transplanted the code and, with it, every little flaw. It's embarrassing that the music tracks still start over after each fight, forcing the player to stand still if they want to listen to the splendid soundtrack, or that certain glitches have remained where we left them a year ago or, worse still, in 2000. The juxtaposition between clean, detailed high-res polygonal models and pre-rendered backgrounds can also be quite irritating, especially as backgrounds, drawn in an age of lower resolutions, appear grainy and more often fuzzy. Fortunately, the team managed to maintain at least the aspect ratio and to implement some tricks that make the frame rate more stable, especially during fights: the latter can be accelerated fup to three times, in case you want to get rid of enemies as quickly as possible. In this respect, however, Square Enix also offers in this conversion the same cheat screen - also called boosters - which made its appearance for the first time in the edition for mobile systems of 2016: in fact, you can select a series of gabolas such as infinite health points, maxed out levels, boosted damage and other tricks that make the adventure a piece of cake. Playing it from this point of view doesn't make much sense, but those who just want to enjoy the story can do so and maybe try their hand at the nice minigames without pressure, starting with the excellent card game Tetra Master, a real game within a game. It would be a shame, however, to leave out a solid and captivating combat system that relies on the individual abilities of the characters - which each follow an iconic Final Fantasy Job - and on an intelligent even if not particularly original growth system.", "date": "2017-09-27", "grade": "7.0"}
