{"name": "Excite Truck - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/excite-truck-recensione.html", "text": "Frenaaaaaaa! Simple doesn't mean trivial, immediate doesn't mean flat. Excite Truck on these bases offers a gaming experience that collects something from F-Zero, a few others from Wave Race, a splash from the aforementioned Excite Bike, a sprinkling of Burnout, puts a lot of his own and shakes it all up for a truly explosive. And so after having briefly navigated through the actually uninspired menus, you are ready to start a race with no holds barred against 5 other challengers, within settings ranging from Canada to Scotland to Mexico to Finland to China to Fiji Islands. 3, 2, 1, and the show begins. The crazy speed that characterizes the Nintendo production slams on the face of the unsuspecting player from the very first moments, seasoned with violent blows and jumps capable of putting the suspensions to the test. The control system is the now classic one for racing games on the Wii: Wiimote held horizontally with two hands to take the place of the steering wheel, key 2 to accelerate and key 1 to brake. Added to this is the possibility of activating a turbo, by pressing any direction of the cross, and of managing the forward or backward inclination of your vehicle during jumps, through the relative rotation of the controller. However, the turbo must be used sparingly, since abusing it leads to overheating of the engine; the passage through the watercourses can contribute to the cooling, thus giving an interesting strategic component to the whole. A system of great value and effectiveness therefore, which contributes largely to the fun factor that Excite Truck is able to provide with both hands. Another key point lies in the track design, truly excellent with only a few rare drops in quality; in summary, every single route is literally stuffed with bottlenecks, ramps, pools of water, detours, shortcuts, ups and downs and so on, such as to often make a race more like a crazy roller coaster ride. The tension is also always kept at high levels given the abundant presence of trees, rocks and trackside elements capable of abruptly interrupting the player's run, thus making him lose precious seconds. As if that weren't enough, the programmers have also chosen to introduce a couple of interesting additions to the formula, in the form of icons arranged along the track. The first, the upgrade, gives a further dose of speed to your vehicle, also allowing it to cut down trees and shrubs without any fear; very useful for creating DIY shortcuts or for quickly reaching the top positions. On the other hand, the terrainmorph is even more fun, which deserves a slightly more extensive explanation: activating it will change the same path in front of your eyes, with the birth from nothing of hills or pools of water or new bifurcations and so on. The terrainmorph can also be used as a real weapon, given that with a little luck and timing, its activation allows you to throw opponents into the air as they pass on a slope born out of nowhere in an instant. It is a pity that the CPU-controlled challengers themselves are not able to use any of the aforementioned power-ups, leaving a sometimes all too effective ace up the player's sleeves. A racing game? Almost... Although Excite Truck is clearly attributable to the category of racing games, the mechanics studied by Nintendo lead the title in question to move away from it slightly at least as regards the classic formula of ~first position = victory~. On the contrary, the goal is instead to obtain a certain number of stars, so as to earn a final rating that starts from S and goes down to A,B,C,D. In this sense, the final position once you cross the finish line determines only a fraction of the aforementioned stars, which must instead be earned during the entire race. As? Basically by driving with ~style~, or by carrying out a series of actions capable of increasing one's score. And so the drifts or jumps, and still the clashes with opponents or the passage next to trees, or the crossing of rings in mid-air or the realization of various evolutions are all fundamental actions to try to achieve whenever possible . A constant and continuous stimulus therefore, capable of making the Excite Truck races something fresh, electrifying and original. From a technical point of view, however, the Nintendo production settles on good levels, even without surprising; leave the finesse and graphic realism to more equipped (and expensive) consoles, the title for Wii still brings with it an overall result without flaws, enhanced above all by the excellent frame rayou and the truly exhilarating sensation of speed. Too bad for some disappointing textures and above all for the paucity of replays, which instead offer an absolutely ridiculous selection of cameras in terms of quantity and quality in the face of such a spectacular game. But the most consistent defect of Excite Truck, which prevents it from reaching an excellent evaluation, lies in the reduced overall longevity which, although watered down by mirror modes and various mini-games, struggles to bring the title in question beyond the handful of hours necessary to unlock everything there is to see. In this sense, the presence of an online multiplayer would have been really effective, an option which, however, as we all know is not yet part of the offer of the new Nintendo console. The maximum allowed is instead a trivial split screen for two challengers. A last word on the sound accompaniment, characterized by rock guitars as insipid as they are boring; fortunately it is possible to load your favorite mp3s on an SD card, thus creating a tracklist tailored around your tastes. Comment Excite Truck has only one major flaw, namely a very modest longevity aggravated by the absence of an online multiplayer mode which is sensationally missing. Having said that, the foundations for creating a new franchise of great value are all there, thanks to a game mechanic that is immediate but at the same time capable of giving great satisfaction even to the most experienced players. With a culinary metaphor, we could therefore say that the Nintendo production is an excellent dish, unfortunately accompanied by an all too narrow side dish. That said, Excite Truck remains a highly recommended game for Wii owners, and one that sets the stage for a potentially devastating second installment. Pros It's an immediate but deep Arcade Excellent sensation of speed More original than it may seem Cons Lack of online mode Longevity reduced to the bone Bad replays A nice immediate and fun arcade. This is the essence of Excite Truck, a Nintendo product that has finally arrived in Europe for the happiness of all owners of the newborn Wii. The title, for those who have a few years behind them, will undoubtedly bring to mind the historic Excite Bike, an unforgettable NES classic that has recently also been made available for download on the Virtual Console. No motocross bikes this time, but big 4x4 off-road vehicles, ready to challenge each other on very unconventional tracks...", "date": "2007-03-01", "grade": null}
