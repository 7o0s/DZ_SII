Here, now you can also set aside any names that have come to mind in these few moments of reflection, because the title that we are about to describe to you will not struggle to position itself in first place in this particular ranking. Born from the mind of the independent developer Daniel Mullins, Pony Island is defined by its creator as an ~experimental suspense puzzler~, a periphrase that serves up to a certain point to describe the peculiarities inherent in the work. Frankly we are dealing with a video game that goes beyond the ordinary schemes to the point of making it complex to explain its contents to the unsuspecting player, at least without causing a certain impoverishment of the surprise effect, which instead is generated very powerfully after opening Steam and clicking on the launching the application, without having received external input of any kind. Therefore, if you trust our judgment and if you are passionate about experimenting, we suggest you go directly to the level of the vote - we bet that for someone it won't even be a habit so different from usual! - to then go back to reading the rest of the piece after trying at least the first part of the game by hand. Skeptics and the simply curious are instead asked to continue: come, gentlemen, come! Rest assured, Pony Island is not Barbie's new game Blasphemy, I don't fear you Pony Island is not just a game, but rather a game within a game. It's a limbo to explore and a creepy place of perdition, where a mysterious and ancient arcade machine of yesteryear is bound to keep us trapped between lines of code, system glitches and dialog boxes. There is something sick and obscure, it can be perceived from the dull background sounds and from the total absence of colour. Along a two-dimensional sliding course, a white Pony embarks on a vacuous obstacle course, but the system is unstable, something is not right. Moments later the program crashes and we are returned to a rudimentary but blurry desktop. By opening the Messenger folder, a conversation begins with an imaginary prisoner of the machine, desperate to the point of asking for our support. Then a second screen suddenly opens and another entity, with a threatening and not very condescending manner, invites us to stop plotting escape plans. The prisoner reveals to us that there are three different system files, on which the functioning of the entire program depends, and warns us that all of them must be deleted in order to escape successfully. Yes, because Ponies must not mislead; this here is not just any game: it is the devil's game. And the devil hates not having control over the weak, he hates having their hands in his code without having given permission, he gets furious when someone manages to solve puzzles to achieve goals he didn't plan. It seems to hear him, ~who does this guy think he is, God?!~ From here on you can read him, while he inveighs against us, while he treats us like poor lunatics to test us, sure that we will let go almost immediately. Thus begins a journey through fragments of code, messages to decrypt, passwords to recover, improbable pony rides and infernal bosses. There's even room to shoot down Jesus, before returning to the programming segments again, in the reckless search for those system files that can guarantee a nice one-way ticket to freedom. Did you know that Satan likes ponies? We believe we can state it without fear of denials: Pony Island is a deviant game, with obscure tendencies, certainly not suitable for all palates and not at all easy to filter, both for its excesses and for the complex attributions of meaning. Yet it is also one of the most extreme and out of the ordinary experiments we have ever gotten our hands on in our gaming experience. However, what requires a precise framework is whether this awareness has positive or negative implications. Beyond the personal opinions that may arise regarding the theme on which this work is based, what interests us most concerns the success in terms of interaction, the continuous ability to amaze and the constant absence of points of reference. The game dynamics therefore invites you to continue, see more, try to attribute meaning and orient yourself even where it seems unlikely. From this point of view Pony Island works wonders; puzzle and puzzle solving mechanics enhance the deductive spirit, as well as the assumption of a form of controleven in the midst of estrangement, while at the mercy of a game - that of pony racing - which does absolutely nothing to appear different from what it is: a demented and meaningless practice. The analysis and decomposition of the underlying code increase that pressing sense of being trapped and exacerbate the urgent need to find a defuse. And then there are also some meta-referential techniques. The game aims to establish a constant form of direct interaction with the players, aiming to amaze with always unexpected and unplanned results. Mullins recently stated that he was inspired by Hideo Kojima to launch a certain kind of message and try to eliminate the separation between work and user, canceling the distance between player and character and upsetting the notion of interface. Just to clarify, the famous battle between Snake and Psycho Mantis in the first Metal Gear Solid has been mentioned, during which one was forced to change the entrance door of the pad to no longer be identified by the enemy. In its own way, Pony Island also has some tricks similar to those designed by Kojima, but which obviously we will not anticipate here. Moreover, the inspirations also move in other directions. There is an affinity with The Binding of Isaac, in dealing with the so-called Christian demonology through alternative parameters, and continues with the drifts of black humor through which the figure of Satan himself is outlined, so sure of his own ability to control and equally richly denied with each new puzzle solved, difficulty overcome and boss killed, to remind us on more than one occasion of the cynical GLaDOS of Portal. The message lends itself to multiple interpretations; at the end of the story the metaphorical meanings underlying the figures of the ponies are captured, while during the entire adventure the relationship between man and machine remains in the foreground, a potential simulacrum of contemporary slavery of the masses, the real hell from which Mullins seems to suggest to free oneself. Obviously ours remain only conjectures, considering that the material undoubtedly lends itself to many different readings.", "date": "2016-01-21", "grade": "8.5"}
