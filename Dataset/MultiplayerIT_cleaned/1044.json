At the end of the opening jingle you find yourself having to navigate through many screens with no background sound. Given the time that some sound tracks are lost, it would not have hurt (apart from that of the victories there is nothing else). Meh! If in the menus this detail does not count for much, in the simulation of the match the situation changes: there is no comment of any kind from virtual reporters. You only hear a totally repetitive audience, some shouts from the players and the sound of the ball being kicked. To add an extra touch you can hear your counterpart's voice yelling when you issue orders to the squad. That's all. Do we do fifty-fifty? The multiplayer is limited to two players: in this case, having chosen the two teams, the participants alternate their management in turns, a mode that takes up a lot of time and which would have been interesting to implement at least via the network (to ensure that both can manage the the whole). There is no connection to the Internet of any kind, not even to enter a statistic of the best players. However, playing with a friend increases the challenge even if a stronger team weighs the same on management. As already mentioned, the possibility (present on consoles) of connecting to the big network to update the transfer market has been eliminated; more teams have been added to compensate for this cut. Comment Football Manager Championship 2005 Pro Edition arrives on the market at the same time as two other similar titles: EA's Total Club Manager 2005 and Sega's Football Manager. Unfortunately, the game has a rather low technical realization, which penalizes the direct comparison with the competition. Looking at the side of the entertainment and the possibilities offered, however, we are faced with a title that lacks some shortcomings and which proves to be less managerial than the others; the mainstay lies in the management of the team and the stadium (which however does not offer too many modifications other than the purchase of a new one) but the realization of the matches and the interaction with them does not increase the interest in a game that appears old in departure. Recommended for those who want to approach management in a calm way and without expecting great things. Fanatics or those who have already played EA or Sega titles stay away! Pros: Simple navigation screens Lots of A and B squads for eight countries Good squad management Cons: Poor graphics No tutorials or guides Lack of managerial insights Train and then I'll train you... Also this year Codemasters offers us a new version of its football manager, now in its fifth year of life. The game is in the same arena as EA's competitor Total Club Manager 2005. Who will win the fight? After the long initial loading (immediately assume that a gigabyte of Ram is needed to speed up swap and calculation operations) you access a menu where you can start a new game-career, see an example of it, observe the best scores , load saves and change options. Already from here you can imagine that you are faced with a rather simple game in terms of visual quality but which wants to make options its strong point. The selection of the team (all major leagues are present, including the Dutch one) takes place via a sad screen that shows us the shirts (obviously without any kind of sponsor) and where the country and series (A or B) are set. Then it will be asked whether to take care of all the parameters that a club entails or whether to focus only on the financial part. It is also possible to play with another human opponent, alternating the direction of the two teams. one senses that one is dealing with a rather simple game in terms of visual quality Nobody in the stadium... Game management works in a similar way to Windows: click on the main button and a drop-down menu opens which gives access to numerous other sub-menus divided by topic. When you want to switch to another window, the one just displayed is reduced to the taskbar and it is no longer possible to close it; depending on how many you open, these gradually take the place of the others. The ~index~ button allows you to choose between seven possibilities: the calendar, the club (from here you can keep an eye on collaborators and sponsors), finances, the transfer market, information, the laptop (on which you receive e-mail) and the team (with various stats, tactics, training sessions, etc.). Football Manager does not work with a points system but with percentages, based above all on the management of the team and on the earnings made. The e-mail system appears less invasive thanthe one already seen in Total Club 2005 but it is very poor and lacks adequate information. In practice, after each day a horrid window opens (which would like to remind you of Outlook) in which you can read the messages of your collaborators: strangely when you are asked a question (the answer to which is ~Yes~ or ~No~) and you answer in in a negative way, the email is deleted, with no possibility of reading it again. Unlike the EA game (in which the screen was literally invaded by buttons and writings) the screens here appear less confusing but also more spartan (often reduced to the bone) and it is noted that the possibilities are fewer than in the aforementioned title. Furthermore, despite the more pronounced simplicity (which may appeal to newbies) there is no tutorial or guide to follow everything in the best possible way and the player finds himself left to himself. There is no progression of each parameter or a simple ~forward~ button for controlled management of everything. The title derives from a console conversion evidently aimed at the largest possible slice of the public and therefore the programmers have tried to simplify everything by adding a little more to the PC version, slightly changed in the title, with the wording ~Pro~. If that pro stands for ~professional~ someone has exaggerated. In reality, only minor teams have been added for a total that should be eight hundred; but honestly it seems an optimistic figure. The online transfer market update system has even been eliminated, an interesting idea that has proved interesting on consoles! Mysteries of programming allows you to use the modules of the teams that have made history: from Italy in 1982 to Milan in 1990 Tactics Ita '82 Browsing through the menus, one realizes that the available options are not very many, in particular, one does not give much weight to the recruitment of personnel except as regards the observers: these are used to evaluate purchases in the transfer market or to have pre-match reports on opponents. However, the thing always boils down to a very brief description of the type ~good~, ~good teamwork~ and so on without any insights or history. As if to underline the incompetence of these characters, a button appears in the tables with the words ~fire observer~ but despite the sadistic desire to do so, one cannot hope for better hires. The team section, on the other hand, turns out to be well done: the ~tactics~ selection (for everyone or for a single player) offers different variations and allows you to use the modules of the teams that have made history: from Italy in '82 to Milan in '90. The training sessions can also be modified for all or only for the players: of these the various parameters are seen in the form of a percentage which, with the progress of the championship, can also vary markedly depending on successes, failures, mood, etc. The matches can be tackled in two ways: with the 3D view and therefore participating with orders and substitutions or in the 2D mode, which turns out to be an image of a stadium with time running out and the only possibility to replace the players. Leaving aside the second (which serves as a lottery) in the three-dimensional game it is possible to ~scream~ commands to the players from the bench: by pressing the F1, F2, etc. keys. directives will be given such as pressing, counter-attack, defence, play in midfield, etc. for a system that all in all works. If you win, nothing significant happens, so forget the Gazzetta dello Sport that appears in Total Club. Important news or interesting screenshots will only be available at the end of the championship or on rare other occasions. Friend Uligan The horrid email system Defining the graphics as ~spartan~ would be an understatement...Starting the game we are faced with gray and bare menus, with some sad graphic choices that recall titles released eons ago. Unattractive static screens, bad window system, rare cases with scrolling writings that mimic EA's most famous Total Club. The good thing is that it is possible to change the backgrounds by accessing the game folder via Resource Manager (it is not possible to change them when the game has started) but otherwise most of what appears on the screen shows little care. The three-dimensional side, on the other hand, is discreet, with the players having features (at face level) very similar to those of real players. The animations, on the other hand, are fluctuating: during the game there are ups and downs but all tending to few variations. The stadiums, on the other hand, are well made, along the lines of the real ones and equipped with the usual audience (variable depending on the turnout) of cardboard templates. It is possible to see the game in progress from only three angles which however do their wherere (even if they don't allow you to observe the details). Unfortunately, even 3D is undermined by some incomprehensible choices: the games take place with accelerated time, with the only possibility of partially decelerating the scrolling, therefore no real time (ok, it's not essential though...) and a mysterious slowdown effect in ball shooting. If you want you can see the names of the players and the trail of the sphere (which is useless) but overall the repetitiveness leads to getting tired quickly in observing the matches. The graphics remain fixed in 800x600 with no possibility of graphic changes, apart from the shadows. All this further penalizes the little good present.", "date": "2005-02-09", "grade": null}
