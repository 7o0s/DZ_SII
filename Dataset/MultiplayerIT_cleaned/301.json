The original title, even in the face of non-trivial hardware requests for the time, succeeded in its intent. However, it should not be forgotten that NWN carried the burden of a legacy on its shoulders that left no way out for slips and slips. At the state of the art Baldur's Gate 2 was the non plus ultra of the PC role-playing experience. While deviating in many respects from the official line of D&D rules, this title had essentially managed to provide a deep and multifaceted single player gaming experience, enough to win the hearts of players (and there are still those who claim that in many respects BG remains an unsurpassed masterpiece). From Baldur's Gate to NWN2 There were two main aspects that placed a watershed between the two generations of RPGs: the massive entry of 3D graphics engines into the economy of PC games and the advent of technologies related to the network, with the consequent birth of the first MMORPGs of new generation. NWN took up the challenge by proposing something totally innovative. Not so much for the graphic aspect, since as we all know the life of the latest appeal from this point of view lasts a few seasons, but more for the innovative aspect provided in terms of the multiplayer game. but as the years went by, the physiological need to have a new title available that resumed all the good things done in the first chapter from the beginning, to enter the market of the last generation. At this point the road to Neverwinter Nights 2 was already paved From Baldur's Gate to NWN2 The pearl locked inside the carapace of NWN was Aurora, the toolset that allowed thousands of players to create their own online adventures and to live gaming experiences finally comparable to paper ones. Nonetheless, the single player game suffered, at least in the original version, from many shortcomings, both from the point of view of the transposition of the rules from paper and from those of the contents at the plot level. The good old days of Baldur's Gate seemed over, and only Aurora seemed to make a real difference with the past. But the release of two expansions and the constant presence of the technical staff at the service of the users, materialized in the periodic supply of improvement patches, allowed NWN to take shape and to reach over time a completeness worthy of respect. But over the years the physiological need to have a new title available that resumed all the good things done in the first chapter from the beginning, to enter the market of the latest generation, grew stronger. At this point the road to Neverwinter Nights 2 was already paved. Aurora gives way to Electron First of all, the renewal had to start from the graphics engine. Although Aurora Engine (the graphics engine of the first NWN) was an excellent product, the four years of distance have created a natural detachment, generating the need to be able to count on a new technological framework. Having abandoned the OpenGL technology, the developers have thus decided to embrace Microsoft's DirectX (perhaps ready for the imminent approach to porting for Xbox 360) and to renew the entire graphics sector from scratch. the impressions we had during the previews that were granted to us in the first months of the summer were confirmed by viewing the complete game. NWN2 can count on a robust engine, but without exaggerated pretensions Aurora gives way to Electron The impressions we had during the previews that were granted to us in the first months of the summer were confirmed by viewing the complete game. NWN2 can count on a robust engine, but without exaggerated pretensions. It is all too clear that the efforts of the developers have focused on much more critical aspects (the gameplay, for example) leaving the graphic aspect to an effective but rather traditionalist restyling. Character models appear far more detailed than the standards we were used to. However, the number of polygons far higher than in the past has led to a drastic reduction of the units present in the bestiary. If the first NWN provided almost all of the magical beasts of Faerun (the world in which the adventures of the D&D base setting take place) in NWN2 their number has been reduced while offering a rich variety on the models provided. The mobility of character models and NPCs and the introduction of facial expressionswings complete the picture. Races, Subraces, Classes... There's no better way to describe a game like NWN2 than starting from the beginning. The graphic aspect is not everything when it comes to real RPG, the real game is in the role-playing dimension, at least if it is a videogame transposition of D&D. As any good RPG knows, the character creation phase is at least one of the most important. Future game developments will depend on the decisions made at this stage. The first surprises come right at this point. As tradition dictates, the first choice that is imposed on us is on the race of the character who will accompany us throughout the course of the adventure. So far nothing new, the choice is between Human, Half-elf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Dwarf, Half-orc and, surprisingly, the Planar Bloodlines. The predisposition to the management of sub-races is immediately evident. In fact, there is the possibility of specifying which particular racial typology the character belongs to, being able to choose among some of the specific opportunities offered by the race of Elves (with the sub-races of Drow, Wood Elves, Moon Elves, Sun Elves), from of the Dwarves (Shield Dwarfs, Gray Dwarves, Golden Dwarves), from that of the Gnomes (with the sub-races of the Gnomes of the rocks and of the Depths), from that of the Halflings (subdivided into Strongheart and Lightfoot) and finally from that of the Planar Bloodlines ( divided into Aasimar and Tiefling). When choosing the class that will characterize the character, it is possible to realize the introduction of numerous prestige classes (practically all those foreseen by the official manuals, excluding the Shifter class, with the addition of a couple of prestige classes created specifically for the game) which will still be accessible only starting from a certain level, and of the Warlock class, a sort of hybrid between sorcerer and warrior. It should be noted that the maximum number of classes for ~multiclassing~ (also required for access to some prestige classes) has been increased from three to four. We continue with the setting of the appearance of your PG, unfortunately we have to note that, despite the wide range of colors through which to outline the characteristics of our hero, the number of details for the face is rather limited. A flaw, however, not very relevant in terms of absolute economy of the game. Before leaving the creation mode it is worth checking one last time that all the choices made are compatible with the project we have in mind. This phase is really fundamental and a too approximate approach to character creation, in the long run, would end up compromising the gaming experience. Once the character has been created, it is finally time to enter the game world. Gameplay Getting to grips with the interface is pretty easy. NWN was characterized by the presence of the radial menu that allowed interaction with the game world. NWN2 leaves this path bringing a little more order. Using the shift key, combined with clicking the right mouse button on the area of the screen indicated by the cursor, shows the possible options on the selected object, be it a map element, a character or a portion of the graphical interface. In this way a drop-down menu is shown through which it is possible to select the actions or intermediate options of the objects, as well as the commands for controlling the non-player characters of your party. It is precisely the party and its management that constitutes the first real big difference with the predecessor title. Finally NWN2 offers the player the opportunity to take full advantage of the presence of other characters to support his hero. A large part of the game dynamics is entrusted to the management of these NPCs and to the interaction with them. Traditionally, the party is the soul of the game. D&D provides the possibility of experiencing adventures in which the sum of the efforts of the characters in the game always yields the best result. Precisely for this reason, the introduction of the party in NWN2 and its relative management are a big novelty for the game. However, the NPCs entrusted to the player do not constitute an unshakeable front that is eternally loyal to the hero. Being an often heterogeneous group of characters, the first problems derive precisely from the management of relationships with the gregarious characters. The player's actions, first of all, are able to change the alignment of the PG, creating many problems in party management. traditionally, in D&D the party is the soul of the game Alignment isn't the only factor to consider in trying to keep the group together. The sThe unique interactions between the hero and the characters can weaken, or strengthen, relationships, changing the feeling and chemistry during the most eventful sequences. Party management reaches its point of maximum efficiency when it is combined with the use of the action pause. The game can be ~frozen~ at any time, using the space key, and later restored using the same key. The usefulness of this action is to be able to reorganize the game action from time to time by arranging the various characters and calmly managing the clashes with the enemies (but this is just an example of using the party). It is also possible to possess (and therefore totally control) the other characters of the party, with the result of being able to manage movements and special abilities of the NPCs in the smallest detail. The player is even entrusted with the task of managing the characteristics of the NPCs in the process of reaching a higher level of experience. The maximum level that can be reached in NWN2 has been set at 20, for the following levels we will have to wait for any expansions (already partially confirmed). The party is the soul of the RPG On the way to the city of Neverwinter, where we are directed for the purposes of the plot, we meet yet another novelty, consisting of the world map. The ancient area transitions, which allowed you to jump from one area to another without interruption, have given way to a less repetitive and more effective system. While in some cases the continuity between one area and another remains, in NWN2 to reach very distant points you are forced to consult the transition map and select the destination (provided it has been made available based on the experience of the game ). During the journey from one area to another it is then possible to come across bands of brigands and bandits or simple characters intent on asking for help, perhaps in defense of some dark creature. Often these interludes constitute real crossroads in the main story, capable of greatly enriching the gaming experience. a further novelty is the management of fortresses during sieges which allow the player to control a further handful of characters, for a limited period of time The party is the soul of the RPG The management of the fights has remained almost unchanged, with the dice rolling system in the background to be the backdrop to the clashes managed automatically by the computer; once the battle has been engaged, everything takes place automatically, at least as regards the hand-to-hand fight. At this juncture, the use of the control commands of the party mates is essential to better manage the clash. A further novelty is the management of the fortresses during sieges which allow the player to control a further handful of characters, for a limited period of time. The goal is to use combat NPCs to handle large-scale attacks, such as an enemy's attempt to raid and capture a fortress the PC presides over. This introduction finally makes it possible to considerably expand the game possibilities by placing in the player's hands some of the most captivating possibilities provided by the paper game. The changes have even involved the management of the inventory, which although still managed in tabs (up to a maximum of four) no longer provides for the management of the size of the objects, reducing them to all icons of the same size. For the PG's carrying capacity, the weight of the transported objects compared to the player's total carrying capacity is the basis. The aspects related to the management of crafting skills have also been refined, separating the creation of objects into sub-types, as well as by type (mainly alchemy, metallurgy and magic). Power of the network The single player adventure is well constructed and leaves plenty of room for the player's initiative to manoeuvre. The journey to Neverwinter will lead the hero to make friends with patrons who, like him, are headed towards the northern city. The interactions between the supporting characters, in addition to animating the game, constitute real interludes in which irony and the good construction of the dialogues also play a part in the story. The interaction between the young Tiefling who will have to be saved from a group of bandits and the grumpy dwarf picked up under the porch of an old inn are on a par with those of Tolkenian memory between Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf. Furthermore, the presence of numerous sub-quests to complement the main quests should give greater longevity to the title. Ample space has been given in the single player version to all those skills that in the", "date": "2006-11-02", "grade": null}
