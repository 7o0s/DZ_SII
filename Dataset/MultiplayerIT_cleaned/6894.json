The real explosion would have come only with the episode on GameCube, still the favorite of many fans, while Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the chapter for Wii, would have only confirmed the good things done in the past: from a certain point of view, just the penultimate, best-selling Nintendo console has shown that Super Smash Bros. will never reach the numbers of Mario Kart. Because it's not as immediate, and it doesn't have a universal concept like that of the famous racing game. Even many of the most fervent adepts of the Kyotense company, to be clear those who would also buy the Mario Party action figures, have snubbed him on several occasions. Conversely, there are some players who would buy any platform just to play it: the obvious consequence is that, the worse a Nintendo console goes, the more Nintendo needs Super Smash Bros. If Mario Kart sales have always been high, however related to the 'installed of the reference console, Sakurai's work tends to be more stable, and above all indispensable for many players around the globe. This is why Iwata has focused a lot on this project: after the golden luster under the aegis of Wii/Nintendo DS, it was time to go back to old habits. When, not coincidentally, Super Smash Bros. outsold Mario Kart. The pocket-sized Super Smash Bros. makes the most of Nintendo 3DS but will it have a limited edition for Wii U? Plat 'em up The concept behind Super Smash Bros. could be labeled as a hybrid between platform and fighting game, with a veiled addition of party games. The main difference between this game and any Street Fighter lies in the centrality of the jump, and of the aerial sections in general: you don't defeat your opponent by beating him to death, but by throwing him off the stage. Of course, the more blows you strike, the higher the percentage of damage inflicted on your rival, the more chances you have of sending him far, so that he doesn't return to the ring. The other dogma of Super Smash Bros. lies in the formulation of the attacks, which is always identical for any character: the effects are enormously diversified from each other - perhaps more than in any other fighting game, even if a direct comparison would be enough naive - but for each wrestler there are four normal and four special attacks, possible by crushing ~A~ or ~B~ respectively, possibly associated with a direction. The standard ones are also declinable based on the context, i.e. different if performed from a standstill, running, in the air or, the latter is precisely defined as the ~smash~ shot, if thrown after having long pressed the button. Playing it is much more intuitive than reading it, we assure you, but this clockwork description was necessary to introduce the two most obvious consequences, namely: a game of Super Smash Bros., especially when seen from the outside, does not at all resemble that of a classic fighting game. And not just because there are sometimes four fighters, as well as weapons, on screen - these are optional variables. In fact, in each match the characters defend themselves, roll and dodge at frenetic speed, jumping like frogs to the sides of their opponents. They look like two heroes of a platformer who decided to give each other a thrashing. The second consequence we mentioned earlier, however, lies in the ease of passing from one wrestler to another, and above all to understand in a short time the one best suited to one's abilities, as well as closest to personal taste: that the fighter is small , slow, fast or big, you can discover all the moves in a minute, and this simplicity, without affecting the depth, is a great advantage of the title - a typically ~Nintendian~ advantage, among other things. These mechanics also work very well on this first portable episode and, indeed, have even been oiled and speeded up compared to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. At the same time - predictably - nothing has been done to approach those who didn't appreciate the series: gravity, love it or hate it, with its soporific, dreamy falls, remains as anomalous as ever. As are the controls, for that matter: responsive, simple and precise, but not too intuitive - not as intuitive as those of other Nintendo titles, anyway. The wrestlers Since the days of Brawl, the Super Smash Bros. roster has been followed with obsessive attention, and this fourth iteration has not deviated from the course. It is therefore inevitable that some controversies have arisen,either for the elimination of a loved character, or for the inclusion of one deemed useless; to complicate everything this time there was Nintendo 3DS, which with its hardware limitations prevented certain characters from appearing (see the Ice Climbers) and implied, even without official admission, the simplification of the metamorphic ones - such as Zelda/Sheik , which arrive as separate identities on the laptop. However, leaving aside the chatter from ~Bar Nerd~, in this field we can only enthusiastically praise the work of Sakurai and Namco Bandai: Ice Climber aside, almost all the protagonists of the old editions are back, and many others have been added, up to the exorbitant figure of forty-nine - a number to be increased or decreased on the basis of variables which, here, we are of little interest. But the surprising thing is that, despite the insane amount of fighters, the newcomers didn't just show up: many of them brought hitherto unknown game canons, expanding what was already one of the pre-eminent features of Super Smash Bros. It is true that there are very similar characters - Mario and Dr. Mario - and it is equally indisputable that some fall within a certain abstract standard of fighter - swordsmen, for example - but the overall variety is simply extraordinary, the stellar distance that separates a contender like Olimar from one like Donkey Kong, Little Mac from Mega Man, Palutena from Yoshi. Opposing worlds for moves and actions, unified by similar controls and perfectly complemented by the versatility of the game gears. This, perhaps above all others, is an inherent quality of Sakurai's creature. The personalization of the characters is also commendable, both Mii - three types - and standard, in the latter case with alternative moves to the main ones. However, the fact that the modified wrestlers cannot be impersonated online, at least not against strangers, makes this (we repeat appreciable) novelty perceived as a juicy side dish, rather than as a main course. The arenas We cannot say we are equally enthusiastic about the internships. Unlike the characters, identical on both Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, in this area Sakurai has decided to separate most of the arenas: officially because the two versions will focus on stages dedicated to exclusively home or portable games, but it is also possible, at this point it is desirable that it be a facade motivation to expand the offer on the home console. Because not only does Super Smash Bros. on Nintendo 3DS have fewer settings than Super Smash Bros. Brawl, but it inherits many of them from the past (about a third) and none of them offer anything really new. If the first episode had introduced the basics of the game, the second expanded the concept and created effectively ~flat~ stages (so dear to fans), the third had made them more dynamic both in scrolling and in evolution: here is a summation of these aspects, but the levels do not excel in quality or variety. The introduction of the omega mode is certainly welcome, which allows, instead of relegating the many ~pro gamers~ to the single flat and clean stage called ~Final Destination~, to alter each setting so that the conformation of the terrain takes on this form. But the obvious opportunity that arises from this move, that is the possibility of dynamizing and filling the internships in a ~normal~ capacity, has not been exploited almost at all. Of the thirty (approximately) available arenas, few remain in mind due to variety or internal evolution, many of them could have existed, graphics aside, even on the Nintendo 64. And it's a real shame, because the stage dedicated to Super Mario 3D Land is splendid, as well as the Pokmon tower or the castle extrapolated from Fire Emblem. Only insoles The classic mode of Super Smash Bros., or the triumphal ride made up of various stages up to the final boss, the one that most of all resembles the single player of a normal fighting game, has reached its peak on Nintendo 3DS: perhaps it is less long than the usual, but certainly more varied and demanding. Each clash that separates the protagonist from the final boss can be interpreted in three different difficulties (with proportionate prizes), and above all the entire journey varies in relation to the coins wagered initially: the more doubloons are brought into play, the more difficult the enterprise will be, the more high - if successful - the reward. Without anticipating too much, therefore without going into the game dynamics in detail, we can guarantee you that the final boss, a jazzy reinterpretation of the usual Master Hand glove, is an authentic masterpiece of game design, and probably the creative peak of this new Smash Bros. Ahinoi , the beautiful wordsand for the single player they can only end here: it's true, there are the usual intriguing side-games, such as the sack to be beaten wildly and thrown onto the track, or the new structure to be disintegrated with explosives. But there is nothing that can rival Super Smash Bros. Brawl's ~Subspace Emissary~ which, while not perfect in the platforming parts, was still a noteworthy, long and challenging mode. Furthermore, the immediate and often ingenious events that made it possible to create paradoxical and tough situations thanks to their singularity have also been inexplicably removed. In partial compensation Sakurai introduced the Smash Run, ~Avventura Smash~ in Italian, a mode forged from the very heart of its creator, being an evolution of a rib of Kirby Air Ride: in this section four characters always challenge each other, who, before facing each other in the final battle, have a few minutes to explore a labyrinth teeming with enemies, and collect as many power-ups as possible by eliminating them. An interesting idea, but against the CPU alone it is short-lived. For the glory On the contrary, the Smash Adventure is appreciable in offline multiplayer (unplayable online, unfortunately), as well as all the rest of the work. Perhaps it goes without saying, but if you are new to the series you should know that, if alone it is a fun fighting game, in more players it sublimates towards peaks that, without human opponents, are difficult to imagine. And this is true both in the chaotic four-way battles, full of explosions, lightsabers and unexpected events, and in the close, tacit duels on the omega stages, filtered by technicalities and decided by fractions of a second. Offline multiplayer works well - of course - however we would have liked more attention for those who have two (or more) Nintendo 3DS but only one copy of the game: in Japan perhaps they will hardly notice this lack, but here in Italy, and without exaggerating in the West, It won't be easy to find other challengers who own both the console and Super Smash Bros. A Mario Kart-like solution, which with a single cartridge offers a reduced but very pleasant offer, would have been appreciated. There are two ways you can jump into the online arena, ~for fun~ or ~for glory.~ In the first case, weapons flare up left and right, and only positive results are counted; in the second - whose denomination in fact foments ardor and hatred - it is fought exclusively in the Omega stage, and distributes both triumphs and defeats in the archive. Although a world leaderboard is not explicit, it is evident that the game knows it and, above all, uses it well: in matching challengers of similar skill it is almost impeccable, and if you were excessively won or successful you would soon be diverted to another band. We've avoided the lag topic so far, but not out of desperation: the fluidity of the online clashes didn't delight us, but it didn't disappoint either. Playing one-on-one you rarely go below the threshold of decency, in four you rarely reach it. A real pity instead not being able to add rivals, obviously met by chance, to the friends list. Stereoscopic smash Technically the game is fluid and snappy, well beyond expectations: never a moment of hesitation, never a hesitation. Yet the detail is high, the objects on the screen numerous, the animations rich and the framing dynamic: if the uploads last two seconds longer than usual, well, one can only placidly forgive them. Surprisingly useful, and symptomatic of the ~Sakuraian~ expertise in the approach to game design, the black borders around the characters (however removable, you were masochists): especially from a distance, in the most chaotic scenes with four actors, they prove to be salvific because the reading of action is clear. The three-dimensional effect is also valid, which gives depth, does not disturb and helps to separate the game plan from that of the background: simple and functional, two adjectives that can rarely be associated with 3D. Naturally the game is not as nice to look at as on a large TV, and high definition has little to do with it: anyone who has tried any Super Smash Bros. knows well that the proximity of the camera is inversely proportional to the distance between the characters, therefore , when you find yourself at opposite poles of the screen, due to material issues of display size, you will not see much of the beautiful animations in progress. You will never lose your compass nor will a move seem unclear to you, however the general beauty of the screen suffers - and how. Before closing we deal with one last thorny topic, that of the graphic style: if the progenitor was composed of characters of only ~Nintendian~ lineage, well reconcilable with each other, as the series expanded", "date": "2014-09-26", "grade": "8.8"}
