We remembered him just yesterday, in view of this review of The Division 2, only the latest in a long series of titles that bear the name of the master of the techno-thriller who died prematurely in 2013. A name erroneously considered a facade by who thinks that the presence of Tom Clancy's signature on many Ubisoft titles is the result of a marketing operation, forgetting or ignoring that the Baltimore writer is responsible for the founding of Red Storm Entertainment, the development team behind the first, unforgettable Rainbow Six and more recently also to the little virtual reality gem that was Werewolves Within. Clear proof of Tom Clancy's influence on the world of video games is still tangible today in games such as The Division 2 and its predecessor, capable of recalling with their setting some of the political fictional conspiracy atmospheres imprinted in the memory of those who have read the his books. In addition to the name of Tom Clancy, however, in The Division 2 there is also a lot of Massive Entertainment, another team with now twenty years of experience called to the definitive test of maturity after the launch of the franchise which took place in 2016. In these three years, the study of Malm has shown that he knows how to learn from his mistakes, remedying situations that in the very first The Division had led several players to turn up their noses. After a week of scavenging resources for our existing camps around the city, we're finally able to tell you if The Division 2 can actually be everything its predecessor wasn't upon release. Atmosphere and plot If you are reading this review it is undoubtedly because you are interested in The Division 2, but it is not said that you have followed all the steps that led us to this final appointment. So let's start from the basics of the game, set as you know in Washington D.C., a city which, as we have repeated several times, has less charm than the New York chosen for the first chapter. However, Massive Entertainment has worked admirably on the capital, precisely to bridge the differences with the Big Apple. The events told in The Division 2 take place about seven months after the Black Friday bioterrorist attack, with which New York had fallen to its knees together with other cities, including the American capital. While the first chapter showed us the events immediately following the arrival of the second wave of Division agents in New York, The Division 2 takes the next step, changing the season to tell us about a Washington D.C. grappling with a now assimilated emergency situation, in which, however, there are still critical issues such as the complete shutdown of the Shade network when summer is upon us. Our agent then enters the game to get the city back on its feet, making contact with those who are already working to recover a certain level of normality. The film of the resilience of the human race, however, as opposed to the willingness of some to take advantage of the situation to destroy the last shreds of civilization left: this is naturally the case of the gangs who, upon our arrival, set fire to Washington D.C., in which we therefore find as in the first chapter organized groups of enemies intent on hindering our activities. From a narrative point of view, just like its predecessor, The Division 2 does not particularly shine, paying little attention to the story of the events although the usual collectibles are present around the city with which to expand one's knowledge of what happened in Washington D.C. because of the virus. Our character is once again proposed as a kind of silent puppet, an interested spectator of the short interlude scenes which in fact serve to act as the glue between one mission and another. As we are about to see, if Massive Entertainment had also made the same effort in the narrative field in other aspects of the game, we could have seriously considered the hypothesis of promoting The Division 2 with flying colors. Gameplay From the moment you set foot in the White House that serves as the headquarters of the Division in Washington D.C., you find yourself literally overwhelmed by the amount of content that The Division 2 puts before our eyes. The game structure remains similar to that seen in 2016, but with an expanded series of possibilities that start from the main missions to get to the conquest of the outposts in the hands of the enemies in the various districts, by freeing which it is possible to obtain rewards. It is fortunate that the developers thought of introdur a menu item to suggest the next activity to be carried out, which otherwise would risk being lost in front of the many things to do in The Division 2 right from the initial levels. You are spoiled for choice even in terms of customizing your character's abilities, for which old and new gadgets are available to unlock during the run to level 30, taking advantage of the long ride to try which of the various possible combinations can do more to your own case. Compared to its predecessor, The Division 2 simplifies the role-playing dynamics in terms of management, making it much easier in practice to switch from one set of equipment to another to assume the role required by the situation we are facing. Returning to the missions, the structure at their base can be summarized in the clash with waves of enemies of increasingly higher levels, up to the appearance of one or more bosses to be defeated to close the game. Compared to the first hours also from the point of view of repetitiveness we were able to appreciate steps forward, taking part in quite evocative outdoor clashes between rain and lightning. As for the stages inside, we confirm instead what was said about a week ago: the often anonymous settings seen in the first The Division, Massive Entertainment now follows up with some very well thought out places from a purely artistic point of view, giving rise to memorable clashes such as the planetarium, where one of the coolest missions in the entire game is held. All the activities we carry out have the ultimate goal of obtaining loot, which in the case of The Division 2 is constantly conspicuous. The updating of the equipment is guaranteed by loot present everywhere: whether it is in the simple wandering through the streets of the city or as the result of the efforts made in a mission to conquer an outpost, the reward is always guaranteed. Playstation 4 trophies The Division 2 has a total of forty-three Trophies. The usual Platinum which includes all the others is accompanied by four of the Gold type, five Silver and thirty-three Bronze. Among these we naturally find the one that rewards the completion of the campaign with the arrival at level thirty, which however is not enough to be sure of having completed everything. In fact, to bring home all the objectives it is necessary to get busy among the many activities made available by the developers, including the Black Zone and the various control points scattered throughout the city. Enemies and gunplay Among the aspects of the first The Division that had caused some discussion there was also the excessive resistance of the enemies to the bullets fired, which in fact made our opponents into sponges from bullets. While maintaining its approach far from the concept of ~one hit and you die~, The Division 2 abandons the path of its predecessor, thus allowing us to face more balanced fights in which only some bosses can absorb a higher amount of hits. A more than wise choice, thanks to which Massive Entertainment was also able to work on the versatility of the opposing units in the fight, governed by an excellent artificial intelligence. Once deployed on the field, the enemy units rarely remain still in their place, preferring a work of encirclement against the group of players who are therefore urged to make an extra effort in terms of tactics, eliminating an opponent positioned in a key place or arranging himself so as not to be taken by surprise. From this point of view, the possibility of directing the fire of gadgets such as the turret or the drone towards very specific enemies is particularly useful, thus allowing the player to cover any holes in the formation adopted in combat. You must always act by avoiding taking a step longer than your leg, also in order not to risk finding yourself out of position when a new wave of enemies arrives. Remaining in the realm of firefights, The Division 2's gunplay satisfied us in the same way as the artificial intelligence. Whether it's a machine gun, an assault rifle or a simple pistol, each weapon has its own behavior, which we must therefore learn to know in order to make the most of its strengths while limiting the weak ones at the same time. Using the mods at our disposal (renewed in their management, now much simpler), it is still possible to customize some aspects of the weapon we have in hand, making it more suitable for our style of play. Endgame yes, endgame no After a series of evaluations related to this review of The Division 2, we have decided to postpone a more in-depth analysis of the endgameat a later time. The choice was dictated by the presence of many contents that can be used even before reaching the fateful level thirty, including the PvP Conflict mode present from the early stages of the game. You will therefore soon find a new article dedicated to the endgame mechanics of The Division 2, regarding which it is still important to know about the addition of the so-called Black Tusks to the list of factions present in the game. The new group is equipped with high-level robotic units, to which we can respond with the specialization we choose at the end of the path for our character. In fact, compared to the first game, the special ability is missing, replaced in The Division 2 with a weapon linked to the choice between demolition expert, survival or hawk eye. The same specializations, along with the rest of the content, will be updated by Massive Entertainment over the next few months. After the lack of endgame experience of the first The Division at launch, the developers' plan for The Division 2 is in fact not to miss anything from its early stages: in fact, the first of the eight-player raids promised for some time will arrive in the coming weeks , kicking off the Year 1 content which, as announced by Ubisoft, will be free. Graphics and sound The review you are reading refers to the test of The Division 2 carried out on the PlayStation 4 Pro console, therefore taken as a reference for the evaluation of the technical sector of the game. A sensible choice if we take into consideration the defects we had found in the beta version dedicated to the Sony console, which appeared behind the PC and Xbox One editions. The sessions spent in the company of the final version of the game allowed us to better clarify the doubts we had about it, allowing us to appreciate Washington D.C. again. designed by Massive Entertainment in purely artistic terms: the city is appreciated for its colorful range of colors, as opposed to the snowy New York we had known previously. Months after the bioterrorist attack, the capital witnesses the regrowth of vegetation, as well as the colonization by wild animal breeds that begin to roam the streets. If in terms of charm the passage from New York to Washington D.C. made us ask some question marks, as already anticipated, the work done by Massive Entertainment makes the capital more lively and industrious, also distinguished as regards the factions of the Hyenas, True Sons and Reietti by well-defined distinctive signs, as is the behavior of the units that make up the three groups. On a purely technical level, the number of textures that were loaded late seems to have decreased on PS4 Pro, even if a careful eye can still be able to capture elements that become more defined during our passage or others that appear out of nowhere. We also point out some game crashes that forced us to go back to the console dashboard, thus losing the progress of the mission, along with some episodes of drops in the number of frames per second. As far as the audio sector is concerned, the soundtrack that accompanies us is very good together with all the environmental effects, with an averagely good level dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2019-03-18", "grade": "8.8"}
