Similarly, the first work of 5 Bits Games, a tiny team (5 indicates the number of programmers) made up mostly of former members of Neko Entertainment, moves away from the canonical definitions of first person shooter while appearing at first glance as one of many offspring of Doom. The first stirrings of DeadCore date back to November 2012, when it was presented under the name of Deadlock at 7 Days FPS, a convention in which independent developers are called to participate in the conceptual expansion of first-person games by making their own contribution in the arc of a week. Since then it has evolved thanks to the (even economic) support of the Desura community, a platform on which the alpha version was soon made available, and has even changed its title, to avoid copyright problems with what would become Interstellar Marines. A few months ago the echo of enthusiasm reached the ears of a world-renowned publisher like Bandai Namco who decided to place the work of young Frenchmen under its aegis and to give it prominence which, we must say immediately, fully deserves . Old school for life As written at the beginning, DeadCore is a first-person platformer, a successful concoction between an adrenaline-pumping and slightly retro shooter like Quake III Arena and the equally evergreen Super Mario World. The aim of the unnamed protagonist is to climb the immense tower in which it is set, overcoming the five stages that separate it from the top. The plot, honestly a bit specious, can be explored by finding the various ~logs~ scattered throughout the levels which, together with new audio tracks and permanent power-ups, represent the inevitable collectibles. The controls, although basic, are extremely well thought out and allow the player to immediately become familiar with the game mechanics. Initially only a little precision is required with jumps, considering that the force of gravity is much less high than in classic shooters; in particular you need to practice with the one in flight which allows you to cover longer distances than a single press of the space bar would allow. The first platforms thus become a valid exercise to measure up to the game, but soon we will realize that knowing how to calibrate the landings is only the minimum wage to be able to continue. At the end of the first level you will come into possession of a Portal-style gun which is used both to activate or deactivate certain switches and to get rid (temporarily) of annoying cube-robots that hinder the player's movements: however, the number of ammunition is limited and it must be used sparingly. Finally, towards the middle of the third level, it will become essential to use the E key, to which the shot is associated: until then, there is no particular need for it. Advancing in the ascent of the tower, it becomes important to synchronize the movements because the platforms on which to jump are increasingly unstable and bristling with unexpected events such as wind turbines, laser beams and anti-personnel turrets: pitfalls that must be evaded quickly because perhaps that switch you shot just before jumping into the void, he activates a portal that remains open for only a few moments. The timing typical of platformers and coordination required by online shooters are the old school qualities without which continuing in DeadCore becomes nothing short of a desperate undertaking. Fortunately, the learning curve is very well calibrated and the programmers have wisely decided to abound with checkpoints from which to restart in case of failure. As easily foreseeable, passing certain sequences ~on the first try~ will be highly unlikely: in DeadCore, therefore, the ~trial and error~ rule applies which is not excessively frustrating thanks both to the very rapid rebirth times and above all to the satisfaction deriving from overcoming passages that at first glance they seemed to require the massive use of drugs. DeadCore is an unexpected title, made with love by a small group of talented young people Mystical trance moments The technical sector is really well done. The futurist style betrays the transalpine origins of the project with some references to another cyberpunk title such as Remember Me; at the same time cleanliness and minimalism of the locations, obtained thanks to a studied slimming cure by palettand of colors and polygons, they are remarkable because they allow you to always have very clear ideas on the direction to follow. The engine used is the kind Unity, here in one of its most successful incarnations: despite the thrifty hardware requests, it guarantees an always high frame rate and without any uncertainties. Equally worth mentioning is the audio sector: sound effects and above all the electronic column are not a mere accompaniment to the game, but have been designed to complete the audiovisual experience with psychedelic results capable of sending the player grappling in epic vaults into catharsis. It's a deadly blend that we haven't heard since Wipeout 2097, and we believe that such a combination is the best compliment that can be paid to the guys at 5 Bits Games. Completing DeadCore takes approximately five or six hours, the amount of time which increases slightly to unlock all achievements. For those wishing to show off their boundless ego there is also the ~speedrun~ mode, in which it is required to complete levels in a particularly short time which will subsequently be published in the world rankings.", "date": "2014-10-23", "grade": "8.0"}
