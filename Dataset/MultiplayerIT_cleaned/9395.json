After having contributed to the failure of the original on PlayStation2 by bringing it out when the console was now at the end of its run and all eyes were focused on the new hardware, history seems destined to repeat itself with this Okamiden: the direct sequel to the Clover Studios' masterpiece comes out on Nintendo DS in probably the worst period in the history of the Nintendo handheld, for months almost completely obscured in the media by the advent of its 3D successor. So let's see if the two titles share not only the same unfortunate fate, but also the same qualities. Star of the sky, divine puppy That Okamiden is a finished sequel and not a sleazy spin-off can already be understood from a storyline that takes hold nine months after the facts narrated by the prequel. The scenario is always that of a feudal Japan revisited in a fairytale key, and faces known as Orochi - the seven-headed demon to be pushed back into oblivion - and Issun, the small and talkative companion of the main character, make their return. However, it is this last role that changes, no longer played by the divine she-wolf Amaterasu but by Chibiterasu, a puppy with a candid coat, a direct descendant of the aforementioned heroine. A small protagonist for a small Okami one could say: it is evident, in fact, that Capcom's intention with Okamiden was to try to squeeze as many elements inherited from the original as possible into the skimpy space of a cartridge for NintendoDS. An ambitious goal to say the least, which regardless deserves applause for its nobility but which in its execution often tends to collide with the limitations of the hardware and with some not always illuminating design choices. What is certain is that, from an aesthetic point of view, Okamiden is one of the best things ever seen on this portable console. The graphic style and the artistic direction are imported paro paro from the prequel, and therefore see the return of that sublime combination of cel shading and colors and atmospheres from a Japanese period painting, with touches of class such as the explosions of flowers that accompany the successes of Chibiterasu literally able to excite. But also from a strictly technical point of view, Capcom's work was commendable: the settings are wide-ranging, the special effects are wasted, the animations are fluid and varied and the virtual camera performs its task with extreme diligence, all with a frame rate that rarely shows the side of any hiccups. The price to pay, however, comes in the form of a systematic subdivision of each scenario into micro-areas whose transitions take away a good handful of seconds in loading. Again, the touchscreen assigned to display the map is exploited too little in the economy of movements, a detail that is not insignificant if we consider that you always play with the stylus in hand to be ready to perform the functions of the Celestial Brush. The sound, on the other hand, behaves diligently, with the same effects as the original (including the nice jibberish that gives voice to the various characters) and a musical accompaniment up to par, even if obviously not as grandiose and memorable as Okami's. Courage Wolf If, therefore, from an audiovisual point of view, the intent of the developers was to keep the feeling with the original unchanged as much as possible, looking at the gameplay it is easier to notice the measures adopted to give greater weight to the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo console. The Celestial Brush system obviously benefits particularly from this process, i.e. the divine power of Chibiterasu to give life to what is painted on the touchscreen: the handling of the stylus makes this practice even more fun than usual, even if the game proves sometimes too fussy in asking the user for extreme precision of the strokes to be drawn. All the techniques that we had already had the opportunity to appreciate while commanding Amaterasu make their welcome return, and in the course of the adventure it will therefore be possible to draw a straight line again to slice enemies and elements of the scenario, execute a circle on a withered plant to bring it back to life or fill the void left by a broken object to bring it back to its original condition, and so on. To these old glories is added a new application of the Celestial Brush which goes hand in hand with a characteristic aspect of the adventure, and which ends up being the leitmotif of many of the puzzles that one finds himself facing in the various dungeons. cin fact, hibiterasu will often find himself carrying little friends on his back who will accompany him in some quests, showing him the way to go and giving him a hand in combat: in particular cases, these helpers can dismount from the protagonist and reach otherwise unapproachable objects or switches simply by following the path traced by the user using the Celestial Brush. For the rest, Okamiden's gameplay is divided equally between exploration, puzzles and fights, with the latter perhaps constituting the weakest link in the chain: if we exclude the very pleasant - and often ingenious - fights with the bosses, the skirmishes with the minor demons are resolved in a button mashing of the only key assigned to the attack and little more, given the low level of challenge offered by the vast majority of enemies . Furthermore, it does not help that the dynamics of upgrading and combining weapons appreciated in Okami have been reduced here to a much milder upgrade system. Speaking of narrative, however, the Capcom product fails to match the peaks reached by the prequel, but at the same time it tells a good story that does not lack funny and touching moments, even if sometimes the prolixity of some cutscenes totally ancillary to the main plot invites strongly to wild skipping. In fact, Chibiterasu's adventure is still something very full-bodied by Nintendo DS standards, with an average of 20 hours needed to complete the game without counting all the sub-quests and hidden secrets.", "date": "2011-03-25", "grade": "8.4"}
