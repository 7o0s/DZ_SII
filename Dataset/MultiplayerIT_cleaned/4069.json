A title that Visual Concepts wants to maintain again this year with NBA 2K19, playing it safe and therefore starting from the foundations of its predecessors. Precisely for these reasons, do not expect radical changes, but painstaking work in eliminating the defects of the previous episode, refining others and offering new content useful for improving the experience. Starting with the two most important modes of the entire production: My Career and My GM. From China with Furore The first, clearly improved compared to last year in narrative terms, features a young American talent who, due to some wrong choices and a not exactly easy character, fails to make it to the American professional basketball championship. This leads him to play in the Chinese Basketball League, amidst a thousand cultural and language difficulties. A choice that we particularly appreciated: we liked the idea of having to play a boy in some ways immature, with his inner torments, his disappointments and the uncertainties that lead him to have to start over from scratch, at the antipodes of the United States before , and then in the lower categories of the NBA Gatorade League, the professional development league of the NBA: a ~world~ where he struggles to integrate. The story in NBA 2K19 is also told with the usual cinematic cut to which the mode has accustomed us in recent years, but with decidedly more detailed graphics, well-made direction and an appreciable level of voice acting in English. It is finally possible to skip the interlude scenes, and even the editor with which to create your own virtual alter ego is finally worthy of being called by this name compared to last year's meager one. Inside, in fact, we find everything for free to customize our virtual alter ego: dozens of hair, beards, distinctive signs, objects. A confirmation of what Rob Jones, Producer of NBA 2K19, declared, namely that microtransactions would have been present in the game, but in a more balanced way and such as not to force users to always spend VC, the game's virtual currency, for everything . Of course, those in a hurry can always resort to real money to get packages of VC and improve their athlete quickly, but in fact this remains a possibility, not a constraint, no one is forced to resort to the system. Especially this year that the points for growth are, among other things, given more frequently thanks to more extra activities. In short, the presence of microtransitions remains annoying, their use can initially make the online experience difficult in certain sessions (not all), but it is a phenomenon destined to diminish after a few weeks of training for those players, the majority, who rightly do not like to resort to these tricks. In any case, in My Career, the District returns, a sort of open world in which it is possible to interact directly with other players, even real ones, on and off the basketball court. This year the social functions have been improved, exploring areas has become less dispersive and a day/night cycle has been introduced which affects some aspects of the life of virtual athletes and events. Within the neighborhood you can visit places such as gyms and asphalt fields where you can try your hand at challenges of all kinds, such as Dodgeball or, in the Jordan Rec Center, in exciting 3-on-3 matches. And again, go to the shops to get a tattoo , or purchase gadgets to customize and upgrade your character. During our tests we were few online, so we prefer not to express a definitive judgment on the subject: for the record, however, we point out that we have not encountered any problems whatsoever, and also in the other online modes, between tournaments and quick challenges, apart from a couple of occasional half-second delays for a few commands, we didn't have any major matchmaking problems or lag. The King of the NBA The other leading mode of production obviously remains My GM, which consists in managing an NBA team, from relations with the press to the organization of the coach and staff, and so on, within the event. This mode can also be played in a version enriched by the presence of narrative elements, albeit reduced compared to last year, complete with choices to be made during team development. Among the novelties of this edition, which also concerns La Mia Lega, due a nosother opinion the most important, one linked to the Draft, which in addition to presenting a greater number of details and statistics for each young athlete, so as to allow for a more in-depth analysis, offers the possibility of importing the historical classes of 1960, 1965 into the session , 1969, 1970, and so on, up to the 1976-2017 block. This means that you can sign the old legends of the past like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Nate ~Tiny~ Archibald, Jamaal Wilkes and Michael Jordan, to name a few, obviously at a young age. In terms of mechanics, the introduction of the figure of the Mentor stands out, that is a veteran player of the team that the manager assigns to a freshman to help him fit better into the group and grow, changing and influencing his style of play and distinctive characters. In short, as always a lot of irons on the fire and additions and tweaks that add up to an already rich and well-stratified offer. In fact, there are all the other modes, starting from the ~friendly~ ones of Gioca Ora, with all the plethora of options for playing online and offline and the Blacktop mode, which allows you to play fun matches on street pitches without excessive frills, taking advantage a whole host of options to customize the challenges. And then, again, the Season and My League, the classic career that lasts 80 years (also playable online), the Playoff mode, for those who want to start directly from the postseason, and My Team, a sort of Ultimate Basketball Team in to take advantage of special credits to build a team made up of current players and legends from scratch: then the novelty Unlimited, a competitive online mode that allows players to use their best cards without restrictions in blocks of twelve races to receive cards and exclusive bonuses (and as much as $250,000) plus a new set of single player challenges available every week. Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty-one Trophies available in NBA 2K19, distributed in both single player and multiplayer modes. Most are obtained through progression in the game, both in main modes such as My Career or My GM, as well as online. So here's what you get simply for getting a tattoo in My Neighborhood, up to the more complex ones, obtainable after winning an NBA tournament or being called up to the All-Star Game. Hot Rings! Even on the NBA 2K19 parquet it does not overturn the game mechanics of the previous chapters, but tries to improve them. The title therefore rests on the solid foundations of gameplay built over the years, with some refinements and a series of small additions useful for improving it, such as the so-called Impetus, a temporary enhancement linked to the athlete's archetype which is unlocked by correctly performing a certain number of times certain actions in the game. Once activated, with its flaming icon it guarantees a bonus to the primary (and in some cases secondary) statistics, an increase in the value of the relative badges and the unlocking of special moves and techniques capable of enhancing the team. For example, slashers like Giannis Antetokounmpo or LeBron James perform hop steps or European steps more effectively, as well as unlock contact dunks that no one else can achieve. Similarly, shooters like Steph Curry see their three-point average rise further. The duration of the bonus and its effectiveness obviously depend on the technical characteristics of an athlete: the stronger, the better. But don't expect special effects or otherworldly things at the NBA Jam: the athlete in this state experiences a sort of temporary exaltation, a competitive trance that multiplies his forces and some of his parameters, and allows him to get the best out of his main features. Momentum is an important element in the game economy of NBA 2K19, but it works without excesses and without unbalancing certain game mechanics. However, we have other improvements in the mechanics related to shots and steals. In the first case there is a new meter, a vertical bar next to the player's hands which must be filled just before releasing the button with the correct timing to make a great shot; in the second, thanks to a special algorithm that calculates the level of vulnerability in the control of the ball by the athlete who is in possession of it, it is now possible to intervene to steal the ball from an opponent who is distracted or who does not protect it adequately when dribbling, pact to choose the time well. This aspect, combined with an improved general management of the defense under the basket (it is necessary to contain and take positionand manually by acting on the right analog, the backbone LT/L2 is no longer needed for pressing) and artificial intelligence, especially at the more advanced level of difficulty, make the experience more balanced and therefore pleasant. Watch out for strategies Each game becomes a story in itself, with NBA 2K19 that seems to want to reward ball possession, tactics, the ability to manage the ball waiting for the right moment useful for opening the defense or attempting to play, thanks to the ability to change strategy and patterns during the match of the virtual coaches and a greater awareness of the basketball players managed by the CPU on when and how to double or cut. In this sense, one-on-one situations have also been revised, which last season rewarded the attacker more to the detriment of the defender, and even the transitions seemed more logical to us both in the defensive and offensive phases, especially in the quick disposition of the athletes in their respective lanes. But we cannot close our review of NBA 2K19 without first spending a few words on the technical sector of the game. From a graphic point of view, the title of Visual Concepts is nothing short of splendid and every writing, banner, athlete, arena or shirt is reproduced with nothing short of maniacal fidelity. Even events like the All-Star Game and the NBA Summer League have been updated to the new season, visually and structurally. Furthermore, the animations of the athletes are extremely fluid and natural, and there is a new set of specific movements specially made for matches in the park or on the asphalt, and from what we have seen during our tests, also the physics for the collision detection has been improved, since we didn't experience bad clipping and clipping like we did last year, except in one circumstance between a player and an element of the basket. And then there's the soundtrack curated by American rapper Travis Scott, characterized by Rap and Hip Hop tunes as well as songs from other genres performed by the likes of Marshmello, Fall Out Boy, Migos, Jerreau, Dilated Peoples, TrippieRedd and Scott himself, with the introductory song Antidote, and Sweet sweet and the A-Team. All topped off with an excellent audio sector that can count on sound effects, music, announcements and slogans from various championships directly from the various NBA arenas and the usual television-style commentary to which this year the voice of the American basketball guru is added Bill Simmons.", "date": "2018-09-11", "grade": "9.0"}
