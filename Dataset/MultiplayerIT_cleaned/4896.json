Having reached the third episode, it would have been reasonable to expect a further step forward, perhaps accompanied by some original intuition that would reshuffle the cards a bit: instead, Robot Unicorn Attack 3 ends up reclining on itself, proposing a humor that begins to make a little ' the mold and above all a gameplay that does not seem to be in step with the times. Beyond jokes, memes and allusions, Robot Unicorn Attack 3 proves that it doesn't have much to say The unicorn always attacks three times That things don't go the right way in Robot Unicorn Attack 3 can be understood right away, when you realize that the text boxes that in theory would serve to illustrate the gameplay mechanics are used only to spread jokes that really leave the time they find: too busy winking and elbow-elbowing, the software completely forgets to explain to the user what the dynamics that revolve around the classic endless runner action consist of, leaving him in a situation of total confusion. Between Golden Fairies, Unicorn Tears, Sparkling Blasts, Soul Crystals, Mystic Forges, Explosive Declines and a seemingly endless series of nonsensical (but hilarious!) names it's really hard to figure out where the Adult Swim title is headed. until it turns out that behind this sideshow is actually a game that has few new things to say. In fact, Robot Unicorn Attack 3 makes excessive use of all those free to play mechanisms that have contributed to the unenviable reputation enjoyed by the category today: there is the dual currency system, prize chests to open, a base to expand through experience points, a section dedicated to creating new unicorns, a component reserved for weekly challenges and so on and so forth, all rigorously without a real impact on the gameplay, which always remains identical to itself despite level advancements and singing company. Each element of Robot Unicorn Attack 3 is so random that even the inevitable - and rather insistent - appeals of the software to in-app purchases or to view commercials end up falling on deaf ears, so much so that the substance does not change one iota. Whether it's stupidity on the part of the developers or a gigantic joke by Adult Swim aimed at underlining the emptiness of today's mobile gaming, it matters little: Robot Unicorn Attack 3 is a product of so much (too much) talk and very little substance, which pales in comparison. confrontation with exponents of the genre capable of addressing the issue more seriously while also managing to propose something new. This is also evident when facing the actual game, absolutely identical to the prequels in its mechanics: you have three attempts at your disposal to try to travel as far as possible on the two-dimensional scenario on which the protagonist unicorn runs, which the user can be controlled by tapping the left side of the screen to make him jump or the right side to perform a dash that doubles as an attack. To say that the Robot Unicorn Attack 3 gameplay isn't pleasant would be a lie, but everything tastes too much already seen to really capture the attention, also thanks to an audiovisual sector that does its best to eliminate any semblance of originality: the transition to graphics three-dimensional does not hide an aesthetic that is indistinguishable from the previous episodes, with robots, rainbows and dolphins accompanying the race of the mythological quadruped, and even the musical background does not dare to change an iota, proposing for the umpteenth time the repetition to exhaustion of Always by Erasure.", "date": "2017-05-05", "grade": "6.0"}
