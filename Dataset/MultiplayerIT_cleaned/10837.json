{"name": "La prima volta nei cieli di Tom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-hawx-recensione.html", "text": "Having placed the discreet EndWar in the archives, Ubisoft seems willing to continue the expansion work that involves the products of the series inspired by Tom Clancy's novels. The various Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell have all followed their own path, which has led them to evolve both in technical solutions and in gameplay, but given their popularity it would have been stupid not to use them to drive some completely new franchise. This is precisely the case of Tom Clancy's HAWX, developed by the same team responsible for Blazing Angels. In the game you play as Captain David Crenshaw, who at the beginning of the story works together with his team for the US Army, until the division is dismantled. At this point he agrees to work for a private company called Artemis, which thanks to an international treaty can place its arsenal at the service of anyone who requests it and is willing to pay for it. Crenshaw and his companions distinguished themselves for their mission skills and led the Artemis to become a world point of reference in the field of private armies, so much so that the state of Mexico soon requested its services. That's when things start to go wrong... Top Guns HAWX offers a campaign mode made up of nineteen stages, each of which can be played in single or cooperative multiplayer via the PlayStation Network, for up to four players (four is precisely the number of planes that make up the team led by the captain Crenshaw). Before launching into the middle of the action we will be able to attend a briefing (dubbed in Italian) in which our commander on duty will provide the details of the mission, complete with percentages relating to the number of objectives present. Once this is done, we will have to choose our plane from those available and select a subset of weapons for it. The game boasts a scoring system that ranks you up based on experience and automatically unlocks new vehicles and new equipment. The various fighters are differentiated according to speed, maneuverability and firepower, but once on a mission we won't find huge differences between one model and another, indeed the choice of aircraft will quickly become a simple formality. The control system is classic, with the left analog stick assigned to the movement and the right one used to move the shot to your liking, while the back buttons allow you to accelerate (R2), brake (L2) and adjust the yaw right (R1) or left (L1). The main keys of the Dual Shock 3 have been assigned weapons: the Circle button activates the machine gun, X the fire with the primary or secondary weapon (selectable via the d-pad), the Triangle button changes the current target and the Square button activates an assisted mode that comes in handy in certain situations. Pressing the d-pad left or right is used to order our companions to attack enemies in sight or to cover us, actions that are not always brilliantly performed. The structure of the missions does not excel due to the variety of situations proposed: very often you have to face various ~hordes~ of opponents, who make their way as soon as the previous ones are eliminated, with a ~surprise effect~ which diminishes after the second time the pattern is repeated. Other times we will find ourselves having to escort vehicles and therefore we will have to worry about their safety, intercepting any enemy before they can harm them. At the end of each internship, the total score based on the effectiveness of our intervention is displayed, as well as the ~grade~ achieved as a result. The dominion of the skies If there is a novelty introduced by HAWX, it is certainly the OFF mode, which in many ways makes air battles more spectacular and allows you to look at the game from a different angle... literally. By pressing the L2 or R2 keys twice quickly, our aircraft deactivates a sort of limiter which serves to prevent it from stalling, allowing it to perform normally impossible maneuvers, capable of giving a clear advantage over its opponents. During the OFF mode, the view switches to third person and we will therefore see the plane produce the most improbable evolutions with turns and brakes, with the controls that adapt to the new context as regards the lateral movement of the aircraft. The target locking system also changes, however, becoming decidedly more approximate than in normal flight mode: in order to be able to fire missiles against an enemy, you have to get very close and wait for the automatic sight to start.there to follow him until the lock-on. As in any such product, our adversaries will not wait for the end without reacting, but rather they will queue up and try to wipe us out with their missiles. To defend ourselves from this kind of attack we can use the flare (a burst fired from the back of the plane) or start following unusual trajectories until we are out of danger. Also in this case, we will be able to press the Square button to enter a sort of ~assisted mode~: indicators will appear on the screen to show us the movements to be made to achieve the purpose of the case. As mentioned above, all of the game's missions can be tackled with friends or strangers via PlayStation Network's online multiplayer, but it's also possible to set up deathmatches where two teams of four players go head-to-head in a scenario of your choice. Given the small number of participants, it is difficult to encounter problems due to lag, so the games take place without problems and it is possible to communicate with your teammates using the classic bluetooth headset. Technical realization The developers have done everything possible to give the locations as realistic a look as possible, working on the basis of satellite footage. However, the results obtained are fluctuating: some cities are rich and well reproduced, others are truly the fair of approximation and lack of detail. Trying to interact with the buildings you end up being very disappointed: as usual, the interactivity is completely missing, so firing missiles at the houses will not have any effect that goes beyond the classic cloud of smoke. We therefore move within completely ~aseptic~ scenarios, devoid of any mobile element other than the vehicles to be destroyed. In short, it lacks that extra something that could have pushed HAWX above any other similar product. The graphics engine always guarantees good fluidity and it is rare that it lets itself go to some uncertainty, while the creation of the planes is anonymous, with a general impression of ~fake~ which does not help at all the visual impact in the default shot. The sound sector stands out for the quality of the music (with a strongly ~cinematographic~ cut), for the realism of the effects and for a localization that appears well cared for and professional. Comment Tom Clancy's HAWX is clearly an experimental product, the first episode of a franchise that could enrich the Ubisoft catalog from now on in the form of a fixed appointment, like the various Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six. For a debut, things didn't go badly: the gameplay is solid even if it lacks original gimmicks, while the OFF mode brings to light still unexpressed potential, which if well developed in the future could even surprise us. For now, the impression is that of being faced with the classic ~I would like but I can't~, with many limits and a technical sector that sometimes shows something good and sometimes something less good. The background story is interesting, with the usual political fiction plots so dear to Tom Clancy, but it is told through sequences that are anything but spectacular, while the missions fail to break away from the canons we are used to. In short, HAWX is an arcade shooter without infamy or praise, which could win you over or leave you indifferent depending on your tastes. Pros Some really detailed locations Good number of missions and well integrated multiplayer Some interesting ideas Against Often repetitive action Upgradable aircraft construction Severely limited multiplayer", "date": "2009-03-06", "grade": null}
