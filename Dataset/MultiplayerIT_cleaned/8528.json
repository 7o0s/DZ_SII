{"name": "Il viaggio dell'Arisen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/103332-dragons-dogma-il-viaggio-dellarisen.html", "text": "A day like many others at Capcom. Who to call for a new fantasy RPG to rival Western staples? Let's take Hyroiuki Kobayashi, historical producer of series such as Resident Evil and Dino Crisis, put Kento Inoshita, a name inextricably linked to Monster Hunter, next to him, and let Hideaki Itsuno (Devil May Cry) direct everything. Add a team of 150 and three years of hard work, what do we get? The biggest challenge of the Japanese house since its inception. Dragon's Dogma is the son of many things, probably of the success of Bethesda, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. It is the declaration of intent of the whole of Japan, of the desire to renew itself and get out of the suffocating patterns of the oriental RPG, and to do this we need a new identity. Who better than the house in Osaka, so lucky in nailing new intellectual properties can win this bet? We finally managed to play the definitive code, available in a few days in all stores, let's find out if they succeeded. The wings of Freedom Every self-respecting great fairy tale has a beginning, and this beginning usually has very small dimensions, such as the beloved Cassardis, the village where we begin our adventure. The placid monotony of the days is disturbed by the arrival of a terrible red dragon, which, not content with scaring the villagers to death, decides to take away our precious heart as well. A bad story? It depends on your point of view. Still amazed to find ourselves alive despite the deprivation, we discover that we are the chosen ones with a special bond with the legendary creature, but with details that we will only discover through a long journey in the lands of Gransys, the game world. Assuming the new identity of Arisen, we leave the doors of our home for the first time, but if the future and destination are uncertain, our company is not. An Arisen is not such without its main pawn, or pawn, a faithful servant ready to follow and protect it in any situation and better still, we decide its appearance and character ourselves through a complete editor. What follows is a series of functional missions to learn the dynamics of the game, which translate into some inevitably linear hours. Once you get to Gran Soren, the main city of the world, however, things change and it is at this point that the true soul of Dragon's Dogma reveals itself to the player, churning out an open world of considerable size, fully explorable and without particular limits. The impact refers to Bethesda and its The Elder Scrolls, there is no doubt, with a scenario particularly close to Oblivion. We then see beautiful clearings, lush green forests and poignant cliffs overlooking the ocean. If we had to imagine a temperature for the world of Gransys we would certainly be very far from the harsh climate of a Skyrim, so much so as to entice you to immediately dive into the sea, an irresistible urge on the part of the writer when he tries his hand at this kind of title, don't ask yourself the Why. And right here comes one of the bad news, interaction with the liquid is not foreseen except in an extremely moderate way, on pain of being magically teleported to the shore after being attacked by some mysterious force. Too bad, but there's so much more to love about Capcom's latest effort. Never again alone It is impossible to continue the review without talking in detail about the pawns, one of the peculiar characteristics of this production and the ideal point of connection with the Monster Hunter saga. In addition to the main pawn, the Arisen can recruit two others to compose a party of four elements. The choice is much more than vast, in addition to the myriad of characters that can be recovered in the game world (for a fee), through the use of a special stone we enter a persistent online dimension, used as a real market for tokens to be shared with other users. That's not all, the spectrum of possibilities expands further since anyone can borrow our pawn to upgrade it or equip it with exclusive items, or buy it in all respects. The process is facilitated by an impressive search engine, which allows you to choose class, gender and skill level (in case be prepared to shell out considerable sums). The validity of this idea is appreciable only after several hours spent in the world of Gransys: in contrast with the oriental role-playing game school, where a natural empathy with the characters is developed, Dragon's Dogma contrasts a frenetic exchange of elements in the party, linked to situations and needs. As a general rule it is nenecessary to compose a versatile group, made up of different classes. Each presents a specific offensive behavior that the player must make the most of if he is to have any hope of emerging unscathed from the many fights. The warriors obviously prefer white weapons and throw themselves headlong into the fight, while the magicians keep their distance using healing or elemental magic. Also in the management of the classes, the Capcom RPG is characterized by a dizzying eclecticism: by spending the experience points we can even change them at will among the nine available, including the really interesting mixed classes, able to offer an excellent balance. The token exchange system certainly has side effects on the player's emotional involvement, thanks to the bland general design and a little more than specious story, even if the numerous textual dialogues of the characters are made in a truly commendable way, so much so that they are remembered in several occasions a real MMORPG. Xbox 360 goals Dragon's Dogma features the classic 1000 player points, divided into 50 objectives. Half of these are related to the main story, while it is possible to acquire the rest by carrying out various tasks, from researching all the locations on the map to typically Japanese follies, such as dressing a male character in female clothes, in order to obtain the prestigious achievement A Queen's Regalia! Walking is good Dragon's Dogma focuses heavily on the combat system, so much so as to resize the role-playing elements, which are present but never invasive. Despite the clear inspiration, any comparison with the Bethesda productions is absolutely out of place, the insights on the perks gained in the many editions of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout being completely absent. In the Capcom title we limit ourselves to associating special moves that can be purchased in shops to the keys of the pad, making everything similar to a gigantic and elaborate hack and slash. However, it is precisely on this occasion that we can admire the work done by Japanese programmers. Taking advantage of the MT Framework proprietary graphics engine, particularly suitable for managing considerable physics, the title offers an often surprising sense of corporeity, thanks to the splendidly made animations (forgive some typically Japanese licenses), with the result of offering fights that are not only satisfying to see, but just as engaging to play. It is possible to lift enemies, hold them to offer their bodies to companions and even climb on larger ones, such as giants or hydras, to look for their weak point. The downside is a sense of chaos that is sometimes annoying, given that in the myriad of opponents you often receive blows from unknown directions, which can be mitigated by acquiring special moves, but the fact remains that those who choose a class without a shield must be very careful not to expose yourself excessively. This ends up exacerbating what turns out to be more of a feature, rather than a flaw. The world of Gransys is far from hospitable despite appearances, with dangers lurking around every corner. We have already mentioned in our preview the dangerousness of the nights, characterized by limited visibility which forces the use of the lantern, to be recharged with the appropriate oil, as well as the absence strongly desired by Itsuno of fast travel. The latter can be solved by purchasing or collecting rare and limited items in the game, such as special stones, but this does not detract from the need for developers to give a decisive cut to production. The result is that in Dragon's Dogma you die a lot, sometimes without understanding why, often for simple villainy in exploring without too many precautions, but on the other hand this was the precise will of the producer: to emphasize the adventure and the dynamics from action RPGs. In short, you have understood the hint: save often. Unfortunately, the graphics engine is not free from defects, slowdowns and tearing are frequent, so as to force us to lower the resolution of the dashboard to 720p to reduce its intensity. On the other hand, nothing can be done to eliminate the black bars which significantly reduce the visual area and probably testify to a not without difficulty processing, see also the often cumbersome menus and the coarse graphical interface. The main mode is very long, well over thirty hours, with the secondary missions that mix seamlessly with the main quest, scenarios that alternate the world map with the inevitable dungeons and as spectacular as they are endless boss fights, including a griffin and a gigantic hydra. Once everything is finished, the additional mode always remainsin co-op called Ur-Dragon, which unfortunately we could not test due to the servers not yet functioning.
