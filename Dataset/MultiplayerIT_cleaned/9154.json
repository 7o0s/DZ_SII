In short, whether you've stayed at home or have already left for the holidays, chances are you've already hung up your backpack, saying goodbye to studying for a while. Too bad that the Kairosoft developers have the brilliant idea of ruining your summer by bringing you back to school, and indeed giving you the possibility of always carrying in your pocket that wonderful world made of books, boring teachers, notes and class assignments. happy? All on repeat Entitled Pocket Academy, the new game from the authors of Game Dev Story is, once again, a small themed management system that differs very little from the previous titles created by the Japanese development team in terms of graphics, interface and rules. If the bizarre Hot Springs Story put us to grips with the management of a spa, this time a setting is certainly more digestible for a western audience. Once you have chosen the name of your school and the uniforms that the students will wear, you can immediately begin to enrich the structure with new services and research rooms to be filled by hiring new teachers specialized in various subjects. Predictably, everything is aimed at skyrocketing pupils' performance and making one's academy the best on the market, facing numerous expenses but constantly trying not to end the year in bankruptcy. A system of characteristics and attributes very similar to that of Game Dev Story allows to understand in which subjects a student excels and in which he performs less, so as to allow the player to decide whether to remedy the gaps, and thus have a more homogeneous profile, or whether to bet everything on its strengths and perhaps end up with a battle machine to win all the math tests among the members of the various schools. However, Pocket Academy finds a way to offer a charismatic, fun and carefree experience, thanks to a whole series of little gems and side activities that make school life always full of surprises. Of course, you have to have the patience to get over a rather slow start before you can get into the real game, but then you end up enjoying the botany lessons, the formation of learning clubs or the New Year festivals, while the days of the students are full of friendships and little crushes. From many points of view, therefore, Kairosoft's new management system certainly proves to be more elaborate than Game Dev Story and Hot Springs Story, better articulating the customization of the characters seen in the first and deepening more the interaction with the environment already anticipated by the second. It is no coincidence that most of the time is spent building gardens and planting trees in the schoolyard, or if in one way or another one ends up becoming attached to one's students and being a little proud or disappointed on the basis to their academic performance. There are also some unforeseen events and accidents that end up slowing down or affecting the school year, just as we have already seen in the team's past games. Yet we cannot turn a blind eye to the disengagement of the developers who, once again, have preferred to recycle and adapt the same engine used for all its previous games: let it be clear, the improvements are there and by now we almost forget that it is an engine born for older generation mobile phones, but it is really a pity that the opportunity is not taken to experiment and exploit the connectivity of the iPhone and iPod Touch in an innovative way. How funny would it have been to send an Erasmus student to a friend's school, see him come back after a few months and hear him say ~That school sucks. I'm happy to be back~?
