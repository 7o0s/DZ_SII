{"name": "Days of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/days-of-war-recensione.html", "text": "Our review of Days of War comes a few days after the publication of the awaited version 2.0 of what is a classic objective shooter set in the Second World War by Driven Arts, developed with the explicit aim of refreshing, without distorting, a genre still popular. Closed maps, well-known weapons and positions to conquer and defend are the fulcrum of the gameplay, but to make it more articulated we find six classes with weapons to be unlocked by accumulating experience points, bullet penetration based on the material, blood and matchmaking. Maps, gameplay and arsenal of a shooter that wants to be a classic Funded through Kickstarter, Days of War looks to titles such as Day of Defeat with the aim of giving a more evolved outline to the classic gameplay based on rapid sprinting, skill in using aimless fire and lethal snipers. On the other hand, it is a formula that has a large following, but is still tied to outdated graphics engines that are really too difficult for some to digest. And it is here that the guys from Driven Arts take the field who, while not aiming for jaw-breaking graphics, still give us convincing and detailed glimpses scattered across twelve maps that take us from Europe to the Western Front between industrial ports, towns of all kinds and snowy neighborhoods. In some cases the spaces are decidedly narrow, but there is no shortage of squares, avenues and hidden windows that open onto bridges, railway depots, river crossings and military installations. Well-known scenarios in which two teams of up to 16 players collide starting from the opposite sides of maps of various sizes, although closed and bound by precise paths that lead us to control points, with corridors to defend and optimal positions for snipers. And it is here that all the merits and all the defects of both the formula and the title emerge, improved in this new version but still in progress as is evident from the balancing of the weapons, between excessive recoils and exaggerated damage for some automatic weapons which are decidedly advantageous in most situations. The gunplay, it must be said, is all in all faithful to the genre, but in a title of this type, detail is important to transform frustration into a desire to improve. Which is not always easy also due to several bugs and the sensation of stiffness of the movement, which is very unnatural. For someone this is not a problem, mind you, but for many others it is a fundamental detail which, together with other defects and the very long gestation of this 2.0 version, is reflected in the total number of players, limited as it is all too evident from the list of server browsers. To concentrate the players, however, the matchmaking system, introduced with version 2.0, takes care of it, which allows us to find a 16-player game in a few moments and at any time. But he often places us on servers far from home, forcing us to deal with a high ping which, with a title based on lightning-fast reflexes, becomes penalizing as is evident by trying the training mode against bots, unfortunately not very intelligent, but if nothing else effective in making us try the different classes that are differentiated by army and by weapons. We therefore find the Springfield in the hands of the American rifleman, the classic MP40 among the German ranks, various machine guns, Garand, Oberz and so on, with the pistol acting as a secondary weapon accompanied by grenades, smoke bombs and the ever-present knife. But the highlight is undoubtedly the rocket launcher which adds to the show even if it may not be digestible to everyone in a shooter with realistic ambitions where there is no trace of moving vehicles. Graphics, sound and flaws of a richer but still incomplete version Days of War takes on a heavy legacy, that of titles still played by a community that has long been waiting for an heir capable of picking up the baton to bring it into a more technically advanced context. And it is something that falls within the scope of the Driven Arts title, as we said modest but all in all successful at a glance and embellished with elements such as the perforation of materials, bodies that dismember themselves, textures in some cases quite good and discreet light effects, important in a game that on the one hand focuses on dry gameplay, but also owes a lot to the evocative setting. Also in this case some details out of place can be seen between effects that are not always of a good standard, amateur animations and interpenetrations that abound, worsening the already unconvincing close combat and creating unpleasant graphic anomalies when the heavy machine gunner is placed on the groundra with his weapon. Nonetheless, conquering points by killing opponents or conquering key positions, indicated with the classic flag, remains pleasant, thanks to the levels to be accumulated to unlock weapons, with the evolution of the soldiers which for many players is a significant added value for a title that despite the only available mode, however functional when the competitive ones arrive, can be defined as rich in content with sixty weapons, six classes, four factions and twelve maps in some cases well thought out. The port, it must be said, left us indifferent, but we had fun between the streets of Leningrad and Kaysersberg, with the latter being among the most convincing also for its graphic rendering thanks to several watercourses that flow credibly in a snowy and suggestive town. And it is undoubtedly possible to do even better with the editor, among other things complete with integration with the Steam Workshop, thanks to a graphics engine which, although not futuristic, returns, as we have already said, a solid visual rendering. All this, however, is not enough to redeem Days of War from obvious shortcomings which also include an audio sector that is nothing short of fluctuating. The main theme and some effects, such as the magazine of the Garand, are spot on, but the sound of the blows is flat, the vocal samples sparse and the actual quality of the sound far from exceptional. Furthermore, moving on to the controls, we notice shortcomings such as specific settings for the aiming mode and independent values to calibrate the sensitivity of the two mouse axes and it is something that surprised us, negatively, in a title that instead includes full support for ultrawide monitors, even for the very uncommon 32:9 panels. On the other hand we're talking about a very small development team that is grappling with a genre that might seem simple at first glance, but which thrives on details that we hope will become more and more cared for. On the other hand, version 2.0 represents a big improvement over the alpha, even if the current version can easily be defined as a beta. But a solid base is important and with the right refinements it can become interesting, as long as the community, which has been around for three years and is increasingly small, survives.", "date": "2020-02-04", "grade": "6.5"}
