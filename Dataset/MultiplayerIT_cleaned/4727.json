It is a drug that allows people like him to keep the synchronization with neural devices under control; after all, Daniel is an Observer, an agent with the ability to connect to the minds of others to extract the information necessary for the purposes of his investigations. After an update from the police station on the latest episodes of uncontrolled violence, typical of a society where inequalities are too marked to be tolerated, the man receives a mysterious call from his son Adam, who he hasn't heard in years. He tells him he's gotten into trouble and needs help, but it's all very strange: the phone call comes from a shabby building on the outskirts of the city, and that will therefore be our first stop. I've seen things... The mechanisms of Observer are very similar to those of Layers of Fear, the previous title of Bloober Team, and also structurally the two games have several points in common. However, Daniel Lazarski's bionic eyes allow you to experience new situations, interacting with the scenarios in a new way: pressing the right analog stick on its axis activates the infrared to see in the dark, while the right and left backbones respectively start the improved vision and biovision: the first allows us to identify electronic devices and possibly initiate hacking procedures, while the second traces biological signs at crime scenes and analyzes them to provide us with information on the victims and/or aggressors. The way in which the investigations are conducted in the game is very reminiscent of the solutions adopted by Rocksteady for Batman: Arkham Knight, but in fact the development team seems to have drawn on various productions for this new project: Orwell's 1984, mentioned several times, but also Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. In his search for his son, Lazarski comes across a trail of corpses and clearly wants to figure out who killed those people and why. So he uses his special ability, connects to the minds of the victims (whether they are still alive or already deceased, although this eventuality is expressly prohibited by police procedures) and there he faces more or less troubled and obscure paths depending on the case. These ~dream~ journeys are almost always marked by a peculiar imaginary, all the more disturbed the closer one gets to the perpetrator of the murders. It happens in this juncture of having to solve puzzles or simply having to complete a journey that culminates with a revelation: a place to reach, the face of a loved one, a numerical code or something else. It will be up to us to incorporate this information and use it to proceed in the adventure. Detective Stone Daniel Lazarski's voice is that of Rutger Hauer, and this choice by Bloober Team alone is enough to create a good 70% of the atmosphere of Observer, while the remaining 30% is due to a sound design specifically designed to always keep high voltage. In reality, however, one rarely feels really in danger: when the protagonist of the game connects to the neural chip of the victims, one is well aware that what will happen from then on will be something different from reality, although some sequences they see us avoiding a mysterious biomechanical monster in search of an escape route, returning a game over if caught. The same need to inject a dose of Synchrozine from time to time does not make things particularly complex, also because the vials of the drug are found in discrete abundance around the locations. This approach makes the experience closer to that of an interactive story, if you will, even if there are occasions in which we are asked to touch the settings with our hands, activate switches, talk to possible witnesses and even flee while someone chases us. In short, compared to Layers of Fear, the authors have enriched the puzzle component and lengthened the campaign in general, which we completed within six hours but which would have to be replayed from scratch to be able to access both possible endings and discover secret areas. However, the feeling is that some ~dreams~ are dragged on for a bit, ending up losing their initial charm and revealing the obvious budget limits of the project. In fact, from a technical point of view, Observer behaves as expected: well-made and generally detailed environments, with very interesting peaks, but very few characters, ugly and with mediocre animations. So leave egI regretted the impossibility of running the game on the test configuration at real 4K, with all the settings at maximum, without running into heavy frame rate drops. However, we appreciated the option that allows you to scale the resolution while leaving the output intact, in practice a checkerboard rendering that maintains the 2160p net of excellent and constant fluidity.", "date": "2017-08-14", "grade": "7.8"}
