Indeed, let's say better, Fight the Dragon is entirely focused on its community: the developers let themselves be followed step by step in the realization process, they listened to the players on practically all aspects of the production, finally they gave it an easy and versatile editor and they left him the burden of generating their adventures, as well as the various decorative elements of the characters (faces, hair and body). All of this makes up a large chunk of the game. Indeed, let's say better: most of Fight the Dragon, given that there is no real single player campaign and you are limited to selecting an adventure from time to time to place on a map, which will make up the our personal history. In reality, there is a main objective: to kill a very powerful dragon locked up in an arena. Mind you that it is impossible to do it with a single attempt and with a low-level character, but you will have to face him several times slowly draining all his energy (the dragon does not recharge after he has killed us). Adventures and dragons to slay have only one great goal: the collection of ever more powerful equipment. To the adventure! Let's say that in essence we have already told you the philosophy of Fight the Dragon, but there are other more practical elements that must be considered. The action is framed from a bird's eye view, with the camera following us and moving as needed, depending on where we are. If desired, we can also rotate it, perhaps to see what's behind a covered wall or spy in a niche, or simply to better understand what's happening. The game dynamics are really very simple: once you have created a character, which can be defined by class and appearance, you set off weapons in hand to conquer the loot, fighting like in any action role-playing game (you can use mouse and keyboard a joypad to play games). Heroes have a basic attack, a more powerful attack and some special attacks that are unlocked by leveling up. There are the classic health and stamina bars, four features to manage as you level up, an inventory that is always too small to carry the garbage found around the maps, health and stamina potions and so on. When the inventory is full, you can abandon excess items on the street, or you can give them to an altar to get points to spend on more powerful items or characteristic improvements. The enemies are taken from the catalog of the perfect fantasy game and range from classic skeletons to classic zombies, passing through classic trolls, classic demons and so on. There is no shortage of classic necromancers and classic sorcerers. Normally during the adventures you just beat up, but in some cases it will be required to solve very simple puzzles, such as placing barrels on plates connected to mechanisms or finding a colored key to open a barred door. There's also the ability to jump between nearby platforms, just to add a Super Mario feel to the game. The adventures can be tackled alone or in company, with the second possibility increasing the difficulty of the maps. Fight the Dragon idly fights his battle. Let's find out why. The Tears of the Dragon Unfortunately Fight the Dragon has its nice flaws. The most obvious is that its very structure determines some major limitations. The individual adventures quickly lose meaning, unrelated as they are to an organic campaign, and become just scenarios for going around hunting for objects. A few hours are enough for the gameplay to start wrapping itself up, a victim of the underlying repetitiveness that characterizes it. Of course, there is always the motive of killing the dragon to push him to return to the game to power up and level up, so as to take away more and more life points and maybe see him dead, but as you will understand it is a medium intensity call, which becomes increasingly weak over the long distance. Some map makers have tried to make more complex and interesting scenarios, but the game mechanics don't allow you to go too far beyond the basic formula. For example, we tried some maps full of suspended platforms and pitfalls. At first glance they seemed nice to us, but they soon brought out all the limits of the system, because the jumps are not very precise, with the characters taking flight as soon as they touch the edge of a platform, and we often found ourselves dead without a true why. It must also be said that a gameor based almost entirely on maps drawn by the community at length showing obvious quality problems. Sometimes we have had beautiful adventures, designed with great care, but often we have come across mediocre creations that we couldn't wait to finish and move on to something else. In short, in general there is a great lack of quality content created by the developers, who limited themselves to fulfilling the wishes of the community by putting little of their own into it. Another problem, not solved by the Early Access version, is that some monsters get stuck in the objects of the scenario. The most affected by this syndrome, fortunately occasional, seem to be the bosses. It happens especially when the incautious author of the map has decided to place it in a narrow environment and with a few objects too many to make life impossible for him. Thus it happens to find yourself with immobile enemies who try to cross walls or altars or tables or whatever. Frankly it's not a big deal, since the goal is just to kill them as soon as possible to see if they have any objects on them, but it's fair to report it.", "date": "2014-12-18", "grade": "6.0"}
