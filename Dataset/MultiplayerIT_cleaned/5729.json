It must be admitted, however, that lately the British developer has made an effort to differentiate the offer, especially since he has increased the production of tie-ins inspired by the most popular brands married to the very famous Danish brick factory. It all started with LEGO Star Wars eleven years ago, and in the meantime we've moved on to Indiana Jones, Batman, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and, of course, DC and Marvel superheroes. To the latter, TT Games has dedicated one of its best productions, that LEGO Marvel Super Heroes that a couple of years ago had delighted us thanks to many innovations in terms of presentation and gameplay. Here, the same cannot be said for the new LEGO Marvel's Avengers, and in our review we will explain why it left us with a bad taste in our mouths. LEGO Marvel's Avengers is one step ahead and two steps behind TT Games' best tie-ins Flying monkeys If in LEGO Batman and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes the path of the unpublished script had been attempted, complete with spoken dialogues instead of the grunts present in the first games of the series, in LEGO Marvel's Avengers we return to the most classic cinematic spoofs such as LEGO The Lord of the Rings or LEGO Jurassic Park: Intermission cinematic sequences play out  in bricks, of course! - the most important scenes of the films, however seasoned with visual gags and a situational humor which, this time, seemed a little too forced at times. The constant presence of drinks and snacks to make the characters sillier, for example, gets boring quickly, and the general impression is that TT Games hasn't managed to perfectly balance the film's more serious moments with their parodies. However, there are gags that elicit laughter, such as the Hulk taking selfies or Agent Coulson who laughs while Iron Man and Cap give him up for dead, but they are small pearls in a generally subdued comedy. The problem, however, is not only this. The narrative sector, in LEGO Marvel's Avengers, is basically a big mess in various respects. TT Games, to begin with, has adapted only a fraction of the films that make up so-called ~phases~ one and two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: the two Avengers, of course, and the two Captain Americas, as well as Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark world. Everyone else, including the excellent Guardians of the Galaxy and various TV series like Agent Carter and Daredevil, stayed out of the picture. The reason could be found in the possibility of a future sequel and in the way in which the developer of Beaconsfield has structured the adventure. Instead of giving players free choice in the order in which to tackle the various levels, TT Games has opted for a script that is very inspired on paper, but which in practice left us dumbfounded. It being understood that it would not be logical to play LEGO Marvel's Avengers without having seen the corresponding films - to begin with, the sense of parody would be lost - the story develops in a kind of interlocking flashback: it begins with the prologue of Age of Ultron, then passes to recount all of the first Avengers, pausing to recall the events of Captain America: The First Avenger with a couple of internships. Once the Avengers levels are completed, Age of Ultron can continue and conclude, while Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Iron Man 3 act as subsidiary chapters. The idea, as we said, isn't bad at all, but it loses cohesion because of the script: the jokes are the original ones, but the writers have reduced or altered them chronologically, which makes one turn up a bit if one knows the adapted films. For our part, we Italians got an even shorter straw. The English-language edition of the game slavishly reproduces the audio tracks of the films, so much so that the sound quality is not exactly the best, and there would already be something to say about this. In Italian, on the other hand, only a few lines have been extrapolated from the films - those of Captain America, for example - and most of them have been re-dubbed by actors who not only have nothing to do with the voices we now know by heart, after well twelve films, but who also do a mediocre job, completely getting the tone of many lines wrong, so much so that some take on completely different meanings, when they don't directly ruin the gags. The irony is that the Italian adaptation has recruited famous dubbers such as, for example, Pasquale Anselmo, Federica De Bortoli and Marco Vivio to lend their voices again to Phil Coulson, Maria Hill and Steve Rogers in the case of unpublished jokes (Coulson and Hill, for that matter, make usoften as navigators during the adventure) while the new Italian voices of characters such as Nick Fury, Hawkeye, the Black Widow and Bruce Banner are completely different from what we have heard in the films. Playstation 4 trophies There are 31 bronze, 5 silver and 4 gold trophies to unlock in LEGO Marvel's Avengers, plus the platinum trophy. Unlocking them is not a titanic undertaking, it just takes a little patience, and fans of the series will already know that you have to complete the campaign, discover all the secret collectibles and collect every minifig in the game. Superheroes in New York? Do me the pleasure! After ten years and more of tie-ins in LEGO sauce, we doubt it is necessary to explain how to play LEGO Marvel's Avengers, but it is worth pointing out that little or nothing has changed compared to previous TT Games productions. Once again we will have to destroy everything we can to collect bricks as we complete the levels, choosing the right characters to solve simple environmental puzzles based on the specific abilities of the individual heroes. Captain America can activate special switches with his shield, Thor can overload circuits, Black Widow can hack terminals, Hulk smashes and so on. By completing the levels and spending the collected bricks we will unlock new characters to use in the New York free roam accessible once the main campaign is completed, where we will be able to face many side missions to unlock even more minifigs, vehicles, costumes and never-ending goodies. Fans of the series will know very well that a LEGO game can last dozens of hours, especially if you want to discover every single secret, from the red bricks to poor Stan Lee hidden in the various levels. In short, the proposal is the usual, rich and long-lived, but there are also some small innovations, in terms of gameplay, which deserve to be mentioned. Defeating enemies now loads an indicator that allows you to perform attacks that are as lethal as they are spectacular, both alone and together with another character: some of these combinations are truly exciting, and reproduce some of the most memorable scenes from the films. You know when Thor lands a hammer on Cap's shield to wipe out the HYDRA soldiers with the shockwave? It can be done here too. To counteract this novelty, however, there is the infinite regeneration of the enemies and their excessive resistance, an annoying combination especially when you are trying to solve some particularly cryptic puzzles. And they happen again; despite the icons and visual clues, not infrequently you stay still for a few moments longer than necessary trying to figure out how to get out of a room or overcome an obstacle. It is a level design problem that LEGO games have been carrying around since the days of LEGO Star Wars, and which the use of an increasingly elaborate and detailed technical sector has only cemented. That may sound like a criticism, but it's not entirely; LEGO Marvel's Avengers, in fact, is a title that certainly does not squeeze the power of the new generation consoles, but which makes character design and lego constructions its strong points, intertwining them with colorful scenarios full of details. Obviously, the soundtracks of the films of the same name and the themes that have become famous in recent years contribute to involving the players and fans of the Avengers, starting with the now iconic reason by Alan Silvestri. All right, then? No, not really. If we don't feel like criticizing a formula that, no matter how much it's seen and overseen by now, always manages to entertain thanks to the addition of some small novelties, especially if you play in split-screen with a friend, we have to admit that we were absolutely stunned in the face of the double recycling of assets operated by TT Games to develop this tie-in. The New York that we can explore in free roam mode is practically the same already sieved in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes two years ago. In place of the X-Mansion, the OsCorp building or the Baxter Building, anonymous buildings have been placed in respect of the orphaned Marvel Cinematic Universe of the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and (for now) Spider-Man, but apart from these small differences the city, visually and structurally, is almost the same. This obviously means that the roster of characters has also lost dozens of minifigs compared to LEGO Marvel Super Heroes: to compensate for their lack, TT Games has fished out of the boundless Marvel multiverse the most unlikely heroes and villains that the Avengers have ever fought in the movies and in the comics... generating once again not a little confusion, since among the heroes we can even unlock Jewel, alias Jessica Jones (sorry for the gameor words from real nerds). Considering that the cinematic Avengers already appeared in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, one can only remain dumbfounded in the face of such a striking content and visual recycling. Fortunately, all the bad comes with silver, given that TT Games has significantly improved the control system especially when driving and when flying: the frustrating time-based races of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes are now, in short, a distant memory.", "date": "2016-02-04", "grade": "7.0"}
