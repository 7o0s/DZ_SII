We sincerely do not believe that such a title, however pleasant and free, can have the ability to relaunch the brand as it deserves, but it is certainly a pleasant wait between now and the next main chapter of the series, which we imagine is currently in processing at the Finnish studio. Characterized by a design that starts from the Angry Birds movie but transforms its characters into a fanciful chibi version, the game is a puzzle game with colored bubbles, a sort of reinterpretation of the classic Puzzle Bobble but without cannons, with a of variable objectives according to the stage and the introduction of explosive bonuses when eliminating four elements or more with a single touch. The key is to succeed in the enterprise within the number of moves indicated at the top of the screen, under penalty of game over and the loss of a little heart, an aspect which practically represents the traditional energy of action and which is recharged with the passing of time. time. During our tests, however, the system has never given any problems: not only is it difficult to lose with Angry Birds Dream Blast, but it often happens that you get the timer block to play as long as you want, without limitations. Gameplay In short, Angry Birds Dream Blast presents itself as a freemium product with a very generous approach, which at least in the first few hours does not make the user crash into a paywall, rather it leads him by the hand through a very long campaign, full of stages of increasing difficulty but gradually, without sudden jumps that indicate the clear intent to monetize. As mentioned above, in each level we are set a different objective, for example the elimination of a certain amount of bubbles of a certain color, to be pursued by respecting the established number of moves. Well, by eliminating at least four bubbles at the same time we will make the iconic explosive birds appear on the board, equipped with an increasingly stronger disruptive charge and therefore able to resolve even the most complicated situations, when the scenario is invaded by bricks, chains, eggs that must reach ground and whatnot. To obtain a more powerful explosion, the characters must be touched: if we have obtained two Reds, equipped with a ~horizontal~ detonation, their fusion will give life to Chuck, which instead generates a cross-shaped explosion. Finally, putting two Chucks together will give way to the big Bomb, capable of cleaning up almost the entire screen with its own explosion. The system is therefore very simple and immediate, perhaps a little trivial in the early stages (so much so that you will hardly resort to the special consumable attacks present in the lower part of the screen) but capable of involving more when the challenge finally becomes more consistent. thanks to the introduction of obstacles, padlocks and structures with a peculiar shape. To give a hand to the gameplay there is also the excellent technical realization, which as mentioned draws on the design of the film but reworks it effectively, putting the focus on a set of splendid pastel colors and well-implemented visual effects.", "date": "2019-01-29", "grade": "7.0"}
