{"name": "Daymare: 1998", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/daymare-1998-recensione-versione-ps4.html", "text": "For gamers around the world, Shinji Mikami is and will always be the father of Resident Evil, as well as one of the greatest exponents of modern survival horror. And this is also what the guys from Invader Studios think, an Italian development team that with its Daymare: 1998, whose review you read for PS4, aims to pay homage to the main themed games of the past, with a particular eye aimed precisely at the Residents Evil curated at the time by the future founder of Tango Gameworks. Nightmares from the past That Daymare: 1998 refers to classic survival horror is evident already taking the first steps in an adventure that tells the episodic story of three characters - an elite soldier, a helicopter pilot and a ranger - grappling with the aftermath of a chemical leak from a research center located near the village of Keen Sight, which turned all employees into zombies and monstrous creatures. In fact, the game setting recalls their mechanics, and in particular those of Resident Evil 4, with the camera positioned behind the protagonist and the alternation of exploratory phases and clashes. Everything works exactly as ~then~: dark-colored settings that hide potential dangers at every corner, sinister sounds that sharpen the gut feeling that something seems to be moving in the shadows, up to the first real contacts with monsters and fights which, as the genre dictates, are initially quite simple. In reality, depending as always on the level of difficulty chosen and the phase of the adventure in which the player is, things can turn out to be a little more complicated, to the point of prompting the user to think about how to avoid waste of ammunition. Sometimes it is in fact preferable to avoid the clash in favor of a quick and ~cheap~ and healthy escape. Because to further immerse the player in an atmosphere of fear and survival, here too, following tradition, the developers have made available a limited amount of ammunition, in such a way as to ~oblige~ to dose them carefully, and enemies resistant to blows. Although to be honest it is really difficult to remain totally free of top-ups in the key moments, unless you panic. In fact, the game has a weapon feeding system which provides for the magazine to fall to the ground in the event of an attempt to rearm too quickly. A small expedient, it is true, but guessed, as it contributes not a little to increasing the tension of some moments and, at times, as written before, to favoring flight instead of fighting. One shot and gone In general, each basic enemy has a standard behavior, respecting its ~nature~ (the slow but resistant undead, the agile and aggressive monster, and so on). It's a different matter for the bosses, who unfortunately didn't convince us too much due to the lack of variety in their attack patterns. Most of them, in fact, limit themselves to attacking the protagonists head on, prompting the player to use more or less always the same tactic to shoot them down, that is, to run away, stop to fire a few shots and start running again. A real pity, because in theory it should always be a key moment in the adventure and therefore the encounter with a ~different~ enemy than usual. However, this does not mean that beating them will be child's play: thanks to a certain underlying rigidity in some movements of the protagonists, which can sometimes negatively affect the firing system, and a discreet bastardy of the opponents, some battles prove to be quite difficult to carry complete. For the rest, when you are not fighting, in Daymare: 1998 you explore the various areas in search of useful objects, ammunition and clues necessary to progress in the story, as well as to better understand some aspects. In this sense, the textual documents are the elements mainly used for the deepening of a not very original, but nice plot, whose major flaw probably lies in the fact that some of the key implications are revealed a little too quickly by the screenwriters. In any case, all the information collected, as well as the complete control of the characters and maps, is managed through the interfaces of the devices worn by the protagonists. In fact, there are no indicators on the video, even if you can activate some elements of the hud on the screen using a special option. An original idea, which increases the sense of identification. During these game sessions there is obviously no shortage of puzzles, which also recall the tradition of the genre. The puzzles are not particularly coplexes, at least for long-standing videogamers, but we liked them precisely for their ~classicism~, with their codes to decipher, the levers and buttons to press after understanding the system that regulates their mechanisms. Technical realization We close the examination of Daymare: 1998 talking about the technical part. The latter also on PlayStation 4 does not make you cry out for a miracle, revealing itself qualitatively average as the PC counterpart. However, considering that we are dealing with an independent production made by a group of about ten people, and certainly not with millions of euros of investment behind it, it remains valid all in all. In particular we liked the construction of the scenes and environments, created with extreme care, enhanced by the wise use of light sources and the subsequent play of shadows. The scenarios are then animated, and there are some that are better than others in terms of atmosphere and design. Standard are also the 3D models of the characters and the ~beasts~, which do not stand out for their artistic quality or variety of subjects, even if they perform their task fairly well. Going into detail, the zombies are well made, although the re-proposition of some models highlights the lack of a large assortment of specimens, just as good as those of the other creatures. On the other hand, the animations are disappointing, which especially in certain characters and in some of their movements pay tribute to the absence of some connecting animations. In the same way, as written before, not even most of the bosses satisfied us, which are a little too anonymous even from the point of view of aesthetic characterization. For the rest, apart from some significant frame rate uncertainty in a couple of chaotic situations, everything is handled fluidly by the engine. It goes a little better with the sound sector, where we point out, first of all, the good spoken English for some voices, such as that of the late Paul Haddad, voice actor of the Leon of Resident Evil 2, who recently passed away. Then, the audio effects are decidedly excellent, with all the sampling of grunts, sinister noises, environmental effects and anything else you could wish for in a product of this kind. Finally, the choice of Invader Studios for the songs that make up the soundtrack, curated by Alessandro Galdieri, is good, which appears quite spot on, capable as it is of adequately accompanying the moments of greater narrative tension.", "date": "2020-04-28", "grade": "7.0"}
