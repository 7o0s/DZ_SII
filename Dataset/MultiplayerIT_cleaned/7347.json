However, our hero hides an artistic soul under his hard warrior shell, and that is why one fine day he decides to transform his double ax into an electric guitar and to abandon the practice of war to devote himself completely to heavy metal: thus, when the enemies renew their siege, Brad sets out to repel them by exploiting the power of his solos... A guitar will bury you These are the bizarre premises of Bardbarian, the debut work of the small Tree Fortress team which boasts not only a convincing humor, but also and above all a decidedly original play structure: the game is in fact the result of a mixture of elements from classic two-dimensional shooters and action-RPGs, all inserted in a context close to the canons of tower defense. The goal is therefore to safeguard the integrity of the magical crystal that towers over the village, eliminating hordes of enemies determined to destroy it. However, it will not be Brad himself who will take on this burden, given that his role will be to inspire other warriors with his powerful guitar solos: as he moves on the stage, the protagonist continues to play, accumulating notes that can be spent both to summon companions, and to give them three different types of temporary bonuses (respectively to attack, speed and defense). Brad's collaborators will therefore do the dirty work, automatically attacking the closest enemies using their peculiar skills: there are, for example, the archers who compensate for their long range with a reduced damage capacity, while the magicians have a longer range reduced but are capable of injuring entire groups of monsters in a very consistent way. In all of this, the user has the task of moving the row led by Brad by simply dragging a finger across the screen, then being able to choose how to spend the notes using a convenient menu in the lower right corner. Everything works properly, and Bardbarian immediately reveals itself to be immediate, accessible and fun, managing to effectively combine mechanics that apparently would seem incompatible. Part shooter, part RPG, part tower defense: Bardbarian is an original mix of genres Just like in a classic shooter, the user must beware of projectiles launched by monsters, carefully avoiding them on pain of losing precious portions of health, an element that gives freshness to the playful action despite the game structure providing for a constant reiteration of the same scenario: progress in the adventure is marked on the basis of enemy waves, and if you die or if the crystal takes too much damage you have to start over. At this juncture, however, the more strictly RPG aspects of Bardbarian emerge: it is therefore possible to spend the money accumulated in your game sessions to buy upgrades related to the skills of the protagonist and his companions, as well as various upgrades of the same village that open the door to the most diverse bonuses. We must also acknowledge the developers for not having overplayed the hand with in-app purchases, present in moderate quantities and in any case never perceived as indispensable in order to continue. In short, even if in Bardbarian you end up doing basically the same thing, the procedure is still made pleasant by the palpable incidence of the improvements purchased, by the precise dosage of new contents and above all by a gameplay adaptable to both short and long game sessions. It also doesn't hurt that the Tree Fortress title presents itself really well, thanks to a lively and colorful two-dimensional cosmetics and an absolutely spot-on soundtrack.", "date": "2014-01-24", "grade": "8.3"}
