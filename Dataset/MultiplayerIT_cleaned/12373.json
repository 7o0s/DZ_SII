Although the game features energy bars, these only appear under damage suffered conditions, and leave the player right from the start in a game environment where no indication stands between him and the dolphin, breaking the enchantment of identification. Ecco could be defined as an original and unusual action-adventure, in which the exploratory and action elements are mixed in a series of simple puzzles, dangerous encounters and sections that require dexterity: however, the experience that is determined from the immersiveness of the interface and the type of interaction with the marine environment and its inhabitants, it cannot be classified in any videogame ~genre~. Ecco is a title whose playful pleasure is also embodied in the mere control of the dolphin in the water, in the sudden leaps that can be made out of the water, in the shots to feed on the fish and replenish the energy, in the lunges and ascents to overcome the submerged obstacles, in the sonar that returns bringing us the otherwise invisible image of the characteristics of the large surrounding environment. At the center of a storyline between environmental fable and primordial myth, Ecco, with the brand of stars on its forehead, captures the player in a videogame aquatic world that has almost the same charm as the real one. What is it today The dolphin Ecco, in search of the Vortex that deprived him of his entire population, who travels through time through underwater connections and explores the environment with sonar, preceded the monkey by a decade: well before Peter Jackson's King Kong and its ~absent~ interface, Ecco built a feeling of a relationship between game and transparent controller. This sensation, today, almost makes us regret the lack of an adaptation to the WiiMote to enjoy the leaps and leaps of the dolphin in wireless motion. But even with a normal controller Ecco has stood the test of time without a fight. Parallax layers of simple bitmap backdrops, the midi adaptation of Spencer Nilsen's melodies, a very high level fluidity, secondary details and fish fauna that are not spared create a suspension of realism that amazes if we consider the technical means of the console available of the team of Ed Annunziata and Novotrade. You don't always need photorealism or sophisticated polygons and textures, as the disappointing Dreamcast episode proves, to build a fascinating and immersive game, and Ecco is proof of how inspired design and an unconventional attitude to writing videogames can offer games that don't even have to try to resist the passing years and technical obsolescence, because they establish themselves as experiences on a par with a painting or a piece of music. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for an unusual and unconventional video game adventure. Ecco the Dolphin, published in 1992, is a fascinating, hypnotic videogame experiment that clearly testifies to what level of experimentation Sega's unforced production and innovative approach reached at the turn of the last two decades of the last century. The Novotrade title is an aquatic vertigo with an absolutely new concept and, even if its sequel refines many of the numerous unpublished solutions of the original, Ecco remains one of the best titles published for the Sega console and available on the Wii catalog (at than 800 Wii Points).", "date": "2007-04-09", "grade": null}
