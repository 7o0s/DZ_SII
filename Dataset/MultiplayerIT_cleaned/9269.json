This does not mean that you will spend all your time on the gas and autopilot, tailing and swerving which is a pleasure, but that the driving model and more generally the whole gaming experience are calibrated to never be too demanding and frustrating. Having this in mind, and freeing ourselves from any simulation / pro - arcade / casual schematism, DiRT 3 turns out to be a valid and very fun title capable of giving us many emotions, albeit confined to an area that will make die-hard rally enthusiasts turn up their noses. Rally that more than in the past edition is just one of the many specialties. Where we go? The heart of the game is the so-called Tour Dirt. It is made up of four main seasons, in addition to these we find ~freestyle~ and Gymkhana challenges located inside the Battersea compound, the decommissioned power plant made famous by the Pink Floyd Animals album cover and a whole series of long championships dedicated to individual types of races, called World Tours. The offer is very wide, the competitions and related disciplines are really many. Alongside the rally, we find the Rally Cross and Land Rush, i.e. real grand prix against eight opponents on the track, aboard rally cars, trucks (also called pick ups) and buggies. Then there are Head to Head, one-on-one races, similar to those we see at the Motor Show and TrailBlazer, sort of long point-to-point races, but aboard particularly fast and ~slippery~ cars, not exactly rallying, painted with eye-catching aerodynamic appendages, spoilers and side skirts. Up to here there are no particular changes compared to DiRT 2, the new game mode is the previously mentioned Gymkhana, which does not just make us go around the pins, in fact completely absent, but stages a series of very various. The basic concept is simple: the more ~numbers~ you make, the more points you get. In Battersea, Los Angeles or Montecarlo we find real playgrounds at our disposal, we can drift, skid while stationary or around different types of roundabouts, destroy objects or jump. This in a nutshell, because DiRT 3 complicates everything with the obvious timed challenges, races in which you have to find particular items hidden around the map, check point races and much more. In short, you don't get bored if you want to get away from mud and gravel. The progress between the various seasons (each made up of different championships) is done by accumulating reputation points which gradually open the different events. From this point of view, it's not always necessary to finish first, you just need to get the necessary points to move forward, without having too many worries about podiums and unfinished races. In addition to these races, if you play online, you will immediately find additional tracks to buy directly in the Store and in the Marketplace, a sort of instant DLC already present at the time of release, which expands the offer and fortunately does not affect the progression of the game. game. Grandpa's 131 or the Fulvietta? The level rises not only on the basis of our positioning at the end of the championship, but also on the basis of how many flashbacks we have used (there are always five), the chosen car and the overcoming of small missions, such as maximum speed or drift length. Each level rewards us with new cars, liveries and teams that ~demand~ our performance. On the car side, the developers have really included a lot of them, in addition to the aforementioned hyper-fast cars, trucks and buggies, we find the legendary Group B cars that raced between 1982 and 1992, and the best of the historic cars straddling the 60s and 90s. In short, it ranges from the Lancia Fulvia to the integral Deltone passing through the Fiat 131 and the Renault 5 Turbo, therefore a real boon for enthusiasts. In addition to these there are a whole series of modern cars, from those with official WRC license to less famous categories such as Open rally, Super Rally 2000, or the huge boats dedicated to Raid such as Hammer and various jeepponi. As with the competitions, various cars can immediately be purchased separately. Starting right from the cars, it is possible to understand the approach to racing of Codemasters. Competitions that do not include drastic restrictions on the classes they belong to, such as Rally and Head to Head, can be played with different types of cars, which dramatically increases the longevity of the title but does not ~specialize~ the cars, making them good for ~all seasons~. This simplification is also visible when we have to choose a car. The only differences are relactive to weight, power and traction, values almost always similar within the same class. Therefore, every minimum distinction for speed, grip and so on, present in the last edition, has disappeared. The differences are only noticeable when driving and these are never exaggerated: the driving model is very homogeneous, there are no - always in relation to the same category - particularly conflicting values. Therefore the minimal differences between cars disappear, but the possibility of being able to act on the mechanics of the same remains, a tuning relative to the strictly indispensable (as in the previous edition) which sees us act on lift, height from the ground, suspensions, differential and so on, and which manages to distinctly vary the behavior of the car. Tuning therefore that works but which is not essential in the light of some choices that we will see later. It is then possible to decide whether to activate the ABS and the stability control, but the impression is that with or without it is only perceptible in extreme conditions, when atmospheric conditions such as pouring rain and snow storms come into play, which make the cars ~lighter~ and decidedly less reactive. Or when you take to the track in Rally Cross races, where several races take place on asphalt (someone said Monte Carlo?), where power oversteers and tire lockups are the order of the day. Track yourself The game takes us around the world making us run in the most diverse places. Finland, Kenya, Norway and Michigan host the rally and Trailblazer races, while snow-covered Aspen, the ~country dirt road~ Smelter, Monte Carlo and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum are the venues for the Rally Cross, Head to Head racing, and truck and buggy racing. It goes without saying that each place is made up of different routes (Finland has eight of them, as well as Kenya and Michigan), and thanks also to the possibility of running in different weather conditions, by night or by day, at dusk or evening, it will be possible to keep the repetitiveness factor below the danger level. The pleasure of driving at sunset It almost seems that DiRT 3 is undecided about what it really wants to be. It leaves the settings, albeit basic, but it doesn't let us understand the behavior of the car when choosing it. It gives us the possibility to activate the aids, but they are not so important in terms of the level of difficulty and the learning curve. These ~preemptive indecisions~ are entirely justified in light of the driving model. As written at the beginning, DiRT 3 is entirely devoted to an ~arcade~ type of use, and not because you race with your eyes closed but because the driving model perfectly manages to mediate between the skill in knowing how to brush the curves, in the partialization of gas and in the use of the handbrake, with a gaming experience that is never too punitive and extremely rewarding, which never exacerbates the errors caused by a happy driving by the pilot. In short, one always has the impression that the camera can always be resumed, the game tolerates imprudence and clean cuts, the brutal openings are never catastrophic, the pendulum effect, unless you exaggerate with the pressure on the stick, is not something with which we often have to deal, in the same way the various types of surfaces affect adherence without however ever distorting the way in which we run. However, such a choice is weighed down by two external factors. The desire to be suitable for everyone, enhancing driving pleasure, has imposed a difficulty that is certainly not very high. At an average level, three out of six, you manage quite easily to get to the top, to struggle practically only in a few specialties. Our invitation is to set at least the difficulty to four, and raise it when necessary in short. Secondly, the flashbacks, or the possibility of rewinding time thus avoiding errors, drastically cut the tension in traveling the longest tracks in apnea. The game invites us not to abuse them, since the less you use them, the more reputation points you earn, but it is useless to underline how useful they can be in case of fatal mistakes. The flashbacks also lead us to consider the excellent mechanical and aesthetic model of the damage. Crashes damage cars realistically, and they warp and lose parts convincingly. A simple impact against a wall is enough to render the machine useless, losing power or skidding dangerously. In short, the damage is serious and progressive in the right way. Replays then save us when the car is ~crippled~, penalizing a well-implemented crash system. Summing up, the sensations that DiRT 3 gives us are undoubtedly very pleasant, the game is really funto and most likely its best parts are not exactly the rallying ones, but the track races, with their exciting mix of drifts, doors and overtaking on the strait, which enhance the driving model of the game. Then the ~problem~ of the second chapter returns with great fanfare. The rally is just one of the many ingredients of the dish cooked by Codemasters and not necessarily the best, always in a context of excellence. Lovers of WRC orthodoxy are warned: if they put aside preconceptions and mental closures, they will find a slap-top title on their hands. In closing, it is right to say a few words about artificial intelligence. In point-to-point races, increasing the level of difficulty obviously corresponds to better times than the opponents, while on the track the cars behave in a credible and realistic manner, fighting and creating tussles, while not giving up, except in the case of (frequent ) mistakes the ideal trajectory. Xbox 360 goals DiRT 3 rewards the player with 50 achievements. They're pretty much all related to progression in the game. They are obtained by leveling up, playing with or without hints, points and medals earned in gymkhanas. There are also achievements for online game modes. A spectacular picture On the multiplayer side, for up to eight players, we find all the game modes of the Tour, in which they participate for the increase in reputation points. We can race alone or in team events and if, on the other hand, they feel like abandoning point-to-point racing and real grand prix altogether, it is possible to take part in the Party mode, made up of ~light~ events such as Transporter, a reinterpretation of the classic Capture the Flag which invites unbridled races and bank runs, Invasion which requires us to destroy hardcover robots that have ~invaded~ the planet, Infection in which a lethal virus puts us in the shoes of the infected and those who want to escape the contagion, pushing hard with the wide angle and turning the screen green. Really fun modes that work and can be a valid alternative to the serious classic types. Also interesting is the possibility of posting one's adventures directly on YouTube. Cosmetically speaking DiRT 3 is a real show. Codemasters' work is virtually flawless, although sporadic frame-rate issues remain in the heat of circuit racing with seven other opponents on track. For the rest, one is often amazed, one immediately appreciates the greater detail, both on the cars and above all on the elements on the side of the track, which draw a picture in which there is virtually no difference between main and secondary elements of the staging. Another point to praise is the modeling of the vehicles, meticulous and hyper-detailed, which also reveals parts hidden behind small air intakes, such as the fans in the trunk of some cars, and which is not afraid of destroying the vehicles piece by piece. However, the effects sector stands out above all, with light effects based on the time of departure, refraction and above all particle effects that take your breath away. Running in the middle of a blizzard, trying to survive the dust raised by the challenges on clay, under torrential rains or at night in the moonlight, skirting the yachts in Monte Carlo while colorful fireworks explode in the sky is a beautiful experience, which more often than not it will lead us astray, luckily there is a flashback button. Among so much beauty, however, it is necessary to underline the really unnerving slowness of the loads between races. Our code, final but for debug console, didn't allow us to install, so we don't know in this sense how the version that will arrive in stores will behave. We hope that this problem, if it persists, can find a solution.", "date": "2011-05-20", "grade": "9.0"}
