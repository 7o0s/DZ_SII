Thus it happens that a man without particular combat skills but with an innate sense of business (the player) can become a tireless conqueror of treasures by exploiting the mania for this extraordinary drink, which drives beefy adventurers to explore dungeons under the influence of its effervescence and the shocking glycemic rate in the blood. The solution developed by the protagonist, under the advice of the clever manager of the village inn, is in fact devilishly brilliant: to supply the place with new tables, stools, ornaments and various attractions but above all with rivers of soda in order to attract as many thirsty adventurers possible, therefore make them drink at will until the heavenly nectar does not come to cloud the simple minds. Once this state is reached, any warrior becomes easily manipulated and, under the promise of more soda, can be sent to the nearby dungeon towards a thousand fights and infinite treasures, which are regularly confiscated by the eminence grise who controls the soda traffic in this way in the country and the constant stream of treasure arriving from the dungeon (that is, always the player). This is the concept of dubious morals but of great amusement elaborated by Afro-Ninja Productions and Armor Games for Soda Dungeon, which therefore turns out to be a strange and somewhat apt mix between the basic characteristics of an RPG and an equally simplified, but resulting management in a sum of elements richer than the individual addends might suggest. The aim of the game is therefore to call fighters in increasing numbers and skills to the tavern, in order to send them to collect treasures in the dungeon with the hope of success proportional to their basic skills combined with the goodness of the equipped armaments. Soda Dungeon, or what not to do in the name of a hunger for treasure and a thirst for soda! Soda! Soda! Soda Dungeon takes place through fixed screens made with an appreciable pixelated style that obviously recalls the classics of the JRPG genre of the 16-bit era (although the miniaturization of the elements on the screen sometimes makes touch control difficult, on smaller screens) , staging only the tavern that serves as a base for adventurers and the dungeon, the only two destinations that can be reached from the initial screen, although the latter changes considerably as you advance from level to level. Any client of the inn can be hired and sent to the dungeon, although obviously the higher the skill level and the higher the cost required for hiring, while the equipment, beyond the basic one already possessed by individual fighters, it is provided by the player based on what was collected in previous quests or purchased at the armory, also obviously present in the tavern. The initial subdivision between the explorable destinations reflects the structural split of the game between the managerial elements pertaining to the creation of the party of characters on the one hand and the management of the tavern and the elements more pertaining to the RPG sphere on the other. It is the preparation phase, from the construction and control of the various attractions of the inn to the choice of party elements and related equipment, the cardinal element of the whole game system, with the subsequent combat representing a simple consequence. First of all, you need to call the strongest fighters to your inn, and to do this you need to enrich the structure with new furniture and additional comforts, as well as rivers of soda, of course. As far as the latter is concerned, the purchase of new types of drink determines fundamental qualitative leaps as regards the ability of the patrons-adventurers, therefore the upgrade of the soda is an indispensable element to take into consideration, as well as being particularly expensive, although a greater insight into these different brands of soda and perhaps a clearer connection with the potentially enlistable character classes would have been interesting. The purchase of new and progressive options for managing the inn, as well as weapons, armor and items to equip, takes place by spending large quantities of gold, which must be obtained through dungeon exploration, in a continuous reference from one other side of the game. Among the customers of the tavern we can therefore create a party of five characters to be armed and sent to the dungeon, where the other phase of Soda Dungeon starts, focused on continuous progressive clashes. Combat managementit is extremely simplified, so much so that it can simply be entrusted to the automatic clash which independently manages the attack rounds and the possible use of healing objects without actually losing much in terms of depth. We therefore find ourselves for some time simply observing what happens on the screen without intervening, eagerly watching our loot amass. The strange roguelike-like mechanic in fact leads to a continuous gain regardless of the outcome of the clashes, given that even if the fighters are defeated they leave what they have collected up to that moment in place.", "date": "2015-10-20", "grade": "8.0"}
