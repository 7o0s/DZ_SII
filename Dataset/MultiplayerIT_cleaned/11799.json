{"name": "SimCity Societies - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simcity-societies-recensione.html", "text": "Simplicity What made us spend whole nights behind the previous SimCity chapters is, without a shadow of a doubt, the high level of difficulty that does not allow the player even a moment of distraction: building and expanding a city involved careful planning of where and when to place even just a single building and the honorable consequences that every wrong decision entailed, on the distance; in previous titles, a little inattention was enough to see your whole city collapse on itself, to make you fall into a spiral of emergencies and requests for intervention: this tension, which fans of the series liked so much, has completely disappeared, because for precise choice of EA and the developers SimCity Societies is a title open to the masses and, why not, also to consoles. The first aspect that strikes you, unlike what you might think, is not the aesthetic one, but rather the incredible simplicity in the management of your city: if before you were asked to position the industries far from the city centres, taking care at the same time to create a well-organized water, electricity and road network, in Societies you simply need to place a power plant (among the many available) to let your Sims enjoy the wonder of Edison, without the problems of pylons and high voltage cables. The need to bring water to each building and the classic categories that divided areas into residential, commercial and residential areas have also completely disappeared: in their place you find a choice of housing structures necessary to attract the workforce, and an equally large choice of commercial structures, which are concerned with generating income for your pockets. The entire game then boils down to a simple triangular pattern: build houses to attract new Sims, who will be employed in commercial buildings to produce money, which in turn will be used to attract new inhabitants. All quite simple. Way too simple. And all those nice graphs? The developers evidently realized that they had excessively castrated the typical game mechanics of the series and focused their attention on what we could define as the most innovative element of this fifth episode of the SimCity saga: Social Values. These mysterious new elements, on which the entire Societies gameplay is based, are nothing more than parameters that will allow you to better customize your city, following your personal ideological tastes: you can, for example, focus on Prosperity, building a metropolis that revolves around rivers of money and constant managers on business trips; or, why not, prefer spirituality, so as to have a city full of faithful in search of the real meaning of life. The introduction of these values, however, is a terrible double-edged sword: if, on the one hand, it introduces the possibility of totally customizing your cities, especially from an aesthetic point of view, on the other, it only monopolizes the entire gameplay. For practically all your games, all you have to do is juggle continuously between the construction of buildings that generate certain Social Values and others that consume them, which in turn restore happiness to your citizens. This system is further frustrated by the excessive ease of the entire game: since our first game we have managed to obtain stratospheric revenues, simply by building the buildings that generate the most money every day, thus allowing us to buy the most expensive structures and smoothly expand our city. Added to this is the similarity between all the buildings in each category: for example a theatre, which transforms creativity into happiness for the Sims, is absolutely the same as a casino or a shopping centre; it will therefore be enough for you to build the same building several times in an identical area to still see your town grow happily and without problems of any kind, such as excessive distances or areas not covered by certain services. Therefore, once you have grasped the mechanism, the level of challenge is completely cancelled: it will be enough for you to build three residential units to attract inhabitants, followed by three commercial units to generate money and invest your income in recreational facilities, and then repeat the same procedure until when you have not filled the game map. The positive notes Having abandoned, deliberately or not, any connection with the previous titles in the SimCity series, so much so as to make this Societies seem like a completely different game, the positive notes cannot be ignored: the fact of having madethis fifth chapter so simple automatically translates into a greater possibility of use by a larger number of consumers, which does not only include the lover of city simulators, but which also includes the casual gamer or anyone who simply wants build a city and watch it grow without too many headaches. all quite simple. Way too simple. The positive notes PC - System Requirements The game uses a decidedly heavy graphics engine, even on a high-end configuration like the test one as your city expands, the framerate will start to fall inexorably, going from a stable 35-40 up to even 8-10 fps . By lowering the resolution, fluidity is gained, but one of the most successful aspects of this title is also sacrificed: the aesthetic component. Minimum Requirements Windows XP Processor: Pentium 4 1.7 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 128 MB Disk Space: 2.1 GB Minimum Requirements Windows Vista: Processor: Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1024 MB Video Card: Direct 3D Compatible with 128 MB Disk Space: 2.1 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 2.7 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Home Edition Comment Were it not for the name printed on the cover, this Societies would have nothing else in common with the SimCity brand: EA has decided to completely abandon the old approach to pave the way for simple and affordable game mechanics for anyone, at the risk to expire, sometimes, in monotony and repetitiveness. Therefore, consider this fifth chapter as a stand-alone game, graphically pleasant and decidedly intuitive, which makes simplicity its strong point, with all the advantages and disadvantages that follow; do not buy it if you hope to find yourself in front of a more elaborate and graphically more advanced version of the last chapter signed by Will Wright, because you risk getting a resounding disappointment. However, one question remains: isn't this simplification process the first step towards ever less deep and less demanding games? Pros Pleasant graphics Simple and immediate Cons It's not a SimCity Too simple Sometimes repetitive SimCity Societies is available for PC. Fight against pollution That advertising in video games is now a practice is a fact, and EA has not given up on pocketing some extras for its budget: BP (Beyond Petroleum) sponsors all non-polluting power plants (such as wind or nuclear power plants) present in the game, adding a touch of verisimilitude to the title, exactly as happened in SimCity 2000. Coincidentally, if in the previous episodes the power plants were at risk of overloading or even melting down (especially in the case of nuclear ones), now that they are sponsored will remain in business and perfect even after years and years of work. Pretty lucky, right? The SimCity brand has always been synonymous with the micromanagement of a small town, with the task of following it from its inception to its maximum splendour, to then start an uninterrupted struggle in an attempt not to make it degrade into an imploding urban cluster: this consisted , especially in the fourth episode, in a continuous problem solving of those typical city problems, such as pollution, traffic and insatiable citizens always ready to complain about too high taxes and scarcity of services offered. The minestrone, it must be admitted, has always succeeded with more or less success, also thanks to the incredible talent of Will Wright: a talent that, in this new Societies, is completely lacking, since EA has preferred to entrust the development of the game to a different software house and, unfortunately, the result is not what was expected.", "date": "2007-11-23", "grade": null}
