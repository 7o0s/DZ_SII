Cthulhu Tactics takes us to the Europe of the Second World War, the same one that is the setting for a tabletop strategy that links the Nazi passion for the occult with the sidereal darkness of Cthulhu. The result is the quintessence of evil that in the turn-based strategy of the small English team Auroch Digital is embodied by the men of Nachtwolfe and Black Sun, unscrupulous soldiers determined to exploit the power of myths to put a stop to the American advance towards Berlin. And this is where we enter the field, in command of four special agents who have the task of blowing up the enemy's plans, using equally dangerous powers. A modest game with solid mechanics Funded through Kickstarter, Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics undoubtedly takes its cue from old and new X-Coms, at least as regards the turn-based combat which is based on action points to spend on movement and skills, cover, target percentages, indicators showing how many enemies are in sight, alert mode to act in enemy turn and grenades. And the formula also includes physical and mental modifiers that depend on the gravity of the situation and can lead our men to act in panic, thus risking their lives. In short, nothing is missing and although the interface is not the canonical one of the genre, after the initial confusion it becomes clear and simple to use. However, it does not allow us to save action points for the next turn, even if there is a trick. Some actions, in fact, are based on a system called momentum which exploits a secondary resource that is shared among team members and can be accumulated by performing critical hits and killings. Furthermore, even if the characters are not customizable in appearance and in the basic armament, they have various skills to unlock, even esoteric ones, which guarantee a not excellent but still important evolution of the gameplay; this largely gravitates on the visibility of the adversaries who, by remaining hidden, have a considerable advantage. Therefore it is necessary to position the men in order to have the best possible view, while taking advantage of signal flares and special abilities that help us to clear the darkness. And when one of our subordinates identifies an opponent, the companions also earn a bonus to aiming which can prove to be decisive in the vast majority of occasions. Hence the need to pursue some enemies, perhaps by exploiting characters specialized in short-range combat, to gain an advantage in a game system that works, forcing us to vary the approach based on the enemies which include simple soldiers, special forces of experimental weaponry, dangerous mutants with supernatural powers and even shoggoths, amorphous purplish blobs capable of chaining together and unleashing deadly melee attacks. In short, there is everything needed to shape a turn-based combat worthy of the name. What is missing is the contour, the narrative thickness, the complexity and the freedom of exploration that we find in other titles of the genre, but we are talking about the work of a small independent team that focuses on a discreet longevity, with a dozen hours to complete the campaign on normal difficulty, and on the price. When gameplay isn't enough Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics boasts solid strategy mechanics, but it's not a complex game. Loot is limited to primary or secondary mission rewards, healing dynamics are limited to a few single-use items, each character can choose from up to two weapons, and modifications are a handful. Outside of the clashes, the only possibility of action for our four men is to run along a more or less obligatory path that leads us to the next fight. In the middle we find some clues that intersect with the mission briefings and help outline the story, but the narrative component is thin to say the least and goes hand in hand with a gameplay that, excluding a few keys to press here and there, is entirely focused about combat. Among other things, this is triggered automatically as soon as there are enemies in the vicinity and always starts in the same way, with the enemies who are placed and the ball immediately passes to us, greatly limiting the tactical options. These, however, are not lacking once you get into the action, with several skills ranging from area attacks to the possibility of exploiting mystical powers to drain the life of the enemy or confuse him. We can also revive fallen comrades and it is good not to forget this. After a few turns, in fact, these disappear and are captured by the enemy, which forces us to face a missionne secondary to recover them. It doesn't take much in any case to minimize this occurrence. The momentum system can give too much advantage, allowing a single man to perform an unlikely number of actions that completely unbalance the melee component of the enemies, often unable to reach our men. On the other hand, they are more dangerous over a distance, even if in the case of the opponents the aiming system does not seem to fully respect the percentages indicated on the screen. Sometimes the followers of Cthulhu strike us at stellar distances, but more often they manage to miss the target at a span of distance, so much so that we side with them. Then suddenly they hit every blow, forcing us to leverage the uncertain intelligence of an enemy force that tries to take advantage of shelters and hit our most vulnerable men, but doesn't do it in the best way, pushing the enemies into the fray. , meeting certain death. And there are even glitches, bugs and slowdowns, numerous despite the fact that the technical sector is rather modest. The models are not too bad, the animations are pleasant if sometimes grotesque, the colors are spot on and details such as the fog nebula stand out which makes enemies appear particularly threatening and alien when they are out of our men's line of sight. But the variety is scarce, including that of the elements that make up the maps, and the maximum expression of the opponents, removing the final boss which represents the only effective variation of the gameplay, is a shapeless purplish blob with almost no intelligence. All this, combined with the repetitive soundtrack and excessive longevity in relation to the contents, gradually erodes the pleasant initial atmosphere and weighs down the last hours of the game.", "date": "2018-10-10", "grade": "6.0"}
