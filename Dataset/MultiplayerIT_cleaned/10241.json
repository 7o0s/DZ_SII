After all, it is one thing to re-propose the game structure made famous by Psygnosis, and all in all it is a more than feasible operation; it is quite different to replicate the ~wow~ effect that wipEout aroused in anyone who watched it in action, giving the feeling of being in front of a much more powerful machine than the first Sony console actually was. From this point of view, the discussion is purely and exclusively technical: a large number of polygons on the screen (or, alternatively, a series of solutions designed to disguise in the best possible way a reality that is less sumptuous than one might think), a fluid and stable frame rate, an attractive design for the nacelles and even more for the tracks, real protagonists of the races with their curves, with the bonuses scattered around and for the classic acceleration ramps. Let's say right away that Speed Forge Extreme has the merit of achieving its objectives at least in part: the wipEout game structure appears to be well proposed and enriched by a ~reward~ system that not only allows us to unlock ships and tracks, but also the upgrades and weapons that we will find scattered on them. The action therefore becomes richer as we successfully complete the races, and crossing the finish line first is the only possible goal if we want to see what else the product developed by Ratsquare for Chillingo offers. Run and shoot The numbers of Speed Forge Extreme are certainly important: six different ships, twelve tracks and four arenas in which to tear each other apart. Each vehicle differs in speed, agility, resistance and firepower, thus adapting to the most varied needs. As mentioned above, you have to finish first in each race (beating three opponents) to unlock the next one, and in this sense the arenas act as the decisive episode for each ~quarter~ of the championship. Inside, the rules are simple: you don't have to run but chase the other pilots, collecting the weapons needed to annihilate them and remain the only survivors. Unfortunately in reality these game phases are not exciting and indeed highlight the cumbersomeness of the controls when you are faced with an open scenario rather than on a track that develops in length. Let's also say that the combat system does its job in a decent way but nothing more, so the clashes for their own sake leave the time they find and in no case offer more fun than the classic races. The control system relies by default on the accelerometer to ~steer~ and on the touch screen to brake and fire the equipped weapon, while acceleration is automatic. This is not the best implementation that has been seen so far in terms of directional control, but this is also and above all due to the type of game, given that you have to anticipate the tightest curves a lot in order not to crash and lose positions. Thankfully, a virtual thumbstick can be used on the touch screen in place of the accelerometer, resulting in more accurate and responsive control. The rest is simply a matter of memory: you have to learn the conformation of the tracks, and this factor plays a fundamental role in the higher difficulty levels. ~wow~ effect At the beginning, we discussed the objectives of a hypothetical wipEout clone, and among these there is certainly the technical component. Now, although the visual impact of Speed Forge Extreme is spectacular and certainly well made, unfortunately it does not achieve the purpose of creating amazement and wonder in those who observe it in motion. There's certainly a good amount of poly on screen, but the frame rate is erratic and prone to frequent drops. The design, in general, has a lot to envy to that of any wipEout episode, starting from the spacecrafts and ending with the tracks, which in the Ratsquare title offer very few surprises and generally are not surprising for the solutions adopted. There are also situations that could have been handled much better, such as when our vehicle impacts with a barrier or when explosions occur. A similar argument can be made for the sound, which unfortunately does not involve that much or offer effects that are up to the situation.
