Super Orca Slap is basically a game of darts, in which the latter, however, are replaced by penguins (very versatile animals, apparently): each player has around ten penguins neatly lined up on an iceberg; our orca friend acts as a crossbow, throwing the unfortunate people into the air near the target, and the yeti is ready to hit them with a snowball once the right trajectory has been calculated, so that they stick in the area that scores the most points. At each center, you have the option to increase your score or have bonus penguins with a slot machine. Pingu Dart is a more complex version of the same game, using a traditional dartboard and a more detailed scoring system. Even in these modes, we will be able to try our hand alone or in company. Animal rights activists shouldn't be offended: penguins willingly lend themselves to being tossed around for the pleasure of the yeti and even get desperate if they miss the mark! They make a certain impression when they stick into the target and stay there waving their paws frantically or even when they roll or crumple on the ice after a right-angle trajectory... but the light-hearted spirit and the nice cartoon-style graphics undoubtedly contribute to defuse the basically sadistic nature of the game! Polar bears, killer whales and penguins have never had so much fun together - certainly not in the documentaries we are used to. As for the yeti, on this occasion he will highlight hitherto unknown sporting qualities... A flash game with growing problems There is not much to say about the technical realization of Yetisports, except that it is discreet and worthy complements the immediacy of the interface and the simplicity of the mechanics of a game evidently born in flash. However, the funny and ~cartoony~ graphics appear captivating enough and the nice animations of the penguins elicit much more than a smile. Also noteworthy is the delusional musical accompaniment, which would not look out of place in the best of cartoons. The penguins' voices and the in-game are in English but the lack of localization of the software will not hinder even the least polyglot of players, given the essential and purely arcade nature of these Yetisports. Longevity is certainly not at the highest levels, especially if the multiplayer options are excluded: the game modes are too few and not articulated enough to entertain an adult for more than a couple of hours, but this title is perhaps more suited to a young audience. Comment Yetisports can prove to be nice entertainment for your little brother's party or a simple but effective way to neutralize the hyperactive cousin who can't wait to get his hands on your PC, but nothing more: we can't help but think that these likeable characters and the original concept that sees them engaged in improbable challenges on the snow could have been developed much better and perhaps their migration to consoles and PC was a bit rushed. It's a real shame because, with some added challenge, perhaps a tournament mode and a more robust and varied framework, Yetisports would undoubtedly have been irresistible on CD as well. However, we would like to recommend it to the little ones, for the respectable technical realization and the fun it offers in multiplayer challenges, although they too will risk getting tired of the extreme simplicity and repetitiveness of the games available. Pros: Original concept Simple and immediate game mechanics Fun in multiplayer Cons: Insufficient game modes Too essential and repetitive Poor longevity Winter sports as you've never seen them before In 2003, an Austrian developer with the emblematic name of Edelweiss Medienwerkstatt puts a flash game online that sees a nice yeti try his hand at ~penguin launch~. Within a few weeks, this new and bizarre virtual sport conquers a disproportionate number of admirers: according to the figures provided by the manufacturer, it currently boasts around 300 million online users per month! It's also enjoying some success on mobile phones, but will it be able to defend itself as a real PC title? [CC] In the PC version, the conceptit has been further expanded and we have a total of four game modes available. [/CD] The original game, as mentioned, involved a long-distance penguin throwing competition with the help of a makeshift club. Subsequently, various variants were developed, flanked by other curious ~disciplines~. In the PC version, the concept has been further expanded and we have a total of four game modes available: Pingu Throw, Ice Bear Attack, Super Orca Slap and Pingu Dart. The first mode provides for the classic penguin launch: our yeti positions himself under an ice ledge and waits patiently for the penguins to launch one by one to hit them with the club, trying to hurl them as far as possible and taking into account the wind strength and direction. To help him there is an orca, who enjoys throwing the reckless birds into the air, and to hinder him insidious polar bears, who will instead stop his run. We will be able to try it alone, and then publish our record score in the online rankings perhaps, or challenge friends in competitions to the last meter of ice.", "date": "2004-08-02", "grade": null}
