{"name": "Namco Museum DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/namco-museum-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Classic game collections are a genre in themselves, which for several years have been receiving more or less strong acclaim and represent a relatively simple source of income for developers. It must be said, however, that from the first experiments to today, these products have been increasingly refined, and this Namco Museum DS represents an excellent example of this trend: each title is accompanied by a rich documentation, made up of text and images, and it is even possible to set extra values by acting directly on the switches of the original motherboard... The contour The start screen has four options: Pac-Man VS, Arcade, Demo and Library. By selecting the first item, you can play with Pac Man VS, an alternative version of the classic Namco game designed for wireless multiplayer games, in which one player controls the main character and the others take on the role (or rather, the sheets) of the ghosts . It's really a shame that this mode isn't playable online, via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, because it really could have made a difference. However, participating players can also access without owning a copy of Namco Museum DS, through the Download Play. The Demo option simply allows us to pass the demo of one of the seven games to a friend who owns a Nintendo DS, while the Library collects a whole series of information on the contents of the compilation, from historical notes to instructions, from posters to artwork. Finally, the Arcade entry allows us to access the games: Galaxian, Pac-Man, Galaga, Xevious, Mappy, The Tower of Druaga and Dig Dug 2. From 1979 to 1981 Galaxian (1979) is a shooter clearly inspired by Space Invaders, which however boasts numerous additions compared to the previous year's Taito product. First of all, the graphics present colorful and detailed sprites, not single-colored silhouettes, and the enemies launch kamikaze attacks instead of limiting themselves to just descending in groups. The stages are not different from each other, the seabed is always the same but the difficulty increases gradually. There's not much to say about Pac-Man (1980): it's difficult to simply define it as a puzzle game, given that it requires a certain dexterity. The version is identical to the original, including the glitches in the controls, with the d-pad not taking the indicated direction instantly but with a little delay. Galaga (1981) represents the natural evolution of Galaxian: our spacecraft is always anchored to the bottom of the screen, but the backdrop runs vertically and the enemies build up the classic formation little by little, undoing it to launch solitary attacks and firing shots that are often difficult to be avoided. Galaxian introduces the concept of enhancement for the first time: at a certain point it is possible to have a ship stolen by the enemy, to then recover it and ~hook~ it to the one in use. This way you have a double attack and things become much easier... From 1982 to 1985 Xevious (1982) is the third step made by Namco in the shoot'em up genre, and presents innovative features from many points of view. First, the ship is free to move in eight directions and has two distinct attacks: air-to-air and air-to-ground, to eliminate both flying and ground-based enemies. There are no upgrades yet, but the concept of bosses is introduced for the first time, with huge ships that appear at the end of each stage and have pre-established attack patterns. With Mappy (1983) we enter the less brilliant area of this compilation, made up of little-known titles. In this case, we're faced with a mix between platform and puzzle game, in which we have to guide a little mouse escaping from cats, using trampolines to get to higher platforms and with the ability to open and close doors. The objective of each stage is to collect all the objects present without getting caught by enemies. Completely different is The Tower of Druaga (1984), in which we control a knight who has to explore labyrinths full of menacing creatures, with the aim of finding a key that allows him to open the door to the next level. Finally, Dig Dug 2 (1985) is a very particular puzzle game: the protagonist finds himself facing opponents on a small island, and can eliminate them either by using a pump or by drilling the ground and causing entire areas to sink into the water. Comment Namco Museum DS is a fairly well made compilation, appreciable above all for the numerous information available and for the extra settings relating to each game. There are four good quality titles and three much less successful ones, so the balance cannot be completely positive, eitherfrom the point of view of the nostalgic only. The inclusion of Pac-Man VS is appreciable, but the possibility of playing it only in wireless play and not online greatly limits the final result. Technically all seven classics are identical to the original versions, defects included, so no criticism can be made from this point of view. If you own a Nintendo DS and fancy a collection of classics, this Namco compilation is definitely for you. Pros: Seven different games, identical to the originals Lots of information and lots of accompanying pictures Interesting introduction of Pac-Man VS... Cons: ...that it's not playable online Nearly half of the games aren't very exciting Just for nostalgia", "date": "2008-04-10", "grade": null}
