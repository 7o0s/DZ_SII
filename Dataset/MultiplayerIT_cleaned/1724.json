Both to learn how to play and to make PGA Tour 2003 a game with a fair longevity, it is definitely advisable to immediately choose the Career mode. After having created your own profile, it will be possible to purchase the necessary equipment (where possible, given that the initial budget is limited) and undertake some golf lessons which will allow you to choose the game mode (the aforementioned three clicks or the movement of the mouse) and will explain the basics for a correct game methodology. After a few lessons, which are also fundamental to be able to overcome moments of crisis such as exiting a sand bunker or thick trees, you can start pursuing a career as a golfer, thanks to a calendar which, every month, allows you to play various types of competitions, earning, where possible, the money necessary to invest in new equipment (missing clubs, more ~performing~ balls, etc.) or to increase one's skills (power, accuracy, etc.). Every quarter it will also be possible to participate in a special tournament that will allow you to move to a higher level of difficulty if completed within the 35th position. Methodology Let's go into more detail regarding the most important thing in the game, namely: hitting the ball. With the classic three-click method, it is essential to have an eye and quick reflexes: given a semicircle with speed up and precision down, with the first click an indicator will start from the bottom which will quickly travel the entire semicircle towards 'high. With the second click the indicator will be blocked, thus deciding the speed of the shot: at the same time the indicator will begin to quickly return downwards. With the third click the indicator will be blocked definitively, thus deciding the accuracy of the shot: in the latter case, it is necessary to try to stop the indicator on the white bar located near the lower edge of the semicircle, so as to hit the ball with the greatest possible precision. Method infinitely easier to use than to explain, it is suitable for classic PC golf players, who like to hit the ball using above all their reflexes. The second method uses the mouse instead. Moving the mouse downwards causes the player to lift the club upwards: successively moving the mouse upwards causes the player to hit the ball. The faster this ~up and down~ movement (but you can also set it to ~left and right~), the more powerful the blow is; the more the pause between ~up and down~ is reduced, the more precise the shot becomes. This method is decidedly more arcadey, adapting to those looking for more action than reflexes, and attempting a vague hint of realism by making the mouse perform a sort of pseudo-micro-movement that occurs using a golf club. Other useful information during a game is the wind, irrelevant at the lowest difficulty level and increasingly decisive in the continuation of the game, the maximum power that can be reached with each club, essential for calculating the distance that the ball can reach and for understanding how much power to calibrate for each shot, without forgetting the angle (for high or low shots) and any effects. Races There are many and imaginative types of races in the game. From the classic ~match~, which sees us alone facing dozens of opponents with cash prizes divided among all the participants according to the final position in the standings, to one-on-one competitions, passing through small tournaments in which money is won for each hole concluded with fewer strokes and continuing with competitions of ~whoever sends the ball furthest or closest to the hole wins~ and so on. Also, going from one difficulty level to another, the game modes grow (and the skill points to spend become much more expensive). Technique The graphics of the players are splendid, realistic and complete: the movements are fluid and the feeling of being in front of a real player is not a mirage. The terrain is also well done, with grass, bunkers and well designed greens. Too bad for the colors, too bright and that eliminate a lot of realism. Instead, the public and the trees / bushes, really badly made, deserve a separate discussion: the spectators, inparticular, they recall the sprites of ten years ago. The sound goes hand in hand with the graphics: realistic and precise in representing the swings of the club, the bounces of the ball and background noise, it borders on the painful in the reproduction of the public and the comments of the commentators, the latter excessively repetitive and without a shred of emotion. Conclusion Suitable for golf lovers, who will find in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 a boring game at the beginning but increasingly exciting as the difficulty increases, it will also have converts among newbies, who will find fertile ground to grow their skills ' of golfers in the initial stages and bread for their teeth with the succession of competitions. There is no shortage of circuits in which to try your hand, the ~Career~ mode makes the game long enough and it will happen several times to find yourself late at night continuously repeating ~one last shot and then that's it~. However, it is not suitable for action lovers, because PGA Tour 2003 is a calm and reflective game. Ideal classic game to play while, for example, you are watching television, but in this case it is advisable to wait for a budget version. Perhaps not studied in detail, but a good product that rivals competitors (such as Links & co.) that do not differ in terms of general quality. PROS As adaptable to newbies as to veterans of the genre; Well-constructed learning curve; Relaxing pastime at the right point. CONS Graphically unacceptable backdrops and audience; Commentary and audio accompaniment of unpleasant fans. Introduction It has a certain effect to watch golf courses on television, these expanses of green lawns cared for with almost maniacal passion, with your eyes trying, often successfully, to close for a deep sleep between one shot and another by rich players. However, it is true that this calm and tranquil aspect of golf has been present in our calculators for about twenty years now, where decidedly static graphics and a not too burdensome amount of calculations have allowed this kind of game to appear on the computers since the early 1980s. Over time, the power of computers has allowed golf games to present graphics that are always in step with the years, while the classic three-click system (departure, speed and precision) has always remained unchanged for some years also supported by the simulation of the bat via mouse movement. When it comes to sports games, one cannot fail to include EA Sports. There are dozens of sports treated by Canadian developers and updated annually, including golf. Tiger Woods, the undisputed champion (and billionaire) of this discipline, has already lent his face and name to the EA product for some years which, as happens with American Football with Madden, gives the title to the package: ~Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 ~.", "date": "2003-03-15", "grade": null}
