In fact, what awaits us in the bowels of Mars are hordes of monsters that we will explore in the role of Darius Mason, grandson of that Mason who saved the planet 50 years earlier. The result of the change is a sort of mix between the formula of Red Faction and that of Dead Space 2, with creatures that come directly from the imaginary space horror. But as we will see, a mixture of this type is by no means easy to manage and the main risk is that the rebellion closed in a tunnel will no longer have as much effect, especially if the walls of that tunnel are not destroyed. Furthermore, the choice to completely eliminate freedom of movement and destruction appears too drastic given the enormous potential shown by the Red Faction formula in a free roaming key. Without freedom of movement, in fact, Mars loses thickness and one immediately realizes that the setting is monotonous and that the variety of structures is even less than that of the buildings that populated the already not too varied panorama of the previous chapter. If nothing else, the title is less dispersive, it travels smoothly even on not too powerful systems and the story is tighter and is connected by lively and rather well-made cutscenes. Furthermore, the reduction of spaces helps to develop mechanics that give us specific and planned situations such as assaults, ambushes and so on. Unfortunately this possibility is exploited a few times and almost all of them are concentrated in the second half of the chapter, also offering us some brief raids on the surface, while the first hours are decidedly poorer in terms of level design. The endowment of the perfect hero In Red Faction: Armageddon the control system is richer, more responsive and precise and also supports the combat made up of missiles and mechs quite well. Furthermore, as an extra, the title gives us a couple of sessions aboard an aircraft complete with thermal vision. But there are also novelties from the point of view of the gameplay that evolves compared to what we tried in Guerrilla. Indeed, when on foot, the character can draw on an instrument of immeasurable power that makes him the spearhead of the Red Faction. We are talking about the Nano Forge, the powerful artifact around which the events of the previous chapter revolved and which the grandson of the previous savior of Mars now proudly carries on his arm. The Nano Forge amplifies our close combat capabilities and, through a beam of blue lights that is so science fiction, it allows us to reconstruct the destroyed objects also going to modify the gameplay linked to the covers and the structures on which we move. In fact, it is not uncommon to have to rebuild a bulkhead to block a huge ball of fire that has been hurled at us and on many occasions we will have to repair the communication trenches on which we find ourselves in order not to end up soaking in the lava or in some very deep Martian ravine. Boat trip But the title also brings other innovations such as the rail rifle, which can pierce bulkheads and is equipped with a caloric sensor to see through structures, and the magnetic gun which is perhaps the most fun weapon to use. The magnetic gun refers in part to the gravity gun of Half Life and in part to the glue beam of Ghostbusters and allows you to hook a magnetic pole to a target or an object to hurl it against other targets, structures or rock walls. Unfortunately at the Normal level, but also in many more difficult situations, the magnetic gun is far too powerful, and then almost completely loses its meaning where there are no structures to bend over monsters or buildings to demolish by projecting enemies against us. As for the other weapons, many have been recovered from Red Faction: Guerrilla, but the physics of shots and explosions have improved. Unfortunately, the physics of the affected opponents has not improved that evolutions are produced so bogus as to not even be fun. Also the variety of weapon effects is fictitious and there is little difference between a plasma cannon and a missile. The perks, on the other hand, have increased but the upgrades for each weapon that allowed you to further customize your favorite equipment are missing. In any case, through the purchase of perks, divided into four categories that are unlocked by proceeding along the story, it is possible to enhance both the damage, health and aim of the character, and acquire new abilities. In fact, with the talents the close combat shot of the nano forge becomes extremely powerful and becomesIt is possible to create energy shields capable of reflecting the blows of enemies. Face to face with the enemy The most common adversaries are the Martian tribal Marauders, who here act like mindless automatons, alternating with five hopping alien types that are rather similar to each other. In fact, all creatures are capable of throwing various types of projectiles at us, sticking to the walls and cutting us with their sharp claws. The difference lies in the movements and the type of bullet that they throw at us, but these are too limited variations that lead to an inevitable flattening of the gameplay. Thankfully the action varies here and there thanks to special monsters that can't jump but shoot more powerful fireballs, create acid pools and are sturdier. But even in this case the basic typology is only one and so the new potential of our character, now also capable of dodging blows, is not exploited properly. The power of the mechs Furthermore, we will almost never find ourselves in firefights worthy of the name since the NPCs are scarce and the number of enemies has decreased, and although the opponents, Marauders included, are animated and better characterized, unfortunately they are still less intelligent than the they were in Guerrilla. Fortunately Red Faction: Armageddon also gives us some pleasant variations on the theme thanks to the occasional use of mechs and a spectacular sequence that sees us engaged in a desperate escape. The title does everything to vary the experience by enriching the recipe with some special sessions, committed to stopping dozens of creatures chasing us, unblocking the way for a vehicle or aboard huge mechanical spiders of unusual power. Furthermore, in some situations it is necessary to eliminate the nests that generate enemies before the monsters become too numerous and in others it is good to move quickly so as not to fall from a structure that is disintegrated by powerful blows. But the design of the maps and the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies dampen the enjoyment of many situations by devaluing even the good ideas and putting a serious mortgage on the replayability of the title. The fundamental question At this point the fundamental question is one: was it worth sacrificing freedom to increase the graphic tenor of the title and focus on the action side? To answer, let's go back to the not particularly successful attempt to evoke a Dead Space-style atmosphere. To spoil the tension we find a radar warns us of the arrival of the enemies and neither the repetitive music in a space horror key nor the forty diaries that say little or nothing since they are not connected to any known element are enough, we don't know who it is speaks and they are thrown at random into corners of insipid rock. But also from the point of view of the action, whose tenor has definitely improved thanks to dodges and new gadgets, there are several problems since the structure and design of the title don't help to explode the good ideas integrated into the gameplay. Among other things, even from a graphic point of view, the success is partial. But let's start with the positives. In fact, the more detailed models, improved lighting, smoke and more defined textures are undoubtedly noticeable. Also the ability to rebuild structures with the Nano Forge is a notable addition and now the physics related to destruction are more realistic, there is more debris and finally the screen vibrates and jerks as huge masses of concrete collapse to the ground. But the graphic setting is the same as the last chapter, with only one setting as a background, and there are no more extra missions, bonuses, vehicles, radio transmissions and minerals to distract us to collect. Therefore we do not have a clear answer to the question that opens this paragraph and although the weapons are more varied and the melee is more fun, the developers' choices have cut off the legs of Armageddon which is in a limbo where destruction is not more so fun since it's no longer free-form and where the action is punished by deficient level design. Active sensors on the aircraft On balance we have lost a good part of the NPCs, part of the feeling of destructiveness, side missions integrated into the game, secondary objectives, exploration, vehicles (except for the mechs and for a flight session, but even these are too powerful and they flatten the gameplay instead of expanding it), collecting, part of the advances, bombing and large-scale combat. On the other hand we have a less frayed plot, much improved short-range graphics, special monsters, Nano Forge, improved control system and more exciting and tight combat. In short, counting the elements one by one Armageddon would seem at a loss compared to Guerrilla.But the final judgment depends a lot on the player's tastes. In fact, those who are bored with the setting of the previous chapter, but still want to have the opportunity to destroy part of the scenario, could be faced with an interesting and less distracting product. Those who hoped for a further evolution of the series will be greatly disappointed. In any case, the savage destruction is still present and can be accessed from the game menu by selecting the Ruin mode. The title also includes an Infestation variant that puts us, in a 4-player cooperative, against hordes of enemies. Finally Red Faction: Armageddon, whose campaign on normal difficulty lasts about ten hours, can be replayed keeping all the talents and weapons acquired during the first game.", "date": "2011-06-01", "grade": "7.8"}
