{"name": "La terza stanza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/159230-the-room-three-la-terza-stanza.html", "text": "The Room by Fireproof Games was one of the titles that contributed to giving substance to the offer of the App Store and Google Play, offering an adventure based on the resolution of puzzles of great quality. The main feature was linked to the fact that the puzzles took place on the surface and inside boxes, made up of articulated and complex mechanisms that gradually revealed themselves in a fascinating and mysterious progression. Given the enormous success achieved, the release of a sequel was rather inevitable: The Room Two focused on the development and expansion of the original concept by extending the arrangement of the puzzles also on different objects within larger and more complex rooms. After another two years, the British team has chosen to give life to a new chapter, with the aim of continuing the project of growth of the series, bringing it closer to the trend of Myst-style adventures. The Room Three is a high-quality puzzle-adventure that looks right at home on the touch screen Mysteries and secrets The decision to give the series a wider scope, if on the one hand it deprived The Room Three of a certain level of uniqueness that was guaranteed on the contrary by the ingenious boxes of the first episode, on the other it allowed the developers to overcome some inevitable limits of this formula. In fact, this new chapter puts the player, always with a first-person view, in a setting to explore made up of numerous interconnected rooms, each of which houses a series of objects with which to interact to access the various puzzles. It is not possible to move freely: on the contrary, shots and movements are fixed and the player can only activate them by touching the screen in the foreseen areas. A solution that allows you to reduce downtime, focusing the user's attention on the really important elements. As we said above, Fireproof Games has chosen to make the adventure a little more faithful to the canons of the genre by creating puzzles involving the most diverse objects: usually a fundamental aspect of the gameplay is the manipulation of the various tools and artifacts, which finds a particularly convincing ally in the touch screen. Often rightly criticized for its limitations in other genres, in these situations instead it allows a type of interface that perfectly supports the game mechanics: touch, move, rotate, open, and so on, everything happens in a very natural way and without particular problems . The developers have also intelligently exploited some exclusive features of this type of device, for example creating puzzles to be solved by interacting simultaneously with two fingers on two objects. A novelty of this chapter is the possibility then, through a particular new lens available for the viewer, to literally ~enter~ some of the objects to access the puzzles hidden inside them; it is a more scenic addition than anything else, since it does not change the cards on the table that much. More generally, however, the level of challenge offered by the puzzles present in The Room Three always appears to be intelligently calibrated, and such as to guarantee player satisfaction by limiting frustration peaks. The aid system is also well studied, which grants a series of increasingly explicit suggestions in case you find yourself stuck in the progression, which are revealed over time. However, this is an optional option, since to access the aid you need to press a special icon: in this way those who want to rely only on their own strength can continue without problems, provided they resist the temptation. Even from a technical point of view The Room Three can be appreciated, even if it is more functional and fascinating than really impressive: the graphics engine is always the same as in the previous episodes, the environments are well modeled, but the lighting management is not particularly advanced . Where the British team could probably improve to make the proverbial leap in quality is in the narrative element: in fact, the plot develops for the most part through messages left by ~The Master~, which however are often vacuous and all too allusive and convey little sense of progression. Finally, the adaptation into good Italian and the presence of multiple endings, which strengthen the already considerable overall longevity, should be noted.", "date": "2015-11-17", "grade": "8.6"}
