As it is as it is not, over the years and many titles, the series has dug its niche also in America and Europe, where it has always been known under the title of Harvest Moon: but today, due to disagreements between Marvelous and Natsume, who was entrusted with the western localization, we can rightly speak of two parallel sagas, at least here with us. Natsume kept the rights to the Harvest Moon name and tried The Lost Valley to introduce different novelties, not always getting the best results. Marvelous on the other hand, despite having to invent a new name, remains firmly anchored in tradition without risking too much: was it the right attitude? Change the name but Story of Seasons is the Harvest Moon we all know, with some good news! Country boy Once we have chosen the gender and a few other customizations of our avatar, we learn the background: we are a young citizen who, on a cold winter day, bored with the routine and emptiness of modern life, answers an ad in which look for a new farmer in a nearby village. This is how we find ourselves in Querciallegra, a charming country village, where we immediately get to know Veronica, the head of the local guild, and Eda, an elderly country girl of whom we are guests for the first seven days of our stay: the two ladies will explain all the rudiments of a farmer's life, in what is a decidedly well done, enjoyable tutorial in which we will deal with all aspects of the game in a basic way. From here on, Story of Seasons does not have a real plot, but in the tradition of the saga a series of episodes (some of which are very touching) and interactions with non-player characters that will unfold over the years, divided into four seasons each of which has 31 days. Interactions that will lead, again as usual, to the development of friendships and even love relationships, with very basic dating sim mechanics, having the possibility of getting married and starting a family. However, this time, this is not the main purpose of the title: Querciallegra is a locality whose development, based on trade with distant lands, has come to a standstill in recent times, and hence the will to recruit fresh workforce that can introduce system a breath of energy, physical as well as mental. While we will talk about commercial exchanges, a real and well-crafted novelty, later, let's now do a quick review of the basics, which will be very familiar to anyone who has already had the opportunity to come across any Harvest Moon. Starting from the cultivation of the fields with different varieties of plants, from those purely food to those exclusively ornamental; you have to take care of the animals on your farm and collect materials around, or go to the mine to extract minerals, which can then be used to build various furnishing objects with which to embellish and make more functional not only your land, but also the squares present in Querciallegra in order to attract more and more tourists. Once the daily tasks have been completed, one can devote oneself to leisure: going around the meadows, taking a swim in the river, also trying to collect more materials, fishing, catching insects. Going down to the village, shopping, deepening relationships with the other inhabitants; then there are, on fixed days, the festivals in which to compete with colleagues, the birthdays of our friends, various celebrations... In short, there are so many things to do and the beauty of the series is precisely that of giving the player so much freedom, that he can take all the time he wants and face things at his own pace, at least, as we will see shortly, once he gets into the spirit of everything and with the right means at his disposal. The 3D effect Present and also very much, it is advisable to calibrate it at a lower level than the maximum available. It certainly makes the graphics more lively and profound, but it has no devastating effects either on the gameplay - and as it could be - or on a frame rate which, however, is already not very solid on its own. The frenzy of the modern countryside Story of Seasons introduces a series of novelties on what is a very well run system. Starting with small things, such as the possibility, for example, of catching fish no longer just by fishing normalmind, up to more significant things. It is normal that with the passage of time and the coming into possession of greater means, the crops will grow and diversify, also according to the seasons, there will be more specimens and types of animals and in general the productive activity will intensify. But our farm is limited: here Querciallegra makes available a series of fields, intended for specific products, in rotation for the various farmers, who will compete for them among themselves. The real novelty, however, is represented, as we said, by commercial exchanges: merchants from foreign countries will be present in the Market Square, on days conveniently indicated on the calendar, who will sell their typical goods, an excellent way to get hold of exotic seeds, unusual animals and so on. But the merchants also buy and, in fact, this is the only way to make money. One does not limit oneself simply to selling one's goods, there is a real economic system which, albeit simplistically, reproduces some concepts of the real economy. At certain times some goods will be in greater demand, which can be sold at a higher price, for example. Sell too many specimens of a single product and you will see their value gradually drop... they are all pieces of a simple but fun mechanism, making good use of which you can truly become a successful agricultural entrepreneur and even open up your space on the market. Another welcome change, or rather a necessary evolution, is in terms of actual gameplay: through a whole series of optimizations both to the game dynamics and to the inventory system, now the experience is much more fluid and faster. You will work, for example, on a 3x3 grid and no longer on a single square at a time: if you have played a previous title you will understand how much this is appreciated. However, Story of Seasons remains, despite this, a very slow title in its initial part, this due to the fact that it will take some time to get our hands on better tools than the basic ones, which make us waste a lot of energy forcing us either to limit one day's actions and go to bed at two in the afternoon, or recover stamina through a series of operations that cost money. This is also a feature of all the Harvest Moons that Marvelous has preferred not to give up, and in fact has always been part of the charm of the saga for some, the main barrier to entry for others. Of course, it is coherent with the almost Zen spirit of the production (even if going forward and with a small empire on his shoulders, the situation can become a remarkable frenzy), but perhaps it would be appropriate to go and intervene in the next iteration, with a view to of ~quiet~ evolution of the series here highly visible and, ultimately, meritorious.", "date": "2015-12-30", "grade": "7.8"}
