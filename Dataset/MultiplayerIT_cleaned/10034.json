Less than 6 MB is enough to hold Vertigo Rogue in your hands. Above all, considering that many developers are accustoming the public to the truly generous dimensions of their titles (read Street Fighter 4, for one, with its 201 MB) the premise is positive. This consideration is right above all in the graphic quality of the title which in this respect is really very accurate. But let's go step by step and start from the initial premise: why always escape by car when you run the risk of running into traffic jams, traffic lights and checkpoints? One could choose the fateful plan B and escape by helicopter... even if things don't go much better here. If initially the protagonist begins his adventure locked up in prison, he will soon have paved the escape route; but movies and video games teach that no one saves someone else's life just for their big eyes and everything has a price. The price to pay in this case will be to stop the enemies of friends and to do so we will be alone; in addition to this, the forces of order will also look for a way, possibly definitive, to stop the new convict. An entire city full of details, parking lots and air-conditioned rooftops is at the player's disposal; however, roaming freely is not the only task of your alias which in fact has a specific purpose to complete which almost always will coincide with a good deal of firefights with enemies of all kinds. The game view closely resembles that of the first two chapters of GTA (or the most recent chapter Chinatown Wars also released for the bitten apple platform) even if unfortunately it does not inherit the character and variety of missions. The blades turn A 90s-Sega-game-style menu launches the player straight into the adventure; certainly there are not a few 38 missions, divided into six chapters, accompanying the title and although there are three difficulty levels, don't expect to see the end credits very soon. On a theoretical level, the commands are apparently simple: basically you have to place your thumbs in the two halves of the screen and spread them out to take off or tighten them towards the center to land or duck. To steer, on the other hand, you need to move your fingers as if you were turning an invisible steering wheel; moving them up or down will cause the vehicle to follow these directions as well. After spending a few minutes adjusting to the controls, although you never feel perfectly mastered, you can launch into the fray. Objectives will always be shown at the edge of the screen, as will new ammunition/weapons, repairs and fuel. The real sore point of this product, however, is represented by the basic gameplay, more precisely in the aspects related to looking for a moving target, zigzagging between buildings and firing. In fact, it is often necessary to make the movement of the helicopter coincide with the fire button and this, considering that you will have all your fingers busy, is not the best of comfort. In addition to this, the enemies will continue to move and following them between the buildings often means that you risk also ram them. Therefore, if initially someone could throw their handheld out the window after a few minutes, know that an herbal tea and a little training can lead to finding a more pleasant and fun feeling. However, what could cut off any further stimulus is a difficulty level set slightly too high, especially in the more advanced missions in which the stress risks reaching its climax. 2.99 euros to take home Vertigo Rogue are certainly not a capital, considering that the game is almost fun at times, but it is still a fairly high figure in the average offer for the Cupertino terminal. If it had come out at the opening of the App Store certainly the judgment would be different, but it is important to remember that now the variety and quality of the Apple platform is truly impressive. Sound effects play their part; thumbs down instead for the music, which if in theory should recall a noir style, is completely out of place and tremendously repetitive. The tested version is 1.0.2 App Store links", "date": "2010-05-05", "grade": "6.3"}
