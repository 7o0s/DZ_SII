{"name": "Shrek Terzo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shrek-terzo.html", "text": "Considerably ahead of the release of the film in theaters, Wirelessgaming has managed to get their hands on a final version of Shrek the Third, a two-dimensional action-platformer that carries within itself some of the hallmarks of Gameloft productions. This clearly leads to various positive aspects, primarily as regards the technical implementation, which in fact in this case is really excellent: Shrek the Third can boast very defined and colorful graphics, whose spearhead is represented by the quality of the sprites of the characters on screen and their animations, which are a few inches above average in terms of fluidity and variety. All the more picturesque friends of the green ogre make their more or less veiled appearance in this title, starting with Donkey and Puss in Boots (present both in the cutscenes and in some sections of the game) and continuing with Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man and even the donkey's dragon bride mentioned above, to whom a very enjoyable shooter section has even been dedicated. The only flaw in the presentation of Shrek the Third lies in the storyline, as often happens on incomplete and inaccurate furniture, and which does not disdain to leave out fundamental events between one stage and another. From the gameplay point of view, however, the Gameloft product proves to be as pleasant for certain elements as it is questionable for others, ending up with an evaluation slightly lower than its potential. Let's start with the good news: Shrek the Third is above all fun, thanks to an excellent control system and a good balance in the play structure, which cleverly alternates the platform component with the action one and enriching everything with the presence of many collectibles to collect. Our ogre jumps, rolls, savagely beats enemies and fires cannonballs at a good pace, making the continuation of the adventure enjoyable. To frame then the aforementioned shooter sections at the controls of the ~draghessa~, an evident homage (if we want to call it that) to the Gradius series by Konami complete with dragon puppies to play the part of the satellite ships. But it's not all rosy, especially for the very short duration of the game: at the standard difficulty level, it takes less than an hour to complete the only eight months of internship available, and the only replay factor value lies in the non-exciting pursuit of all the bonuses. Furthermore, Shrek the Third is all too similar to other Gameloft titles such as King Kong, Mission: Impossible III and Splinter Cell, which in turn were ~freely inspired~ by the great classics of the genre: in short, the French developers have a little originality every that certainly wouldn't hurt. PRO Excellent graphic design Fun and cared for Very successful shooter sections AGAINST Zero originality Incomplete storyline Too short", "date": "2007-05-22", "grade": "S.V."}
