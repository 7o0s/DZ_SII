With the difficulties encountered and competition, that of FIFA, which was marching forward, the Asian software house decided at a certain point even to abandon any ambition to re-propose on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 that realism that had made the series' fortune on PlayStation and partly on PlayStation 2, veering towards a slightly more arcade-like game system. But without success, and in the end the various experiments attempted to find a new identity ended up dissatisfying old and new fans, not to mention the perennial problems in an online key. Konami's landing on the next-gen wants to mark a new beginning from this point of view, hopefully definitive, with a look at the more distant past, that is, that of glories, of almost perfect simulation, and another aimed at the future , to the inevitable growth that must go hand in hand with technological evolution. From this point of view, the 2015 edition is the first to arrive on the current consoles of Microsoft and Sony precisely because last season the Japanese developer had taken an extra year to make significant changes to his creature, with the awareness that to regain its users had to start again, as mentioned, from the basics, from the actual gameplay and from the atmosphere that reigns on the football field. With Pro Evolution Soccer 15 Konami reconnects the broken thread with its glorious simulation past The Day One patch Pro Evolution Soccer 15 offers few official licenses of the national leagues, although it can count on those relating to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League, the AFC, the Copa Sudamericana and the Copa Libertadores, with the related participating teams. To these are added those for the Argentine, Dutch, Spanish (series A and B), French (both leagues), those of the Italian and Brazilian series A (both lack the official names and logos Lega Calcio and Brasileiro) . Our cadet series is present without official licenses, with frankly preposterous names. The English tournament is still out of the running, and although the players' names are real, the only team to appear with official names, flags and kits is Manchester United. The situation is almost similar for the Portuguese Primeira Liga, with only three licensed teams: SL Benfica, Sporting Lisbon and FC Porto. The Bundesliga is missing, with only Bayern Munich, Schalcke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen present in the rest of Europe. The team rosters are not updated on the disc, but just connecting to the network when you first start the game will solve the problem thanks to the Day one patch available from November 13th. It is a substantial update, which in addition to all the latest transfers and transfers from the transfer market, also includes 93 new game kits, new Puma and Nike boots, eight new licensed teams such as Sparta Prague, Slovan Bratislava, Partizan Belgrade and Maccabi Tel Aviv, and an update for the real names and likenesses of Brazilian league footballers. Plus that of six teams from the same tournament, such as Internacional, Santos and Vasco da Gama. The update also includes feature overhauls for 80 players across various leagues. A new season Let's start our review by taking a look at the game modes available, this year selectable through a mosaic interface that is finally comfortable and functional, with all the options organized in five dynamic menus, the first of which can be customized as desired with the most used by the user. In addition to the classic performances available in all guises, and the licensed competitions, cups and customized tournaments, there are free training sessions and specific ones, where you can learn all the novelties of the gameplay in the best possible way through a complete tutorial. Then we have the Championship Mode, enriched in this edition by the presence of the second leagues of England, Spain, Italy and France, and within Mondo Calciatore the classic Master League, where the structure concerning the growth of the players, the of transfers, managers and automatic match settings, and Become a Legend. The latter mode is substantially similar to the past one, except for some improvements made to the training, transfer and engagement system, and the inclusion of the second divisions here as well. Then there is the important novelty of the local multiplayer mode dedicated to the game con three human companions. By activating the co-op function in matches and setting the commands with the Role Control option, it is in fact possible to play up to three users within the same team, with each one controlling one of the three crucial areas of the field, i.e. defense , midfield and attack. And we must say that playing matches by controlling a specific portion of your team is damned fun, especially if the understanding with the friends involved in the match is good. Another important change concerns myClub, the mode that actually replaces the Master League Online, with a complete restyling in terms of options and features. The focus of the session is managerial management and the creation of one's dream team, and within it it is possible to combine the role of the manager with the strategies and peculiar characteristics of the players, in such a way as to obtain the maximum yield, also taking into account the needs of the technician. In fact, putting under contract players who have characteristics that satisfy the coach's requests helps to create stronger tactical ties and make the team alchemy more profitable, just as using athletes from the same department for several games in a row serves to stabilize the pink without constantly questioning it, demoralizing individuals with upheavals at every game. There is also the possibility of buying and borrowing players through agents, earning GP points to spend, and playing both offline and online, maintaining the same progress in both configurations. In this sense, an interesting thing is represented by the fact of being able to download data from other real players even when playing against the computer, to therefore face a team with different characteristics compared to the standard ones, a sort of miniature Drivavatar, while climb the leaderboards and score points to improve your team. In myClub there are also micro-transactions, which are used to buy the most expensive champions with real money in case you don't want to play too much to earn the points needed to get them, after the first few hours we didn't feel any particular need, but there we reserve the right to further evaluate the balance. Again in the context of online play, there are the classic options which include the quick classified match, competitions, Online Divisions in which to play a series of seasons where the points are not the classic ones of real matches, but vary according to the team used (the smaller it is, the more points you get in case of a positive result against a big one), and the lobby dedicated to those who will participate in the matches up to a maximum of twenty-two real players. Interesting is the presence of an anti-cheat function introduced to reduce online cheating. In general, in the matches we played on the internet we had easy access to the various services, while during the matches we only encountered some lag, plus some slowdowns in a couple of chaotic situations on the edge of the penalty area, such as after a kick corner or a free-kick rejected by the barrier. However, nothing that jeopardized the smooth running of the match, a clear sign that everything is working properly for now. myClub is reminiscent of FIFA Ultimate Team in some ways, but the implementation is different, since it is based on foundations that sometimes give very similar results, in other cases focus more on the management of agents to get the best players, and on coaches to further increase team spirit. Ball in the center and go Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to game modes, it's finally time to talk about playability. Once you take to the field, it's easy to find the usual feeling with the controls, given that there are no big news in this sense and indeed there is a certain simplification to make the gameplay more immediate and more based on the gamer's skills. To be honest, it took us back in time, positively reminding us of the times of the best Winning Eleven/PES on the first Playstation, when the user was able to recreate credible and fairly complex actions without excessive frills. In this sense, returning to the present, a quicker and more effective control allows you to exploit the athletic characteristics of the players, and to get the better of the opponents you need to use adequately the protection of the ball and close contact with it. Without underestimating the importance of winning the classics one on one, a ~challenge~ in the challenge to be faced in every portion of the field to earn hisnumerical superiority when it is not possible to do it by simply rolling the ball. This time without unrealistic newfangled or placed there to make a scene, but only with the ability, as mentioned before, pad in the user's hand, and the timing in the changes of direction to discard the opponent. This provided you use the manual settings, which as we always say remains in our opinion the best way to enjoy the game, given that with the assisted settings otherwise everything becomes a little more predictable and simplified. Shooting and defending the ball are therefore the two most important elements of the Pro Evolution Soccer 15 gameplay, essential for freeing yourself in the spaces, passing the ball and being in a favorable position to shoot on goal. Clearly the strongest players are always equipped with the best skills in all fundamentals, and thanks to Player ID, the technology that allows you to have the most important players reproduced with ways of acting and parameters that reflect those of their real counterparts, they are still able to solve a game with one play. But without exaggeration, given that now more than before moves such as feints and ball games are not effective (and for the most part they are not even present) for the purpose of achieving a favorable result. Also because defenders don't stand by and often try to anticipate or contain the opponent's attacker, even at the cost of using strong ways to stop him or bounce the ball away. The latter boasts further refined physics and is much more convincing than the past in terms of rebounds and heaviness (just see how it reacts on the field made heavy by the reintroduced rain), but not yet without some automatic movements. Speaking of the latter and of the rails, those relating to the directionality of the run are a distant memory, furthermore on the occasion of a tackled ball or one close to the lineout, it is possible to use R1+R2 to cancel the automatic run towards the ball, or R2 to prevent inertia from pushing it out. However, there are some automatisms in certain movements due to the precise choice of the developers, and the ~hook~ to the ball itself has a greater range than for example in FIFA. It is a matter of balancing that is not easy to read, but which in Konami's idea serves to make the game more fun. From what has been described, a very well-calibrated gameplay derives, with a reasoned and no-frills construction of the maneuver even when the pace of play is raised, in which in addition to that of the aforementioned Player ID, the influence of Team ID is felt, it is worth to say that function that allows digital teams, thanks to a complex system of algorithms, to replicate in a plausible way the way of being on the field of the real ones. From this point of view it must be said that the teams actually tend to move quite well both in the defensive and offensive phases (in the game there are three different game systems available, i.e. base, defensive and offensive, which can be recalled by pressing the cross directional up or down), applying the schemes and ~reasoning~ at the collective level in a plausible way according to the strategy, the men in the workforce and the result of the moment. All these elements, among other things, Konami has ensured that they will be updated weekly, together with the players' statistics and their look, to create an unprecedented, real bridge with reality for the series. If Allegri's Juventus truly switch definitively to 4-3-3, abandoning the 3-5-2, the virtual one will do the same, just as if De Rossi takes off his beard or Icardi dyes his hair platinum blonde, the same will happen in the game. From the management menus you can still change everything at will, from the selection of the starting eleven (unless you want to leave the task to the CPU), to the schemes, strategies, the way of being on the field of the singles, and so on. Ultimately, the pace of play is what we liked the most, it is finally possible to set up reasoned actions, also play horizontally and with backward passes, waiting to find the right gap and the movements of your teammates, and the thing greatly increases the fun and realism of this fundamental part of football. There is also good news on the general artificial intelligence front. The referees seem more attentive, the players' routines, as seen before, are varied enough to allow them to insert, cut and logical movements, even in the coverage phase, with the full-backs who, for example, spare no effort to make effective closing diagonals. To be picky, however, the defenses, which enjoy a good learning coefficient in such a way as to a", "date": "2014-11-14", "grade": "8.8"}
