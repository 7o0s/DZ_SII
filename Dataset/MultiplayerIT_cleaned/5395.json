In fact, we are talking about a solid and consistent driving game, which uses an excellent and widely adjustable control system thanks to nine different layouts that combine accelerometer and touch controls. The default setting here too sees us steer by tilting the device, with millimeter precision, and activate the brake and accelerator by touching the left and right sides of the screen respectively. However, the novelties of SBK16 Official Mobile Game appear evident right from the start, given the presence of an unprecedented icon that allows you to switch from the standard third-person view to a first-person camera that shuffles the cards on the table, giving us an experience more chaotic at first but also potentially more involving and, if desired, ~permissive~ compared to the collisions that our bike can run into in the most agitated phases of the races. The aforementioned control system also supports physical controllers, completing a picture that shows great attention to all possibilities. SBK16 Official Mobile Game offers a solid and consistent driving experience, with some small changes Back on track As per tradition, SBK16 Official Mobile Game updates its roster of riders and circuits to reproduce the new season of the Motul FIM Superbike World Championship as faithfully as possible. We therefore also find in the package the German circuit of Lausitz, with its peculiar ~return~ design, the long straights and the exciting alternation of hairpin bends that are also quite difficult to tackle, as well as the Yamaha YZF R1 motorcycle. The structure of the game resumes what was seen in the 2015 edition, albeit with a different approach: all the contents are available immediately and for free, and it is even possible to deactivate the short advertising films between one event and another, not only by performing the usual in-app purchase from 2.99 euros, but also by simply completing the new Test Ride mode. It is a sequence made up of two hundred challenges, in which we will have to complete, for example, a race by reaching a certain position starting from a disadvantageous situation. An important addition to a formula that risked becoming fossilized on the usual alternation between fast races, time attack and championship, options that are nonetheless present and well tested. If SBK16 Official Mobile Game therefore earns points in terms of structure, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the technical sector, which remains valid but in line with what has been seen in past years, suffering in a particular way when a collision occurs, with one-of-a-kind solutions little too hasty from the point of view of the animations. We also experienced some frame rate uncertainty on iPhone 6s, but we are confident that this will be fixed in future updates. On the other hand, the sound accompaniment was rejected without reservations, appearing generic and lacking in personality.", "date": "2016-07-21", "grade": "7.8"}
