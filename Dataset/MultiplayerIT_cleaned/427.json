In addition to the starting breeds, continuing in the game and earning a certain amount of trainer points it will obviously be possible to unlock all the other breeds contained in the other three versions of Nintendogs up to completing your own dog ~park~. The game, unfortunately it must be said immediately, does not change anything compared to the previous versions: Dalmatians & Friends is nothing more than an additional version which had the only fault of coming out several months after the first three. The game, it must be said immediately, does not change anything compared to previous versions 101 Dalmatians The game begins in the now classic way: the choice of the dog, the first vocal lessons, walks in the surrounding area and five minutes to play with friends in the park on the fresbee. Over the days the feeling between master and dog will grow and with it his response to vocal commands, useful in obedience competitions. An essential factor in the dog's happiness will be that reserved for the game phase: there will be many toys that can be purchased and found during the game, each dog will have a very distinct character and it will thus be possible to find an animal that is afraid of barking balls or who love them and so on for all the objects in the game. The owner's moral obligation will be to pay attention to his puppy for at least ten minutes a day with a series of basic tasks such as taking him out for a walk, giving him food and cleaning him, thus making him a happy dog. Unfortunately, after months, however, nintendogs comes out slightly resized 101 Dalmatians Unfortunately, however, after months nintendogs comes out slightly resized: what initially could have seemed like a long-lived and light game, one of those to be played even for just ten minutes a day, in the long run demonstrates all its flaws with perhaps too repetitive mechanics that lead to 'abandonment of one's dog (obviously after taking him into retirement, we are non-criminal gamers) after two or three weeks. Dalmatians will still bring new life to Nintendogs, allowing those who missed it some time ago to recover it now and certainly with more choice. For all other information regarding Nintendogs, consult our review at this address Nintendogs can probably be considered as the game that marked the turning point on the European market for the Nintendo Ds, the game that expanded the portable installed base beyond the limits of imagination, managing to reach and exceed the incredible number of more than two million of copies sold. The first exponent of the Touch Generation, a group of games attributable more to applications than to classic video games, it allowed a sort of initial customization of the product by letting buyers choose between three different copies of the game which, not differing in terms of the material offered, were dedicated each to particular dog breeds: Chihuahua&Friends, Dachshunds&Friends and Labrador&Firends. Several months have passed since the release of Nintendogs and in June Nintendo decided to complete the book of breeds by releasing Dalmatians & Friends, for lovers of black and white spotted dogs.", "date": "2006-06-27", "grade": null}
