{"name": "Rugby Challenge 2006 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rugby-challenge-2006-recensione.html", "text": "40,000 spectators, packed stadium and national anthems Rugby Challenge 2006, released for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC, immediately presents itself well, with many official licenses of the most important competitions including the Guinness English Premiership, the Celtic League, the Italian league, the French one and those of the most important championships in the world, without forgetting the Six Nations and the European Cup. There will certainly be no shortage of competitions in which to participate. For a game about rugby, a sport much followed by enthusiasts, but unfortunately considered minor if only by the media, it is essential that the approach for the common user is gradual, in order to help him learn without too much difficulty the various possibilities offered by this fight for the oval ball. The same observation must have also been made at Ubisoft and, in fact, they have equipped Rugby Challenge with a valid tutorial that allows the less savvy user to learn the game and its rules. Once you understand how to successfully carry out all the movements, you can indulge yourself in choosing the mode in which to compete, ranging from the traditional Career, to the most important national championships, to the Challenge mode in which we will be able to replay the most important matches that have made history of this exciting sport. Rugby Challenge 2006 is much more arcade oriented than actual simulation. Career is certainly the main choice, in which we will take the risk of bringing a team of the lowest level to the top of world rugby, thanks to the possibility of operating on the market with the necessary investments and above all thanks to the training sessions to which we will subject our players. Ancillary modes have also been included in which the rules of the game change slightly, for example in the ~Hot Potato~ each player cannot hold the ball for more than three seconds, in the ~Rugby of the old days~ the historical rugby will be emulated in the which the traditional try was not made but the points were scored by kicking towards the goal, and to finish in ~Superstar~ before the kick-off we will choose a player who will be the only one who can score the try during the match. We certainly cannot say that the game lacks variety. The control system is quite good and is very focused on speed of execution and simplicity. With the combination of two or three keys we will be able to complete even the most complex actions. The speed and timing in pressing the buttons will be fundamental in melees, during which it will be decisive to stop the indicator several times at the right time to win the fight. Needless to deny that the approach given by Swordfish Studios is oriented much more towards the arcade rather than the actual simulation. Half successful So if the gameplay, even if very simplified, is promoted without too many problems, this is not the case for the technical sector. Despite being the first Ubisoft production in this area, knowing the team of developers we expected something more. The graphic cleaning is quite good while unfortunately the realization of the players leaves something to be desired, not only in appearance (only the most famous have been faithfully recreated) but above all in the animations at the limits of acceptable. The uniforms, on the other hand, have been faithfully reproduced in accordance with the numerous licenses acquired by the game. The game editor, developed quite well, then allows you to change the appearance of our favorite champions. The commentary, as well as the sound effects, is quite good even if scholastic and does not reach particular peaks, remaining at a purely academic level. Incredibly, there is no mode that takes advantage of the online game, unfortunately the multiplayer battles must take place exclusively ~live~ and are limited to four participants. Cross-platform The game is identical for all three platforms on which it is distributed, note the classic small advantages of the Xbox version compared to the PlayStation 2 version, namely greater graphic cleanliness and faster loading. Rugby Challenge 06 represents Ubisoft's first product in this field and it certainly shows. The game itself is discreet, the developers have rightly focused on immediacy to try to capture the attention of even non-enthusiasts, unfortunately, however, the graphic cosmetics are too sparse and have a significant impact on the enjoyment of the title. Longevity is absolutely guaranteed by the presence of many modes, some completely innovative, and by the long series of official championships present. However, the lack of valid alternatives represents a discreet advantage for Rugby Challenge 06, so if you want an alternative to EA's Rugby 06 you cannot leave yourselfescape the latest creation from the developers of Jonah Lomu Rugby. Pros Immediate and fun Lots of official licenses Multiplayer up to four players Cons offline only Technically only sufficient A few days after Italy's undeserved defeat against Ireland in the Six Nations tournament, the passion for the oval ball is rekindled with the latest product in Ubisoft's sports line, Rugby Challenge 2006. Developed by Swordfish Studios, former authors in the past of World Championship Rugby in 2003 and the older Jonah Lomu Rugby of 1995, the title of the French house is proposed as the most valid alternative to Electronic Arts' Rugby 06, let's examine it in detail.", "date": "2006-02-13", "grade": null}
