{"name": "Belli e Dannati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90080-shadows-of-the-damned-belli-e-dannati.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Suda 51, Shinji Mikami and Akira Yamaoka, three names put together that have made the specialized press write rivers of ink (or kilobytes) in recent months, gathering around the Shadows of the Damned project a hype that is not easy to manage . Only in the wildest dreams of videogame horror enthusiasts could it be thought of putting together an idea of the creator of Killer 7 and No More Heroes with the experience of the manager of the Resident Evil series, seasoning everything with the music of the historical composer of Silent Hill. These are the high-sounding foundations on which the project in question is founded, a title with premises so high as to risk creaking at the first misstep, at the slightest graphic or content imperfection. The old double-edged sword of expectation has struck again: has such a promising production hit the mark? The answer is, as often happens, ~n~, with the damned by Suda51/Mikami who, ironically, sway between lights and shadows, between a unique atmosphere, a fun gameplay, highly derivative elements everywhere and a technical realization that it certainly doesn't make you cry out for a miracle. What remains, in any case, is the characterization of the characters and the scenario, which as per Grasshopper tradition remains well planted in the memory thanks to its charisma, although we are still far from the abstract symbolism of Killer 7 and decidedly closer to the trash of No More Heroes, here pushed towards new frontiers by the demonic setting halfway between the more splatter grindhouse and the esoteric classicism of Hispanic matrix. In the midst of so much horror, however, the deep note that resonates with the greatest intensity and that remains alive in the memory is the humor that characterizes the entire journey to hell of the strange pair of protagonists. Drag me to hell Garcia Hotspur is a Hispanic demon hunter who seems to have seen a lot, many of which have left their mark between scars and tattoos on his own skin. The reason that drives him to go through hell, within what he defines as his ~demonic road movie~ is the oldest that there can be, or rather the desperate attempt to save his loved one, snatched by the lord dark Fleming. What risks being an abused canvas is revived by the sarcastic spirit that pervades the hallucinatory journey, above all thanks to the personality of Johnson, the companion of the protagonist. The latter is an escaped demon from the underworld who helps Garcia's mission in various ways, being able to shapeshift, transforming from his ~normal~ appearance of a flying skull into a flashlight, various firearms and even a motorcycle, all 'occurrence. But above all he leaves his mark on the gameplay for the continuous supply of caustic comments and sarcastic jokes on the underworld, which he obviously knows well but from which he is somehow detached. Mind you, you need to have the palate to appreciate the grindhouse-style dialogues, between Mexican-flavored machisms and exquisitely scatological jokes, but the interludes between the two probably represent the best aspect of the gaming experience, with colorful comments on the strange habits of the demons and puzzles based on ~demonic pubic hair~, just to name a few. The level design itself, which puts us in front of intrinsically humorous moments, together with the personality of the protagonist couple, continuously dilute the horrific and ultra-violent climate that the Grasshoppers have built in their particular vision of hell. This is a sort of glittering alternative world where, among torn bodies, blood and monstrous beings, in some cases we find bizarre connections with the real world, as demonstrated by the billboards that cover the walls of the levels, moreover quite obvious quotations from the promotional messages and of propaganda seen in Bioshock. Garcia's Strange Inferno The gameplay is set according to the typical stylistic features of the third person shooter, in particular derived in a marked way from the structure of Resident Evil 4, with the decisive addition of the updated possibilities engine of the protagonist who in this case can move while shooting and occasionally carry out contextual actions based on the characteristics of the scenario (launch from windows, climb over objects, activate mechanisms). The combat is based on hitting neuralgic points using the pointer of the weapon, sensitive cores that change according to the type of demon we are dealing with, a solution also derived from the developers' previous productions, between Resident Evil and Killer 7 , although in this case the speedThe generality of the enemies and the mobility of the protagonist make everything much more dynamic. The management of light represents the most characteristic element of the gameplay: the shadow appears in the inferno of Shadows of the Damned both in a natural way, as a simple lack of light that makes enemies more aggressive, and as an alternative dimension proper , a palpable darkness that can appear in fixed or expanding areas, which changes the characteristics of the world and damages Garcia's health if it remains there too long, making it necessary to take bonuses capable of increasing its resistance and to search in all ways to find and light the lanterns or ~goat heads~ scattered throughout the levels as particular sources of light present in this bizarre hell. The shadow-element then represents an integral part of the gameplay since in several cases to get to the bottom of puzzles or particular types of enemies it is required to pass from one dimension to another, to make visible, for example, hidden ~switches~ or sensitive nuclei from hit. The mechanics of parallel but intersected dimensions is also an excellent variant which partially dilutes the otherwise extremely linear development of level design. A demon for a friend Another characterizing element of the game is Johnson's role as a transformable weapon, even if behind the particular solution adopted to equip a simple tool with its own specific and disruptive personality, there are no substantial innovations in the management of weapons. In practice, the demon-skull is able to transform into a pistol, rifle or machine gun as well as being used as a torch useful both for lighting and for melee attacks. Each configuration of Johnson is particularly useful in certain situations and can in turn be enhanced through the application of rare red gems that are conquered by knocking down the most difficult enemies, finding them in the most hidden places of the levels or buying them from Christopher, another ~good~ demon ~ who plays the classic role of merchant. In short, all typical characteristics of the Japanese school shooter, although presented in an undoubtedly new and highly charismatic setting. Johnson is also capable of shooting the ~shot of light~, i.e. a luminous projectile capable of having different effects and particularly useful in solving puzzles or in battles with bosses: the shot of light can turn on the lamps and the ~heads of goat~, but can also break down the armor of shadow that some enemies wear and which makes them invulnerable to normal shots, other elements that enrich the shooter dynamics. In most cases, it is necessary to aim very precisely at certain elements of the scenario, or precise anatomical parts of the enemies, in order to obtain any positive result and this makes the level of challenge constantly challenging. On the other hand, the interaction with the elements always takes place for better or worse in a violent way and Johnson is to all intents and purposes always the tool with which Garcia carries out his actions, whether it is a matter of killing demons or solving puzzles and opening doors, therefore the simple firearm assumes here the role of fulcrum of the action, in the shooter phases and in the - less incisive but still present - adventure phases. Xbox 360 goals 50 unlockable achievements for 1000 gamerpoints is the standard loot you can collect from Shadow of the Damned. Most of these are achieved regularly by progressing, overcoming levels and defeating bosses, therefore already a first conclusion of the story allows the collection of a good number of points. For the complete collection it is necessary to focus on particular performances, more suitable for experts. Eclectic hell The characterization of characters and settings is therefore the real strong point of the game, which appears evident after a few minutes immersed in the damnation of Garcia and Johnson. If the gameplay elements can be largely derivative, there is very little already seen with regard to settings, enemies and main characters, in the bizarre carnival of pseudo-Mexican, Gothic, modern, Victorian and medieval elements that intersect in this particular gaming hell. There are faces set on the doors that ask for strawberries or various human entrails to open, there are vending machines for alcoholic beverages to restore the protagonist's health, women in lingerie and demons with obvious faecal incontinence problems, all elements that are examined by the protagonist duo , who for their part liquidate the oddities on the screen with caustic jokes to be taken with the right sense of irony. From a stylistic point of view, the work done does not betray the standardsd by Grasshopper, the technical execution however does not always keep pace with the glowing ideas of the team. The Unreal Engine base is evident from the typical Epic shaders, but except for some topical moments, such as boss fights, it never seems to be faced with a large-caliber title from a graphic point of view, given the frequent repetition of elements of scenery and textures sometimes of not very high quality. Narrow corridors and not too large rooms are the usual EU equipment, as well as an interaction with the scenarios reduced to historic minimums, while the management of the camera combined with the angular movements of the protagonist tend to sometimes make the game action rather chaotic. Shadows of the Damned seems to represent the paradigm of the Japanese teams grappling with Western graphics engines, with its stylistically original and impactful but technically backward representation, compared to other titles related to the genre currently on the market. Virtually perfect in his role instead Akira Yamaoka, whose Spanish soundtrack with rock grafts fits perfectly into the general atmosphere of the game.", "date": "2011-06-21", "grade": "7.5"}
