{"name": "The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episodio 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-walking-dead-the-final-season-episodio-1-recensione.html", "text": "We approached this new and final season of Telltale's The Walking Dead, trying to get rid of all references to a work that made the team great, but which also proved to be no longer successful, after an exciting first season and very hard, to hit the mark in the same way with the next two (and probably with none other of the myriad licensed series churned out in these six years). Like a curse, the impact of those five episodes in crescendo has never been replicable, and if on the one hand the second season still remained on a high quality level, the third had collapsed in on itself, tired and inconclusive like few others . For this reason, and for Telltale's promise to surprise and reinvent itself with this fourth and final season, we let ourselves go, trying to become part of this universe as if we didn't know its evolution. The premise always remains the same when it comes to episodic works: it is impossible to decree its value from a single fragment, even more when it comes to the first, but we are called to judge it as a completed work, and we can only think that Telltale has at least adjusted the throw. The story of ~motherhood~ We all know how in the first season, the evolution of the relationship between Lee and Clementine, thought out and written very well, had allowed The Walking Dead to bring players the whole atmosphere of the Kirkman comic. Where the TV series immediately lost its way, the episodes of the Telltale title told the horror of the world into which the protagonists found themselves catapulted and Lee's need to turn into a father against his will, so like Clementine's acquired awareness of having to grow up faster than a child ever should. A similar mixture, combined with a series of well-written situations and supporting actors, is what Telltale tries to replicate with this last piece. If before the curly little girl was the victim to protect, now the roles are reversed, and it is Clementine who has to manage a ~motherhood~ that has been catapulted on her. Here lies all the cunning of a team aware of its limitations in narrative terms, which once upset and never again succeeded in the same goal. What way then to try to recreate the sensations of the past? Put us in the exact same situation, years later, with the now teenage girl grappling with the responsibility of survival for herself and for AJ. This premise is not even too hidden and it is precisely here that Telltale's honesty lies, putting Clementine in a position to tell us, at the end of the prologue, that we are about to experience those same atmospheres again. The relationship with the child is well written and the feeling is that the consequences of what we will teach him will have important repercussions, starting with a rather interesting and unexpected final twist (at least during our run). Too early to say if everything will evolve for the best, but the premises are more than positive and the feeling that AJ could be something very close to the first season's Clementine is quite successful. From a first introductory scene, which also serves to present us with all the differences in technical and gameplay terms that we will analyze shortly, a couple of hours of never too tired moments unfold, albeit with the brakes pulled for a good half. The new location (a dormitory full of boys of various ages and ethnicities) is the backdrop for the introduction of new characters, among the best characterized of the series, despite the limited time available. Precisely due to its narrative nature, we have no intention of spoiling the surprise for you, but we are sure that the final stages of this chapter will snatch more than a feeling of hatred and compassion from you, hitting the mark where this series has not been able to since its inception . A whirlwind of events in the final half hour is what finally manages to raise a narration and a tired team, which perhaps right now that it has time to dedicate to what it loved most, manages to give us those emotions that only the universe invented by Kirkman has been able to donate in recent years. Gameplay reinvented Telltale has made a point of making it big. For the first time, in fact, the team gets to work to completely renew its approach to gameplay. No shots from above, no wide shots, welcome camera behind the protagonist's back. This moment of important detachment is so accentuated in the initial stages as to leave you displaced, but able to immediately understand the work done also with regard to the ~action~ stages. Now, with respect to the passato, it is possible to stun and kill the walkers with the pressure of two different keys. If unfortunately you end up too close to an enemy, a sequence will start in which we will be called to quickly press a key, before giving the coup de grace. The phases of interactions are clearer, with superfluous elements that enrich the game world and with those that carry on the narrative indicated by a colored circle around the key to press. There is also the possibility of collecting a handful of collectibles with which to furnish your dorm room. Important choices are always accompanied by signals that confirm how and when a character will change his approach to our actions and, even if some relationship changes appear too simplistic and sudden, it is certainly early to decree their goodness with the passing of the hours and episodes. Technically a big step forward We conclude the analysis of this first episode with the element that perhaps most struck us. We knew Telltale was going to put its engine on fire and make this season the final of The Walking Dead, the swan song of a storytelling that has probably said all it had to say. Despite the good intentions and premise of the various trailers released over time, the surprise in seeing how everything is so smooth and beautiful to look at is quite surprising. Forget about an exaggerated polygonal mass, which is rather useless when it comes to cel shading, but everything that runs on the screen, as well as the environments, textures and sound behavior, have taken a rather important step forward. Basta Fuggire (this is the title of the first episode) is beautiful in a way that we never expected and this is enough to give us the hope of seeing a large amount of settings of this caliber over time. Thanks to the camera much closer to the protagonist, it is possible to appreciate even more the game world and the extension of the environments extremely more substantial than in the past. It is all seasoned with an excellent English dubbing and a discreet (for the first time since day one) adaptation in the language of the Bel Paese.", "date": "2018-08-20", "grade": "7.5"}
