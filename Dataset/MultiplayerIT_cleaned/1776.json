{"name": "Bmx XXX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bmx-xxx.html", "text": "The graphics department The graphic design of Bmx XXX is without beating about the bush mediocre, the game environments and the characters are made with sufficient care, but in any case, they do not particularly exalt. The characters, although customizable with tattoos and accessories, remain somewhat anonymous and devoid of personality. As far as cities are concerned, however, it should be emphasized that areas full of ramps alternate with others that are completely deserted. Analyzing more deeply, we notice how the textures are not up to the situation, resulting in poorly defined; in addition, the game suffers quite heavily from Aliasing, which in certain situations is quite annoying. Another defect found is the poor realization of collisions between polygons: very often it will happen to see your character cross a wall with a part of the body, which is decidedly unreliable. The animations of the characters are very well done, realistic and faithful to those of a real Bmx rider; each trick is reproduced to perfection, thus satisfying fans of the genre. Cycling, what a passion! As already mentioned above, during the main mode, or the Hardcore Tour, you will have to face different missions riding your Bmx performing a vast amount of stunts, so the essential feature of a game like this is undoubtedly having excellent playability . The Z-Axis title immediately offers the player a good feeling with the controls, you will immediately be able to master your Bmx discreetly. During the game, your character will be able to increase his skill thanks to the bicycle parts that you can find scattered throughout the levels, thus giving a pinch of variety to the game. The Sony pad is well used in Bmx XXX, each key will allow you to perform a different trick from the other. The title offers the player a fair amount of freedom, the only obstacle you will have to face will be the energy bar, which, once it reaches zero, will sanction the end of your stunts by ending the game session. longevity Bmx XXX will offer you nine game levels in which you will have to carry out 20 missions, thanks to this the programmers have ensured a good longevity to their ~on two wheels~ title. It should be added that in each level of the game you will be able to unlock secret parts, i.e. extra pieces for your bicycle, coins useful for unlocking movies and the possibility of setting new records that will crown you Bmx champion. I also underline the fact of being able to roam around peacefully throughout the level and have fun doing stunts in complete freedom, a very appreciable possibility also in function of the absence of the timer which, in my opinion, would have greatly limited the game action. Hey, turn on the stereo! The most appropriate aspect of Bmx XXX is undoubtedly the sound. During the game you will be accompanied by a respectable soundtrack, characterized by remarkably captivating and powerful motifs: among the musical artists I mention Green Day, present with their Basket Case. A background voice will accompany you throughout the game, but be careful, it won't be very tender with you since as soon as you miss a trick you will be covered in insults by the latter. The characters who live in the city are quite funny, expect equally funny and amusing phrases from them. Final comment Bmx XXX is a title that has caused discussion more for the content prohibited to minors than for the game itself. Analyzing it in detail we see how this game turns out to be rather linear and repetitive despite the excellent amount of missions to be carried out. The Z-Axis have not been able to exploit PlayStation 2 properly, creating a mediocre title unable to stand out among others in the Bmx genre. It goes without saying that I recommend the purchase only to fans of the genre, others should go elsewhere where they will be able to find, without a shadow of a doubt, a title capable of offering much more than Bmx XXX Pros: A game out of the box for its content At times funny Soundtrack Cons: Graphic design Linearity Little substance Acclaim and Z-Axis present: Bmx XXX! One of the most talked about and criticized games of recent times makes its debut on PlayStation 2 with the intention of causing a sensation. Developed by Z- Axis, Bmx XXX offers a captivating mix between hot girls and east sportsoar, what more to expect? The main screen of this captivating game allows the player to choose between five possibilities: Hardcore Tour, i.e. the main game mode, Multiplayer, Character Editor, Game Extras, and Options. Entering Hardcore Tour you will have to select your character from those available in the game, about ten, or the character created by you using the Editor. Once you have decided the character you will have to decide in which level to play; the first, set in the Bronx, will introduce you to the game. The main mode of Bmx XXX is structured in missions to be carried out within the city area, you, aboard your faithful Bmx, must be able to complete them. Each level has an excellent amount of missions and submissions, I mention for example the one in which you will have to help a poor homeless man to recover some empty cans useful for earning his daily food. It is useless to emphasize the ~hot~ character of this game, in fact, by performing certain stunts on your Bmx you will unlock decidedly spicy videos, in which beautiful girls will perform a Strip Tease all for you. Despite the good premises, the Z-Axis have not managed to mask the defects of a game that offers nothing more than other titles where BMX takes the lion's share. Let's analyze it more deeply in every aspect.", "date": "2003-02-03", "grade": null}
