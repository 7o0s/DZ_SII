It is a festival simulator developed by On The Metal in collaboration with Sony XDev Studio Europe, which promises to give the possibility to take care of every aspect in the promotion of a musical event. From the choice to the growth of the bands, passing through the management of the public and services, everything should be in the player's hands. But is that really the case in the end? BigFest seems to have been born to demonstrate that a great idea is not enough to create something good BigDave lends you a hand The festival season is upon us and the player is called upon to take on the role of a promoter with the aim of transforming a huge green area, which has long been used as an open-air landfill, into a gathering place for fans of music. The role of guide to the world of musical events belongs to BigDave, the head of the roadies, who from the very beginning makes his experience available to explain the basic mechanics of the game. So BigFest is immediately configured as the most classic of management software: the musical events are programmed on the basis of billboards, each of which requires the completion of three objectives that allow you to earn stars useful for unlocking subsequent billboards. During each event you have to decide which bands to take on stage and make sure that the audience and artists always feel at ease. To do this, first of all, it is necessary to keep the number of visitors in balance with the festival structures: the possibility of expanding the campsite, for example, allows for a greater fixed attendance but on the other hand makes it necessary to improve services such as showers and toilets. The equipment must also be adapted to the number of spectators, who will have greater demands as the event gets bigger. Increasing the number of tills, improving the lighting or installing big screens is a great way to make visitors happy, who also have preferences for food, drinks and merchandise items. It is therefore necessary to decide which stalls to place also based on the needs of the public, or on the weather conditions, always bearing in mind that each element can only be added in limited quantities. In fact, the available showers depend on the size of the drain, the usable watts for the equipment on the power of the generator, the number of licenses for the stalls varies according to the level of supplies, and so on. Band coach? BigFest therefore proposes a respectable management structure, to which depth is added with the arrival of various hecklers who try to ruin even the most solid profit plans: arson clowns, thieves, stinking ~punkabbestia~ and ultra vandals must then be removed; but there is also room for vampires, werewolves and valkyries, as well as visitors with flu or fungal infections that can cause an epidemic. Not to mention nudist disturbers, spectators at risk of exposure or others affected by sunstroke. In short, the fauna is very diversified and it is a real pity that, despite all these elements, the game is boring and full of problems of various entities. The growth of the bands, for example, should be one of the flagship elements of the title. On balance, however, it is repetitive and based on an unpredictable experience system. Groups level up in a completely arbitrary way and, without warning, go from level one to ten, from ten to thirteen and then to twenty, and finally directly to fifty in a matter of minutes. With all due respect to the billboards that require the performance of artists with a reputation between twenty-five and thirty-nine. Situations during performances also tend to repeat themselves over and over: chasing out hecklers, pandering to bands, repairing structures and modifying stalls to meet visitor demands. If at the beginning everything requires a bit of prudence (also due to inexperience), as the hours go by the progression becomes mechanical and the money begins to flow in rivers into the coffers even without an active interaction with the events. PSVita trophies With BigFest hunters will be able to get their hands on 13 trophies, including a rather simple platinum. These are objectives related to the normal progress of the game and they can all be unlocked in just over ten hours. But beware of glitches: the ~A big yellow taxi~ gold trophy may not unlock due to the cutscenes at the end of the conceptrto. It is therefore advisable to concentrate on removing the required fifty trees as soon as possible, before confirming the selection of bands for one of the billboards. Out of tune guitar BigFest's songs come from the Jamendo catalog, an independent music aggregator that hosts unsigned artists. No support from the Sony record company, then, but that's not the problem. The proposed songs do not seem to have received any kind of selection and the quality fluctuates a lot between the various artists. For this reason the very long times required to download new tracks (you can have eight at a time) become unbearable, which nullify any ambition for experimentation which should be one of the cornerstones of the game. Despite the low player load, the servers are also bad in other circumstances: when starting the application, for example, it is almost impossible to automatically access the online mode and you have to force the connection later. Then there are some line drops even during the events, with consequent saving problems due to the continuous online synchronization, which in some cases can lead to glitches in the recognition of unlockable objects. Some difficulties also occur with the special billboards, probably the funniest for situations and lines of text, and with the social component. The latter should allow interaction with users from all over the world by sending jammers, but in reality the damage caused is only visible for a short time and thus ends up becoming a simple alternative method to accumulate money quickly in the advanced stages of the game.", "date": "2015-12-21", "grade": "5.0"}
