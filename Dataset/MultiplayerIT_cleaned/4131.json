{"name": "Mobile Raid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mobile-raid-la-recensione.html", "text": "Mobile platforms have found a way to bend certain classic genres towards new variations, in order to make the most of the typical characteristics of these devices: portability, constant connection and direct connection to social elements, as well as obviously the possibility of applying of alternative businesses and often based on micro-transactions. For some years now, therefore, real new genres have been born, which maintain some obvious links with other standard videogame types but distance themselves from them in many respects, configuring themselves as ~new~ games, which already enjoy a vast audience of enthusiasts but they need to be somewhat metabolized by old-fashioned gamers. The genre defined SLG falls quite precisely into this category of titles, such as the present Mobile Raid: largely derived from the strategic games that emerged in the social sphere, within Facebook or at the various portals that offer free-to-play titles , this typology largely pertains to the classic strategy, but adds a large amount of management and managerial elements, which often result in the well-known micro-transactions, even if their use is obviously left to the player's decision. SLG would stand for ~simulation game~, or something like that, and the definition itself distances it somewhat from the classic strategy, even if the basis is undoubtedly common. Mobile Raid, for example, clearly incorporates some typical characteristics of the Command & Conquer series, such as the futuristic setting and also the design of various combat units, but places everything within a more stratified and complex picture, more focused on management of the resources of the base more than on the direct control of the units during the clashes with the enemy. The sense of the game, in short, is essentially to make one's city-base work: to make it bigger, more efficient, stronger against attacks from outside and more powerful in the expansionist policy. In all of this, the actual clash turns out to be a small part of the amount of things to keep an eye on and constantly manage. Handyman commander The story tells of a world on the brink of a gigantic war between three factions, within which there is a small strip of land where a young commander tests himself in the management of a fortified city. With the typical view from above, we therefore find ourselves essentially managing two phases: the construction and evolution of the internal structures of the base and the external battlefield, where the battles with the bosses take place and the conquest of new territories to be annexed to our sphere of control. During the early stages of the story, the progression is clearly marked by some obligatory passages to which the game forces us, leaving very little freedom of choice, but as time progresses and resources increase, the degree of freedom expands, although some practice is required before mastering all the features of the game. It is in fact an extremely stratified management system, where each single structure opens up numerous options and sub-sections, so it is easy to get lost among the menus and the learning phase is rather long. In the face of this powerful management structure, the combat system appears somewhat simplified, simply requiring you to choose the commanders to deploy and the amount of units for each category to send into battle, with the outcome of the battle being calculated based on the level of the contenders. The game is therefore played entirely upstream, in the complex preparation of the army and the commanders, one and the other always subject to continuous evolutions and upgrades in concert with the evolution of the entire base. Within all this there is also the inevitable ~gacha~ dynamic of the heroes to be unlocked and conquered, each characterized by its own statistics and special abilities that can be used in different situations: from leading the strategic vanguard to managing the troops of assault, up to more complex and fine specializations such as espionage and diplomacy. In short, the strategic-management base of Mobile Raid is convincing and, after an initial period of adaptation, even involving, the problem - needless to say - lies in the free-to-play structure, as often happens with this type of game. There is no real constraint towards micro-transactions, just as the dynamic cannot be defined as ~pay to win~, however the continuous game of waiting becomes stressful in the long run, when the continuous request for diamonds (the in-game currency principal that can be purchaseda even with real money) begins to become pressing and unbalanced with respect to the amount of resources that can be conquered by playing. At this point it becomes necessary, in order not to run into the forced purchase, to balance the game time a little in order to make the frequent (and in some cases even long) forced breaks more sustainable.", "date": "2018-07-25", "grade": "7.0"}
