No, please, not for a commercial issue - after all Nioh has sold very well and has put the team back on track after years of oblivion - nor for a mental health issue: our apprehension derives from the overwork that the developers of the software house have they are voluntarily submitting, because if in such a short time you release a DLC like Dragon of the North, which has just appeared on the shores of the PlayStation Store, it is clear that you have sacrificed too many hours of sleep for an ordinary human being. Seriously, Dragon of the North isn't just an add-on pack, it's an expansion in its own right, adding a whole new region to the base campaign. There is everything inside: new bosses, new weapons, new armor, new spirits and a fair handful of new enemies that demonstrate how much Team Ninja wants to enter the Guinness Book of Records for ~the most massive and longest-running action ever ~. We played it, not without some problems given its requirements, and today we have every intention of evaluating it with you. Prepare well, however, because it is only the first of three pieces. Dragon of the North, the first DLC of Nioh, is finally here: our review! In the snow, you die As already mentioned, Dragon of the North is not a normal DLC. Team Ninja has in fact made the courageous choice to place it chronologically after the main campaign, making it accessible only after the conclusion of the latter. To be able to access the region in which this new phase of William's story takes place, therefore, it will not be enough to buy the season pass: the DLC does not adapt to the player's level and joins the original events seamlessly, with the usual mix of main and side missions. Predictably, since these are post-final content, the difficulty is set upwards and you will find particularly fierce Yokai waiting for you, including strange human-demon hybrids who beat like blacksmiths and don't take long to send even players who have invested a lot to the creator on life points. That said, the DLC's difficulty is also one of its main flaws, due to the very structure of the base title. However complex, in fact, the system rich in role-playing game elements of Nioh lends itself to being ~broken~, with a long series of abusable specializations that allow you to eliminate any threat in a nano second if you invest the Amrita properly and due time has been spent retrieving divine weapons and armor with best effects. This makes the level of challenge bipolar: those who gave up the title shortly after the ending, without worrying too much about how to develop William, will sweat a lot to bring home the loaf (although the powerful equipment is not missing in the new maps), whoever Now a master, he'll scrub new missions like they're full of budding demons, never really being challenged. We admit that balancing such a situation is almost impossible, but we would have liked some insane difficulty mode, to test even the most experienced players. The others, at least, will not fail to throw some healthy curses in front of the difficult bosses of the game (the first in particular is the most inspired, where the others have not sincerely told us much) and the mass of angry Yokai who populate the snowy maps below Masamune Date's control. The John Holmes of the samurai The events of the Date clan and the new missions are not the only gem of Drago del Nord. There's a new weapon in William's arsenal, and it's a sword larger than is legal to be for any sharp object, the Odachi. This broadsword, whose modifiers are based on the strength statistic, boasts a fresh fresh moveset, and although not very fast, it has a frightening range and damage. We do not doubt that many will prefer it to axes and common katanas, so much so that we already see several builds (among the corpses scattered across the maps) that seem to have replaced their original weapons. Furthermore, the new spirits that accompany the new blade are aesthetically among the most beautiful in the game, and to them is added the possibility of transforming into female characters, the chance to equip two spirits at a time (alternating the active one, with bonus extra) and various balance adjustments also designed for PvP. Now, PvP would actually be a gifted addition to all owners of the game, but there's a problem: remember what we said earlier about the Nioh system? It's complex, customizable, and... can be ~broken~ quite easily. This is an action calculated totally around the showvariety of battles and the possibility for the player to customize his alter ego with moves of unspeakable power; predictably, it is in no way suitable for PvP. Team Ninja added the competitive due to the incessant requests of the fans, but to make it passable it would have had to put serious limiters on the damage, since in its current state it is pure chaos, sometimes unplayable, and also plagued by a little annoying latency . In short, the effort was appreciable, but for the execution to be equally good, there is a lot of work to be done. We close with longevity, more than excellent, given that it will undoubtedly take you a few hours to complete the new region (not to mention the obvious lengthening of the experience, in case you decide to make the most of the new missions to perfect your equipment) .", "date": "2017-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
