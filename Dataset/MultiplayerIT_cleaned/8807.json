The protagonist of the game is Roo, a kangaroo mother intent on saving her puppy Joey, who is about to be sold to a Sydney zoo. The road to reach the big Australian city will be quite long and full of obstacles, to be overcome using a mix of reflexes, precision and reasoning; all through twenty chapters, for a total of four hundred and twenty individual levels (three hundred standard, one hundred and twenty ~extreme~) to which, every week, ten more are added for free. The basic idea is very simple: each stage can be tackled in a matter of seconds, literally, and speed is rewarded with the release of a gold star. In this way completing the fifteen levels of each chapter becomes a matter of minutes, so much so that often the impression is that of being faced with a rather ~ethereal~ production from the point of view of consistency. A sensation that is however swept away thanks to the involvement that the gameplay is able to arouse, irresistible in its immediacy, which in each different scenario relies on a particular element to make the challenge more varied and multifaceted. Can you see the pouch? Run Roo Run's control system makes use exclusively of the touch screen and requires a single press for the character to take a leap. In the upper right part of the screen there is an icon that can provide us with some help, such as a ~bullet time~ function to slow down the action or one to automatically complete the level. Clearly it can only be used occasionally, even if most of the time there will be no need. The degree of challenge of the game is in fact largely manageable, and you can only find yourself in difficulty when the challenges involve calculating the times for the jump: once you touch the screen, Roo begins his march and we cannot stop it, therefore we will have to carry out jumps at the right time and with the right timing, even more so if the objective of the turn is to get on a moving platform. However, there are so many elements taken into consideration by 5TH Cell: from simple obstacles to the possibility of taking off double jumps, from trampolines to tires tied to a rope, from kangaroo-shooting cannons to invisibility potions, passing through slippery surfaces, devices capable of modifying gravity and so on. The completion of each chapter guarantees access to ~extreme~ levels based on the same location, in which the speed of the action increases as well as the danger of the obstacles, and you really have to do the math well to win. Moving on to the technical sector, compared to Scribblenauts the step forward made in terms of design is evident: the characters in the game are well designed, with an effective and pleasant style, and at the same time the scenarios also look lively and colourful, thanks with full-bodied edges that recall the cartoons of a comic. The sound accompaniment is less brilliant: the musical theme is nice, but ends up being repetitive after a while.
