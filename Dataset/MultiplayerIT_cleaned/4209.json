This first DLC, available at the price of 11.99 euros or included for free in the Season Pass, starts from a fascinating concept, that is to take one of the many supporting characters from the base game campaign and make them the protagonists of a story, in this specific case set in the past . The character we control in the expansion is in fact Wendell Redler, the veteran we met during one of the missions in Hope County and who asked us, if possible, to find his Vietnam lighters. It is precisely his experience in the war that represents the fulcrum of the experience, with one episode in particular in which Redler is shot down together with his team while exploring Vietnamese territory aboard a helicopter, and finds himself a prisoner of the Viet Cong. After witnessing a comrade killed in cold blood, the protagonist manages to free himself from the cage in which he is confined following an airstrike by support troops, then flees when new hostile troops arrive on the spot. From this point on, the approach is the classic Far Cry one, with the possibility of making some silent eliminations using a bat, then getting a gun and starting to get back on top. Gameplay and game structure The goal in Far Cry 5 - Hours of Darkness is to reach an extraction point within a relatively small map, trying to do it after saving the three still missing Redler companions (Joker, Moses and Yokel) and perhaps completed a series of side missions, such as freeing South Vietnamese prisoners, destroying anti-aircraft emplacements, eliminating North Vietnamese commanders, conquering camps controlled by enemy troops, blowing up propaganda loudspeakers and of course collecting the eight scattered lighters within the map. You can choose how to proceed, in the sense that there is no real obligation to dedicate yourself to the side quests and it is theoretically possible to get to the end alone, without worrying about saving anyone, but this will clearly make the experience even more more inconsistent than it actually is. The big problem of Hours of Darkness lies in fact in its short duration: the expansion is completed in the space of three hours, with few highlights and few new features compared to what we have already seen in the original campaign, setting aside. You get hold of new weapons quite quickly, naturally linked to the scenario and the era but with an identical feeling and without clear breaks compared to what was seen in Far Cry 5, and the stealthy or disruptive approach emphasizes different traits of the protagonist , in a sort of progression to Wolfenstein: The Old Blood which, however, is not explored. A concrete novelty is represented by the possibility of ordering air strikes against targets, but only when the area is free from anti-aircraft devices. The similarities with the base game are obviously obvious, net of some differences also dictated by the fact that we won't have who knows how much time to develop the character, nor to pay attention to the mechanics related to hunting, even present. However, the dynamics of liberating the bases and completing the objectives are the same, just as it is possible to exploit the liberated companions such as the mercenaries of Hope County, with the possibility of being revived in case of need and doing the same where needed. Playstation 4 trophies There are only seven Trophies included in Far Cry 5 - Hours of Darkness, and getting them is quite simple. In fact, the achievements are unlocked by completing the expansion in the three available modes (standard, Survival and Action Movie), freeing the three prisoners, making a certain number of silent kills, and so on. Atmosphere, graphics and conclusions By now it is quite clear that making comic-style introductions costs substantially less than putting together cinematic sequences, and Hours of Darkness is no exception in this sense, telling us the incipit of the story of Wendell Redler, his imprisonment and his ransom, through basically static and not very inspired images. However, the graphics of the expansion are excellent, in line with that of Far Cry 5, with lots of details and great care with regard to the scenarios, which alternate large green expanses, rocky areas, rivers and small settlements, the latter however not beautiful to be seen. There are cables to move quickly with, but even this mechanic is only hinted at and set aside rapidly, together with the need to move in a strictly silent manner, perhaps eliminating the targets using the bow so as not to alert their companions. In the end, the degree of challenge is not extraordinary, it is possible to fight without major problems even in situations of strong numerical inferiority, thanks to the experience made with the followers of Eden's Gate, and the final confrontations are reached without great effort. then unlocking two alternative ways to replay the expansion: Survival, where you play with decreased health and a limited inventory; and Action Movies, which on the contrary allows you to get additional slots for weapons and launch air strikes even where in theory you could not. Alternative interpretations that should serve to promote the replayability of this package, understood a bit as a challenge to complete the path by completing as many missions as possible, but which crash against the general lack of ideas and the many, too many little aspects appreciate the expansion.", "date": "2018-06-09", "grade": null}
