The two titles have several things in common: they are not first party Nintendo, for example, and then they have two important mascots of the Japanese company as protagonists. Furthermore, even more importantly, they are the spiritual sequels of some titles that have marked the history of the great N and of the platform genre in its entirety. After completing Kirby's new adventure and unlocking practically everything there was to unlock, we can reassure you: the title signed by HAL Laboratory is everything fans of the pink wad expected. Return to the former glory of Kirby Superstar (SNES) with a sprinkle of Kirby's Adventure Wii and an ounce of three-dimensionality implemented in a truly ingenious way... Kirby returns to flutter with a fun and original ~two and a half dimensions~ platformer Up, up, higher and higher Although it is a simple pretext to stage the approximately forty levels of the game, the little story that forms the backdrop to Kirby's new adventures is quite nice and, in the end, will certainly excite longtime fans of the pink ball. It is inspired several times by various fairly famous fairy tales, starting with that of the magic beans: in a not very high quality computer graphic kinematics we witness the growth of an enormous plant, the so-called dream plant, which arises from Dream Land and soars into the sky, taking Kirby's cottage and Dedede's castle with it. It is precisely to the latter that Kirby first thinks of his awakening, but once he arrives at the castle he discovers that his historical archenemy has nothing to do with it and that he was indeed captured by a strange and malevolent creature named Taranza. Kirby will then discover that he has ended up in the shattered world of Floralia and will decide to pursue the mysterious Taranza to save Dedede and the inhabitants of Floralia kidnapped with him. At that point the story of the game steps aside to make way for the gameplay, reappearing only before the final battles with a series of nice subtitled cutscenes: HAL Laboratory perhaps didn't manage to be as spectacular as it wanted, but we appreciated the effort and we are convinced that Kirby fans will like it too. After all, the emphasis is placed entirely on the gameplay and game levels, divided into six worlds: each of them offers at least five stages, a secret level and a final boss. The variety of settings is remarkable, although it winks at Kirby's previous adventures; you start from the enchanted forests of Dream Land and pass through the world of sweets, that of underground ruins and so on, until you reach the fortress of Taranza. HAL Laboratory has used the same graphics engine already seen in Kirby's Adventure Wii to give life to colorful scenarios in ~2D and a half~: it's all polygonal, but the gameplay is horizontal and vertical scrolling as in the more classic pink wad adventure. From this point of view, Kirby: Triple Deluxe is actually not very original since it proposes not only the style but also most of the creatures and enemies already faced in our previous explorations of Dream Land and its surroundings since the days of the NES. The cosmetics, however, are a feast for the eyes: each scenario is colorful and full of details, embellished with a game of depth and parallax that is not simply an aesthetic tinsel but an integral part of the gameplay. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect employed by HAL Laboratory is exceptional, even if by deactivating it you will not lose the nuances of the gameplay based on the depth of the scenarios but only the visual spectacularity of the proposed situations. We therefore advise you to activate it and enjoy the show. At the bottom of the heart Kirby: Triple Deluxe plays exactly like the more traditional chubby pink creature platformer, and that means you jump, flap and suck in your enemies to absorb their powers. All the transformations already seen in the prequel Kirby's Adventure Wii are back, to which is added the welcome return of the Wheel and some new powers such as the Scarab. For each of them, a large list of special moves and abilities has been compiled that will allow Kirby to get the better of his enemies: in reality, many of them are quite superfluous, but it's nice to know that they exist and that they can be used with a some creativity. After all, the various powers are not only used to get rid of the bad guys - bosses or municipalities - but also to solve the various environmental puzzles scattered throughout the levels. In some cases it will be necessary to take advantage of the powerful blows of the Scarabeo or the Hammer to flip a switch, in others you will have to freeze a red-hot block or light a fuse with the breath of fire: the solution to these puzzles is often very intuitive and the enemy who possesses the necessary power is almost always nearby , except when it comes to some hidden area or some special treasure designed so that the player manages the powers available with more foresight and possibly replays the level. Many sequences also leverage the motion sensor integrated into the console, forcing the player to tilt it to the right or left to move obstacles or means of transport, and still others will combine all these features in real puzzles, and timed to boot. In short, from the point of view of level design, there is no shortage of variety, but the stroke of genius of HAL Laboratory was certainly the use of depth and the two levels of parallax on which the action takes place. In fact, most of the stages run simultaneously on the main floor and on the background one, and through special transport stars Kirby can or will have to switch from one to the other to continue on his way and solve some puzzles. The beauty is that often the two floors will ~interact~ with each other, and in an increasingly complex way: for example, we have had to dodge cannonballs fired from a tank on the seabed, perhaps attracting them onto fragile platforms that , once destroyed, they opened a path to yet another hidden sunstone. A certain number of these magical stones are found in each stage and, needless to say, most are well hidden and accessible using the ingenuity and powers of the enemies. By collecting a certain number of sunstones, the boss of the world in question is therefore unlocked, and by collecting all of them, you get access to an extra level which in a certain sense unites all the main characteristics of the world in a sort of complicated summary. belongs. Everyone is crazy about Kirby The various stages are completed not only for the sheer pleasure of doing it, but also to collect keychains: there are hundreds of them and they represent practically all the sprites conceived for all the games in Kirby's long history, from the NES to Wii passing through the laptops and Game Cubes. Completing the collection will be a real feat, but fortunately, in addition to replaying the levels to collect keychains, you can spend in-game coins to buy three a day or cross your fingers and receive some via StreetPass. That of the keychains is a decidedly nice idea, designed for the nostalgic but not particularly incisive in terms of gameplay and content. Different speech, however, regarding the extra modes that accompany that Story. From the beginning it is possible to play Duel Kirby and A rhythm with Dedede, two nice mini-games without too many pretensions: the first is a kind of Smash Bros. in miniature in which you face the Kirbys controlled by the CPU or by another player, while the second is a bizarre rhythm game starring Kirby's historical nemesis. The beauty, however, is once the Story mode is completed and the Arena and the Dedede adventure mode have been unlocked: the latter allows us to face timed variants of the levels played in the story wearing the shoes of Dedede, armed with a hammer and a movelist of its own. This is not a simple recycling of assets, given that the mode in question offers specially designed bosses and stages that act as a sequel to the Story mode. After completing this part of the game and the Arena, in which it is possible to face the story bosses again, an additional game mode is unlocked which offers the real epilogue through some bosses and stronger battles than before and equipped with completely new bindings. Here, if there is one thing that made us turn up our noses a little, it is precisely the exaggerated revival of the bosses, albeit with their variations, both in the story mode itself and in the extra ones, but on the other hand there is no he is so sorry because the battles designed by HAL Laboratory are among the funniest in the long history of the franchise, complicated, long and challenging at the right point. In this regard, we cannot fail to address the issue of difficulty, a real weak point of the various games with Kirby as the protagonist, which are often too easy and short: in this case, however, we found ourselves faced with a cartridge full of content and indeed not very easy. Sure, we've never seen Game Over and we haven't even risked it, but several steps took some time and some defeats that took us pleasantly by surprise.hex.", "date": "2014-04-28", "grade": "8.7"}
