{"name": "Sonic Jump", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-jump.html", "text": "We know practically everything about Sonic by now: the character made his debut in 1991 with Sonic the Hedgehog for MegaDrive, replacing Alex Kidd as the SEGA mascot. The game somehow represented a revolution for the platform genre, introducing original mechanics and above all the possibility of going through the stages at very high speed, giving the player the possibility of choosing a ~fast~ rather than an ~explorative~ approach to complete each level. Sonic has certainly known dark times, but now his popularity appears more solid than ever and the numerous appearances on consoles (some of which are still to come) as well as on mobile prove it. After having dealt with the conversion of the original episodes of the series for Java-compatible devices, Glu decided to create a spin-off focusing the accelerator on the character's jumping ability rather than on his speed. Sonic Jump offers us a single game mode and a total of eighteen stages, distributed within six different locations. The first stages serve as a tutorial to understand how the action takes place, after which it will be up to us to face the platforms and the enemies of the blue hedgehog, until we reach the top of each level. The character jumps automatically, basically ~bounces~ and we have to direct him using the d-pad, climbing higher and higher and paying attention to the opponents present: we can only eliminate them if we touch them while Sonic ~rotates~, or in the ascending phase of the jump; otherwise, we will lose the rings collected up to that point, just like in the most classic of the episodes of the series. The rings act as an ~energy bar~, therefore, and their arrangement will follow the trend of each location, i.e. they will develop vertically. The only alternative action that we will be able to perform will be the so-called ~spin~, that is an acceleration in the rotation which will also produce a further momentum, giving us the possibility of reaching areas otherwise placed too high. It is a maneuver that produces excellent results also in offensive terms, as we will be able to verify during the battle with the inevitable bosses, who present themselves at the end of each location. Given the small number of things to do, the developers of the AirPlay team have decided to work on variety only from the point of view of the stages, with numerous ~alternative~ platforms that increase the level of challenge and that put us increasingly in the position of having to learn each route by heart so as not to lose a life. On a technical level, the game looks very good, in many ways better than the Sonic titles converted to mobile so far. The character is well drawn and the same can be said of the various enemies present, with the only flaw of a relatively poor set of animations. The stages boast an excellent design, and differ profoundly from each other thanks to the choice of colors. Scrolling takes place only vertically, of course, but is embellished by a couple of levels in parallax. Most importantly, you never get the feeling that the graphics repeat themselves to the bitter end, as unfortunately happens in various productions in the mobile sector. The sound sector boasts different music for each location, and for once offers catchy songs, of the techno genre, which accompany the action effectively without astounding. PRO Simple but addictive mechanics Technically very well done Great level of challenge... AGAINST ...but frustration is around the corner Essential animations Sonic doesn't run!", "date": "2008-10-15", "grade": "S.V."}
