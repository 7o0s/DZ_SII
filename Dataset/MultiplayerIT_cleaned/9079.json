{"name": "Covid Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/covid-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "Video games have an enormous and unique capacity for representing reality, because they can not limit themselves to flattening it into a language made up of words or images, but have the means to reproduce it, obviously in a simplified form, through mechanics which, added together, form systems with an enormous and pervasive discursive force. By simply staging certain dynamics, video games can become a very strong critical voice and shed light on a macro event such as a pandemic, while continuing to perform their playful function, as done by the Covid Simulator. Pure simulation Covid Simulator has Spartan graphics, but what matters here are the game dynamics, not how good it looks Basically Covid Simulator does not offer a real goal. As the title suggests, it simulates the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this case within a company of which the player can set all the parameters, starting from the number of employees and the vaccination rate. The only challenging factor, if we want to define it that way, is the management of the speed of spread of the infections, which can be greater or lesser depending on the prudence of our choices and the investments made in safety. The player's freedom of interaction is actually very broad, and concerns all aspects of the working structure, which he can shape as in a normal sandbox. So we can move the office furniture to guarantee or not the safety distance, we can do the same with the tables in the canteen, with the sinks and with any other furniture item in the game. We can hire or reduce staff, buy sanitizers or establish rules of conduct. Furthermore, we also have a certain margin of intervention on employees, who we can equip or not with masks (of different levels of effectiveness depending on the price), whose working hours we can change to avoid gatherings, which we can favor or not in vaccinations, even going so far as to impose a kind of green pass to continue entering work. In short, we can touch many factors, all capable of influencing infections in their own way, increasing their speed or drastically reducing them. How to play it Covid Simulator can be played without spending anything: a free version can be downloaded on itch.io, almost identical to the paid one. If you want to support the developers you can still buy the paid version, which costs very little ($4.99). The game will arrive on Steam on January 25, 2022 and will likely be the same price as the itch.io version. What if? Private behaviors influence infections In reality, Covid Simulator is not very interested in sending positive or negative messages, even if, in its silent adherence to reality (the diffusion mechanics are completely based on real statistical and medical data) it still manages to do so in a more convincing way than those video games that they throw them in your face. What really interests him is to be as accurate as possible, thus arriving at demonstrating a very precise basic thesis: the increase in investments in safety and good information can help curb infections, even though they cannot prevent them completely, above all in the presence of more aggressive variants (it is also possible to set those: alpha, beta and omicron, changing them during a single game). To do this, it also leaves the player free to explore the other side of the fence, that of the virus deniers, allowing for no-vax propaganda within the offices or promoting productivity on safety, so as to make more money while making people ill and, as a result, more people die. The statistics on the infections are the most interesting part of the game All of this also includes external factors, determined by the private behavior of individual workers, which greatly influence the results. At the end of the simulation, the game allows you to save the statistics of your game in a studyable format, to understand the various factors that have influenced the result obtained. If we want we are faced with the possibility of applying the scientific method in a very rigorous way within a video game, with each experiment that can be replicated to confirm the starting thesis or deny it (or to elaborate a different one in progress). In this Covid Simulator it appears very successful because it does not give us pre-packaged truths, but places us before facts, determined by our own choices and beliefs.", "date": "2022-01-23", "grade": null}
