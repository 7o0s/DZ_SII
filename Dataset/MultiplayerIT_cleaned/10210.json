This phrase and the game of the same name are well impressed in the minds of a large part of gamers, as well as the beautiful Reiko Nagase, Race Queen protagonist of many of the introductory films of this successful series. Maybe in one of these she found herself kicking off a race session, to then assist the racing cars whizzing past her and raise a real tornado. Instead, what the cars raise in Ridge Racer Accelerated is a spring breeze that does not move any collective imagination, because the transposition for the iPhone, by Namco Networks America, fails to reproduce on the Apple terminal that sense of speed which represents one of the main features of the series, as well as one of its strengths. The doubts about the reason for such a disaster are to be found in what appears to be a port without too many frills of the version that has seen two incarnations on the PSP, a fact confirmed when you go to see the menus, the music and the sound effects present, completely similar to those of the Sony counterpart. Final Lap! If we look purely at the graphics of the game, we are pleased, effects and music are excellent as always, the reproduction of tracks and cars shines for detail and use of colors, with some reflection effects and in general a convincing, albeit undermined, impact by a rather visible aliasing. The fluidity has also been adjusted after the last update, but as mentioned, it is the speed that is missing, which inevitably undermines the fun. The control system makes use of the classic accelerometer for cornering and screen pressure for brake and accelerator (which can be set as automatic), there is no lack of turbo that builds up following drifts in corners, but also the management in dealing with them it is criticisable, given that the view almost completely follows the rotation of the accelerometer instead of affecting only the horizontal axis, making everything a bit chaotic. The sore points however are not finished, if we go to analyze what Ridge Racer Accelerated offers from the point of view of modalities, longevity and more, the situation gets even worse, in the main menu there is in fact the possibility to choose between single race, duel against another car and survival, in which the driver in last position is eliminated at each lap. That's all, the presence of any structured and progressive mode, as well as at least local multiplayer, has not arrived, drastically reducing challenge and longevity and with the further aggravating circumstance that, once  2.39 has been spent on the game, you have only four tracks and two car classes are available. To have the one with the fastest cars you have to pay 1.59, to have another 6 tracks instead a further 2.39. Therefore, beyond a price that visibly rises, the overall situation does not change, there are very few incentives to play the title.
