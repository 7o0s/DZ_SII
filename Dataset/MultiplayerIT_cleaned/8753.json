With the recently released home version everyone will want to see what Vita is capable of doing, both from a technical point of view and from that of gameplay given the plus given by touch control. Capcom's bet is undoubtedly won, because from a content point of view this porting is indistinguishable from the ~home~ one (and perhaps this is not a good thing), but above all on a visual level thanks to the small hyper-defined screen of Vita it's hard to think that what appears before your eyes is the work of a small portable console. In a nutshell, as amazing as the flagship versions on DVD. Keys or touch? The game offer is the one we know, that is a simple arcade and training and the usual uncomfortable ~challenge~ system to learn the rudiments of the game. So much the same in terms of content that Heroes and Heralds mode will also be added as DLC at game launch. Then there are, and it could not be otherwise, all those changes and additions included in the Ultimate console version. The roster has therefore increased with ten new characters equally divided between Capcom and Marvel, but above all the numerous corrections made to the gameplay have remained unchanged, such as the ability to change character in the air during a combo or the downward calibration of the X-Factor attacks . The only real novelty of this portable version is the touch mode that allows newbies to simplify the game's complex system of combos and tags. The solution adopted is simple and functional, but precisely because of its immediacy it risks being too unbalanced given that with relative simplicity it is possible to create the longest combos and devastating special attacks. Precisely to remedy this problem via the menu it is also possible to activate the controls on the front keys and even map individual attacks, special and otherwise, onto screen icons, to make everything even more fluid and less ~geek~ possible. Playing with Touch activated (both front and back) is undoubtedly a good way to make Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 usable by everyone, but certainly this is the zero degree of using the peculiarities of the consoles, since it's just an extra help and not something really inserted into the gameplay. With then in fact the zeroing of any ~technical~ ambitions pad in hand. Playstation 3 trophies Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 rewards the player with 47 trophies. The bronze ones are obtained for the most part with the simple progression in the game, but also by performing particular special moves in large numbers. Silver trophies are mostly related to how much time you spend playing the game, both online and offline. Gold, on the other hand, is obtained by unlocking all the unlockables while platinum is taken home as usual by obtaining all the trophies. Color explosions The thing that really struck us is therefore the great visual quality of the game. In this sense, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, perhaps more than Uncharted: The Golden Abyss, is the title to play when you want to flex your console muscles. The impression is that nothing has been sacrificed on the altar of less powerful hardware in the transition from the home version to the portable one. Everything has been left intact, it seems that there have been no heavy cuts in this port. Fluidity, animations, character swap speed and special effects. Nothing makes you regret the large home screen and indeed, given the five inches and the OLED Multi-touch screen, the game seems even more defined and dazzling if possible. In other words Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 literally left us speechless. In short, the perplexities are the same that we encountered PlayStion 3 pad or Xbox 360 pad in hand. The lack of content is felt, and this is an important criticality if you cannot access online matches on the go, on the other hand, however, this is a new game for PlayStation Vita, in short, one cannot complain about the release after a while time compared to the ~smooth~ version. A valid title without a doubt, but we expect numerous and important innovations from the next chapter, especially on the side of the solo game offer.", "date": "2012-02-16", "grade": "8.0"}
