A good year therefore, to use a term stolen from oenology, which however also saw another trend manifest itself massively, namely that of collections of games from the past re-proposed in high definition. The phenomenon of the HD collections generally enjoys a good success with the public and critics, however thanks to a generation that is coming to an end and the lack of new brands to get passionate about; all this provided, however, that the re-proposition work is adequate for the requested offer (and in fact there are splendid examples in this sense, such as the Collection dedicated to Ico and Shadow of The Colossus or the remake of the first Halo). For a fighting game, however, the discussion becomes more complicated and transcends the pure technical component; indeed, framerate aside, graphics are usually a secondary element in the general evaluation. In Tekken Hybrid it was thus decided to re-propose none other than the first Tekken Tag Tournament, unanimously or almost recognized as the best Tekken ever created and for this reason still full of nostalgic fans today; next to the original, the good Harada and all the staff who have been dealing with the various releases of the Iron Fist Tournament for years have decided to give a small appetizer of the awaited sequel to Tekken Tag and even, always on the same support, the full movie in high definition Tekken: Blood Vengeance. Playstation 3 trophies Tekken Hybrid has two sets of trophies, a complete one dedicated to Tekken Tag Tournamet HD which includes 36 divided into 1 platinum, 5 gold, 10 silver and 20 bronze, and a reduced one for Tekken Tag 2 Prologue consisting of 1 gold, 4 silver and 7 bronze. All trophies are easy to achieve, being essentially unlockable by progressing in the game and making specific moves during matches. However, the achievement of the gold trophies of the first Tag linked to the time in the Time Attack of less than 6 minutes and to the score of 200 points in the Tekken Bowl is particularly difficult, performances that require absolute or almost perfection. We are the most beautiful couple in the world In examining the offer proposed by Tekken Hybrid, we will focus here on the analysis of Tekken Tag Tournament HD and Tekken Tag Tournament 2 respectively, while we will dedicate a special box to the film Tekken: Blood Vengeance a little further on. Before talking about the innovations introduced in Tekken Tag Tournament HD, it is appropriate to briefly explain the reasons that led to defining the original product that appeared on PS2 about 10 years ago as the best exponent of the series. Although the aesthetic aspect certainly didn't make one cry for a miracle even at the time, the Namco fighting game took its origin from the glorious third chapter of the brand, improving its roaster (now finally with all the historic protagonists), the lists of moves and introducing the welcome novelty of the quick change during the match or, more briefly, the Tag Mode. Without graphic frills, floors with uneven or worse destructible floors, the first Tag represented (and still represents) certainty and security for a ~Pro~ player: in fact, each move is always worth a certain number of frames and has one or multiple properties, immutable and predictable. Each uncovering is therefore certainly ~punished~ with the best possible move, the result of an accurate mathematical choice given by the relationship between the speed of execution and the damage inflicted. And this is how, for example, Kazuya Mishima's terrible electric punch, delivered standing up and facing the opponent, takes on the property of ~special mid~ and manages to launch in an aerial combo (the so-called ~juggle~) even if lowered. An electric therefore, made up of 14 animations (the ~frames~), is born medium and remains medium forever, regardless of position, angle, etc. What has been said obviously applies to all shots, except for sporadic unwanted bugs and, unfortunately, not corrected even in this revival. Going into the merits of the production, even an enthusiast of the first hour cannot avoid noticing some truly inexplicable choices: the work of upgrading the resolution has in fact only affected the part played, thus excluding the films and the menus themselves (entirely copied from the 'original). The game speed, anchored to 60 frames per second, however allows a sigh of relief to those who, having long passed the green childhood age, still remembered with horror the bad PAL conversion that was made at the time on PlayStation 2. Unfortunately however some stages, in particular those of Paul Phoenix and Eddy Gordo, seem to suffer from microshots if faced at 1080p resolution; waiting for a possible patch, iThe advice is to force the console resolution to 720p, which is already better than the original. On the game itself there is very little to report, being substantially identical to that of 10 years ago: therefore we have available the classic Arcade mode, Practice, Team Battle, Survival Mode and the fun Tekken Bowl, which has also been present for a few weeks on iOS in free stand alone version. The numerous characters present (almost 40 if we also include the different variants) represent a cross-section of the main existing fighting styles (Capoeira has in Eddy Gordo the most beautiful digital representative in the history of videogames), some invented but of great charm (think to the imperious Mishima-style Karate) and, fortunately few, that expire in the metaphysical (Devil and Angel, able to shoot a laser from the ~third eye~ on the forehead). Despite the undoubted charm that the Namco title still exerts on the large community of enthusiasts, the age and aging of the gameplay in the end makes itself felt: in Tekken Tag HD the slowness of reaction and the woodiness of the animations weigh like boulders, above all if compared to those of 6 or Tekken Tag 2. The appeal for the new generations is certainly not high, however the purity of a style that has never been found again remains, a unique pleasure in playing knowing exactly how to face all the different situations. The movie Tekken: Blood Vengeance Also available in a 3D version, this computer graphics feature film is absolutely not convincing if viewed through the eyes of the passionate cinephile. However, this mistake, at the cost of suffering a little, must not be made: in fact, it is essentially a good quality fan film, in which the Tekken enthusiast finds what he is looking for, that is to see his alter egos at work digital. Dubbed in English or, splendidly, in Japanese (but with Italian subtitles), the story talks about the usual clash between the two most important Corporations in the world of Tekken, the G-Corp led by Kazuya Mishima and the Mishima Zaibatsu, on whose throne reigns Jin Kazama (son of Kazuya) who in turn ousted his grandfather HeiHachi Mishima. The plot therefore takes up the events narrated through the official chapters of the games, which in itself already represents a certainty for the fans. The protagonists of the film are Ling Xiayou (complete with a giant Panda in tow) and the humanoid (and undoubtedly sexy) replicant Alisa Boskonovitch, respectively spy agents in the pay of Anna Williams (G-Corp) and Nina Williams (Mishima Zaibatsu). The ups and downs will see the two heroines face each other and then join forces to try to avoid the fratricidal clash between the different Mishima generations which, due to the powers at stake, could bring about the end of the world. Finally, numerous small cameos should be mentioned, including those of Lee Chaolan and Ganryu. Tasting of new couples Tekken Hybrid also offers a novelty inside, a sort of (very) small appetizer for what will be the next big effort by Namco-Bandai, namely Tekken Tag Tournament 2. With the Prologue formula, already used for example by Gran Turismo (which, however, had decidedly more substantial content), the possibility is given to try a preview of 4 characters in pairs, choosing between Kazuya Mishima, Devil Jin, Alisa and Xiayou. It is no coincidence that the rose is formed by the protagonists of the film, to whom this Prologue seems to be dedicated; in addition to the Arcade mode, however, which stops at the fifth meeting, unfortunately there is nothing else to do, not even the indispensable training (however, there is a way to look closely at the character models). Pad in hand, in this awaited sequel we begin to glimpse a much more complete and refined work, starting right from the game mechanics. The basis on which we started is in fact clearly that of Tekken 6: Blood Rebellion, the last official episode of the saga of which Tekken Tag 2 uses an enhanced and refined version of the engine. However, there are many innovations: the Tag is in fact now more fluid and natural and the combos in pairs are practically instantaneous to learn, even with more changes. In essence, we notice a certain facilitation for the less demanding juggles but, on the contrary, to achieve the greatest possible damage, the effort to do is still a lot. The distance between the fighters then seems to have increased slightly, thus allowing the player to avoid the temptation to ~shoot~ anytime, anywhere. A title that remains frenetic but more balanced, with the Mishimas always fearsome even if far from the best glories, full of special effects, lights and colors: Tekken Tag 2 therefore appears, after a first fleeting glance, as a further surrender to the spectacularization of the saga, thanks also to the presence of wallsi, destructible parapets and floors, of the Bound System (i.e. the extra rebound at the end of the juggle, even if at first sight both the range and the presence of shots to activate it seem reduced) but not of the Rage System, at least understood in the old way (in Tekken 6 consisted of a hit boost when dying, signaled by the unusual brightness of the lifeline). In fact, here is the bar of the player ~on the bench~ which begins to flash if it becomes larger than the one currently engaged, thus suggesting the change to the player but, above all, allowing the ~Tag Crush~, i.e. a much more violent entry into combat directly on the opponent, but at the cost of sacrificing a portion of red life (that is, the one being healed). The other modes of Tag remain partially borrowed from the first episode (sliding, running and flying kick change) but in addition there is the new Tag Assault, i.e. a particular situation that allows for the establishment of a superiority for a few seconds numerical two against one in video, but to be exploited very quickly. The few characters present do not allow for an in-depth analysis of the balance ratios, which we therefore reserve the right to do as soon as we have the definitive version in our hands. However, one of the problems that many players have noticed is the excessive decoration of the costumes of Devil Jin and Kazuya, taken from their final transformations seen in the film. Extremely rich in details but above all in wings and feathers on the screen, in the most agitated phases it is practically impossible or almost impossible to realize what is happening in combat; we therefore hope for the possibility of making the choice of these costumes only optional. Generations of professionals compared The community of Tekken enthusiasts in Italy is not only very large but can also boast excellent results in competitions around the world. Located essentially in Catania (at the ~FreePlay~) and in Milan, in the historic ~Camerlingo~, the players coordinate and stay in contact with each other thanks to the active forum of the Tekken Italia site. On the occasion of the important release of Tekken Hybrid, we asked some of the historical faces, well known among fans, for their opinion on both games. ~Silver~, aka Marco Silvestri, is the co-founder and administrator of Tekken Italia, the Italian partner of reference for Namco Bandai and Halifax on the occasion of official tournaments. According to him ~the job of converting Tekken Tag to HD was done well, despite some slowdowns which are nothing if we consider the abomination of the original PAL conversion.~ ~The prologue of the second Tag~, continues Marco, ~I didn't even install it because trying it in the arcade version confirmed all my fears for yet another operation aimed more at the commercial side than at the technical one.~ ~Tekken Tag~, concludes Silver, ~remains the point of reference for the Italian old guard and the best exponent of the series~. On the other hand, ~Rikimaru~, born Rosario Monaco, winner of numerous Italian tournaments and currently reigning European champion of Tekken 6 BR after triumphing at the Samsung Euro Championship in Berlin, has a different opinion. In fact, according to Rosario ~the first Tag, despite having undoubtedly made history, is currently too old in terms of mechanics. Tekken Tag 2, on the other hand, has nice graphics, the stages seem wider and more detailed. It seems there is a bit of spacing (distance among fighters, ed) more than Tekken 6 and the thing is not bad at all. The combos don't seem too difficult to do despite the numerous tags to perform. The only flaw perhaps is that the game seems a sort of Tekken 6 with the addition of the tag option but I think the final version will give a different impression.~ Finally, the last word goes to ~Bode~, also known as Fabrizio Tavassi and for years the true legend of the first Tekken Tag. Winner of the Absolution tournament in London in 2004 and already author of the book ~My name is Bode~ in 2009, Fabrizio maintains that ~the first Tekken Tag, however coarse in the details and in the composition of the frames, kept some basic principles that have conferred a remarkable longevity compared to the other versions of Tekken.In the last chapter, we are instead faced with a very frenetic game, where lights and sounds mix at high rhythms and can make concentration more difficult to achieve. of Tekken Tag 2 is undoubtedly the correction of the spacing of the game, made wider than before, so as to entice players not to be in a hurry to hit their opponent, risking going empty.~", "date": "2011-11-30", "grade": "7.7"}
