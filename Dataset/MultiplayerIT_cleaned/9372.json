{"name": "Double Dragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86917-double-dragon-il-ritorno-di-un-mito.html", "text": "The genre of scrolling fighting games as we know it, that is with the characters who can move deep within a scenario represented with a three-quarter top view, was born exactly in 1986, with the release of the coin- op Renegade. Strongly influenced by the film ~The Warriors~ (~The Warriors~, from us), the game saw us play the role of a vigilante who was faced with numerous gangs against the background of purely urban settings. The same development team, i.e. Technos Japan, created Double Dragon the following year, smoothing the edges and enriching the gameplay with what we can in all respects define as the archetype of a genre that caused a furor from there to early 90s, with titles that even today the nostalgic remember with pleasure. After three episodes released both in theaters and on the gaming platforms of the time, Double Dragon returned to the limelight in 1994 thanks to a b-movie with Robert Patrick and Mark Dacascos, from which a decent fighting game for Neo Geo was made . The remake that we can buy on the App Store, developed by Brizo Interactive, was already released in 2009 for the Zeebo console (sold in Brazil, Mexico, Russia and India...) and arrives on Apple devices thanks to a substantial graphic restyling, while keeping its strengths intact (above all the quality of the animations and the excellent character design). Let it therefore be clear that we are not dealing with the original Double Dragon by Technos Japan, but with a reinterpretation that takes up its structure and a large part of the gameplay, adding new moves to the repertoire of the characters and accompanying the action with an excellent column soundtrack, composed of inspired remixes of old music. A fist full of resentment The punitive expedition of the Lee brothers begins after the kidnapping of the beautiful Marian by the gang of Black Warriors. The story behind this new Double Dragon therefore does not seem to have changed one iota, even if the introduction makes use of numerous drawings of excellent quality. Under the command of Billy or Jimmy, we will therefore have to clean up a series of scenarios from the members of this gang, leaving the bosses for last and finally trying to save Marian. As mentioned above, there are many elements in common with the original 1987 coin-op, in particular the sensation of impact is immediately very good and there are weapons that our character can take from enemies' hands to then use them himself: whips, baseball bats and barrels, mostly. Using both punches and kicks, it is possible to perform a combo capable of knocking out any opponent, and usually it is enough to repeat the maneuver to score a new elimination. Our character can also jump and deliver a flying kick, but this solution does not go well with the touch control system implemented by Brizo Interactive, which unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Available in two variants, basic and advanced, the controls prove to be one of the biggest problems of this remake, given that there are numerous moves available on paper, but being able to execute them is another matter altogether. Beyond the default combos and the enhanced blows that we can inflict once crouched (an uppercut or a knee), in fact, our repertoire is severely limited by a poorly optimized system and not at all suitable for the touch screen, in particular due to of the poor precision of the virtual d-pad. The gameplay suffers as a result, and forces us to play in an extremely static way, activating movement and offensive maneuvers separately. The situation is also aggravated by the complete lack of ~tolerance~ regarding collisions: to hit an opponent we must be perfectly aligned with his position, but identifying it becomes difficult since the sprites do not cast a shadow on the ground. It's a real pity, because beyond the intrinsic limits of the scrolling fighting game genre (which, moreover, is not exactly suitable for quick and impromptu use, indeed requires a commitment that lasts virtually until the completion of the game), Double Dragon makes it very the most important elements well and also introduces the possibility of unlocking numerous new characters by completing the adventure several times.
