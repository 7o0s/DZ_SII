{"name": "Gregory Horror Show", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gregory-horror-show.html", "text": "Gregory's horror show And this is precisely the case of Gregory Horror Show, a title that will surely arouse the attention of all tired and bored gamers, desperate for something new or at least something new. The Capcom production is based on a popular (at home) Japanese cartoon series of the same name; therefore, the merits for the most atypical aspect of the title in question, namely the artistic style, should not be attributed directly to the Japanese software house. However, the graphics have succeeded in the far from simple task of transferring the contents optimally within this video game, with a simply irresistible result. Everything takes place inside Gregory's hotel, in which the protagonist is locked up with no possibility of escape; the only way to leave the gloomy manor is to steal all the souls of the other guests present, and then offer them directly to Death during sleep. If that all sounds crazy and bizarre, the reason is that Gregory Horror Show is exactly that: crazy and bizarre, from head to toe. Already the description of the ~landlord~ himself, a decidedly cross-eyed anthropomorphic mouse with an inappropriate blond tuft, should be sufficient to give an idea of what the Capcom title has to offer. But we could continue with Neko Zombie, an undead cat, or with Catherine, a pink female lizard with purple polka dots, a manic hotel nurse armed with an enormous syringe. Or again Judgment Boy, a flying knot that shoots sentences, or with Mummy Papa and Mummy Dog, father and son with mean but mummified features, and with an ax and a halberd stuck in their heads... and so on. The madness of the contents goes hand in hand with the graphic style, deliberately stylized and minimalist (but not poor in details) in the settings, and extraordinary in the characterization of the characters, with squared bodies, very short legs and enormous cubic heads. The emotional component of the protagonists is exceptional, with irresistible facial expressions and attitudes capable of giving them a truly distinctive personality. Which, you will agree, is no small thing. Resident Gregory The game mechanics adopted by the programmers, while not surprising, proves to be perfectly suited to the style and setting proposed. Basically, Gregory Horror Show is an adventure very much devoted to puzzles, without forgetting some action aspects accompanied by a series of really hilarious quotes. That the hotel is in fact similar to the manor of Resident Evil, is a sensation able to touch more than someone... evidently also the programmers themselves, who have added classic aspects such as the door opening sequences between one room and another and especially the presence of healing herbs of different colors. The aim of the game, as already mentioned, is to obtain the souls of each of the occupants of the hotel; all this not through shotguns or well-aimed fists though, but simply using the good old logic. Each ~guest~ is willing to give up his soul, more or less voluntarily, only following certain events or in exchange for other objects. It is therefore up to the player to study the situation, grasp the suggestions and clues to understand exactly how to operate. Often, it is essential to give vent to all one's voyeurism to look through the keyhole and listen to what the occupant of the room says or does; other times the suggestions come from other characters, in still others you have to get busy interacting with the right objects. And so if getting the first souls represents little more than a tutorial, continuing in the game more often than not you find yourself having to sharpen your wits and find the keystone to arrive at the solution. And it is precisely in this aspect that the only real note that can be moved to Capcom production lies: although there are plenty of clues, it is not difficult to find yourself wandering in a desperate search for something concrete, or in any case in an attempt to understand what to do and how to do it . All this is linked to the good variety of puzzles proposed, which in fact never resemble each other: if some are therefore really trivial, others require such an effort and constancy as to be able to put less patient players in a crisis . Yes because, despite the childish appearance of Gregory Horror Show, the game in question is far from suitable for a very young audience: in addition to the commitment required, in fact, the effort of the Japanese programmers is literally filled with black humor, mixed with a general air grotesque and with a sprinkle of horrorwhich certainly direct him to a mature audience. How else to define Catherine, the perverse lizard-nurse who chases the poor protagonist armed with a huge syringe? Obviously this is just one of many examples, on which we do not want to dwell so as not to spoil the surprise for those who want to buy the atypical Capcom title. Also interesting, among other things, is the decision not to use the classic energy bar, as an indicator of sanity, destined to decrease progressively over time, or significantly in the event that one is attacked by one of the more aggressive guests. The price to pay, in the event that this indicator runs out completely, is very high: attending Gregory's terrible Horrow Show Comment Gregory Horror Show is a small game. Small budget, average technical quality, no advertising coverage. But it's a great game at the same time, since it succeeds in the increasingly rare aim of providing something different from the usual. An exceptional graphic style is accompanied by a gameplay that is certainly not suitable for everyone and equally certainly not perfect, but intriguing and above all fun. All this, combined with an excellent dubbing (in English) and an incomparable black humor make the Capcom production a purchase to be seriously considered for all Ps2 owners looking for something pleasantly atypical. Pros: Irresistible graphic style Challenging game mechanics Hilarious humor Cons: Very variable difficulty level Short life Not suitable for those who prefer action to puzzles Originality, a rare commodity these days. Leaving aside sterile and withdrawn speeches on the massification of the video game industry and all that this has entailed, for better or for worse, it is indisputable that following the path of the much-vaunted originality is a risk that very few are now willing to take . And on the other hand, how can you blame him? The budget required today to give life to any title is so substantial that it can even have repercussions on the budgets of the giants of the sector, let alone the smaller soft companies forced to play their cards better. Nonetheless, on some rare occasions it happens to witness the classic sheep escaped from the flock, that is to say a production that - for one reason or another - proves to be able to offer at least a different perspective on classic mechanics. And this is the case of Gregory Horror Show, an atypical title for Ps2 made by Capcom to say the least; which is indeed the home of infinite series such as Megaman, Street Fighter and Resident Evil, but also of Auto Piattista, Viewtiful Joe, P.N. 03, Everblue, Breath of Fire Dragon Quarter. All games that, with mixed fortunes, have in any case attempted to take alternative routes both from a technical point of view and from a playful point of view, on already well-established and known strands.", "date": "2004-02-12", "grade": null}
