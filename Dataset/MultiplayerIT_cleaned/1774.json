{"name": "NBA 2K3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k3.html", "text": "Back Again...from ESPN! The impact with this new jewel of Sega Sports is consumed by breathing a different air already from the graphic setting of the introduction. For the first time, the ~2K~ series takes full advantage of the ESPN television license (the true leader in American sports television broadcasting). This move gives the title a multitude of notable improvements in the management of the menus (clean, intuitive and functional despite the massive size) as well as for what concerns the excessive style with which the game is presented, told and vivisected among a thousand statistics before, during and after the race. The Visual Concepts team, since the first edition on DC, impressed the audience for the accuracy of the simulation, the attention to detail in the animations and the overall technical realization; today they have not only surpassed themselves but have decided to move their aim much further. There is too much talk of next-generation games inappropriately and perhaps the question is not raised, wrongly, when products of this type are involved. Analyzing what our avid gamer soul encounters first, one can only bow reverently in front of a graphic sector that literally transcends the concept of stunning. Not only is the reconstruction of every single NBA player the most faithful one can ask for but it becomes able to leave you astonished the moment you realize the expressive range of the latter. The athletes experience the game through an emotional range that paints joy, dissent and anger on their faces, grit and amazement in front of a clamorous play by a teammate, passing through a whole series of suburban bullying attitudes to please or make fun of the opponents. Shaq, who after a two-handed dunk throws punches in the air with a slouching gait, Iverson who hints at break dance steps after having drunk a defense or Steve Nash who points to the audience, enthusing them, are just infinitesimal examples of ~life~ flowing in the polygonal models of this NBA2K3. Small note: the athletes, after a handful of minutes played at high pace, start to sweat! (visible and amazing effect that gives a touch of class especially on colored players). We already talked about it in the reviews of the previous chapters but it is right to point it out; no sports title manages to make the spectacularity of the animations functional to the gameplay like the NBA according to VC & Sega. Every crossover, feint or simple body imbalance after a tackle completely changes the approach to shooting and the solution adopted whether you're in the painted area or from the three-point line. The simple and intuitive commands allow you to literally do anything. A point guard marked tightly to free the winning pass has dozens of possible solutions, from the pass behind the back to the one pressed to the ground, from the attempt to start an alley hoop to performing a feint (executable with the Z key which also allows you to remain in ~surplexe~ holding the ball with one hand in order to deceive, by restarting, his marker) and then launch himself to the basket. The same goes for guards in general or power finishers for the ~dunk~ section. Believe it or not, they just don't count. After weeks of play we continue to witness something never seen before, the physicality of each player has a very heavy impact on the animations and repertoire that each of them has to dunk the basket. The balance of the body, the braking point, the strength of the athlete, the contrast of the marking are all elements that merge like countless variables that give yet another new and incredible movement capable of systematically snatching the ~OOooh!~ of the case. One more mention regarding the management via pad of not very tall players like Jason Kidd or Gary Payton but with pure class who offer all their reporting both from afar and under the basket through hand changes in the painted area with the ball leaning against the glass in the midst of very narrow markings, all with the inevitable fluidity and credibility given by the shattering animations. I Love this Game!...'Cause it's Real Far beyond the amazing graphic sector (which also includes every faithfully reconstructed league building) in NBA 2K3 the attention to pure and simple simulation also shines with its own light. A further upgrade of the AI takes both your team and the opponent to move through the real dogmas of basketball, implementing game patterns that you yourself will create and set. ANDIt's impressive to see your teammates trying to escape the marking as well as the immediacy of the response when calling a block (with the d-pad) to open a gap in hermetically sealed defenses. In the exceptional gameplay the analog stick ~C~ also plays a leading role which allows for greater precision in the passes but above all guarantees the development of a counterattack action in a much faster and clearer way with a simple movement of the lever in the direction of the unmarked player. Just in the markings there is another demonstration of how the Visual Concepts have brought together graphics and playability in a sublime way. The collisions between players border on perfection, in the close-up replays, which reproduce phases of the match, we notice real ~hugs~ in marking, hands showing perfectly articulated fingers and all this, in the physical clash between attacker and defender, without we witness dubious or trivially wrong polygonal collisions. Nothing to complain, solidity reigns supreme and combines with the behavior of the ~Spaulding~ branded sphere which, respecting every chrism of physical laws, reaches peaks of truthfulness never touched before. Gimme Watcha Got! NBA 2K3 showcases every team in the league, their arenas, plus an inordinate series of All Stars from the 1950s to today who offer the opportunity to play again the various Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul Jabbar (while to enjoy Jordan it is enough to choose the Wizards and go crazy in front of the technical realization they have lavished on the unattainable MJ) and a series of modalities able to really satisfy anyone. It is possible to face the entire season (playoffs included) in two different ways which translate into the classic Season where your task will be to play and nothing else or in the very complete Franchise Mode which combines the managerial phase made up of player exchange with the gameplay with rigorous tradeline, contractual situations to manage, search for new promises, careful eye on budgets and salary-gap; if you are among those who enjoy maniacality in this genre of games, the result is truly priceless. The cake is divided into further slices, smaller but no less tasty, such as the Street Mode where, on nine different playgrounds, it is possible to create teams of a minimum of two to a maximum of five players, choosing from any NBA star and then challenging each other to rhythm of hip hop without any rules but simply enjoying the screams and taunts that your idols will exchange, basket after basket. As always happens, this version also offers a well-kept Edit Mode where you can create a polygonal clone of yourself or the basketball player of your dreams passing through physicality, muscles, every imaginable somatic trait up to the shoe model and the dutiful tattoos. NBA2K3 also allows you to import talented players through data exchange on memory cards from the other title produced by VC and SEGA SPORTS, namely NCAA College Basketball 2K3 which recreates the American High School season, where the champions destined for the big league are born. Conclusions We are faced with a title practically free from defects if we were not sure that it is destined (as is the nature of things) to be outclassed by the 2K4 edition. The flaw of this Game Cube version is the lack of online mode and only a small note can be underlined regarding the sound. Although it proves to be at very high levels for the feeling it recreates in the arenas amidst the noise of the people, the voices of the coaches (who never speak at random but follow the action) and of the players themselves, as well as having a good dose of of grooves and hip hop rhythms was missing a bit in the renewal of the commentary. The latter, despite being punctual and of a good standard, has remained the same in almost all the versions released so far, this aspect can only be noticed by the faithful of the series while what it already offers will greatly exalt those who are only approaching this simulation now. If you love basketball and of course its maximum expression which resides in the magic of the three NBA letters, there are no choices or doubts whatsoever. Everything you dream of is inside this SEGA SPORTS mini DVD. Pros: Great animations and polygonal models. Playability and simulation at very high levels. Exciting Franchise Mode and Playground Mode. Obsessive completeness of menus, statistics and television-style broadcasting. Cons: The online commentary option of a good level is missing but inherited from previous titles without appropriate innovations. Gimme More... And there are four. A poker of versions is certainly not a trivial matter for a sports series but if we pause to observe the systematic annual update in this videogame sector, it is clearly evident how lavishing quality and innovation in each title is by no means a healthy habit. Fortunately, this aspect goes beyond some software house, the most striking example is found precisely in Visual Concepts which, on behalf of SEGA, has put on the plate, since the year 2000, the best US sports simulations that have ever had the grace to reach our consoles; today it's up to NBA 2K3. Despite this, due to a market that aims decidedly more at confusing the consumer rather than rendering him a service, the NBA2K series has not had the opportunity to establish itself as the only paradigm here in Europe, paying for a difficult marketing of the first two episodes (only on Dreamcast) and later 2K2 on both DC and Game Cube (via simple porting). Today, the scenario is destined to change radically with this edition which will also reach our market on each platform. Let's go into the GC version.", "date": "2003-02-06", "grade": null}
