In fact, Moto GP 08 will not be remembered as the graphically most impressive mobile game in history, but the choice of the In-House developers not to follow the (questionable) trend that imposes 3D at all costs has brought benefits that amply fill this gap. Therefore, if Moto GP 08 does not offer highly detailed scenarios to the eye (the tracks are practically indistinguishable from each other) nor incredibly defined sprites, on the other hand it manages to guarantee an enviable fluidity and a sensation of speed capable of putting embarrassment most of the most famous polygonal racing games. Obviously this has positive repercussions above all on the enjoyment of the product, highlighted by a clearly arcade play structure. Steering the bike is therefore simple and intuitive, and the chances of falling are reduced to a minimum, but the player is still required to drive cleanly by tackling the curves in the correct way, even if the brake is hardly ever used. An important role is instead covered by the turbo, which can be used at any time by pressing a button and whose level is automatically regenerated after use: an element that takes Moto GP 08 even further away from the concept of simulation, but which very well with the overall setting of the game. Certainly the I-play product manages to always keep the user's attention alive, through a catch-up system that allows the opponents to always be on the heels of the first place holder, but also allowing the last driver to recover many positions, provided you drive well. I-play then took advantage of the license in the best possible way, inserting the official drivers of the current season in the title, together with 18 tracks that are part of the world circuit.
