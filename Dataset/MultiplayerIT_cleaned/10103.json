Anyone who knows the previous works of the programming team based in Vara knows that by simulations we mean those with a capital S, where every single element reflects reality as well as the driving model, created to be as similar as possible to the real one, with all the consequences you can easily imagine. After the interlude Race Pro on console and Volvo - The game, SimBin returns with Race On to the dear old PC market, where this new title is presented in a single solution together with RACE 07 and STCC - The Game, dedicated to the Swedish Swedish championship Touring Car Championship. What's new The additions introduced by SimBin in Race On see a group of new cars from the US Muscle, both in road and race versions, plus the Tatuus-Honda of the European International Formula Master, while as regards the circuits the novelties are formed by the presence of the American tracks of Laguna Seca and Road America. Not really a series of new additions for which to tear your hair out, however, which, added to the cars and circuits present in the old titles included, constitute a respectable choice. Simulation is the watchword Anyone who has already had the opportunity to try a driving game developed by SimBin knows that physics and simulation are practically the gospel of this development team, capable of putting on one of the most likely engines currently around among automotive simulations. Acceleration, braking and cornering must all be done at the right time, as there is no room for error and the risk of going off the road is present in practically every corner of the track, except of course on the straights. The same goes for the damage to the cars, faithfully reproduced to what they could be in reality, even for example by driving too much for a walk on the gravel, thus ruining the suspensions. The only aspect that still doesn't convince, also found at the time of GTR Evolution, concerns the management of collisions between vehicles, which open the door to a good dose of slightly less realistic doors than the rest of the game mechanics. Apart from this, it goes without saying that all this realism requires a high availability to the steep learning curve proposed by Race On, after which, however, a whole world opens up made of satisfactions and challenges at the last millisecond to be experienced instant by instant: those who are not willing to do a few more laps on the track than on the track should seriously consider buying it more than once. Everything as always From the purely technical angle, Race On inherits practically all the strengths and weaknesses of its predecessors in this sector, in fact not adding or taking anything away, but suffering more from its own defects in the light of the fact that it is past of time, due to which what maybe before was glossable now becomes a problem that makes you turn up your nose. As usual therefore, despite the good detail of the cars, the edge of the track is always made up of flat trees and low-resolution textures, just as the shadows are far from being able to compete with other more graphically pumped titles: as they say in these cases , take it or leave it, even if the new tracks show small steps forward in the attention to the most marginal details. The sound, on the other hand, confirms the good things found in the past, making Race On deserve the title of simulation also with regard to the audio, including trackside effects and roaring engines. Born as an expansion, Race On was then sold separately together with RACE 07 and STCC, from which the final product draws most of its elements. As we have seen, the innovations introduced by Race On are not exactly very many and that is why those who already own the two games just mentioned could turn up their noses, given the pricing policy which sees it on sale for a good 40 in the full version and 25  for the update only. On the other hand, those who have never had the opportunity to get close to the titles developed by SimBin have an excellent opportunity to buy ~two and a half~ in one, provided however that they get behind the wheel with the knowledge that Race On is as far away as it can be from an arcade. Extremely satisfying once you get the hang of it To be taken if you do not have RACE 07 One of the best simulation models on PC Difficulty not open to everyone Few novelties that justify the purchase for those with RACE 07 We want a ~next-gen~ Race", "date": "2010-04-01", "grade": null}
