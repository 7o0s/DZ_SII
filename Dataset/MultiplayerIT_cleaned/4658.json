{"name": "La recensione di Atomega", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/189016-atomega-la-recensione-di-atomega.html", "text": "At the end of time, reality will dissolve definitively, bringing with it the last remaining life forms: the Exoforms, officially described as ~super-advanced post-biological life forms~, in fact spheres of energy that can transform the collected matter into body mass. What is their goal? Having fun, literally. After all, we are at the end of everything and there is not much else to do. Against a colossus it takes another colossus Happy growth Atomega is an online shooter where up to eight players battle it out in a single arena to see who racks up the most points by collecting materia before a ten minute timer runs out. At the beginning of each game, players roll around the map and have to collect matter cubes. Doing so not only increases the score, but allows you to grow your avatar, making it more and more powerful and resistant. In total there are six stages of development (seven, if we count the initial one called Atom), which greatly change the approach to action and exploration of the map: when you are a small and fast creature, you can traverse them at great speed even the narrowest underground tunnels, but fighting against the largest Exoforms is a real suicide; growing up, however, the mobility decreases, the spaces become narrower, the map suddenly becomes smaller (in relation to the new dimensions), but the shots start to hurt more and it is the others who have to be afraid. In the Omega stage, the only thing that counts is to survive as long as possible Let's say that of the seven stages, the first four are dedicated more to the collection of matter (and to escape in case of need), while the last three allow you to fight more effectively. In particular, the final stage, called Omega, transforms us into a very slow and ethereal colossus which, in order to stay alive, must suck mass from the other players or from the cubes in the circumstances, using its deadly beam. Although it has many constraints, the Omega phase is very important because it is the one in which the most points are accumulated. Really good players usually manage to reach it once or twice a game, while poorer players may never get there. Staying on the subject, let's try to understand what fighting is for, since so far we seem to have described a kind of evolved Pac-Man. Killing an opponent causes him to lose mass, returning him to the initial stage of development (that of Atom). Lost mass can be picked up by other players. Fortunately, if you understand that you are about to be killed, however, you can use a convenient teleporter for a quick escape, at the price of losing a stage of development. Basically the firefights are not too exciting, because they take place between creatures with asymmetrical power: however good you may be, it is almost impossible to beat an opponent of a higher stage than ours. The ten upgrades that can be collected in the form of golden cubes do not help in this sense, apart from the shield which makes you invincible for a short time. However, they are very comfortable in many situations. For example, facing an enemy of the same level by activating the healing power offers an undoubted advantage in terms of resistance, just as the magnet allows you to accumulate matter faster, allowing us to attract the cubes not only by bringing them closer, but also by shooting them. Less and nothing As you may have understood from the description, Atomega is indeed a first-person shooter, but the shooter mechanics are less central to the gameplay than in other titles. Unfortunately, however, the good things it has to offer are limited by the lack of content. The Ubisoft Reflections title consists of a single map, for a single non-configurable mode. Basically in three or four games you can experience everything that can be experienced and if you don't get caught up, you leave the game without regrets. Of course, there are some incentives to continue playing, such as the unlocking of new skins for our Atom, linked to level growth, but it's really trivial stuff. The beginning: let's start collecting matter cubes! As if this weren't enough, Atomega has another big problem that is impossible not to mention, although it is not the direct responsibility of the developers: the chronic lack of users. Honestly, we struggled a lot to play, given that if there are not at least four players, the matchmaking does not start the games and sends you back to the title screen to start the search process again. Unfortunately there are no bots to compensate, so with no other humans around, Atomega is basically dead software. It's a shame, because deep down he has some really intriguing ideas, framed by a styleminimalistic yet fascinating graphic. In its current state, however, it looks more like a luxury prototype than a full game, much as we are sorry to say.", "date": "2017-09-26", "grade": "5.5"}
