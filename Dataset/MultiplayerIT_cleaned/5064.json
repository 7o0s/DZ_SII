It is, as is evident right from the start, an RPG puzzle that incorporates the mechanisms of the classic Puzzle Quest: in the lower part of the screen we find the traditional board with the elements to be combined in match-3 style, while in the upper part we find visually the clash between two contenders (or between two tag teams) in the ring of the TV show created by Vince McMahon. However, unlike other similar games, such as Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign, the matches do not take place through a simple alternation of static artwork, but are fully animated and boast well-made (although often very similar) polygonal models, characterized from a cartoonish style that refers to that of the great Technos Japan classics, in this case WWF Superstars and WWF WrestleFest, or to the more recent WWE All Stars. The combination of the colored elements translates into the execution of specific moves which, by moving the needle of the balance to one side or the other, determine at a certain point the opponent's pin and eventual victory. WWE Champions is a solid, immediate and fun puzzle game for Puzzle Quest and WWE lovers Road to WrestleMania The main menu of WWE Champions allows access to different modes, the richest of which is the Road to Wrestlemania, consisting of a series of increasingly complex matches in which our task, as new managers, will be to manage a roster increasingly large number of wrestlers, starting with The Rock, John Cena and Roman Reigns. However, the list of obtainable superstars is huge and includes not only current wrestlers but also stars of the past such as the immortal Ultimate Warriors, ~Macho Man~ Randy Savage, Andre the Giant and more. By winning the matches we will collect the virtual money necessary to upgrade our characters and to unlock new moves linked to a card system visible during the fights. In fact, eliminating gems of the same color will not simply give life to a basic attack, but will help activate one of the special moves that can change the course of the match, damaging our rival to the point of subjecting him to a pin from which he cannot will be able to break free. Where therefore the normal clash mechanics allow those who are on the mat to get up by quickly scoring three weight eliminations, as the referee will count three seconds once our shoulders are in contact with the mat, the same will not happen if we are able to close the contest with a powerful finisher. The system is immediate and solid, and as mentioned is assisted by a valuable technical sector, very beautiful and spectacular, even if it suffers from the systematic limitations of this kind of product: the lack of effective combinations is often attributable to luck rather than ours skills, while the freemium dynamics make progression difficult at a certain point, inevitably inviting us to purchase rare packs and characters. However, if you love puzzle games and WWE shows, there really is no story: WWE Champions is the best title currently out there.", "date": "2017-02-03", "grade": "8.0"}
