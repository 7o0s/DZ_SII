{"name": "Athens 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/athens-2004.html", "text": "Road to Athens It is now common practice that at every sporting event of a certain level there is also a video game that exploits, more or less adequately, the very fruitful license. The Olympics in particular have followed this ritual since time immemorial, with series that have become famous such as Track & Field by Konami, or the various titles by mother Sega, with often decidedly satisfactory results. Now it's Sony's turn, which with this Athens 2004 hopes to exploit the popularity trail of the imminent Athens Olympics, proposing a title which, without denying the classic mechanisms which have always characterized this genre of games, also intends to herald some interesting changes. Through our virtual alter ego (to be chosen among 800 athletes, coming from 64 nations, without however being able to create one from scratch), we will be called to compete among 25 Olympic disciplines, belonging to the most disparate genres (athletics above all, but also swimming , target shooting, archery and horse riding), each characterized by a particular game mechanic. And right here, unfortunately, more painful notes arrive. If it is true that a considerable effort has been made by Sony in an attempt to vary the game structure as much as possible, diversifying the ways in which the various disciplines are to be tackled, it is also undeniable that this choice has led to a title of quality extremely erratic, characterized by a good amount and variety of events, of which only a handful are actually fun. The classic button smashing gameplay, typical of disciplines such as running and swimming, turns out to be rather unmanageable in light of the facts with the close arrangement and small size of the Dual Shock keys, making these events so difficult as to be quickly abandoned by the player; other disciplines, such as discus or shot put, where reflexes count more, are on the contrary so simple that it is not at all unlikely to collect records in bursts already in the first game. The third type of disciplines, the one in the minority unfortunately, is decidedly the most interesting, proposing a mechanic that closely resembles rhythm games, in which we will be called to reproduce, with a certain timing, the sequence of keys that appears on the screen: even here, however, it is certainly not difficult to collect records once you get a little carried away, to the detriment of longevity. There is obviously no shortage of events that offer a hybrid mechanic among the three described, unfortunately without offering better results. The important thing is to participate... Also from a technical point of view Athens 2004 fails to fully convince, proposing a fluctuating graphic sector, characterized by models of the athletes rather poor in polygons and often not too proportionate, covered by textures with acceptable detail but lacking in terms of variety and chromatic richness . The settings (faithfully reconstructed using the original designs of the Athens 2004 structures) adequately perform their duty, but even here a few more details certainly wouldn't have hurt. Opposite speech as regards the animations, very accurate and decidedly well done, with a massive use of motion capture to ensure the highest level of realism possible. However, the fluidity is always impeccable, and we note the presence of the selector to set the 60Hz if equipped with a television that supports them. Even with regards to the sound, the same impressions are recorded, with a wide range of varied and well-crafted effects (ranging from the cheers of the audience to the noises of the various instruments), however the absence of the national anthems and the official musical theme of these Olympics, above all considering that this Athens 2004 has an official license for good money on its side. Longevity is certainly one of the critical points of this Sony production, failing to guarantee a sufficient level of interest in single player, and inexplicably not offering any support for an online mode, which would have been a perfect fit. Of course, in multiplayer it unleashes its potential and is able to give hours of frenetic fun (provided you have a multitap), however a rather large group of players is needed for the title to give its best, with the result that he risks dusting it off only during a few parties or so. Comment Athens 2004 is an incomplete title. The difficult adaptation of the control system and the lack of care in calibrating the difficulty of almost all disciplines irreparably compromise the single-player mode, and the good number of available events and the attemptto vary the game mechanics if it is the substance that fails. In multiplayer, things change decisively: the frenetic challenges that Athens 2004 is able to offer make the structural problems soon forgotten, however the lack of an online mode prevents it from being able to take full advantage of it, making the title suitable mostly for a few parties with ( possibly) many friends. Also technically there are unfortunately no elements of particular importance, indeed the lack of general attention highlighted, especially as regards the sound sector (the total lack of national anthems, for example) only accentuates the opinion that this new sports title mom Sony is a bit of a missed opportunity, proving unable to emerge and establish itself as a new benchmark for the genre. Pros: Fun in multiplayer Good number of disciplines Fairly varied game mechanics Cons: Boring in singleplayer Technically poorly maintained Difficulty poorly balanced Control system sometimes frustrating The Athens Olympics are almost upon us, and here Sony offers us the opportunity to emulate the exploits of the greatest athletes in the world simply by holding the Dual Shock, arming ourselves with only a pinch of coordination, a dash (abundant) of patience, and lots and lots of resistance. In fact, time passes, the bits in the consoles increase exponentially, however the gameplay for this kind of title seems to resist the years undeterred, always rooted in button smashing mechanics at the limits of human tolerance, and Athens 2004 certainly does not escape this. but also proposing some interesting news.
