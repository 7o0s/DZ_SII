{"name": "Colosseum road to freedom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colosseum-road-to-freedom.html", "text": "The life of the Gladiator It all starts with three simple questions that need to be answered: where are you from, which god do you worship, and what kind of moral path are you going to follow; the answers will affect the appearance and attributes of our character. After that, having sustained simple battles, our life as a gladiator will finally begin: a rich and powerful Roman has bought us for the sole purpose of entertaining the public in the arenas. As the title of the game suggests, the main objective is to earn the money needed to buy freedom from our master, and there is only one way to do it: fight and win. Colosseum Road to Freedom, however, is not based solely and exclusively on fights, as I have already mentioned before, it is our task to fortify the gladiator through hard training that varies from simple sparring against human opponents to classic physical exercises such as push-ups and squats. The latter are like real mini-games, in which, for example, you have to press the joypad keys with a certain timing to perform the exercise correctly. Training is essential because it allows us to increase the attributes of the wrestler according to our needs, for example if we wanted to strengthen the arms we would have to do nothing but try our hand at some healthy push-ups, if instead it is the legs that we want to strengthen, the squat is the exercise to support. There are various parameters to manage, and in addition to the strength of the individual parts of the body (arms, legs, chest, etc.) there are more specific skills to the fighting style such as, for example, fighting with a sword or two swords, and some typical skills of role-playing games, including dexterity, stamina, strength, etc., which can be improved based on the food given to our gladiator at the end of training. This training phase undoubtedly helps to strengthen the identification with the life of the gladiator, but the problem is that in the long run it starts to be quite boring, since it is certainly not the best of fun to spend time doing trivial exercises for the body. If we then add the lack of a real plot (practically non-existent and which turns out to be decent only towards the end), one can well understand how Colossuem has very little that is really interesting to offer other than the actual duels. Into the arena By only training, however, we go nowhere, without money we could never obtain the much desired freedom ... and it is for this reason that between one training session and another, days are organized in which to show off our skills. Each day is divided into six events, each of which has a different type, difficulty and cash reward. There are a total of six types of events, ranging from one-on-one duels to team duels, in which it will also be possible to challenge animals such as tigers or elephants. Obviously difficult fights lead to high rewards, but it is better to carefully choose an event that is not excessively difficult because a possible defeat would halve the money collected up to that moment during the day. The combat system is slightly different from the traditional one, in fact it is possible to direct one's attack according to the key pressed: a blow to the head is carried out with the TRIANGLE, towards the right and left respectively with SQUARE and CIRCLE, while with the X you can strike the opponent's legs. In addition to the simple attacks, there are also particular ones, such as the counter (counterattack), the fast stab (quick hit) and the lateral and rear attacks which expand the chances of victory in particularly unpleasant situations. Every self-respecting gladiator needs weapons to survive, and in Colosseum there are certainly no exceptions, it is possible to bring weapons, shields and armor of various kinds into battle, as well as collect them (or leave them) directly on the battlefield by duelists now defeated. Between one encounter and another you can keep or sell the equipment obtained in the field, and if you are not very happy with the performance it offers, just pay a visit to the blacksmith to upgrade it and add special abilities. Weapons and armor aren't the only things you drop from defeated enemies, they also drop skill tablets. These tablets can be equipped and are divided into two types, active and passive: the former are associated with an attack key and are used to perform a special hit, the others instead serve to increase the values of the stats. Although there are many valid features that make this title unique for lovers of the world of gladiators, the playability is unfortunately not of a good standard and in the end the game is a trivial hack'n'slash that has very little to offer in terms offundamental element of a video game: fun. Our gladiator's response to the joypad input is not the best and often extricating yourself from the most complex situations becomes really frustrating, moreover, although there are different types of events these are reduced to a repetitive button smashing which in the long run leads to boredom. Complicit in the monotony of Colosseum is also the not very varied setting, which forces us to always fight in the same arenas (only two in all) and the lack of spectacularity in the fights (apart from some very rare cases). Ars Technique The graphic aspect, while doing a fairly decent job with well-made reproductions of the locations, armaments and characters, is not among the most impressive in terms of quality. In fact, it must be considered that during the duels there are not many polygons that the graphics processor has to manage, therefore something less ~rough~ and more detailed could be created both in terms of the models of the wrestlers and the play areas. Even the animations leave something to be desired, and their low fluidity, combined with a not excellent physics, makes the movement of the characters rather wooden. The sound is pretty much on par with its visual counterpart: bare. Music and speech border on sufficiency, resulting most of the time repetitive and boring ... the sound effects, on the other hand, raise the tone of this not very exciting technical framework a little, adding a pinch of acoustic realism. Comment Ultimately Colosseum is a game with excellent ideas, but which unfortunately have not been exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the unconvincing technical realization and playability do not allow this title to be classified as a ~mandatory purchase~, but simply as a game to be rented at the weekend for those who want to identify themselves only for a few hours in the life of a gladiator ... this new life could in fact not turn out to be that exciting Cons: Very questionable technical realization Control system a bit difficult Boredom will take over immediately Pros: Excellent RPG elements Interesting game structure After the success of Ridley Scott's masterpiece Gladiator, it seems that the world of ancient Roman wrestlers is also catching on in a videogame version. Who has never dreamed of reliving the deeds of these fighters firsthand, without having to get up from the sofa in their living room? And here Koei comes into play, who decides to offer us a kind of ~simulation of gladiators~ with which we can fulfill our wish, making us the protagonists of the bloody, but fascinating, fights in the arenas. Colosseum Road to Freedom is the title of this new born in the Koei house with which we will be able to literally live the life of a gladiator: we will not only have to worry about making our way through countless battles, but we will take care to enhance our alter ego through hard training. As we will see later, the presence of some elements typical of role-playing games makes the gameplay very interesting and innovative for its genre, unfortunately, however, all that glitters is not gold, and the defects from which Colusseum suffers will not be slow to make themselves felt.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
