Roller coaster, cross and amusement park delight! Enthusiastic people who queue for hours and then find themselves terrified when the carriages rush downhill or make a sudden curve. And that's the beauty of it, isn't it? Among the many mobile games that Digital Chocolate has the merit of having created, the ~Rollercoaster~ series stands out for its originality and freshness. This is not a management game in which you have to take care of the attractions of an amusement park, but a title that combines action, reflexes and strategy in a single package. The player must tackle a certain number of courses by activating the accelerator and the brake of the roller coaster, with the aim of completing the race in the shortest time possible and simultaneously collecting the greatest number of objects. At the end of the internship, the performance is evaluated by a number of stars and the unlocking of new locations and new modalities may be valid. All by pressing just two buttons, as per tradition for the arcades developed by the Californian house. From the start screen, Rollercoaster Revolution: 99 Tracks gives us the possibility to access three different modes: ~Career~, ~Multiplayer~ and ~Survival~. The first constitutes the most substantial part of the game, and sees us face the beauty of ninety-nine tracks divided by nine locations. Each stage can be passed with a variable score, but a minimum of stars must be obtained to unlock the next setting. At the same time, new carriages become available with different characteristics from the starting one, faster or with a better starting point, to replay the sessions already completed but with a different approach. The ~Multiplayer~ mode is based on the classic ~pass and play~ on a single mobile phone and offers two distinct possibilities: one in which you can view your opponent's ghost in real time, the other structured like a tournament. Finally, the ~Survival~ mode is the classic survival in which you have to pass as many stages as possible without crashing and without the possibility of continuing. In this case, the goal is to set a record despite the difficulties we will inevitably encounter. If you have already tried a title from the Rollercoaster series, this new version will not be able to take you by surprise as the gameplay is unchanged, with the only addition of power-ups that can make things easier for you during the ride: some make the carriages indestructible and therefore they allow you to make any jump without fear and always go at maximum speed; others ~glue~ you to the tracks avoiding any unwanted jumps. For the rest, playing is always a matter of just two buttons: dosing accelerator and brake takes on the connotations of an art when it comes to making jumps at the right time or collecting objects that are in bizarre positions. Technically the game looks really good, with excellent graphics for colors, detail and fluidity. A hybrid between 2D and 3D that allows you to get the best of both styles, a solution to which Digital Chocolate has already accustomed us in the past, always with exceptional results. The locations are splendid and each of them offers a rich and lively scenario, while the carriages move convincingly and inside them the kids cheer and scream like crazy. The sound accompaniment consists of moderately made MIDI music, which however soon ends up becoming repetitive.", "date": "2009-04-01", "grade": "S.V."}
