{"name": "Scriptic: Netflix Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scriptic-netflix-edition-recensione.html", "text": "When Netflix announced its intention to launch itself on the video game market, one could have expected some search for a synthesis between TV series and game, a mixture of languages that would lead to the creation of a catalog capable of placing itself on the border between the two managed media by the same company, in line with the experimentation already started on the film front with Bandersnatch. So far, however, we have not seen particular efforts in this sense, but the review of Scriptic: Netflix Edition could present a turning point, since it could be considered the perfect product of a fusion between a ~crime~ style television series and an adventure interactive. We are quite far from the standard canons of videogames but these, especially in the mobile sector, have now expanded so much as to accommodate experiences that are difficult to classify, as in the case we are dealing with here. Scriptic is a collection of interactive stories, which on the one hand recall the structure of old text adventures and on the other hand some videogame experiments such as A Normal Lost Phone, which play with the now established conventions of using smartphones and social networks to tell a story in an alternative way, but decidedly realistic. The player plays a Scotland Yard detective engaged in various cases (three, for the moment), structured like real TV series, with episodes to be progressively unlocked. The stories are very different and well constructed, all set in and around London and all centered around an initial murder and the investigations that ensue from it. The three cases can be played freely by Netflix subscribers, thus bypassing the paid unlock of the episodes following the first one (which is instead free for everyone). This is an offer of considerable value, if we consider that each single story would cost around 20 euros and are all included in this package available to Netflix users. Multimedia investigations Scriptic features various videos shot live with live actors The gameplay, so to speak, appears rather limited, being all about narration through different multimedia contents. Everything takes place within an interface that replicates the smartphone of the protagonist detective, with a remarkable identification given that the actual use of our device replicates the gestures and actions that the character performs in the game. Each case starts with a short initial film that vaguely shows the outlines of the murder and the discovery of the body, in the more classic style of the ~crime drama~ TV series, after which we are usually contacted by police colleagues who give us the first information on the case through a virtual chat. The interaction takes place entirely through this virtual interface, from which we can directly access the victim's smartphone, our chats with colleagues (field agents, forensic police and coroner) and the interrogation room. Rummaging through the victim's smartphone, reproduced as a real real screen with messaging apps, photo archives and more, represents the most purely investigative part, with the possibility of collecting useful information and clues about the person's past history. The system is interesting but the fact that the sensitive elements are highlighted tends to significantly flatten the level of challenge of the game. Scriptic: some screenshots on video and control interface In this sense, the chats with colleagues and the interrogations of suspects are more significant, because in these phases we can make decisions that seem to have important consequences in the continuation of investigations and history. In general, the progression is very guided and the resulting idea is more of passively watching a story unfold than actually taking part in the case, but the narrative remains always engaging. The stories, on the other hand, they appear well-constructed and believable, supported by an excellent, truly high-level dubbing (in English), so much so that we think we are dealing with a production more like a television series than a video game. From a technical point of view there is obviously little to say, since it is essentially a game built with real photos and videos, but the interface is still functional, with a convincing style in recreating really existing systems and apps. A significant obstacle to the use can be represented by the presence of the English language only for the texts, moreover often written in a British slang that is difficult to understand, but the developers have promised that the game will subsequently be updated with new localizations in other languages.", "date": "2022-12-22", "grade": "7.0"}
