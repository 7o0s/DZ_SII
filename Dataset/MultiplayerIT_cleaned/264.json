Of course, that also means new heroes, new special abilities, and new powers. The events come to life after the destruction of the Death Star, the remains of which can still be found in the space around Yavin IV. In this new context, therefore, we will be able to find a mature Luke Skywalker, no longer a pilot but a Jedi apprentice, and his instructor Yoda, while the Red Team has been replaced by the Rogue Team, which will have the task of countering the Death Star 2. The power of corruption In addition to conquering planets, the Consortium can corrupt them, stealing credits and other bonuses. The corruption of a planet takes place by sending a special unit, the corruptor, but the type of action varies from planet to planet. For example, we will be able to carry out Extortion operations, which will provide the Consortium with credits for each unit destroyed in the system, or Piracy, to obtain new ship models for our fleet. Each planet has a choice of different actions, each of which has a cost in terms of credits but also of units. The corruptor will be sacrificed for each operation, while sometimes it will be necessary to spend other units, more or less expensive and, above all, some types of operation involve a mission in orbit or on the ground. Not all operations are possible from the start, each one has requirements to be fulfilled so they will be unlocked as you progress through the game. Corruption begets corruption, in short. On some planets, the corruptor will be able to establish a base for the Black Market, through which the Consortium will be able to acquire new technologies. corruption begets corruption The power of corruption As we said, there are new units and new heroes. As regards the former, we point out the main innovations. The Consortium fleet is similar to the Rebel fleet, consisting of fighters, bombers, frigates, and warships. On land, however, the situation becomes more varied. In addition to the normal front-line troops, Zann will be able to show off invisible transports, he will be able to produce antiquated but always deadly droidekas, he will have the support of the mysterious sisters of the night, who enter battle riding their rancors, he will exploit the disturbing Ewok tamers and he will be able to flush out Jedi and invisible units with his dangerous molosses, plus obviously the inevitable classes of armored vehicles. The Empire, of course, has not been idle all this time and has supplied its fleet with the new prototypes of Tie Interceptor, Tie Defender and Tie Phantom, the latter capable of becoming invisible and striking at all 'sudden. On land, the Empire will be able to field three different versions of the Dark Soldiers, an armored transport and the Lancet aerial artillery unit. The Rebels, for their part, are mysteriously equipped with fewer units. If in space we finally find the powerful B-Wings and a light Mon Calamari frigate, on the ground we have only the troop transport. [C] The planet corruption screen. We can see the black market option. Caccia Starviper and Tie Interceptor give each other a thrashing, in a spectacular shot made with the battlecam. Tyber Zann's power allowed him to corrupt this Imperial Lancet into joining the Consortium. Kamino's hours are numbered. [/C] As you can see, the transport vehicle is common to all factions, albeit with the appropriate differentiations, but it is not the only one, in fact each team will have a Mobile Defense Unit at its disposal, i.e. a vehicle capable of moving and , at the appropriate time, transform into a multipurpose platform, providing turrets or shield generators or other, depending on the deployment to which they belong. The presence of UDMs partly compensates for the impossibility of building structures during land battles, in fact each of them can dynamically transform into a certain type of defense and having a certain number of them, defensive structures can be placed anywhere on the map. Of course, there are many restrictions, primarily the number of units that can be brought into battle, including reinforcements, but the utility and versatility of these tools is decidedly high. Furthermore, on land maps, we can find bunkers, capable of holding up to five soldiers and providing them with additional defense, at the expense of mobility. We talked about fleets and troops, now let's see which heroes the force of corruption brings into play. In addition to the aforementionedleaders, Tyber Zann and Urai Fen, the Consortium introduces a couple of other minor heroes plus a particular droid, which will be the weapon to be used to defeat the second Death Star. The Rebels will have on their side the devastating power of the young Skywalker, who has now become a Jedi apprentice, and his master Yoda, both with their own powers. In space, as already mentioned, to counter the second Death Star we will find the Rogue Squad. Too bad though, that there is no Lando Carlissian in the Millenium Falcon, as in the film. And the Empire? Well, the Empire has big names in the field, such as Grand Admiral Thrawn, General Rom Mohc, with his Arc Hammer (those who played the first Dark Forces will surely remember it) and the Super Star Destroyer Executor. In short, fans of the series certainly cannot complain (apart from some temporal inconsistencies). being able to create an extensive network of corruption allows you to weaken your opponents and, at the same time, reap indirect benefits The secrets of power. Playing on Zann's side opens up new possibilities for conquest and allows for a less straightforward approach to controlling planets. Being able to create an extensive network of corruption allows you to weaken your opponents and, at the same time, derive indirect benefits, even without getting involved in battles on the field. The Taken Army offers a new Campaign story mode and a new set of Galactic Conquest scenarios (also playable with other factions), in both cases, however, we will directly control the two main heroes: Tyber Zann and Urai Fen. As heads of one of the largest criminal organizations in existence, it is natural that the two characters are endowed with excellent battle skills, unfortunately this translates into a strong imbalance in favor of the Consortium, as deploying Zann and Fen together (but also only Zann is enough) means being able to conquer even an averagely defended planet, if you play carefully. Zann's strongest ability is to be able to corrupt any enemy unit into fighting on his side; placing Urai Fen alongside him, who alone has a very high firepower and can regenerate his wounds, considering, then, that both are capable of making themselves invisible for short intervals of time, we have a clear picture of the situation and how much this is in favor of the Consortium. Aside from the new units and new heroes, the changes in the game stop there. The space battles remain two-dimensional and the ground maps are still too small and ultimately the game has remained much the same but with more content. In short, no upheavals. Finally, the new options for multiplayer should be mentioned. Finally, the possibility has been introduced for two opponents to choose the same faction to clash and in addition it is possible to play three-player skirmishes, with all sides. Added to this is support for clans, with online statistics and rankings, and the ability to challenge each other. Conclusions The EoC does not distort or innovate, but adds substantial content. Those who loved the base game will certainly love this expansion too, while the others certainly won't change their minds. Of course, it must be said that playing in a scenario with three factions changes the strategic approach a lot and increases the proposed challenge coefficient. Unfortunately, however, the defects that were present in the Empire at War are also here, so we find again the flat space battles, too powerful heroes, small maps and all. In this sense, one would have expected a filing work by the developers, which did not happen. In the end, the product was like this and has remained like this, for better or for worse. Pro New faction and new units New Campaign and new scenarios. New multiplayer options Cons Little innovation to the original scheme In the long run the flaws of the base game Unbalanced Factions emerge A short introduction The Corrupted Army introduces a new protagonist in the clash between the Rebels and the Empire: the dangerous criminal Tyber Zann, formerly sworn enemy of Jabba the Hutt, and his criminal organization: the Zann Consortium. Accompanying him is his trusted lieutenant and right-hand man Urai Fen, with whom he will share control of the operations of conquest and corruption.", "date": "2006-11-20", "grade": null}
