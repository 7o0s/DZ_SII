However, for everyone, from Milan to Palermo, the time has come to put umbrellas and bathing suits aside to dive back, pardon the pun, into their daily chores such as school and work. However, if you still feel like summer and you just can't resign yourself to the idea of returning to your usual commitments with winter just around the corner, like the guy in the advertisement for a well-known cruise company, Farsight Tech and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment encounter with a decidedly ad hoc product. Ok, it's more of a palliative than anything else, but as they say, ~he who is satisfied enjoys~... Vacation Isle Beach Party is a game which, as the suffix itself states, is in fact aimed at an audience of all ages and experiences eager to experience the thrill of trying different activities typical of an exotic summer vacation, but in the living room of your own home, perhaps company of friends and family. But let's proceed in order and let's explain how to play: at the beginning you'll have to select a character to play and, if you want, change its appearance with gadgets, body accessories and much more. Once all this is done, choose the modality and the sport you want to tackle (surfing, water skiing, slalom, ski jumping and even some types of dance) and start the challenge. The game involves the use of the balance board (Nintendo's balance-shaped peripheral) on which you will have to move to determine the movements on the screen of your virtual alter ego but it is also possible to relegate everything to the analog stick, losing in our opinion however half the fun. If the type of race involves the execution of stunts you will then also have to use the Z and B buttons. It will be precisely in these phases that you will realize that what was said at the beginning of the article about the simplicity of the game system was not an exaggeration . The controls and gameplay prove to be quite essential: on balance it is generally about trying to avoid objects and perform stunts which, however, seem to arise more from chance than from the particular skills of users and characters. In fact, it often happens that you randomly manipulate the keys used to move the avatars to be able to perform incredible evolutions on the screen without any problems whatsoever. Dancing on the beach As for the mini-games based on the musical component and therefore on the rhythm, we have a series of challenges typical of the genre, that is, a series of dance competitions in which the characters on the screen must be made to dance following the specific indications that appear in the video in the form of icons to be executed with the aid of the peripherals used for the purpose. All with a certain timing. In short, just like you see in any product of the musical genre. In this way up to four players not at the same time can challenge each other in sessions full of rhythm and dance, accompanied by very nice and summer-themed tunes based on the location where the competitions take place. Strange to say, but paradoxically, these seem to be the most successful phases of a product which, due to its nature, concentrates its attention more on the sporting ludic component. At the end of each session you will be able to earn hundreds of sand dollars which can then be used to purchase a wide variety of sports equipment and accessories to customize your avatar. Little to add on the technical aspect of Vacation Isle Beach Party: it has colorful graphics, cute and discreetly characterized characters, but nothing that leaves users too impressed from a visual point of view. Also due to a certain repetitiveness of the scenarios. On the other hand, we have a soundtrack suitable for the type of game and the setting, with catchy songs that perfectly recreate the holiday atmosphere, immersing the gamer in the environments represented. In short, we are not dealing with a masterpiece and certainly the Nintendo Wii from the point of view of family entertainment can offer better, but this title certainly deserves a look, bearing in mind, however, that it is only a pastime title.", "date": "2010-10-04", "grade": null}
