Will it perhaps be one of those cases in which a video game manages to overcome difficulties and prejudices by imposing itself as an excellent alternative to the more famous productions? Well... no. Eisenhorn: Xenos won't go down in history as one of the best Warhammer 40,000 games Inquisitor profession The problems of Eisenhorn: Xenos arise from a series of design choices that appear ill-calibrated when not completely wrong from their foundations. Let's start from the narrative sector, what should be the real spearhead of Pixel Hero Games' work thanks to a complex plot narrated through a wide range of cutscenes and with the icing on the cake of a dubbing of the protagonist made by the famous actor British Mark Strong: Well, the story is full of references that only the most hardcore Warhammer 40,000 enthusiasts will be able to appreciate, while everyone else is left in the dark. The interlude sequences and most of the dialogues are unnecessarily long-winded and artificial, and already after the first stages of the adventure it is difficult to resist the temptation to press the key to skip the scenes completely; finally the vocal performances of the voice actors - with the exception of Strong's - are just a step above amateurish, testifying to the fact that evidently the whole budget was spent on hiring the actor. A dizzying difference between ambition and results that also involves the graphic aspect, another sector in which Eisenhorn: Xenos seemed to be able to make a big voice at least in the mobile sector. Indeed, at the outset the title shows off some impressive elements: the polygonal models of the main protagonists are massive and full of details and the settings appear complex and well defined also from the point of view of the textures. Too bad it doesn't take much to get all the dirt that Pixel Hero Games has tried to sweep under the carpet out: the frame rate drops well below an acceptable threshold as the screen gets more crowded, the assets are repeated at disproportionate and the animations prove wooden and poorly connected to each other. Needless to say, even the gameplay suffers more or less the same fate, in the context of an action game that would like to be many different things but which in fact fails to properly interpret even one specific role. In its exploratory component, Eisenhorn: Xenos simply proves to be devoid of interest: the settings are often too large and empty, and the interaction with the scenarios is limited to certain parts (highlighted by specific indicators) where it is possible to perform contextual actions. We therefore proceed yawning between one long walk and another, forced to listen to the thoughts of the protagonist himself or the boring dialogues with other characters, without actually doing anything pleasant from a playful point of view. Sometimes it is required to use devices or Eisenhorn's psychic powers to analyze some sensitive element, but it all comes down to a simple routine that does not add depth to the experience. The fights are supposed to add the necessary spice to an effectively bland dish, but they are made in such a sloppy way that they almost have the opposite effect. By engaging one or more enemies, the protagonist automatically draws his sword, and five virtual keys appear on the display relating to as many actions: one can strike with a white weapon, shoot a pistol, dodge, perform a sort of telekinetic attack or activate a special move that allows - after filling a special bar - to slow down time and attack helpless opponents. On paper everything is fine, but in fact the list of things that don't work is quite long here too: there is no semblance of a target locking system as God intended, the impact of the shots is almost non-existent, the reactivity of the controls it leaves a lot to be desired (especially when frame-rate dips get in the way) and enemy AI is zero. In short, while making a rather substantial campaign available, Eisenhorn: Xenos forcesthe user to swallow far too many bitter pills, and we honestly believe it is difficult that even the biggest Warhammer 40,000 enthusiast can be satisfied with a playful transposition which, moreover, is sold at a decidedly high price by mobile standards.", "date": "2016-08-26", "grade": "5.0"}
