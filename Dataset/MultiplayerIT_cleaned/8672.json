After the fully successful attempt to revive the SSX saga, it's now up to the perhaps more delicate one of Fifa Street, the interpretation of the Canadian five-a-side software house. The loss of the numerical suffix (technically it is the fourth episode), as well as the considerable time gap of four years reaffirms the essence of a real reboot compared to the previous chapters, enriched by the presence of an exceptional testimonial: Lionel Messi. Not a bad presentation card for this 2012, but let's see what new things await us. The new Lombard First of all, it is necessary to reiterate the abandonment of the comic style that had characterized the third chapter, as well as all the typically Arcade exaggerations represented by pyrotechnic special shots, fiery players or moves on the edge of reality. While maintaining a boisterous spirit and ideal for those who want to approach the game of football without commitment, Fifa Street offers a more realistic look and dynamics, clearly borrowed from its older brother Fifa 12. This time the two titles really have a lot in common, albeit with diametrically opposite intentions. The menu offers a fair number of modes, but the focus is mainly on the main one, the World Tour Mode. This is the real soul of the game which consists in bringing your favorite team to the podium of world competitions. How to do? First of all by starting to recruit potential teammates from the field near the house, through hot Sunday sessions, or better still by creating them from scratch with the very complete editor. Once the team of your dreams has been formed, you move on to choosing the logo, name and club colors, the step towards regional tournaments is relatively short. Through a hub, the player is free to choose an ever-growing set of challenges, which significantly diversify the game. It starts from small two-on-two matches without goalkeepers, up to real tournaments to be conquered with the best ~tricks~ offered by the game engine. The world is my balloon Precisely the feints represent the key element of the new playability proposed by EA Sports, with a system that recalls another old classic of the Canadian house, the Skate saga. In essence, the combination of the back buttons and the right stick gives rise to a whole series of special moves, some to be conquered along the world tour, which become protagonists across the board in the modes dedicated to them. This means that in Fifa Street the aim is not just to get the ball into the net, but also to do it in style. It is therefore clear that, unlike the big brother Fifa 12, it is much easier to perform tricks with the ball, being an integral part of the play sector. However, the World Tour is much more than this: a real RPG where our team levels up after each game, earns bonus items such as clothing and recruits star players from opposing teams. The most successful aspect is represented by the simplicity of the interface developed by the programmers, both as regards the management of the squads and the improvement of the characteristics of the players. All this helps to create a truly unique empathy with our virtual companions, if we then think that the single player sessions have a mere tutorial value for a mode designed especially for online, it is clear where the true potential of Fifa Street lies . In a similar way, the title offers a complete customization of the multiplayer, including the many modes, among the most successful the one that sees our team reduced by one element for each goal scored. Finding yourself against five opponents turns out to be quite a feat, but luckily we are talking about a video game, and with adequate training we will be able to match the performance of the legendary Messi! Xbox 360 goals Fifa Street features the canonical 1000 player points divided along 34 objectives. Half of the points are achieved by finishing the World Tour mode victorious, not exactly child's play. The others require you to meet certain conditions, such as completing a tournament in the company of a friend in co-op, or reaching a certain skill level of the players of the created team. Completing everything will take you a considerable amount of time. Good luck, and watch out for the menisci! Champions in the field Obviously when we talk about Electronic Arts the imperative is the packaging, also in this case made with first-rate precision and richness. For those who prefer to wear the boots of great champions, they come to the rescuerso the official licenses; these ensure the presence of numerous teams from the English, French, Italian, Spanish leagues, national teams and even the US MLS. Not only that, they all include the uniforms complete with logos and sponsors in full view. It has to be admitted that holding Arsenal and Real Madrid to death has its charm, even if it's only associated with friendlies. The number of fields available is impressive, contextual to the modalities and mostly to be unlocked in the World Tour. They range from suburban pitches to gym parquet, up to the synthetic grass of a field on top of a skyscraper! There is certainly no shortage of variety on Fifa Street. The graphics engine is derived from that of Fifa 12, albeit with a modified Impact Engine for the different game dynamics. The athletes are excellently made, and the possibility of wearing the objects earned on the World Tour gives a very urban culture aspect that will make admirers happy. It being understood that we are dealing with a title oriented mainly towards entertainment, where the goals follow one another without worrying about the intervention of the referee (if we exclude a specific modality). For the rest, despite the sometimes excessive emphasis on tackling and dribbling, we have to admit that the game dynamics of Fifa Street are extremely enjoyable. Too bad for a certain compliance of the goalkeepers, a detail that we did not expect from EA Sports: unfortunately we have witnessed several blunders by the extreme defenders. The absence of commentary is felt, even if the screams of the audience and the outstanding soundtrack partially compensate for its lack. Despite the beauty of the World Tour, playing exclusively against the CPU proves to be an unnatural experience: there is often the unpleasant sensation of games conducted through pre-established dynamics, a detail not helped by the impossibility of eliminating the assisted controls. For this reason it is advisable to immediately jump online, certainly an ideal field of action for this successful reboot, even better in the company of friends.", "date": "2012-03-16", "grade": "8.5"}
