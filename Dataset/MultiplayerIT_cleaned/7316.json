Available without much pomp or notice, the expansion called Fallen Angel can be downloaded on the Xbox One Marketplace for 9.99 euros, obviously free for all those who have subscribed to a season pass of the game, which already includes all digital content published and to be released in the future. The latter is part of the narrative called ~Untold Stories of Los Perdidos~, or a series of adventures parallel to those of the protagonist of the main story that are grafted into the Dead Rising 3 universe and its teeming city full of walkers. Dead Rising 3: Fallen Angel: we return to Los Perdidos with a decidedly sexier protagonist! Return to Los Perdidos Although the gaming experience offered by Dead Rising 3 was highly adrenaline-pumping, entertaining and well-constructed, the latest expansion that put us in the role of Adam Kane had not exactly exalted the general public and critics. An uninspired character, combined with a fairly limited offer and the relative ease with which his mini story was tackled, had decreed its partial failure. Partial because in any case the game structure remained unchanged from the original one, still being enjoyable and fun. Capcom, despite the decisive criticisms that appeared on the web immediately afterwards, has instead shown that it listens little to those voices and has produced a new chapter by following the philosophy of the previous one, although this is certainly better thanks to a more captivating and beautiful protagonist to watch: Angel, who while she's far from even being nominated for this year's ~best female newcomer,~ is far more charming and prettier than the aforementioned bland military man. Angel is part of the organized resistance against the ~elite~ who command the streets after day X and the arrival of the epidemic, and our mission is to create safe areas where to host refugees and people rescued from the undead always looking for of a fresh meal. The idea behind this DLC, like all the others to come, is to weave a plot that runs parallel to the main one and that manages to expand it, trying to cross it in different points to give a sense of completeness to the universe created by the authors. In any case, the heavily tattooed protagonist remains very stereotyped, even though she is more fun and ironic than her predecessor Kane (not that it took much, after all). Where Capcom could have decidedly improved the game offer was in the variety, which evidently, however, it did not do as this DLC also does not offer any unpublished settings to discover or even characters with captivating stories to tell. The factor that made the main story unique and compelling was precisely the desire to explore the city and meet new survivors, elements that we do not find in this DLC, a very repetitive and fairly simple game extension due to a level of difficulty calibrated towards Bass. Adding a couple of new weapons (Lara Croft-style UZIs and pulse rifle) as well as a new vehicle, can't justify the cost of this expansion at full price. In our opinion Capcom should and could have done much more, the feeling of having wasted a great opportunity with such a powerful series (and lately zombies also seem to be back in fashion) is evident. It now seems clear that this series of DLCs are aimed purely at the public of super fans of Dead Rising and at those looking for another hour of ~brainless~ entertainment, without many frills, regardless of the cost and the diversification of the offer. The hope remains that, with the four chapters, we will arrive at a positive global balance for the cost of the season pass.", "date": "2014-02-14", "grade": null}
