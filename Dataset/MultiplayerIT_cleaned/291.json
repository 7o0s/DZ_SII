{"name": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-stories-2.html", "text": "Iron class Like its predecessor, Vice City Stories takes advantage of the same location as the PS2 reference title, but in a different time setting and with completely new characters. The protagonist this time is Vic Vance, who a couple of years before Tommy Vercetti arrives in the city, enlists in the army to bring economic comfort to his family and pay for the medical care of his sick brother. Noble intentions that are promptly stained by the corrupt sergeant Martinez, who involves Vic in a series of shady dealings that end up having him expelled from the barracks: frustrated and in need of money, our ~hero~ fits not without a certain reluctance into the branch of the criminal activity, paving the way for the classic GTA scenario of chases, robberies, murders and more. The game's storyline is convincing, supported by the usual vitriolic real-time cutscenes and a series of secondary characters with strong personalities: in this regard, fans of the original on PS2 will be happy to find several well-known faces here, primarily the bizarre Lance Vance, brother of Vic and clumsy co-star of a large number of missions. Compared to the prequel, Vice City Stories can count on a full-bodied visual upgrade Iron class The city is instead exactly the same, enriched by a few more interiors to explore and graphically impressive, to the point of being almost indistinguishable from the version for the Sony home console at first glance. Compared to the prequel, Vice City Stories can count on a full-bodied visual upgrade, evident in several aspects: more polygons, more stable frame rate, greater quantity and variety of pedestrians and vehicles on the screen and finally a higher definition in indoor settings. However, some minor cosmetic flaws remain, headed by pop-ups and a texture update that often fails to keep up with the scrolling on-screen action. Nothing that diminishes Rockstar's monumental graphic work too much, certainly among the best ever seen on PSP. Even the sound maintains the high quality standard of the franchise. The musical choice of the various radio stations is excellent, interspersed as usual by fake DJs and fake advertisements that often manage to elicit a smile. The dubbing at very high levels doesn't even make text anymore, while a curious problem in reading the UMD should be pointed out, which sometimes during the game ~jumps~ in search of the track. Let's get our hands dirty From the point of view of the gameplay, the substance of Vice City Stories is certainly not revolutionary: diligently following the stylistic features of the series, the Rockstar product offers the user the classic sequence of criminal-tinged missions within a free-roaming scenario, to be explored by alternating driving phases with sections on foot. Nonetheless, there is no lack of news compared to the prequel, primarily with regard to the very nature of the tasks entrusted to Vic. Longer and more elaborate, the missions of Vice City Stories on the one hand undoubtedly enrich the net play value of the product (also increasing its longevity), on the other they reduce the possibility of the game being enjoyed in short scraps of time, not exactly a merit for a handheld title. Beyond this, there are numerous additions of a certain importance: among the clearest examples we include Vic's swimming ability, the presence of helicopters and jet skis alongside the more classic means and a hand-to-hand combat system more elaborate nude. Undoubtedly the most innovative aspect of Vice City Stories is represented by the empire mode But undoubtedly the most innovative aspect of Vice City Stories is represented by the so-called empire mode, which adds a certain variety and depth to the regular succession of missions. In essence, the city is full of buildings that the player can buy or rob from rival gangs, in order to exploit them as bases for businesses such as drug dealing, loan sharking, prostitution and so on: activities that generate constant income and which can be expanded both by investing in their development (building larger offices) and by completing dedicated sub-quests. Unfortunately, these turn out to be extremely boring and repetitive, having too little impact on the process of our Vic, considering how the money produced by the elementary structures is already more than enough. However, building your own empire is a pleasant diversion, which enhances the dynamics of a somewhat botched but always extremely enjoyable gameplay: thanks also to a good balance in the type and level of difficulty of the missions, which are hardly too repetitive or frustrating. The only heckture of the Rockstar product can once again be identified in the management of the camera, slow and cumbersome, and in the pointing system, not always reliable. Finally, the undoubted protagonist of Vice City Stories is the multiplayer mode, in fact a considerable expansion of what has already been seen in the prequel: up to six players can challenge each other simultaneously ad hoc (nothing online even this time) in some particular competitions that flank classic races and deathmatches, which can generally be defined as slight variations on the theme of various capture the flag, king of the hill and so on. Although it is a very welcome feature, the multiplayer of Vice City Stories suffers a bit from the excessive breadth of the scenarios, which make meetings between two or even four users rather tedious. Comment GTA: Vice City Stories is an excellent second installment of the series for PSP, which widens the boundaries of the prequel and corrects some imperfections. In addition to an appreciable graphic upgrade, Vic Vance's adventure offers above all a more substantial play structure, with more elaborate missions, the brand new empire mode and an expanded multiplayer section. However, Vice City Stories also shows its side to some criticism, mainly relating to the poor handheld nature of the game and to a gameplay that is in fact five years old. Beyond this, the Rockstar product remains one of the most successful titles for PSP and a must for fans of the series. Pros Technically excellent Improved gameplay over the prequel Fun as ever Cons Not suitable for short play sessions Questionable camera and aiming Adds little or nothing to the series Released last year, GTA: Liberty City Stories caused a great stir within the gaming community, both because it was the first release of the Rockstar franchise on PSP, and because of the extraordinary way in which the US software house had managed to compress everything within a single UMD while remaining very faithful to the original. A high-level debut, therefore, which certainly could not afford to remain an isolated case. Having said that, here comes Vice City Stories, which presents itself with the prospect of breaking the box office again and correcting some imperfections of the prequel.", "date": "2006-11-07", "grade": null}
