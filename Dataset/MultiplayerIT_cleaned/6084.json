{"name": "Xblaze - Lost: Memories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155285-xblaze-lost-memories-non-ti-scordar-di-me.html", "text": "In Japan, multimedia is a long-standing practice. The majority of successful manga become anime, and a great many anime become live action movies and video games. This also happens in the West, we know it well, but the phenomenon is decidedly more contained and has never gone as far as visual novels, which often complement other types of media as a narrative complement. We're talking about an all-Japanese genre that can be defined as a graphic adventure, although perhaps it's better to talk about digital comics. In fact, we often find ourselves faced with a series of tables, seasoned with rather simple animations, which come to life thanks to the dubbing and the crossroads in the dialogues. Given the simplicity of the recipe, it is not surprising that some titles rely on mechanics belonging to other genres to enrich the dish, but in most cases the fulcrum remains the narrative component that unfolds dialogue after dialogue taking into account our choices. This formula, which has accustomed us to rather marked ups and downs, is the basis of the Xblaze series that was born with Code: Embryo and tells us distant stories lost in the past of the BlazBlue fighting game. The protagonist of the first title of the saga, of which Lost: Memories is the direct sequel, is Touya Kagari, a student of the Hakuou North Academy who got into trouble chasing a sound coming from a closed area due to a big accident that took place several years earlier. In this new chapter Touya reappears but is no longer the protagonist. The heroine is a girl who lives in the suburb of Ishana with her little sister. Years earlier, he shows us a dramatic flashback, the protagonist's mother died and her body was taken away by a father engaged in strange experiments. After many years these cumbersome memories still come back to haunt what is no longer a child but a woman who, resisting her fears, has managed to build a life for herself. However, everything changes when his sister disappears, lighting the fuse of this new adventure that leads us in search of lost memories in the maze of a mysterious and desolate place called Phantom Field. The protagonist finds herself with no memory so much that she is initially called with the name ~Me~, although the player can fortunately change it after meeting a rowdy and mysterious girl who responds to the name of ~Nobody~. The search for memories, in essence, is the fulcrum of the adventure that makes us find them in the form of crystals in the depths of the aforementioned Phantom Field. This also allows us to relive, albeit from different perspectives, several key events of the first chapter and this means that it is not necessary to have played it to understand the overall story. A choice that we can define as spot on given the numerous flaws of Code: Embryo, which relies on an incomprehensible system based on web articles to lead us towards an unsatisfactory final series. The second title doesn't follow in the footsteps of the first and that's good. Let's go back to discovering BlazBlue's past with this second chapter of the Xblaze series In the depths of Phantom Field Xblaze - Lost: Memories, which has been out for some time in North America and arriving in Europe on September 18, allows us to directly control the protagonist in a sort of mini-game that leads us to explore the depths of the Phantom Field. And as we enter the pixelated meanders of this place, we find ourselves facing some small adversities but it is clear that there is no trace of refined challenges and addictive gameplay. The only risk, very minimal given the unlimited attempts, is hidden in the not very exciting four-question quiz that must be passed to access the next level, but the questions are quite simple and the only usefulness of this dynamic seems to be to encourage us to carefully follow the memories and dialogues. On the other hand, these represent the fulcrum of the experience and the good news is that in Lost: Memories they reserve us some surprises of a technical nature. Instead of limiting itself to the static figures typical of the genre, the title makes use of various shots, gives us some animated flashes and even sports dialogues synchronized with the protagonists' lips. There are no very complex animations but, unfortunately, the visual novels are anchored to this format suspended between anime and manga, which often sacrifices interactivity for long dialogues without depth and a rather simple characterization of the characters. The same also happens in this second chapter of the Xblaze series, even if the developers have tried to give a different take on the adventure that stretches the broth with some unmissable conversation and creaks under the weight of a characterization that is certainly not memorable, pur also offering rather interesting insights. The Arc System Works title is full of symbolism, of references to the self, to the ghosts of the past and to maturation. All cornerstones of a certain type of Japanese culture that has various things to say and probably manages to clear them in the modern commercial context thanks to the exaggeration with which they are proposed. Just think of Evangelion, which in some ways is a bignami of sociology to understand where Japanese animation can go. But a committed concept is certainly not enough to make an interesting video game and Lost: Memories has its fair share of flaws. The exploratory minigame, as we have already said, is little more than a filler made particular by the choice of pixel art graphics, while Nobody's questions that allow us to move on to the next level of the Phantom Field, designed to keep the player alert during sequences and dialogues, are the simplest imaginable. Let's be clear, we're not looking for challenging gameplay in a visual novel, but an addition isn't necessarily a good thing, especially if it alters the pace of the game without bringing much to the experience. In any case, what really matters is the story and this, as we said, touches on interesting points even if it is diluted in dialogues that sometimes last too long and don't always manage to involve us enough to make the crossroads intriguing. However, we must consider that the developers have eliminated the excessive clichs of the first chapter, which entrusted part of its appeal to crowds of girls in love, and have cut the incomprehensible system of internet articles that led us towards the different endings without allowing us to understand why . Well chosen choices even if together with these elements the multiple endings have also disappeared, which are an important element of the genre. In any case, we are faced with a more pleasant narrative to follow, which could undoubtedly involve those accustomed to this format.", "date": "2015-08-30", "grade": "6.5"}
