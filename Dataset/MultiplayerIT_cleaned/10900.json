{"name": "Severed Steel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/severed-steel-recensione.html", "text": "The first person shooter genre, with the exception of multiplayer titles and some sacred monsters of the genre (the Far Cry, Doom or Serious Sam series), has experienced better times. Leaving aside the RPG hybrids, in recent years the number of exponents of the category has decreased, even if in the very last period things seem to be improving, as evidenced by the excellent Deathloop and the next Halo Infinite. For this reason, those of the old guard have approached Severed Steel with some interest, a title that takes inspiration from F.E.A.R., but also from Mirror's Edge and Superhot. Entered early access in April last year, the project of the independent studio Greylock is finally available in its final version on Steam, GOG and Epic Game Store, waiting for the console versions that will arrive at a later time. Behind the project is Matt Larrabee, a former high school computer science teacher and former Morrowind modder. Let's find out in our Severed Steel review if the wait has paid off. Protagonist without arm A Severed Steel shootout As often happens in FPS, the story is a mere pretext. The protagonist is Steel, a purple-haired spy, who wakes up without his left arm. Determined to take revenge on whoever mutilated her, she sets out to find the culprit, climbing from the slums where she was imprisoned to the top of the building where the final showdown awaits her. Considering the vein to which Severed Steel belongs, one cannot complain about so much flatness, but the presence of some cut scenes instead of simple comic strips would have added depth and comprehensibility to the plot. Freedom of movement is of the widest: from racing on walls to flying kicks, passing through slides, double jumps and mid-air sprints, no movement is prevented from our Steel. What is surprising is the frenzy of the action: you can't afford to stand still for more than a few seconds, both because enemy shots hurt a lot and the only way to restore health is to eliminate your opponents, and because just by moving continuously you will manage to survive. The protagonist, in fact, cannot be hit while making certain evolutions. In aid of aiming, lacking the ability to zoom, there is the bullet time which is activated with the right mouse button, while the central one, located under the wheel, is used to fire the disintegrator cannon which is recovered shortly after the start and which is installed in place of the left arm. It is a weapon capable of piercing walls and consequently of creating alternative routes to those provided by the map. Another distinctive element of the title is the elimination of the recharge, an action clearly impossible in Steel's conditions. In practice, once a pistol has been emptied, it can be thrown (with surprisingly harmful effects) at an enemy and then used the one it has dropped. Small levels grow An adrenaline-pumping fight scene from Severed Steel The story of Severed Steel is divided into ten chapters, for a total of about sixty maps. Here we come to the sore points: if in the first levels, which act as tutorials for the basic mechanics, we are not surprised by a certain limitation, going forward we discover how the scenarios are so small as to be completed within a couple of minutes (sometimes even less). Moral of the story: the professionals will take just over two hours to get to the end credits, while for the others the via crucis of trial and error opens. Greylock's game can be extremely punishing already at the third of the five difficulty levels. Steel's health is so frail that a bullet may be enough to send her to the cemetery, but also the time available for the bullet time is reduced to a minimum, so the thought of being able to use it to correct a too long jump cannot even pass for the antechamber of the brain. The accuracy of eliminating opponents is added to that required to move from one platform to another, often leading to stressful situations. If we add to this the inability to save during the game which forces you to repeat the level all over again, it is easy to realize that we are talking about an experience that is not for all palates. The enemy army is made up of a fair variety of military , while there are no real bosses. It's hard to talk about artificial intelligence, considering that they are basically moving targets, but we can guarantee that they know how to be bad enough to never hold the trigger. The arsenal in which eachweapon returns feedback distinguishable from all the others - an aspect that is anything but obvious in a fast-paced shooter. Unreal Engine 4 and voxel graphics An Unreal Engine 4 setting of Severed Steel The voxel graphics are ideal for focusing on the furious firefights, eliminating all the secondary elements that could distract the player. On the other hand, the level design is penalized: the maps, despite a good variety, tend to look a bit too much alike. The structures develop both horizontally and vertically, but the contained dimensions give the impression of always moving inside a cube; the breadth of breath that would have allowed the levels to express their full potential is missing. The goal is easy to say, that is to arrive unscathed at the exit point. Sometimes it may be necessary to destroy servers, in other cases it is necessary to eliminate enemy hordes, in still others to respect a time limit. The firefight is added to the campaign, a mode devoted to esports: it is not a question of challenging other players in the flesh, but of completing thirty maps in the shortest possible time in which different rules apply to the canonical ones (killing enemies while walking up walls, making a set number of headshots, etc.) in order to then enter your name in the online leaderboards. The level editor is precious which, although still in beta version at the time of the review, has already been used by the small but active community created around the title. Last words for the techno soundtrack made by the Indiana composer Floating Door: really beautiful. In particular, the song Pugachev's Cobra seems almost wasted for an indie game. With our reference system we did not experience frame rate drops at 4K resolution with maximum details, but it should be noted that the Unreal Engine 4 is quite expensive and slowdowns may occur on older video cards.", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "7.0"}
