Having observed the evocative, typically fantasy introduction, the first surprise that comes from DoM regards the choice of our character. It has now become customary in this genre to have the opportunity to choose between different races and classes and then ~customize~ our digital alter ego in many of its aspects. Dawn of Magic does not provide for any of this (it subsequently provides for the morphing of our digital alter ego according to various spells but we cannot properly speak of character editing...), limiting itself to proposing 4 ~pre-packaged~ characters diversified by the balancing of the parameters, and renamed by the developers themselves with the following meanings: the awkward schoolboy (who is so reminiscent of Harry Potter...), the baker's wife, the fat friar and the gypsy. With all due respect, we found it truly atypical to identify with each of them, arriving at the conclusion of choosing the gypsy for reasons of... good taste! The beginning And it's finally time to start diving into Dawn of Magic. And immediately we notice a small problem of no small importance: the balancing of the difficulty. In fact, having done a quick tutorial inside a magic school, we found a very high level of challenge in the first real mission which consisted in killing 10 scorpions scattered in the forest around the school, near a group of students who they were practicing magic like us. And unfortunately not only the initial quest has an exaggerated challenge rate: even later there have been extremely complex and above all difficult to understand situations. And to think that in recent years we have always complained about the excessive simplicity of video games... DoM moves away from the Blizzard hack'n'slash stereotype by focusing much more attention on the ~magic~ component and on the various possibilities given by the inventory and character growth A dind of magic Returning to a concept expressed at the beginning of the review, DoM moves away from the Blizzard hack'n'slash stereotype by focusing much more attention on the ~magic~ component and on the various possibilities given by the inventory and character growth. The production of Skyfallen Entertainment in fact allows actions such as trading, crafting, alchemy and many others. Among the many possibilities available to us, the Dark Portal stands out: a rapid teleport that allows you to move around the visible areas of the map by simply pressing the right mouse button; in fact, it will be enough to bring the pointer to the area you want to reach and, if you have enough mana, the journey will be immediate. You can easily understand how fundamental this aspect can become in certain situations such as chases or immediate withdrawals in fights that are seeing us succumb. As far as inventory management, the amount of things to do during the adventure and the magical possibilities offered are concerned, DoM can only be credited with being one of the best titles in its reference playful genre . A dind of magic Also in updating the character, a less canonical way than usual has been chosen with a sort of various intermediate sub-levels which will give points for skills, but not for spells, while the characteristics can only be increased when the game has been definitively completed. step. Down of Dawn Having said this, however, it must be pointed out that the flaws of DoM do not end with a leveling of the at least bizarre difficulty but continue above all in relation to the response of the commands. As we haven't really seen for a long time, the synchrony between our mouse or keyboard input and the action of our digital alter ego, especially in hand-to-hand combat, has a sort of delay that sometimes tends to irritate. This too can be considered a departure from Diablo but in this case we would have been glad that DoM had been less original... Finally, the key used to ~target~ our spell towards an enemy does not satisfy the needs of an action on screen which always maintains rather high rhythms. the characterization of all the characters fails to be competitive with other similar productions released recently Only partial promotion also for the aesthetic component of Dawn of Magic: the characterization of all the characters fails to be competitive with other similar productions released recently (such as the underrated Heroes of Annihilated Empires) and also the level design, always from a visual point of view, it fails to capture and stregare the gamer. However, things are decidedly better from a more specifically technical perspective with a solid three-dimensional graphics engine that does not show frame rate problems even on PCs of not the latest generation.

The conclusion? The title of Koch Media absolutely cannot boast the nomination of ~Diablo Killer~ but it could prove to be a satisfying videogame experience for those looking for something original in a genre that is extremely unwilling to novelty. Provided that the game clearly manages to involve you in its atmosphere to the point of being able to hide the objective problems that we have pointed out in the previous paragraphs. Pros Lots of Interesting New Features Really Broad like few other titles Price Budget Cons Interaction Problems Difficulty Balance Wrong Character and level design aesthetically lacking Prejudice Among the most frequent cognitive mechanisms implemented by human beings are prejudices, forms of evaluation that take shape even before we have at our disposal all the knowledge necessary to formulate a true opinion. In the case of myself and Dawn of Magic, this mechanism occurred not so much on the qualitative judgment of Russian production as on the ontological side, on what its true essence was. You will agree with me that images and aesthetic background undoubtedly made you think you were dealing with yet another Diablo clone but in reality, for better or for worse, things are not quite like that...", "date": "2007-04-30", "grade": null}
