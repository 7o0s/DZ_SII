{"name": "Rainbow Moon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105836-rainbow-moon-strategia-a-turni.html", "text": "The ~made in Japan~ strategic RPGs unfortunately continue to remain, with rare exceptions, almost a taboo for European users, or at least for those who have never turned to the import market from the USA. Of course, there is still a long way to go and titles of the genre in the PAL version are not many, especially when compared to the American or Japanese markets. However, sometimes something seems to move and thanks also to the work of small but valid software houses, enthusiasts can enjoy interesting products like Disgaea or La Pucelle: Tactics. Rainbow Moon belongs to the aforementioned products, the latest effort in chronological order by the development team SideQuest Studios, a German group that has put itself on display in the recent past in particular with titles such as Sldner-X and Sldner-X 2: Final Prototype, two shooter scrolling old-fashioned that have met with good success at the level of critics and audiences. Like the pair of products just mentioned, the game covered in this review could easily belong ideally to the old school, being a strategic role-playing game with turn-based combat and an isometric-like view, which clearly winks at titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics, in addition to those of NIS already mentioned, albeit in a lesser form. The game tells of the young Baldren, who due to a series of circumstances opens a dimensional passage and ends up in a peaceful and tranquil world, at least until before his arrival, given that the boy unintentionally brings with him an army of evil creatures that transform the planet in a real Hell. The young hero and his five future adventure companions have the task of remedying the catastrophe and finding a way to allow the protagonist to return to his planet. From what has just been described, it is clear that the title certainly does not shine for a very original or particularly intertwined plot. The triumph of grinding Therefore, to give a certain strength to the product is the gameplay, which remains on that classic style that fans of the genre have come to know over the years in dozens of genre products. There is a vast map that invites you to explore very large and colorful scenarios, full of details and with the usual inhabited villages in which to interact with people; then there are the enemies clearly visible on the screen and therefore almost always avoidable, and, finally, those who represent the fulcrum of the playful experience of any self-respecting strategic RPG, i.e. the fights. These take place on the traditional checkerboard map, where, respecting the appropriate turn and that of the opponents, orders can be given to the members of the party (usually made up of three elements, after the initial part in which only the protagonist is controlled -ed ) positioned on it. Normal, special, physical or magical attacks, whose damage inflicted vary depending on the type of weapon and elemental sensitivity of those who suffer them, use of healing potions and artifacts capable of temporarily giving greater resistance to blows by enhancing the defense group are just some of the things you can do during the battle. Nothing original, striking or tactically profound as perhaps can be found in the titles of Nippon Ichi, it is true, but in this sense the title is pleasant and well done in these situations. At the end of each fight you get the canonical experience points you need to level up, even if it must be said that to increase the various statistics inherent in skills such as the strength or speed of each hero, you need to spend special gems called Rainbow Pearls that are collected from killing enemies as well as from contact with some special characters that you meet along your way. Playstation 3 trophies Rainbow Moon gives away 24 Trophies, including the Platinum one. In detail we therefore have 16 Bronze, 6 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. Plus someone else hidden. To obtain them, you must satisfy the game's requests such as completing specific sidequests, killing a certain number of enemies or leveling up the various characters or some of their combat ~tools~. Tempus fugit Precisely in the exploration phases Rainbow Moon offers players another of its positive aspects always linked to playability. In these situations, in fact, the user can enjoy wandering around in fairly large spaces looking for characters to interact with, perhaps to have a simple chat or to find some interesting sidequests, or in search of new paths and rare objects , perhaps useful to enhance, after the intervention of some blacksmith, armi and armor of the various heroes of the group led by the user, or to be used for other purposes. Again, using the Rainbow Coins you can buy upgrades (there are about a hundred skills) or new weapons and armor in the usual shops useful for this purpose. In these cases, however, it will also be necessary to pay attention to the passage of time which will follow a ~natural~ development, in the sense that it will take into account the alternation of day and night, and therefore, as happens in reality, some rooms used for sales may not be available at certain hours. As for the technical aspect, Rainbow Moon has very nice graphics, with a classic fantasy style but in Japanese style, with varied and colorful environments that well represent the world in which the adventure is set. From snowy areas to marine ones, ranging from areas rich in vegetation or rocky ones, the title gives the view a beautiful picture. Some flaws in the animations of the characters, a little too retro in this sense, but in some ways you can overlook them. The sound is also good, with effects in play, music and some sampled phrases for the various characters in line with other genre productions.", "date": "2012-07-17", "grade": "7.8"}
