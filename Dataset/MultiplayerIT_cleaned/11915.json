The king of ninjas The start screen allows us to access the Heroes Mode, the VS CPU, the Selection Exam, the Parameter Upgrading mode and the ~Naruto House~. The Heroes Mode represents the fulcrum of the game and sees us select a team made up of three ninjas, with the possibility of choosing from ready-made groups (which mirror those seen in some episodes of the manga) or creating a personalized one. The three chosen ninjas will each time face a variable number of opponents, from one to three, depending on the characteristics of the clash, until the final fight. Each character brings a special ability to the team that can be used before going into action, and the team itself produces a sort of ~collective~ ability. Translated into practical terms, before a challenging battle we can weaken the opponents by sealing their chakra (spiritual energy), lowering their level of attack or defense, poisoning them or taking away part of their vital energy. Some characters also boast a healing ability on party members, which proves to be essential in more advanced difficulty levels and even more so given the ~survival~ nature of Ultimate Ninja Heroes: our warriors do not fully recover their energy between fights the other, so you have to manage the order of entry of each (as in the famous The King of Fighters ...) using a pinch of strategy and common sense. The Heroes Mode at the beginning allows us to access only the ~easy~ level, after which we can try the ~normal~ one, then the ~difficult~ one and finally the ~insane~ one. Each degree of difficulty corresponds to a series of different fights, and defeating certain enemies results in the possibility of using them later. I will become the new Hokage! The ~VS CPU~ mode is nothing more than a one-on-one battle between us and the game's AI, particularly useful if we want to get to know one of the many available characters well. It is not a factor to be underestimated: each ninja has different characteristics, so using one or the other is not the same thing except for the combinations of buttons that activate the various attack maneuvers. As in any self-respecting fighting game, in Ultimate Ninja Heroes we have an additional energy bar, which indicates our chakra level and which we can fill by collecting certain objects or by holding down on the d-pad. There are three moves that consume the chakra: two of them have a limited effect (usually one has an offensive nature, the other is used to defend us), while the super move consumes all the spiritual energy but produces exceptional results both from the point of view visual (each character boasts a spectacular sequence in which he literally slaughters his opponent) and from the point of view of the damage caused. We must keep in mind all these elements of the game in the ~Selection Exam~ mode, divided into different stages which often cannot be accessed immediately (you must first collect a certain number of rolls of different colors), each of which involves a fight which must follow particular rules (for example ~win without consuming chakra~, or ~end the fight within a time limit~...). While the ~Naruto House~ is nothing more than the place where we will collect all the extras earned in the game, the Parameter Enhancement mode must be taken into due consideration, as it allows us to modify the characteristics of the characters by spending the points earned during the fights. Upgrading the ninjas we usually use is absolutely necessary if we want to complete Heroes Mode from the normal difficulty level onwards, because otherwise we will find ourselves in situations of clear disadvantage, unable to cause massive damage while only a few hits from the enemy can knock us out game. The Perfect Ninja's Handbook If you've tried either Naruto: Ultimate Ninja for PS2, then you'll have no problem getting to grips with the structure of Ultimate Ninja Heroes. The game is basically a two-dimensional fighting game with some platform elements and the ability to move between two different floors of the scenario. Some elements of the background can be destroyed to collect weapons or items useful in combat, and there is only one button (Circle) assigned to the attack, which produces different combos depending on the direction of the d-pad. The parry is assigned to the backbone R, and pressing it at the right time results in the disappearance of our character and its reappearance behind the opponent. Technical realization There are so many graphical elements in common between Ultimate Ninja Heroes on PSP and Ultimate Ninja on PS2, although on the Sony laptop there are new sequences for special moves and some extra animation. The result obtained by the developers is exceptional in many respects, and the PSP's large screen offers fantastic color rendering as well as perfect definition. The graphics are constantly zooming (putting us in a bit of difficulty when the characters move quickly on a distant plane), the fluidity is always high and the quality of the textures is average, but the general impact is really excellent . Naruto fans will be delighted by the presence of numerous (and excellent) character drawings made by the author of the manga, reproduced flawlessly and absolutely sharp. The only negative notes are mostly in the presence of some scenarios that are anything but successful from a design point of view, even if you often end up discovering their true characteristics only with experience. And the graphics engine gives in to some slowdown, even if this really occurs in very rare cases, when the situation gets very confusing. As for the sound, on the one hand we have good effects and good music, on the other hand absolutely awful English voices, which cannot be deactivated or changed to a Japanese equivalent. Ultimate Ninja Heroes has a multiplayer mode that allows us to play with two PSPs even in the presence of only one UMD in the game, as well as the possibility of facing online opponents connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi. The control system sees the use of the d-pad and not the analog stick, and the game responds quickly to inputs, with some reservations only for the back keys, whose reaction you need to get used to. Finally, the question of uploads: tested on a PSP Slim & Lite, the game has frequent waits, but short-lived, completely bearable. Comment Naruto fans who own a PSP can finally play with an excellent exponent of the Ultimate Ninja series, a fighting game that can certainly be tackled without too many frills, but which hides an unexpected depth among its chaotic brawls: the characters have different characteristics and moves , and you have to take note of it when you try your hand at the more demanding modes. The presence of special skills to be used before the fights and the ~survival~ system with which the energy bars are managed are two elements of sure interest, which add a pinch of strategy to the product. The rest is all substance: a full-bodied and challenging Heroes Mode, the numerous tests of the Selection Exam, the wireless multiplayer and the high number of fighters combine to make Ultimate Ninja Heroes a long-lived title, which lasts and is more fun depending of your passion for Naruto. Pros: Great graphics Lots of modes, lots of characters Knowledgeable fighting... Cons: ...but you can also madly press buttons Extremely similar to the PS2 version Items to review Needless to deny it, Naruto is the new phenomenon of the moment both in Japan (where the manga continues to come out) and in Italy (thanks to the animated series), and it is clear that Namco Bandai has every intention of exploiting the license in the best way, on every gaming system. Ultimate Ninja Heroes represents the debut of the series on PSP, and for the occasion the developers of the CyberConnect2 team have drawn liberally from the episodes made for PlayStation 2, adding some innovative elements.", "date": "2007-10-19", "grade": null}
