The one we review here is the fourth one, In Sheep's Clothing. In all there are five episodes and, as always in these cases, we will have to wait for the end of the series for an overall judgment. Finally, if spoilers are making you sleepy, we advise you to go directly to the comment box at the end of the article. At the end of the third episode Snow White saved our lives. Now we find her watching with concern as a medic extracts silver bullets from our many wounds. His smart work jacket is stained with our blood. She might be the last friend we have left in Fabletown. Yet it is against her that In Sheep's Clothing, the fourth episode of the series, puts us. Snow White is in fact the new village chief and intends to enforce the law, without exception. But for Bigby it would mean missing out on an opportunity to show a modicum of compassion and regain the trust of the people he's supposed to protect. At the moment, in fact, his popularity has reached an all-time low and there are those who consider him the same way as the criminals he is hunting. All this only increases Bigby's anger and frustration, forced in the uncomfortable role of sheriff to supervise a flock that shows its true face: a mixture of degenerates and miserable people who don't know how to get by. Fabletown has never seemed so filthy and hopeless as in this fourth episode. As if that weren't enough, the nature of the wolf presses as always to stay in charge. Snow White does not accept this, and his request to have Fabletown's public enemy alive, so that he can be judged according to the law, perhaps anticipates Bigby's final choice, which always revolves around the central dilemma of the series: the price he must pay to be able to do his job better. Apparently he can't be a good sheriff and a respected person at the same time. Although the third episode is the best packaged one, only in this new chapter can we feel the tension becoming more and more consistent as the investigation narrows down to a single possibility, crossing the threshold that divides us from our fears and facing them. The times of the first episode are long gone, when we had welcomed this new series with coldness and skepticism. Telltale peeled back layer after layer of history, revealing new ambiguities each time. When we seem to have figured out which side we have to be on, a thorn pricks us in the side, and no decision ever seems to be the right decision. There is no recipe for life, this is what the stories of the inhabitants of Fabletown seem to tell us, talking frogs and bad-tempered alcoholics with an ax over their shoulders. So bizarre, yet so human. In Sheep's Clothing she torments Bigby, who must choose between loyalty and duty, friendship and justice The wolf at the door Our choices are probably illusory. Perhaps when that sentence appears on the screen, for example ~Colin will remember that~, it means nothing else than that our words have struck the interlocutor, without this changing what will follow in the story. But even if that were the case, it would be a very believable illusion, especially in this fourth episode. The scarce two hours of play mark the last stages of the investigation. Even if some fundamental pieces are still missing at the beginning, one gets the impression that the investigation is just a way to postpone the inevitable. There is room for a flood of words; everyone talks a lot. And Bigby is always called upon to have his say, as he revolts and grills any inhabitant suspected of collaborating with the enemy. Some deserve more than a harsh word, while others end up with a black eye when they are only to be pitied. Everything seems to fall apart, or rather, only now Bigby realizes that everything was falling apart for a long time, right before his eyes. The gap between ideal and reality becomes an immense crack as the investigation progresses. Belle and Beast explaining their financial situation in front of the painting of them rich and contented is a good example of how life works in Fabletown. Bigby records everything, but doesn't have time to stop, because events are pressing and Bloody Mary is in action. Bold, sure of her abilities, she is a presence that is noticeable even when she is not on stage. The wounds on Bigby's body are her calling card and we fear the idea of meeting her again. For once the outcome of the battle appears very uncertain. And speaking of fights, we have to say that once again we were surprised by how spectacular and engaging they are in the Wolf Among Us, and this despite the clumsy timed action system. In The Walking Dead, e.gungodly, they quickly became routine. Instead, when Bigby bares his fangs, the writers have already prepared us properly, making us feel that it is a personal matter. We press the mouse button all the way down, accompanying each blow with our minds, as if to charge it with hatred. And if we have to choose an object among those present to hit the opponent, rest assured that we will take the heaviest and most brutal. Furthermore, in the fourth episode, the assailant is demonic, so he only has to thank if he still has his head attached to his neck. Often after these moments of uncontrolled fury, when we're still drunk from the fight, the game stupidly puts us in front of a legitimate, kind request. The risk of slapping the hand they offer us is real. And once again we end up in the wrong. Apparently it never comes out clean. But at the moment of the final encounter, when we are face to face with the prey we have been hunting since the beginning, moral questions remain at the door. Because, as a movie character said: dead or alive, you come with me.", "date": "2014-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
