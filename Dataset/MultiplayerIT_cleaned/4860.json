This is the debut title of Telepaths' Tree, an indie team made up of former members of CD Projekt RED, Epic Games, People Can Fly, Flying Wild Hog and Techland: people with a certain curriculum, who however did not realize of the amount of problems and defects affecting the game. In fact, beyond the numerous crashes reported by users, which fortunately we have not encountered, this peculiar horror FPS suffers from mediocre artificial intelligence, practically absent technical optimization, basic options and, above all, the complete lack of references narratives beyond the cinematic introduction, which for a product of this genre is no small defect. The only way to get an idea of the plot behind Inner Chains is to read the synopsis on its Steam page, currently studded with negative reviews: in a mysterious world, dominated by a gruesome biomechanical technology, a Ruling Caste has reduced the people into slavery by enforcing the worship of dark deities. As an ordinary person, we are offered as a sacrifice to the gods but survive the ritual and find ourselves wandering underground, searching for a way out of the nightmare. Odds Inner Chains guesses the design of the scenarios, but everything else leaves much to be desired Monster world Let's imagine that the main objective of an independent production, even more so considering the refund policies offered by Steam, is to look for a start with a bang, a preliminary phase that immediately drops the player into the action after having communicated some simple rules of basis. Inner Chains does none of this, wasting the entire first chapter of a campaign that lasts about four hours making us meander through the scenario in a tediously slow way, without any possibility of interaction, much less engaging in combat. After the ~sacrifice~ sequence and some disappointing bare-handed clashes, undermined by an approximate collision detection to say the least, we finally get hold of our first weapon, a sort of electric rifle. We will be able to use it, taking care to avoid rapid overheating, to eliminate human beings reduced to slow and pathetic zombies, who crawl in our direction waiting, and perhaps hoping, to be freed from their suffering. Soon the experience reveals its own puzzle soul, with gruesome human-faced switches that must be activated to make certain electric barriers turn off or on, allowing us to pass and proceed to the next area, possibly indicated by the fluttering of pollen from by plants scattered along the way, sometimes next to monstrous living checkpoints. In short, there is no doubt that the artistic direction signed by Tomasz Strzalkowski properly exploits the ~bestiary~ deriving from the very evident inspiration from Giger's works, but this goal unfortunately remains an end in itself, given that all the rest leaves much to desire. Arms and baggage The world of Inner Chains is as dangerous as it is horrifying: around the levels there are plants that attack those who pass by them, sewers on the ceilings that release poisonous bombs, huge molluscs that grab from above those who are foolish enough to walk where they fall their slime and large eggs that contain creatures capable of launching lethal fireballs. We therefore proceed slowly, although our character can run for some stretches, trying to reach stone tablets in each scenario that unlock letters of the alphabet and allow, at a certain point, to decipher the code that characterizes all the engravings present on the walls. To find them, it is often necessary to interface with devices, which are also biomechanical and disgusting, which wrap around our faces, providing us with a vision of an area we need to reach. Then there are the enemies: not only the pathetic zombies we have already talked about, but also guards belonging to the Ruling Caste, mutants, hellhounds and the most lethal type of all, the ~tanks~, which must be eliminated by blowing up the cylinders that carried on their backs or trying to inflict a lot of blows on them. The approach to combat is very different from that of shooters like DOOM or the classic Painkiller, to stay on the horror theme: the opponents are generally few and should be feared, as they are capable of killing us with a few well-aimed shots. To recover vital energy, indicated on a bracelet welded to the protagonist's wrist, we will have to stop at special devices (yes, even heregruesome esti) that can be exploited only once and that replenish our health, as well as the ammunition of one of the three weapons that we will be able to use during the campaign. In addition to the electric gun, we will in fact be able to hold a flamethrower and a dart-shooter: the first is by far the most effective tool against enemies, who roast when exposed for a few moments to the heat jet, while the second comes in handy for precision shots (for example to hit the tank backpack), even if the almost invisible reticle and the impossibility of aiming makes this operation really complicated. For each weapon we will also find a single-shot alternative fire device, respectively an electromagnetic sphere, a real fireball and a sort of projectile that releases poison on impact. Cross above As mentioned at the beginning, Inner Chains suffers from very evident problems regarding the artificial intelligence of the enemies. Beyond their poor ability to identify us, if not a few meters away, the opponents are themselves subject to the attack of the ~plants~ we have described, so much so that in certain situations it reaches the absurd: just wait a few seconds because the guards are automatically eliminated by their own traps, triggered during the inevitable patrol. As for the attack patterns, only that of the ~zombies~ is credible, as creatures without intellect and moved only by instinct, while for the rest there are only simplistic charges with the head down. Either due to the presence of a good number of checkpoints, or due to the limitations of artificial intelligence, the degree of challenge of the game is absolutely trivial and only in the final stages do we run into a minimum of tension, when perhaps our vital energy has been tested and ammunition is running low. Fortunately, however, the possibility of resorting to the horrible melee of the very early stages is averted by the possibility of opening fire even when the indicators are at zero, sacrificing a little health. However, the last battle takes care of the final blow to the general design of Inner Chains, a boss fight that we suspect is afflicted by some sort of bug: after destroying the first ~hot spot~ of the enemy, it was not absolutely clear to us what should be done to cause him further damage, and so we tried for several minutes to experiment in vain... until, hopping, we managed to end up on the wall that separated us from the final sequence of the campaign. Yes, even that rather disappointing. To all the problems listed so far is added the technical framework: although the game world has its own reason and offers some suggestive glimpses at certain times, the assets seemed generic to us, the polygonal models dated and the direction also very approximate. Very few options are available for the graphics, practically none for the controls (the sensitivity cannot be adjusted, nor is it possible to invert the Y axis on the controller), but it is the optimization that is really missing: on our configuration we had to settle for play at 30 frames per second at 1440p, where titles like Gears of War 4 score exactly double with graphics that are nothing short of more complex.", "date": "2017-05-23", "grade": "4.0"}
