{"name": "Un sandbox decente su Wii U?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152886-cube-life-island-survival-un-sandbox-decente-su-wii-u.html", "text": "One of the biggest shortcomings of the Wii U line-up and of Nintendo consoles in general is represented by the lack of Minecraft, Mojang's sandbox which, released in 2009 as a very simple indie work by a single person, has become over the years the most sold of the story on PC, also greatly appreciated on Sony and Microsoft consoles. Many have come forward in an attempt to fill this absence, but between miserably failed Kickstarter campaigns and not exactly excellent products, the landscape was quite desolate. Until now, because Cube Life: Island Survival of Cypronia, although it sports a number of defects, it does not lack interesting ideas that we are now going to analyze. Cube Life: Island Survival is the best Minecraft alternative you can play on Wii U Cast away From Minecraft, Cube Life not only takes the basic concept but also the graphic style in which all the elements are represented by means of one or more cubes, each of which moreover presents entirely pixelated textures, of those which, to be clear, characterized the games of the 32-bit era, and the fundamental division - of course, Minecraft has many more - in a completely free creative mode and survival. The latter in particular even offers us an outline of the plot, with the anonymous character we play telling us his sad story: a millionaire and owner of a splendid villa, during a journey he finds himself shipwrecked on one of the many islets of a desert archipelago. This already introduces an important difference with the reference point of the genre: instead of a huge mass of land, here we are dealing with many islets (think of The Wind Waker) between which it is possible to move initially only by swimming, stationary provided that, in full respect of the spirit of the game, further on you will certainly be able to build your own means of transport or even modify the aspect and the very nature of the atoll. Without any means of support, therefore, we must first of all get something to drink and eat, with the voice of the protagonist who, as a tutorial, explains how to do it, making the task relatively easy. However, we begin to notice a problem with the product, related to the control system and more precisely to inventory management: theoretically, acting with the usual GamePad stylus and touch screen combo, there would be no difficulties, but the title is clearly designed to be tackled in traditional way, with the buttons and looking at the TV, and in this case going to select the object we need each time can be a bit slow and irritating. Nothing serious in a calm situation, more problematic in other situations: Cube Life is in fact equipped with a convincing day/night cycle, and if in the sunlight you have to basically only look at the animals you want to feed on, under cover of darkness they jump out a whole host of ferocious and ravenous creatures. Don't expect, unless you have managed to build yourself weapons of a certain power, to be able to face them all night long; much better to build a shelter in which to be relatively safe. But this essentially means two things: one, that you will have to spend a large part of your day procuring those basic means of sustenance that will allow you to face the long hours of the night without dying of starvation when instead you would like to explore, experiment and build (the exploration is very pleasant and the crafting system intuitive and exhaustively explained in one of the various menus), and two, that for at least half of the game you will find yourself staying in the shelter waiting for the sun to rise, doing practically nothing. The Cubist period In creative mode, however, you can freely and quietly - there are no dangers whatsoever - dedicate yourself to forging the world that best suits you. As in all games that include a free mode and another with one or more objectives, for some this will be the main option, for others a sort of training useful for mastering all the main constructs, first of all that of crafting. This, as we mentioned above, is quite intuitive especially for those who have already dealt with that of Minecraft or other epigones, and in any case it is sufficiently explained in the pause menu and also during uploads, which are one of the notes mourners of Cube Life. Long in the order of a minute or so, fortunately they are not very frequent unless you die often (which at least during the first few games is quite inevitable), but they contribute to breaking the rhythm of a game that is already suffering, in Survival mode, of the boredom resulting from the quasi need to do nothing during the night. All this is presented, as we said, with graphics that closely resemble Markus Persson's game, to which no notes of any kind can be moved given its peculiarity, but which the Wii U manages to manage easily. However, some effects used clash, and in a positive way - the management of the light in particular comes to mind - which are instead very realistic and well made, and create a pleasant contrast with the rest of the visual sector. Even the sound is basic but without peaks of any kind, except for the speech: often we will in fact hear the voice of our otherwise unidentifiable avatar, and if for the dubbing (all in English as well as the texts on the screen) it is not sure a professional was employed, at least you can reward the dedication of the small development team. In short, as we will elaborate in the comment, Cube Life: Island Survival with its innovative ideas and its defects is proposed as an at least decent clone of Minecraft, which however becomes attractive on Wii U given the lack of competition but also for two other characteristics to report , namely the very low price and Cypronia's promise to keep it constantly updated.
