{"name": "Luxor Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/luxor-quest_a.html", "text": "The puzzle game genre, as we know, consists more of ~clones~ than of original products. In fact, creating a title from scratch that is based on a strong and innovative idea has become increasingly difficult over the years, above all because there is still competition from timeless classics such as Tetris, Blockout, Puzzle Bobble, etc. It is clear that faced with such a demanding challenge, many developers decide to take the path of ~citation~ and remakes. Luxor itself, originally released for PC in 2005, is nothing more than a clone of the previous Zuma, since it shares its rules and structure: ~fixed~ stages within which a small group of colored spheres moves, which we must first eliminate that the journey comes to an end. In the case of Luxor, the device we control is located in the lower part of the screen, it can shoot colored spheres that appear randomly on its ~cannon~ and it must possibly take advantage of the presence of ~banks~ which make the shot bounce if necessary . The game has a single mode in which we will face the thirty stages available one at a time, eliminating the colored spheres as they move along their path. This path will almost never be linear or fully visible: as we progress through the levels, the locations will become increasingly tangled and to hit the spheres we will have to take advantage of the instants in which they become visible, as well as calculate the arrival time of our shot . As mentioned above, sometimes there will be extra elements to represent a ~bonus~ or a ~malus~: banks that make our shots bounce, obstacles to destroy and so on. In more advanced stages, the rows of spheres will become really long and fast, and will multiply to increase the difficulty. At our disposal we will only have the possibility of changing the sphere ~in the barrel~ with the one immediately following it, as well as a series of power-ups that can slow down the scrolling of the spheres on the screen or even make them proceed backwards for a few seconds. Landed hits can create spectacular combos that are worth the unlock of ~achievements~ shown on the main screen. Compared to the previous episodes, Luxor Quest offers us greater freedom of action: our device can move beyond the boundaries of the stage, scrolling the background to the right or left, and we can control it simply by pressing the left / right keys of the d-pad, while the 5 key is used to shoot a sphere and the 0 key to replace it with the next one. Although it is a puzzle game, the developers of the MumboJumbo team have done an excellent job as regards the creation of the stages, made up of really detailed and well-made images, with an excellent use of colours. The spheres themselves are not limited to being colored differently, but have some interesting decorations. The special effects and combos have been rendered very well, and side scrolling of the stage is quite fluid. The sound consists of excellent quality MIDI music, which accompanies the action in the best way and without disturbing; pity only for the lack of an independent volume control. PRO Excellent quality of the bottoms Good number of internships Playable and fun AGAINST The game mechanics are the same as always", "date": "2009-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
