The Milanese company tries again, after an ups and downs first chapter comes the new update of the racing game fully licensed by the WRC league. This guarantees the possibility of competing on absolutely real circuits, competitions and cars, certainly excellent news for all fans of this sport. The menus are minimalist, a choice that goes against the current standards, on the other hand the icy atmosphere and the pleasant acid jazz music immediately push you to deepen the playful contents, and luckily there is certainly no shortage of these. Milestone indulged itself by proposing numerous modes, from the Rally school, which like last year offers specific tests to overcome, to timed races, up to single races and the flagship represented by the main career, ~The road to WRC ~. It goes without saying that this is where we will invest most of our time. To begin with, we have to worry about the management of our team, hiring the various team members who are responsible for improving the performance of our cars. A very interesting feature is the management of growth of our digital identity, structured with a system very similar to the levels of RPG characters. Concluding the races under the scheduled times leads to a significant increase in accumulated experience points, these needless to say increase our skill level, allowing us to purchase more performing cars, and new components for the inevitable tuning phases. There is also the virtual money to win but above all to spend for all the needs of the case, and the possibility of signing contracts with sponsors to accumulate even more points. Negotiations take time, especially at the beginning, when our low notoriety isn't exactly the ideal calling card. Looking at the great masters We are facing a system that looks to other productions (see Gran Turismo 5) but which proves to be surprisingly satisfying and intuitive in its simplicity, the crucial options are turned on from time to time based on the player's actual resources, in order to facilitate soon the management phase. The difficulty curve is decidedly soft, not to mention forgiving, so that the first few races can be tackled with total carelessness, but continuing in the championships it becomes inevitable to understand and exploit the mechanisms of the gradual mosaic of options that open up to the player. The fact remains that WRC 2 proves to be very lenient in forgiving even quite serious mistakes, and it is not difficult to place yourself in a dignified position after questionable races, thanks to the introduction of the Rewind which we will discuss later. Particularly useful is the possibility of choosing whether or not to activate the driving aids through three distinct configurations, in order to meet the needs of each player. Personally we found ourselves very well with the intermediate one, an excellent compromise between simulation and arcade immediacy, but it is understood that purists should go directly to the latter. The cars offered by the game are really many, from WRC to SWRC, including the legendary Group B supplied as standard, and like the previous edition, purchasable liveries are available to customize our racing cars. Matter of abundance! Once on the track, the excellent work done by Milestone in terms of playability is evident. The driving system turns out to be decidedly fun for how it manages to capture the simple essence of the Rally, or rather a challenge against time aimed at reaching the check point. A triviality that is not at all obvious when it comes to a videogame transposition, but in the case of this WRC 2, the right strings have been struck, so as to bring to mind great classics of the past, and sorry if it's not much. The car responds promptly to the commands, without giving the uncomfortable sensation of the ~bar of soap~ effect, while the drifts elicit more than a scream of exaltation, especially when the handbrake system is included, as indeed suggested several times from the game itself. Continuing the referential work, the Rewind option already seen in Dirt and Forza Motorsport is present, meaning that we have five attempts per race to roll the scene back in an attempt to remedy their mistakes. It is sufficient to press the Y key on the pad to activate the routine, implemented in a really excellent way, even if its presence will make someone turn up their noses. Another surprising element is the amount of circuits available, dizzying to say the least. Let's talkof about fifteen different settings, each of which boasts dozens of variations. With an approximate calculation you can easily exceed a hundred total routes! As if that weren't enough, all this abundance never leaves room for monotony, one of the greatest advantages of this production is precisely the track design, well implemented and conceived in a typically ~playful~ perspective. The road is almost always wider than real competitions, in the same way the situations are extremely varied, around every bend there is something new ready to capture the attention. It runs on mud, dirt, asphalt and snow, from Mexico to Sardinia, there are finally the super special stages and space is even given to entirely city routes. Xbox 360 goals WRC 2 presents the classic 1000 player points divided by a total of 50 objectives, the most substantial obviously requires you to complete the ~Road to WRC~ mode, for 100 points. Note the hilarious titles used, impossible not to mention the musical ~Rotolando verso sud~ which speaks for itself and gives 10 precious points. ~Great Jupiter!~ it requires at least one upgrade of the car, as long as you don't expect to send it on a time blast! ~El Mariachi~ refers to a particular operation to be carried out in Mexico, finally ~Spectral Apparition~ requires the upload of one's ghost in the online rankings. Are you OK? The graphics engine has improved compared to the progenitor, but is still too backward compared to the competition. Among this it is impossible not to include the direct opponent, Dirt 3 by Codemasters, in comparison with which WRC 2 shows its side on various occasions. If we exclude some appreciable particle effects, the framerate anchored to 30fps and the warm color palette, the certainly not exciting resolution, the poor quality of the textures and the shortage of the polygonal mass leave a bad taste in the mouth. Particularly unpleasant is the pop-up of the shadows, present in a continuous and suffocating way. The physics is limited to the damage to the bodywork and some raids on the fences at the edge of the track, but it is enough to move away a little to be cruelly teleported to the main path. It is true that the number of circuits on offer is far beyond any racing title of this generation, but greater attention to detail would have been desirable to be technically competitive. The audio part, on the other hand, is excellent, with well-sampled noises, even if not very deep, and a co-driver who is always clear and willing to encourage us, obviously all in Italian. The online side has the same completeness already ascertained in the career, the possibilities are really many, from multiplayer games to updated rankings, the possibility of playing against a friend locally, alternating sessions for the best time, is also appreciable. In short, there is little to complain about, it remains only to hope for the low incidence of lag when the servers are made accessible, since the game calculates the ghosts of the opposing cars. Let's spend a final word on the menus, which seem to suffer from an intermittent response delay, which makes navigation rather tiring. A minor issue, but hopefully fixed through a patch.", "date": "2011-10-13", "grade": "7.7"}
