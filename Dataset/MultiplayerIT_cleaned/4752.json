{"name": "Death Squared", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186620-death-squared-death-squared-compagni-di-morte.html", "text": "There is excellent humorous potential to be exploited in the cold world of science and artificial intelligence, if you have the right inclination, and from Portal onwards a sort of trend has started that has played on the cynicism and absurdity of certain experiments ends in themselves to put together a vision that is both funny and terrible of technology and scientific research. Death Squared fits into this imaginary fact of cruel tests and heinous deaths, all in honor of unidentified tests carried out by an employee called David hired by the mysterious company Omni-corp. Pressed by his work computer Iris, equipped with a biting artificial intelligence, David must complete 80 tasks focused on intelligence by solving environmental puzzles involving the simultaneous use of two working robots within strange and intricate environments. The structure of the game follows a rather schematic setting, but the apparent coldness of the graphic style adopted and of the theme dealt with is tempered by the underlying humour, constantly supported by the ironic dialogues between David and Iris, which in addition to providing vague indications on the narrative substrate background they comment sarcastically on the successes and the (many) failures that are staged on the screen, while trying to understand precisely how to maneuver the two cubic robots avoiding making them end up in the most atrocious ways. As already evident from the title, ~death~ is an element that is always present throughout the game, even though it is in truth the destruction of the two automatons: not only the slightest mistake is severely punished, but also the search for the solution necessarily passes through a first trial period which inevitably leads the two poor robots to fall, explode or destroy themselves in various ways. In short, frustration seems to be an integral part of the gameplay in Death Squared. Concerted action It is therefore a matter of guiding these two cube-shaped robots (or more, in the case of multiplayer for more than two players) within labyrinthine levels made up of blocks suspended in the air, trying to reach their arrival point. Playing alone, the control system closely resembles that seen in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, with the two sticks controlling the two robots independently. The puzzles are structured in such a way as to require coordinated action between the two, who therefore find themselves having to move simultaneously or in turns according to precise patterns, so as not to run into the traps scattered throughout the levels. The alternation in the use of the two is fundamental and plays on the chromatic elements: for example, the red turrets can damage only the blue robot and vice versa, just as the blue transparent cubes can only be trampled on by the red robot and vice versa, furthermore the pressing some boxes can trigger opposing traps or transport mechanisms, all situations in which it is necessary to understand the order in which to move the two characters and the precise maneuvers to be carried out. All this leads to planning a careful mixed and perfectly coordinated use of the two robots in order to reach the conclusion of the levels, even if in some cases the solution can arrive in a somewhat random way and in others one gets the clear impression of being able to force a not exactly orthodox solution to reach the conclusion. In some ways, the structure is also reminiscent of the excellent SnipperClips, in particular when playing cooperative multiplayer with two players, given that in single, unlike the SFB Games title, here we find ourselves having to move the two protagonists even simultaneously, performing different movements with the two analog sticks. The similarity, however, appears evident in the case of multiplayer with two or more players, in which the fun increases with the need to agree by shouting instructions to each other and laughing at every end unworthy of the poor robots, thus also diluting the sense of frustration that individual often tends to emerge, perhaps after numerous attempts gone wrong. Between joy and anguish Death Squared abandons any graphic refinement to focus entirely on functionality, staging levels composed of simple metal blocks and a few aesthetic frills to revive the environment and relying on the audio support provided by the pressing dialogues between David and the artificial intelligence to give character to the All. The beginning is enthralling but we are quite far from the characterization peaks of Portal and the humor present is not always able to dilute a certain monotony and frustration that can emerge from the structure and the chosen setting. However, they are notedor some objective problems, such as the imprecision that can derive from the perspective of the fixed shot, which sometimes hides some elements or makes it difficult to evaluate distances perfectly. However, the response to the commands is always quite precise, a fundamental element in a game of this kind, and the level design alternates somewhat obvious solutions with some truly ingenious tips, making however the achievement of the conclusion of the levels always a conquest capable of giving great satisfaction. Certainly the repetition of the scenographic elements and in part also of the gameplay solutions can lead to a physiological sense of monotony, also given the poor sense of progression given by a story that always remains on the sidelines of the action, being a real puzzle hard and pure, but if you don't overdo it with the puzzle doses this is a game that can go on for a long time. The extra weapon of this version, which arrives four months after the others for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in order not to fall into repetitiveness, comes once again from what is then one of the peculiar characteristics of Switch: the multiplayer immediately and everywhere. Beyond the easy slogans, also in this case the ~on the go~ multiplayer is able to give new life to a game that could bore those less inclined to the classic puzzle, starting a lively game session at any time and situation cooperative.", "date": "2017-07-30", "grade": "7.7"}
