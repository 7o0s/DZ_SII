{"name": "Star Wars Battlefront 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-battlefront-2-recensione.html", "text": "We continue where we left off, an extraordinary setting, which only the infinite universes of Lucas can give, and all the vehicles, the characters, the planets so dear to fans of the saga. The big problem of a sequel, as already mentioned, in addition to the fact that it is difficult to leave gamers stunned is the fact of necessarily having to improve what has already been seen up to that moment. Star Wars Battlefront 2 didn't convince us to the end, some problems have been solved, but this will hardly be the game that will captivate all the millions of Star Wars fans. Offline play is divided into three main types: Rise of the Empire, Galactic Conquest, and Instant Action. The latter simply allows us to quickly start a battle of our choice, catapulting us onto some ~hot terrain~. With the Rise of the Empire we will be able to retrace the history of the conquest of the power of the empire. The Rise of the Empire, which is the real novelty of Battlefront 2, puts us in the shoes of the 501st legion of clone infantry grappling with many battles and different objectives. It starts with a simple tutorial on Geonosis and then takes us on a journey across the galaxy. The whole story is told to us through the eyes of a clone soldier, and we must recognize that this particular campaign works very well not only as an introduction to the main mechanisms of Battlefront 2, but also as a stand-alone ~experience~. In fact, the more or less hidden sub-plots in the Ascent are very interesting: the crazy ideas of the supreme chancellor Palpatine, the secrets hidden by the Jedi and the absolutely too devoted nature of all the clones. The Rise of the Empire is the real novelty of Battlefront 2 However, the main mode remains the Galactic Conquest, which has been expanded and marked by greater freedom, in which through strategic moves we will have to try to take control of the galaxy, starting with only two planets and a fleet. There are four galactic configurations, one for each of the four factions: the birth of the Rebellion, the uprising of the Confederacy, the sovereignty of the Republic and the dark reign of the Empire. Both main modes are based on the same game scheme already present in Battlefront and that is to occupy the command posts as quickly as possible. The command posts are fundamental strategic objectives for the development of the mission, which will see us reborn if killed, also allowing us to change character class; moreover, the reinforcements will always arrive in the vicinity of these tactical positions, so if our team has control of the greatest number of these areas, little by little the enemy will find himself crushed by the lack of reinforcements. Simple but effective as a game system, capable of giving a bit of strategy to a very frenetic shooter. Let us also consider that the Jedi Knights and starfighter starfighters have finally been added to the countless types of soldiers already present. Technically the game is discreet, with well-made polygonal models and scenarios that carefully recreate the landscapes already known and appearing in the Lucas saga, all this, added to the excellent music and film clips that ~air between a mission and the other, does nothing but communicate a feeling of constant dj vu, certainly exciting but a bit tiring in the long run. It would have been better to also include some unpublished levels, on some unknown planet, at least to get out of the routine. The control system is well structured, it is possible to play in third person or, by pressing the right analog stick, quickly switch to a view over the left shoulder of our character. Driving the Jedi and special characters like Han or Luke gives a lot of adrenaline, the space battles are less pleasant in which the comparison with the Jedi Starfighter arises spontaneously, the targeting system works quite well even if it is the whole thing that gives too much an idea of chaos; in online multiplayer then things get considerably complicated due to an always persistent lag and servers that are not up to par. Online games are available on all three platforms: on Xbox, up to 32 players, on PlayStation 2 with 24 players connected simultaneously and on Personal Computers. The matches we played were quite entertaining, but spoiled by the presence of too heavy a lag, even greater on the Xbox Live circuit than on the Sony network. The split screen games, provided for in both versions, are almost more interesting. Instead, the PC version deserves a separate discussion, which is the one that performed best online, being able to take advantage of aa network of better servers and thus offering a better gaming experience, not great but still satisfying. Comment Starwars Battlefront 2, it is useless to deny it, has left a little bitterness in our mouths. Just as the first episode of the series made us rejoice, really being what all Star Wars fans have been waiting for, so this sequel fails to repeat its success. The reasons? Basically the fact that the game doesn't feature anything new that is really worth playing. Certainly the inclusion of the Jedi and the Starfighters are a nice thing, but a little too little for those who have already played the first episode. Let's not talk about the technical part which, if discreet in the single player, suffers a lot once landed in the online world, wasting the gaming experience. However, it remains a recommended title for those who have not tried the previous episode and want to try their hand at this shooter set in the Star Wars universe. Pros Rise of the Empire Star Wars comes out from every angle The Jedi Knights Cons Online overlooked Too new compared to the prequel Cross-platform The game as anticipated in the review was released on Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC. There aren't major differences between the three versions, with the online oddly favoring the Sony console and with some better graphical details and faster loading times for the Microsoft console. Technically the PC conversion is better, as well as the online game which has been optimized and based on better performing servers. In essence, the two ~consular~ versions are practically identical, while a small step up is the PC one. The sequel to one of the most successful Star Wars games lands on our shores in Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC versions, again by Pandemic Studios which after the excellent Full Spectrum Warrior and Star Wars Battlefront are trying again. Battlefront II is a sequel and the big problem of all sequels is really intrinsic in their nature, I'll come later, they can't surprise, they can certainly improve their predecessor but they lose a little the surprise effect of the beginnings. And this new proof by Lucas, while valid, does not escape this rule.", "date": "2005-11-11", "grade": null}
