{"name": "XIII: Identit Perduta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xiii-identita-perduta.html", "text": "Surely few here in Italy will know XIII, a Franco-Belgian comic book of great success across the Alps but not as popular here. After a first console adaptation dated 2003 by Ubisoft, today it is Gameloft who uses the subject to create a video game exclusively on mobile phones that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor. First of all, let's clarify that when we talk about Gameloft and action / adventure, we immediately have in mind an abused game scheme that has united most of the recent productions of the transalpine house. XIII Lost Identity is no exception, offering a mechanic very similar to the recent Die Hard or Beowulf. Therefore, the goal is to cross levels playing the role of one of the two protagonists (XIII and Jessica), overcoming a large number of enemies until you reach the exit, often blocked by a boss who requires a little more attention to be eliminated . The balance of the game is rather directed towards firefights and fights in general, even if there are short platform sections that are still quite simplistic; and it is precisely during the latter that XIII 2 shows its greatest problems, linked to an irritating imprecision in the jumps of one's alter ego which can often cause unwanted deaths and of which above all the player is not guilty. Frustrating, certainly, but all in all acceptable in the face of the goodness of the graphic system that the product can boast; intelligently using a very comic and colorful style that goes well with the subject from which it draws inspiration, Identit Perduta is a title that can undoubtedly represent one of the greatest exponents of the current generation of two-dimensional video games on mobile platforms. Excellent animations, great variety and excellent level of detail are the strengths of an action/adventure that in any case remains quite fun to play, even if it suffers from the absolute lack of any original cue compared to its many similar ones. The 14 levels that make up the adventure flow away pleasantly, both for the now inevitable variations constituted in this case by jet ski rides, but above all for the high interaction with the settings, which offer a whole series of objects to use as a weapon of offense; tyres, fire extinguishers, bricks, grenades, suitcase trolleys and so on, which can be used simply by pressing the hotkey ~5~ which practically represents the means to perform all the actions. Of course there's also a healthy amount of firearms to fight your way through, with the inclusion of pairs of uzis and pistols to take out enemies coming from either direction. It is therefore evident that XIII 2 is a good level game, which, while remaining within a path covered all too often by Gameloft, proves to be able to deserve the attention of fans of the genre. Pros: Great graphics Fun Quite long-lived Against: Not original at all Revisable platform sections Very long uploads", "date": "2007-11-30", "grade": "S.V."}
