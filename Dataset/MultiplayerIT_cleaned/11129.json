Baja: Edge of Control is available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The version tested is the one for PlayStation 3. Driving question The difference in costs between one class and another is often exorbitant, and in practice this translates into an extremely long and tedious apprenticeship, which sees us really start from the bottom and patiently face not only numerous races full of pitfalls but also one absurdly difficult handling. If in racing games the power of the cars is usually inversely proportional to the difficulty in controlling them, in fact, the exact opposite happens in Baja: the less powerful vehicles are also the most difficult to drive, and there is no upgrade that matters. Even after spending thousands of dollars to improve every aspect of the vehicle, in fact, not only will you always find yourself chasing the other competitors, but you will have to face the curves with maniacal attention so as not to end up off the road. The guidance system adopted for the new THQ title is really strange, therefore, wherever you look at it: it is certainly not an arcade, but it seems to take only the worst elements of the realistic approach. Depending on the type of race, this problem can arise in a more or less evident way, and as already said we will have six different kinds: ~circuit race~, or a race within a track over several laps; ~rally race~, in which you proceed from point A to point B; ~uphill race~, which sees us running on mountains with absurd slopes; ~free race~, open to different vehicle classes; ~Baja~, i.e. an endurance race over different lengths; and ~free run~, with customizable values. Technical realization Moving on to the technical discussion, the first thing that must be said is that Baja on PlayStation 3 looks like a different game than the Xbox 360 version. The reasons for an unsuccessful optimization are obscure, the fact is that on the Microsoft console the frame rate is fluid and constant, while on PS3 it travels on 15-20 fps with frequent drops and slowdowns. To this problem is added an almost total lack of antialiasing: there are ladders everywhere, the resolution seems much lower than the 720p at which the game should run, with the probable use of upscaling techniques, while the vehicles practically have no textures, therefore they appear with an extremely flat and unrealistic appearance. If there is something that is saved in the graphics sector, it is undoubtedly the quantity: there are really many cars and many tracks divided into various settings, with an above-average extension and practically no pop-up effects, this is a critical issue preferable to the benefit of a smoother frame rate. Unfortunately the sound sector does not improve the situation: the music is anonymous, while the effects are not convincing: it lacks the necessary ~impact~. Comment Baja: Edge of Control is a mediocre product unfortunately. Without going into the incredible differences compared to the Xbox 360 version, the new THQ title offers us a large number of races, vehicles and tracks, as well as an interesting online multiplayer mode. The problem is that everything else is plagued by various critical points: graphically it is not very fluid, the polygonal models are not well finished and have an unrealistic appearance, the driving system is difficult to master and frustrating, the difficulty is too high all beginning and strongly discourages continuing to the higher classes. The comparison between the two versions leans clearly towards the 360 version, without prejudice to the general quality of a title that fails to put into practice the many good ideas expressed during development. Pros A large number of races, tracks and vehicles Online multiplayer mode Fairly complete upgrade system... Cons ...but then the results are hard to see Choppy and poorly defined graphics Difficult driving system Everyone on track! The best aspect of Baja: Edge of Control concerns its numbers: we have three game modes available, six types of races and nine vehicle classes, each made up of at least a dozen different vehicles. Once the game has started, we can choose whether to try our hand at a single race (using vehicles and tracks that have already been unlocked), start a career or try the multiplayer mode, which gives us the possibility to challenge a friend in split screen or compete online with players of all the world. The ~career~ is structured in the most usual way: you start with some money and from the lowest class, you buy a car and throw yourself headlong into a series of tournaments in which a good placement translates into earning a certain sum of money. Money we can spend on buying a new onevehicle, perhaps of a different class (thus accessing the races limited to that category), or to enhance our current car from every point of view: engine, transmission, exhaust, control unit, brakes, tires, etc. The upgrades applied increase the power of the vehicle (controllable on the screen via a special bar) and also allow us to make advanced adjustments to the gear ratios and shock absorbers, among other things. As mentioned, there are no fewer than nine classes and we start from the small Baja Bugs (cars with less than one hundred horsepower) and then move on to the Unlimited VW, 4x4, Open Wheel, Mini Truck (with more than three hundred horsepower). and finally to the higher power categories: Fullsize Truck, Class 1 Limited, Trophy Truck and Bonus Class.", "date": "2008-10-15", "grade": null}
