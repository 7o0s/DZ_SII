{"name": "Kya: Dark Lineage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kya-dark-lineage-2.html", "text": "An adventure for Kya Kya's plot is just a mere pretext to entice the player to continue in the experience, but it's quite nice and all in all it deserves to be mentioned. It all begins when Kya opens a trunk which, for some strange reason, is connected to another dimension, into which she is sucked up together with her brother, made up of floating islands and whipped by very violent winds. Arrived in this new environment, Kya will socialize with the Nativ people, threatened by the evil wizard Brazul, able to transform the Nativ into deadly and monstrous Wolfen. Kya's only hope to get home is to recover the fragments of a mysterious magical locket, put it back together, and defeat Brazul. But someone is plotting in the shadows... A bit of everything' As already mentioned, Kya mixes a few elements borrowed from various genres, in an attempt to create a combination that is at least pleasant and above all playable. And it must be said that he succeeds, even if partially. What ranges more once in control of Kya is an excessive linearity of the progression, scanned in missions to be solved in a precise order in order to open the communication routes between the various islands and therefore move from one to another, which certainly increases the freedom and variety of play but which, however, does not eliminate the annoying feeling of being on a fixed track and not having control of the train. Things improve on the occasion of the numerous fights that will have to be faced to progress in the adventure, which will imply the use of a sort of boomerang or bare hands: if in the first case the use of the weapon will be simple and immediate enough to allow get rid of the various monsters without too many problems, in the second one the quantity of special moves that can be performed almost like in a fighting game will allow after an initial disorientation to get rid of the most difficult creatures with a considerable dose of spectacularity. The monsters, however, require precise strategies to be defeated and the Wolfen in particular, after being KO'd in punches, must be freed from the curse of Brazul. The number of Wolfen to be ~reborn~ varies from scheme to scheme and it is possible to return to the levels already covered to complete the work, in case someone had missed it, which implies, in addition to a fair amount of freedom of action, also a certain repetitiveness of the action. To break up the rhythm made up of fights and explorations, there are some very interesting arcade sections, which see Kya glide from an island by exploiting the windy currents, glide at full speed on a sort of snowboard along the ducts or ride a Jagnut, a creature vaguely similar to banthas from Star Wars, capable of trampling everything in its path. As if that weren't enough, the now much abused stealth component that mimics Metal Gear Solid and which in Kya, at least, is made well, could not be missing, committing the player to proceed along some scenarios avoiding being seen by the patrolling guards area. Lineage not so dark Strange that Eden Studios chose such a gloomy subtitle for a game that makes such massive use of sunny and bright colors, in generally cheerful (except for the canonical, gloomy final levels) and richly detailed settings. The entire graphic engine deserves applause for the realization, despite some uncertainty of the frame rate in the most agitated situations, substantially more than good, especially as regards the excellent animations of the various three-dimensional models and the expressiveness of the funny characters, whose sympathy or dislike depends exclusively on the tastes of the player who can appreciate or dislike the typically western character design that has left the writer rather indifferent. However, Kya moves in stages with a design that absolutely does not compete with other sacred monsters of the genre but which is not a pity, resulting neither excessively complex nor too easy but, indeed, very well balanced. Fair dubbing and mediocre soundtrack that does not particularly impress the player's mind, although always quite apt and never particularly intrusive. Comment Kya: Dark Lineage is a good action/game that further fleshes out the already well-stocked PlayStation 2 playroom. It is not a title that will go down in history nor a paradigm of the genre, but the mix of genres it offers, although not always totally harmonious, represents sureent an incentive to purchase in terms of variety, also considering the disproportionate amount of mini-games and secondary quests present which certainly makes Kya a fairly long-lived and enjoyable game in the long term, engaging the player for a good ten hours, between islands hunting for Wolfen or shopping for the next mission. The technical sector is quite good, with an average sound side and a discrete graphic realization even if it fluctuates in the character design a little too western and indifferent, raised by excellent animations which are, in practice, the flagship of the game. A must have if you love the genre, to try in any other case. Pros Good technical realization Varied and long-lived Enjoyable combat system Cons Too much flesh on focus Anonymous music Limited freedom It cannot be said that action-games on PlayStation 2 are in short supply, but one never feels the lack of a new and enjoyable title when the opportunity presents itself. This is the case of Kya, a game that from a distance would seem to be the usual old story made up of jumping, exploration and occasional fights, but which when tested on the road definitely offers something more, starting with the protagonist, Kya, a little girl , which contrasts with the recent invasion of anthropomorphic animals protagonists of this or that game. In this regard, Kya fishes from all sides, recovering winning characteristics from all kinds, then trying to mix them together in a soup of playful events with an uncertain but all in all enjoyable flavor. In short, it's not Beyond Good & Evil, but it has several cards to play.", "date": "2003-12-02", "grade": null}
