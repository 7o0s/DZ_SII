It's space capitalism, beauty, and the offer is undoubtedly tempting: it's about taking your spacecraft and wandering through space trying to exploit the resources offered by the various planets as much as possible, without paying much attention to ecological and vital sustainability, if not as far as the protagonist himself. The small inconvenience, in this otherwise greedy business, is the fact of constantly having to watch out for attacks by pirates, aliens and more or less organized criminals who from time to time try to enforce their own supposed control over the various sectors of space, which brings us back to the most classic essence of the video game, or rather the shooter component. Yes, because Vostok Inc. is a mixture of things that are difficult to categorize, which brings together different characteristics and genres between ~twin-stick~ shooters, clickers, management and survival, amalgamating these different influences into a whole that in the end is quite convincing in terms of balance. If you want to find a matrix common to the different souls of this title, Nosebleed Interactive is perhaps the modern interpretation of classical stylistic elements, in a certain sense: these are inspirations as old as the video game itself, having to do with space, exploration and clashes in focus between spaceships, but the vision with which all this is filtered is particularly modern, almost ~fashionable~ if one thinks of current indie trends. There's the frenzy of the twin-stick, the steady, compulsive progression of the clicker, and the tension of roguelike-tinged survival (although that's not quite the case), which makes Vostok Inc. something of a manifesto of modern tastes in indie field, establishing itself however with a remarkable identity thanks above all to its particular characterization. Capitalists on Mars Although the first contact can be rather disorienting, it is easy to immediately take a liking to Vostok Inc. thanks to its ironic and colorful characterization, and this is a fundamental element to melt the initial ice and make us forward into the maze of its mechanics. The rather inflexible difficulty level, the pleasant but very crowded menus and those numbers on prices and objectives that seem completely out of reach may discourage the novice space trader, but the hilarious consultant Jimmy, with his constant babble of profits and future prospects, good corporate policies, and ways to deal with unknown planets and alien threats, it does a great job of keeping the interest high and gradually introducing us to the mechanics of the game. It's about earning as much money (~moolah~) as possible by scattering mines and factories around the planets of the universe, going from system to system to conquer space in an ever-expanding market. To do this we must travel between planets, face enemies, destroy asteroids for extra moolah and colonize new worlds by bombarding them with structures to ensure a constant influx of money. The progressive mechanism is as relentless and ruthless as the market economy: the purchase of upgrades becomes immediately necessary to amplify the collection of resources and those prices that seem so high to obtain new structures on planets soon become necessary investments to be made to continue in our race for wealth. In parallel with the construction and expansion of infrastructures on the surfaces of the planets, the shuttle also requires constant care and vital upgrades to keep up with the threats that loom in every corner of space, with ever more powerful weapons and various improvements to be applied that require a good dose of grinding to be obtained. Extreme businessmen If the ultimate goal is the earning of huge amounts of money, which can be achieved by working on the menus relating to the collection of resources on the various planets, we must not forget that the playful basis of Vostok Inc. is essentially the twin-stick shooter. On this front, the game behaves in a manner perfectly relevant to the canon, with the shuttle to be guided through the left stick and the fire to be directed with the right stick. The control is not very comfortable through the small levers of the Switch, combined with a difficulty of precisely discerning what is happening on the screen, especially in portable use, but those who are familiar with the genre should be at ease. In some cases, Vostok Inc. brings us more rigorosa to this shooter dimension by inserting ourselves within a sort of grid and subjecting ourselves to continuous attacks by progressive waves of enemies, in case we fall into ambushes. In these situations, the game becomes a sort of test of endurance which can also be very demanding, as well as in the less frequent boss fights that accompany the transition from one system to another. The level of these challenges imposes a constant evolution of the shuttle's potential and represents the main engine that drives grinding and the frantic collection of resources. However, this rigor of the game structure is always tempered by the general climate, which exploits the retro-futuristic design as a scaffolding to stage continuous comic scenes that rely above all on the caricature of extreme capitalism and corporateism. The graphic representation is quite simple but the style is pleasant, also succeeding in the difficult mission of making the various menus on which it is necessary to spend time appreciable. The mini-games inserted to break up the action are also nice, all representatives of the reinterpretations in a simplified key of various classic videogame genres.", "date": "2018-01-22", "grade": "6.8"}
