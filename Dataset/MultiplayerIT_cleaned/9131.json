It is a subject that has inspired Adams, Asimov and many other science fiction authors, and deep down there are many who wonder whether a bicentennial man or the revolt of the machines will come first. Developer Fenix Fire, for its part, used the theme as an excuse to introduce the many jumps, somersaults and battles of its new platformer for iOS devices. Roboto opens with a short sequence in computer graphics in which, after falling for a girl all bolts and circuits, the little droid protagonist sets off on a space journey in an attempt to reach her. Has anyone thought of Wall-E? Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto Between platforms to jump on, trampolines and levels crammed with enemies, Roboto presents itself right from the start as a rather traditional 2D platformer, whose gameplay adopts many small ideas taken here and there: each opponent can be eliminated both thanks to his laser pistol, or by jumping on his head in the manner of Super Mario, while at different points in the level the gravity is reversed as in VVVVVV. And finally, with a wink at Yoshi's Island, the protagonist's skateboard is able to float for a few seconds, thus allowing him to jump large cliffs and reach distant platforms. All these ideas put together give rise to a fairly fast and frenetic experience, where you hit enemies, avoid obstacles and jump on this platform or that, suddenly finding yourself upside down. It would seem like a winning formula right from the start, but it is precisely here that the game stumbles over what is its main flaw. ~Intuitive and responsive controls~, the developers assure on the App Store page: if it were at least half true, we would be faced with a fun and enjoyable title, certainly without major flaws. Unfortunately, however, the tiny size of the controls, and in particular of the analog stick, will be the main cause of the deaths of the player, who by mistakenly missing one of the virtual keys will end up all too often with falling into the void or with taking an enemy bullet in full face. Everything thus ends up becoming immediately frustrating, and the 30 levels available, with their repetitiveness and uninteresting design, certainly don't help to resolve the situation. To turn the knife in the wound there are some ugliness of game design, such as exaggeratedly powerful enemies and an energy system that is too severe on certain occasions. From jumping to climbing, from firing to floating in the air: all the actions performed by the protagonist outside of simple walking consume energy which, once finished, leave him helpless and waiting for the coup de grace. The player is thus encouraged to sip his moves, but the energy spheres scattered throughout the level are not always sufficient, and on more than one occasion you risk getting stuck, perhaps because you no longer have the energy to shoot that droid steering wheel that blocks the passage or to float over the last huge chasm. It's a real shame, because Roboto has plenty of good things, starting with the excellent graphic design. It hardly happens to see such lively 3D backdrops on the iPhone, although there is no shortage of uninspired enemies and some unfortunate juxtapositions with the elements in the foreground, while the frame rate, already a dancer in itself, collapses disastrously with a couple of applications open in the background. Also welcome is the possibility of buying new skates and more powerful guns, and once the main adventure has been completed it is possible to spend time with the three mini-games available: Bot Invaders is nothing more than a version of Space Invaders in which you can launch projectiles jumping on three switches, Gun Range challenges you to eliminate multiple enemies by jumping on trampolines and wielding a powerful bazooka, while in Ring Shoot you have to hit the target in three gears that continuously go up and down. Finally, as regards the boss battles, the nice and well-made models of the three gigantic opponents are not enough to lighten the weight of trivial and predictable attack patterns, where the only thing that increases the difficulty of these encounters is, alas, the botched control system.
