Most of the time they have rather leveraged spectacular combat skills and a roster of characters as charismatic as potentially boundless, elements that for a die-hard fan were enough to turn a blind eye to the lack of depth and superficiality of the gaming experience . With several novelties in the gameplay, an even greater number of characters and some new modes, this new Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi promised not only to be the definitive title for lovers of Akira Toriyama's magnum opus, but also opened some glimmer of hope to a much more interesting and less banal combat system. Like the anime, better than the anime By inserting yet another game dedicated to Dragon Ball on the console, the feeling is that of already knowing everything in advance, without expecting big surprises in terms of narration and presentation. The history of the Saiyans, the epic of Freeza, the saga of the androids, up to the dragons of the GT era or the enemies of the various feature films: through a thousand reruns on TV and continuous reprints of the manga, the events of Goku and his companions have been proposed and re-proposed ad nauseam, but never as in Ultimate Tenkaichi in such a credible and engaging way within a video game. What immediately catches the eye is in fact the enormous graphic advancement compared to Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast 2, with a much more lively cel-shading, more believable facial expressions and more dynamic and mutable backdrops, capable of overwhelmingly thinning the border between anime and video games. Each battle thus becomes a fantastic audiovisual show made up of chases and shots of energy, which explodes and reaches its peak in the final stages of a match, when the two fighters give it their all by showing off their most devastating techniques. Added to this are the clips taken directly from the anime and used effectively as a short interlude during the story mode: it is not clear whether Spike and Namco drew directly from the 2009 remake (Dragon Ball Kai) or redesigned all the scenes , but fans of the series can expect spectacular high-definition sequences ranging from the saga of the Saiyans to that of Majin Buu. On the other hand, the choice to summarize the events that separate the most important battles, using boring and ineffective textual summaries that the average player will be led to skip at the same time, was much less apt. Heroes from another world One of the main and most anticipated novelties of Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi is undoubtedly represented by the new Hero Mode, an alternative story that catapults the player into a universe parallel to that of Goku. A character editor allows you to create your own Saiyan, customizing more or less relevant aspects such as build, skin color, hair or tone of voice. However, it must be said that, although the developers have finally fulfilled one of the strongest wishes of the fans, the editor is still very limited, offering an extremely small selection of elements to choose from: seeing the glass half full is not easy, considering that , apart from the colors, the fighters created in this way all look the same in the end. In this mode, the player often finds himself exploring the world in search of new battles to face in order to strengthen his alter-ego, meeting the same characters of the traditional story in a rather random way, but those who are not interested in creating a My Little Saiyan and just want to play the historical heroes of the series will be pleased to be faced with a large database of playable characters from the series Z and GT. Playstation 3 trophies Ultimate Tenkaichi offers a list of 50 trophies to unlock by tackling all game modes. Most of the challenges require you to perform a certain number of combinations or techniques in combat, but there are some trophies to unlock by progressing in Hero mode, keeping the player busy for a good number of hours. Fighting game for dummies With various innovations and a series of mechanics retrieved from past games, the combat system is certainly one of the most delicate elements of Ultimate Tenkaichi, but those who hoped for greater depth of play could however be disappointed. Both melee and ranged encounters can trigger a variety of QTE offsensive and defensive able to determine the type of attack or parry. Before starting a combo, the two players are usually asked to choose a key between Square and Triangle, and if the choice coincides, the attack is rejected. It is therefore clear that once again the player's skill takes a back seat and gives way to his luck: delivering a powerful chain of attacks is reduced to a simple choice between two buttons and nothing more. As for the special attacks of each character, these can be launched after having suffered a certain amount of damage and reloading their Ki: in this case, depending on the Ki at their disposal, the defender can decide whether to block the blow, reject it or fight back; in the latter case the usual button mashing challenge will start, in which the player with the fastest finger can easily get the better of the opponent. There is also the possibility of transforming in the middle of a fight or of performing fusions between two characters, but this represents the maximum that Ultimate Tenkaichi can give in terms of strategic choices. In the story mode, traditional fights are flanked by some very unsuccessful pursuit challenges, in which the aim is to fly as fast as possible while avoiding the energy shots launched by our pursuer, or vice versa, try to slow down the escape of an opponent who tries to flee. However, the lowest point is reached in the tedious and frustrating fights against the huge bosses, and in particular against the transformations of the Saiyans into Oozaru. These apes limit themselves to repeating a few attack patterns, while after a certain amount of damage they start a series of QTEs to be completed successfully in order to defeat them.", "date": "2011-11-01", "grade": "6.7"}
