Twenty-year-old Kazuma Kiryu, belonging to the Dojima clan, has just taught a guy a lesson in an alley, taking his money and handing it over to the instigator of the punitive expedition. After having gone to have fun in a club with his close friend, Nishiki, however, he discovers that something has gone wrong: the body of a man was found at the scene of the beating, which started the police investigation and caused bad moods from part of his commanders, who have never looked kindly on Kazuma and above all his mentor, Captain Kazama, currently in prison. The boy's attempt to understand what happened gives rise to a series of events that will shake the fictitious neighborhood of Kamurocho, causing tremendous clashes that have as their only common denominator that tiny plot of land, the crime scene. What is behind this whole thing? Who is trying to frame Kiryu? Yakuza 0 tells, through seventeen chapters, a powerful, intriguing plot, embellished by an enormous number of dialogues (spoken in Japanese, subtitled in English) which provide a precise idea of the extraordinary care SEGA put into this product. After completing the game within thirty-one hours, with a completion percentage of just 18%, a rather apt comparison came to mind from a narrative point of view: if some of the most famous Western action games pose as a story, the title produced by Toshihiro Nagoshi is instead an entire book; and we have no doubt that the script written by Masayoshi Yokoyama has a few hundred pages. Also because the story of Kazuma, the Dojima family and the mysterious alley does not end on the streets of the Tokyo district, but extends as far as Osaka, where we find Goro Majima and can control him for the first time in the history of the franchise. The background of this character is incredible, as well as the tough challenges he has had to face in his life, only to find himself in debt to his ex family, with a close friend in prison and a huge desire for redemption. Yakuza 0 is a title of excellent workmanship, with a simple structure but extremely rich in content Return to Japan From a structural point of view, Yakuza 0 takes up the traditional formula of the series, the same seen in the fifth episode, although in this case the chapters of the story alternate only two scenarios and as many protagonists: the Kamurocho area, through which Kazuma Kiryu moves , and that of Sotenbori, where Goro Majima acts instead. In both cases we are dealing with fairly sized sandboxes, which must be explored by following the indications that are provided from time to time on the basis of how events develop, thus moving from point A to point B and facing during the journey (or at the its term) furious fights that refer to the classic trend of scrolling fighting games, when, for example, we come across bad guys inclined to fight. This is of course a concise analysis, because the Yakuza 0 experience offers much more than just a few walks, cutscenes and a series of fights. The narrative component is undoubtedly the strong point of the game, endowed as it is with impeccable direction, perfect timing and an extraordinary ability to carry out the build-up necessary to load us up when we have to face a particularly important duel . However, there are tons of things to do between one main mission and the next, literally a huge amount of side-quests and side-quests, as well as management-type mini-games that unlock at a certain point in the campaign and allow the two characters to raise money much faster than beating up some criminals on the street. The city that never sleeps The maps of Kamurocho and Sotenbori show the presence of numerous businesses. On the one hand, there are restaurants of various types, convenience stores, pharmacies, department stores and luxury ateliers where it is possible to purchase a whole series of objects, mainly drinks that restore energy and/or the anger bar, essential especially during the most advanced stages of history. On the other hand, there are the activities dedicated to leisure: amusement arcades (strictly SEGA) where you can try your hand at Out Run, Space Harrier or the treacherous UFO Catcher with puppets and mechanical arm, discos where you can perform in rhythm-based minigames, bars in which to have a drink or dedgo to karaoke (even there with a special minigame), rooms for Shogi enthusiasts, clubs where you can play billiards and darts, bowling alleys, structures where you can play a few hits with a baseball bat, activities dedicated to racing on electric tracks, chat clubs where you pay to talk to girls on the phone (trying to find the right topics to make them fall in love), catfight shows where you can bet on the winning wrestler or even video stores with private booths and crunchy armchairs where you can watch softcore films (with lots of of kleenex on the table). As mentioned above, at a certain point in history both Kazuma and Goro will also be able to access managerial activities to obtain substantial earnings: the first will take care of buying shops and restaurants, investing in their relaunch thanks to the use of carefully selected personnel; the second to manage a cabaret club, hiring the most beautiful girls around the city and matching them with various clients according to the right mix of skills and needs. Then there is the very rich part dedicated to the side quests, which we will invariably come across, especially during the first half of the campaign. Here too the mechanisms are similar to those of Yakuza 5 and the two characters, like good Samaritans, will lend themselves to helping many people in need: kids whose latest video game has been stolen, guys who run up and down to please girls a a little too smart, schoolgirls trying to make ends meet by selling their used underwear, businessmen threatened by thugs, even BDSM dominatrixes looking for some advice on how to do their job best. Very often completing these missions requires a minimum of memory and common sense, where we are asked questions relating to the situation, and in all cases their value compared to the experience in general is undoubted, as they add narrative variety to the package although sometimes expiring in somewhat boring sequences. The completion of the sidequests also translates into the earning of points which it is then possible to spend at a sanctuary to obtain perks capable of improving our exploratory skills, earning more money with fights, shooting for a longer time without having to catch your breath and more. The goodies After completing the Yakuza 0 campaign it is possible to try your hand at a mode that allows you to keep the progress made and enjoy the sandboxes and the remaining side missions, as was to be expected. In addition to this, however, there are also some extra modes: the inevitable new game plus, a new degree of challenge, the possibility of reviewing all the cutscenes, a mode dedicated only to fights and finally the possibility of trying your hand at some of the minigames both against of online opponents than against a second player locally. Do you want some'? We have already said that Yakuza 0 offers a rich sandbox, full of recreational activities and side missions to grapple with. However, there is also the element of combat, one of the cornerstones of the experience developed by SEGA, which in this chapter sees the two protagonists stand out for their fighting style and related upgrades. Both Kazuma and Goro can in fact use three different techniques, which can be activated by pressing the d-pad, and wield various weapons with which to eliminate their opponents. Kazuma has the ~brawler~, ~rush~ and ~beast~ styles, respectively street fighting, very fast boxing and unstoppable wrestling, the latter characterized by the low speed of the movements but also and above all by the automatic coupling of any object within reach hand: the character will fight wielding road signs, vases, bicycles or even motorcycles and even defeat several enemies at the same time. With the ~brawler~ style, the default one, he will still be able to collect improper weapons and use them against opponents, in this case also exploiting the anger indicator to create very painful maneuvers, for example a bike lowered on the unfortunate person on duty, which is finished off by jumping on him. Even more effective is Goro, who has the ~thug~, ~breaker~ and ~slugger~ styles: the first is the default one, ~breaker~ is a sort of mix between capoeira and breakdance, fast but not particularly functional , while finally the ~slugger~ style sees the character take out a baseball bat and devastate his opponents with a series of sensational combos. The special moves that activate when the rage meter is full are also contextual, so performing them near a wall will result in the criminal's head being smashed several times against the concrete and then karate blasting him, or again bombarding him with punch in thestomach. The yield of the impacts is excellent, so we really enjoy fighting, even when perhaps we would be in the mood to go around the city without necessarily running into any rivals: the clashes are almost ~random~, from this point of view, but from at some point Kazuma will eventually be able to avoid them by throwing banknotes in the air. Of course, the fights related to the main story are another matter, really exciting when, for example, you have to punch your way through the corridors of an enemy stronghold, facing literally hundreds of minions, or when you face the bosses ... which in this case are not it's a videogame way of saying. The money earned (with fights or side activities) can be invested to unlock new skills of the protagonists, therefore both unpublished attack maneuvers and an increase in the vital energy bar, or even upgrades that allow you to defend yourself more effective or make anger mount more quickly, often a decisive factor during the most complicated duels. But be careful not to cross Mr. Shakedown, a thug who wanders around the city and who can knock you down with just two blows, stealing all your hoard... Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty-five Trophies that can be unlocked in Yakuza 0, and as it is possible to imagine they are linked not only to the completion of the seventeen chapters that make up the campaign, but also to all the secondary activities with which it is possible to try Kamurocho and Sotenbori: walking for a certain number of kilometres, buy a certain number of products, win a certain number of fights and so on. The great atmosphere of a bygone era The manufacturing care of Yakuza 0 stands out absolutely, not only as regards the amazing narrative component, but also and above all for the excellent mix of graphics and sound that the game can offer. The idea of a faithful representation of late 1980s Japanese cities is fascinating in itself, but it is truly amazing to see how Nagoshi and his team have gone into the matter, reproducing movie posters, advertising signs, furniture and even magazines of the time, which it is possible to ~browse through~ during a visit to the convenience stores. And if the fictitious districts of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are beautiful to see during the day, with a good number of people crowding the streets, they are much more so in the evening, when the signs of the shops and clubs light up, composing a splendid picture worth seeing and full of atmosphere. The cross-platform nature of the game produces some drawbacks as regards the save system, which not only isn't automatic (you have to reach for a payphone to create it) but involves waiting a few moments too long, a situation in which PlayStation 4 owners are no longer used to it and that makes one turn up one's nose. Beyond this, however, the results achieved by SEGA are extraordinary and it really seems that nothing has been left to chance: even the most restricted locations see the application of a blur effect on the surfaces that approach the view, simulating the a camera focus effect to prevent textures from appearing fuzzy at close range. There is only one sequence in which the developers seem to have let their guard down, a scene involving cars and a ring road, the yield of which is substantially lower than everything else. It is no coincidence that the driving minigames of Yakuza 5 are missing in this prequel: it is too complicated to take care of that type of context on a par with the rest, but we did not miss it. The many cutscenes have been created in an excellent way and the detachment from the actual graphics engine is not striking, thanks to an excellent level of general animation. However, while the frame rate remains very solid for the entire duration of the experience, unexplained slowdowns sometimes occur during some dialogues, perhaps due to background loading. Finally, the audio sector boasts masterfully interpreted dialogues, as per tradition for Japanese productions, and a perfectly fitting soundtrack, which involves and best underlines all kinds of situations.", "date": "2017-01-19", "grade": "8.8"}
