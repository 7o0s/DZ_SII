{"name": "La recensione di Airborne Troops", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-airborne-troops.html", "text": "This alchemy of genres leads to a very immediate and arcadey gameplay which, if perhaps it will make the purists of realism and stealth action turn up their noses, will probably conquer that audience looking for a third-person shooter with some variation on the theme. Certainly, however, we cannot remain silent about some production limits such as the decidedly simplified scripts with which the enemies are managed within the map and the artificial intelligence itself turns out to be rather limited: after all, only the numerical element of the Nazis present on the screen will have to be taken into consideration to decide whether to attack massively with the various weapons available (pistols, rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers) or rather sneak up behind the only soldier present in the vicinity and eliminate him with a precise stab in the throat . In practice, saving can only take place when we conclude a mission: within these there will be checkpoints from which to restart only in that single game session and not later That Airborne Troops is a multiplatform title more oriented towards the characteristics of console games is not understood only by the possibility of using the joypad to play but also by the absence of being able to freely save our adventure at any time. In practice, the rescue can only take place when we conclude a mission: within these there will be checkpoints from which to restart only in that single game session and not later. Most PC users do not like this type of system very much. As proof of this we recall that in the various episodes for Personal Computers of Splinter Cell, the checkpoint system of the console versions (however reloadable) was replaced by free saves. The choice probably stems from the desire to lengthen the duration of the game but for this we would have definitely preferred a multiplayer component, unfortunately completely absent in Airborne Troops. War aesthetics The most successful aspect of AT is certainly the graphic representation of our war adventures. Renderware proves to be a middleware that over the years has achieved a versatility capable of giving excellent performance. Airborne Troops without requiring too expensive hardware specifications (probably due to the direct porting from the console for which there is no possibility to modify the graphic parameters if not the resolution) manages to offer a convincing visual appeal, both for the rather large settings that give the sensation of actually being in the scenarios of the Second World War than for all the other graphic effects foreseen: from the excellent response of the objects to various explosions (including sudden aerial explosions which give a greater sensation of a ~live~ background), the production of Playlogic manages to maintain good levels throughout the war adventure. It is certainly not a title capable of putting the latest generation graphics cards to the test in terms of the number of polygons on the screen and for the implementation of particular technical features but equally it performs its task very well. The sound component is much less convincing: we understand the lack of a massive musical presence for the stealth interaction, but this silence is not compensated by sound effects at the level with the decidedly excessive beat of our steps and the rest of the sounds that do not particularly shine . The most successful aspect of AT is certainly the graphic representation of our war adventures Comment Airborne Troops is an honest third-person shooter with a clear arcade setting with a good dose of stealth action and some adventure contamination that has a decidedly pleasing graphic design for the player's eye and an acceptable narrative background, even if the second war world has become a rather overused clich in the field of video games. Unfortunately, Playlogic's debut cannot be said to be free from more or less gross defects starting with a rather limited artificial intelligence of the enemies and the decidedly simplified scripts with which our opponents are managed within the map. The choice of the lack of free saves is also rather perplexing, a sort of must for PC users which had led the same episodes of Splinter Cell to change the system saving on Personal Computers. Despite all this, Airborne Troops remains in its entirety on a sufficient judgment and which will be able to satisfy players looking for an immediate action with a slightly below standard expense (thein fact, the title has a recommended retail price of 39.90). Pros: Good graphic design Immediate gameplay Good combination of stealth, action and adventure elements Cons: Artificial intelligence and modest enemy scripts Lack of free saves Below average soundtrack Second World War: a sort of panacea for video game developers who for decades (but the boom came after the incredible success of the first Medal of Honor) have been using the scenarios of the most terrible conflict in the history of humanity as a backdrop for their own productions interactive. The incipit of this review is not at all accidental given that Airborne Troops is also set in the 1940s, exactly on June 4, 1944, two days after D-Day, or the landing of the allied troops in Normandy. Our hero and digital alter ego finds himself in French airspace under Nazi occupation. In theory, American Sergeant John Welsh is only accompanying a French partisan in the infiltration by launch on enemy-occupied soil. It so happened that a shot from the Nazi anti-aircraft strikes the European and it will therefore be Welsh who parachutes between enemy lines, rediscovers the contacts of the French resistance and completes some operations against the Nazis. We will find ourselves immersed in a type of interaction halfway between action and stealth, with some adventure contamination The narrative plot then takes us to occupied France where in the course of 7 missions, we will find ourselves immersed in a type of interaction halfway between action and stealth. It would be improper to compare Airborne Troops to Splinter Cell for example since the infiltration mechanics are much more immediate and require less attention to our movements (it will be sufficient not to run and if the enemy is behind him he will not be able to warn of our presence). Furthermore, some parts of the game include long shootings more inclined to the genre of third-person shooters (the view with which we will experience the whole game) than to stealth games. To enrich the missions, some puzzle elements based mostly on switches and buttons to be activated or closed doors to be opened using keys scattered along the maps will take care of it.", "date": "2005-03-08", "grade": null}
