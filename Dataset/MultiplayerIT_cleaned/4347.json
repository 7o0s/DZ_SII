Slowly other houses are added, soon becoming a village and a first social structure which becomes more complicated up to the construction of a real city, with its chaos and its problems, but which deep down always remains linked to the ~Telegraph Road~. , heart of the human settlement like that first camp in the middle of nowhere. In The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands instead of the telegraph line there is a bonfire, because the historical dimension of the game is somewhat abstract, but the concept is similar: at the beginning there is a single man who decides to settle down on a beach, he lights a bonfire and soon begins to attract various people from the surrounding places, who immediately set about forming a social nucleus. The reconstruction of the sociological dynamics is here reduced to the minimum (very) terms, in the sense that there is only to collect resources and expand the settlement by assigning each new wayfarer a specific role within the various possible occupations and the characters limit themselves to perform the work assigned automatically, but we can find more or less all the basic elements of a strategic / management with survival elements based on the expansion and defense of the territory, simplified to best fit in the mobile environment. The activities multiply as the structures built increase, which are unlocked with the constant collection of materials, but the bonfire always remains at the center of the settlement, a reminder of the search for heat and the flame of life that drives people to unite and share efforts for the common good. The peculiarity of The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands is the fact of representing everything with a 2D side scrolling view, an interesting idea that is functional to the general simplification of the strategic mechanics, but the interface designed in such a way as to be as readable as possible possible remains somewhat confused, in addition to having some problems with responsiveness. A constant activity During the day we monitor the activity of the various workers, who automatically act according to their assigned roles by collecting wood, working in the mines or making tools, making sure there is always enough food (thus balancing the workforce on cultivation and livestock) and materials for building structures and objects. Then, every single night, the situation changes significantly: the protagonist constantly watches and participates in the defense of the village from the attacks that occur with disconcerting regularity as darkness falls. It is necessary to arm a good group of men and assign them to night watch shifts but it is also important to take sides in the first person to fight the creatures that threaten life in the village, from which it is then possible to obtain skins and useful materials. Also interesting is the possibility of entering caves which constitute real quests completely detached from the standard activities in the settlement, creating a good break in the otherwise immutable course of events and also carrying forward a sort of mythology linked to the game world, with the progressive discovery of the secrets of the titans and other creatures that make up the most mysterious and metaphysical part of The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands. With a well-trained group of warriors it is possible to try to enter these mysterious areas but the challenges within them are particularly demanding and it is essential to take the right precautions and make the best choices for the good of the community. The rendering of the behavior of the various inhabitants is very basic, but it is necessary to keep in mind the degree of tiredness and satiety of each of them in order not to run into problems, and also to evaluate their tendency to fidelity. In some cases, the game confronts us with rather unexpected situations, such as when some inhabitants decide to betray, fleeing and looting resources from the village. In these cases, the response must be ruthless as befits an elementary society of the age of bonfires, leaving us with a certain feeling of unease that drives us to always keep a high level of alert on the behavior of the inhabitants.", "date": "2018-03-16", "grade": "8.0"}
