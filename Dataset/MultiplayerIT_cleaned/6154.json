This year marks the tenth anniversary of the action adventure originally developed by Neon Studios, of course, but in our eyes such a treatment should be reserved for the classics, titles of unquestionable quality, while in this case we are faced with a game that already debut had not made a miracle cry. However, let's imagine that there are people who keep fond memories of the story of Kay, the young warrior cat of Yenching Island, suddenly invaded by troops of gorillas and rats determined to control the inhabitants with an iron fist, suppressing by violence any attempted revolt. Introduced to martial arts by his drinking master, the protagonist of the adventure will soon have to accept his destiny and fight to free his land and his friends. All with a view to twenty-five missions that take place within a freely explorable scenario, a sort of open world spoiled, however, by the presence of a lot of annoying backtracking and by a particularly problematic visual management, which no one thought to fix during the remastering work. Don't say cat if you don't have it in the bag There are elements of Legend of Kay Anniversary that make you think about how good mouthed gamers were ten years ago and how much progress the industry has made since then. In fact, the adventure begins with a slow and cloying tutorial, which cannot be skipped in any way and which practically lasts an hour, where a few textual indications and a couple of ad-hoc situations would have been enough to illustrate how the system works. game combat. Kay can hit her opponents creating frantic combos, jumping from one enemy to another a bit like in Batman: Arkham (do you want to see that Rocksteady was inspired by the work of Neon Games for its titles? But no, come on) , going around their targets to take them from behind and using a parry capable of blocking most of their shots. The degree of challenge of the clashes is not trivial and it will happen to run into game over, a fairly rare eventuality today; but in reality this is not due to sophisticated behavioral routines of artificial intelligence, but to a pure and simple matter of numbers: if more enemies attack simultaneously, it is clear that the situation will become complicated. Also and above all because of the aforementioned problematic management of the view, which does not follow the protagonist and which often gets ~stuck~ vertically, preventing you from looking beyond your nose and creating very frustrating situations, especially during the platform sections or in fights with the bosses (see the one with the boar, which you have to practically face ~blindly~). This lack ends up diminishing the minimum of variety present in the clashes, introduced by the three different weapons that we will acquire, and honestly makes it difficult to appreciate the aspects of the production that have better withstood the passage of time. Feline boredom Although the only real interaction element of the game is in fact the fight, the Neon Studios title is not expressed exclusively using the language of action games, but tries the adventure approach through dialogues, side quests, small environmental puzzles and anything else. Extras that increase the duration of the campaign, making it exceed twelve hours, but which bring in solutions that are too slow and simplistic, belonging to an era in which, evidently, the rhythm was not among the elements that the developers had to take into consideration for increase engagement. There are platforms and hidden auctions, items to find and deliver to certain characters, but interest in pursuing these things is quickly lost due to the hefty backtracking, sketchy direction (which looks all its age), and particularly boring dialogue, a testimony of a plot that knows hopelessly already seen and therefore fails to do what it should, namely to encourage us to move forward, develop Kay's skills and face increasingly stronger and more dangerous opponents in order to free our island . Legend of Kay Anniversary is a remaster that probably few felt the need for Remastered up to a point The PC version of Legend of Kay Anniversary, which we tested, doesn't allow you to adjust any visual options and simply runs at the resolution of the screen, increasing the frame rate depending on the power of the hardware. In our case the graphics era nailed to 1080p and sixty frames per second, but it didn't seem like a noteworthy result considering the general quality of the assets. The models have undergone a resampling to adapt to the high resolution, it is true, and in the same way you don't notice poorly defined textures or various ~pixelousness~ around the levels. Unfortunately, however, the polygonal count has remained unchanged compared to the original 2005 version, as well as the animations, which today correspond to those of a not particularly inspired indie production. Then there is a level design problem that goes hand in hand with visual defects, giving life to dead moments in which one tries to understand where one needs to go because one direction or the other of the scenario seems completely identical and the small map bottom left doesn't help much. The audio sector includes music of moderate quality, albeit not very original in their oriental style, and the Italian dubbing that we had already heard at the time, made up of ups and downs.", "date": "2015-07-30", "grade": "6.0"}
