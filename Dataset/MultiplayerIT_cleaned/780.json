{"name": "Dust & Neon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dust-neon-recensione.html", "text": "The mobile game market and that of PC and console games almost always run on parallel tracks, offering on the one hand experiences designed for quick and impromptu use, but often capable of proposing truly innovative ideas; on the other, more structured, consistent and, in general, traditional productions. However, it sometimes happens that the boundaries between these two worlds become thinner or even disappear, thanks to technological progress and the now surprising capabilities of latest generation smartphones and tablets; and thus also the evaluations of the critics, who move within the ambit of reasoning based mostly on the state of the single platform, find themselves suffering a small short circuit. The Dust & Neon review is an excellent example of this: the roguelite-style twin stick shooter developed by David Marquardt Studios is available not only on iOS and Android in free format for Netflix subscribers, but also on PC and Nintendo Switch ; and it only comes into its own when you put the touch controls aside to pick up a controller. Structure: far too lite roguelite Dust & Neon, the unlockable upgrades for the character Within an alternative and futuristic western setting, Dust & Neon puts us in command of a new Frankenstein's monster: a cyborg created by a (mad?) scientist and mass-produced, in the sense that at each death it can be replaced from an identical clone, which also retains the progress made in terms of upgrades while losing its equipment from time to time. Our task, in the context of a campaign that will see us explore four different areas to come to terms with six powerful bosses , will be to complete a series of tasks that tend to repeat themselves cyclically: clean up a map from the robotic sentinels that occupy it, sabotage a factory, possibly collect precious resources. Starting from our creator's laboratory, where we will be able to use the money and objects obtained up to that moment in order to unlock upgrades for the character but also new weapons that will occupy the three equipment slots (one for the pistol, one for the shotgun and one for the shotgun), we will have to go through a sort of citadel until we reach the mission access terminal. At that point we will find ourselves projected into the scenarios that form the background to the various challenges, generated by a procedural system and therefore with all the limitations of such a solution, which pays little attention to level design and soon ends up offering us paths that are all more or less the same, full of crates to open and buildings to burglarize. Gameplay: A gun that jams Dust & Neon, a firefight from cover Dust & Neon's twin stick shooter mechanics give great satisfaction when shots impact enemies and have surprising strategic implications, in the form of objects behind which our character can automatically lurk, then leaning over to shoot when the trigger is pulled left side of the controller. It is no coincidence that we talked about the controller, because despite having tried the mobile version of the game we were forced to run it on an iPad with a Bluetooth gamepad connected to the tablet: in fact the only truly effective configuration for enjoying of this trouble-free experience. In fact, the touch controls have a problematic layout, with the weapon change button too close to the left virtual stick and a very delicate reloading mechanism. Dust & Neon, the traditional factory mission to sabotage The developers had the interesting idea of managing reloading by showing the drum of the equipped weapon on the screen and asking us to press the button as often as there are cartridges we wish to insert: with physical commands this works well and you can even be quite fast in the middle of a frantic fight, while with the touch screen it is delirious and you have to fall back on automatic reloading, which however loses that visual cue and works more slowly. Obviously the degree of challenge that is far from trivial does not help, even here's an exception to the rule if we consider how mobile games usually work. It is possible to choose between the easy and the normal level, but only at the beginning of the game: if you don't want to lose the progress made up to that moment, you will have to make the best of a bad situation and collect the game overs linked to a system that puts yes available for somersaults to get out of trouble, but at the same time tends to fill the screen with enemies during ambushes. Technical realization: cute but limited Dust & Neon, ambushes present an extreme challenge, speciesplaying on touch screen The Dust & Neon graphics make discreet use of cel shading to represent an almost cartoonish style, very cute and functional to the action, also thanks to the isometric view and the possibility, on smartphones and tablets, to push the settings up to the high preset at 60 frames per second, thus enjoying a fluidity that also positively affects the precision of the gameplay. The price to pay on mobile is considerable battery consumption, but if you have to play with the tablet placed on a support and the controller none prevents you from connecting the device to the power, right? Too bad that the aforementioned procedural system ends up delivering us scenarios that are all rather similar to each other, increasing the feeling of general repetitiveness.", "date": "2023-04-17", "grade": "7.0"}
