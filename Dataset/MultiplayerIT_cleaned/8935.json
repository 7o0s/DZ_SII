{"name": "Pioggia di bile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95587-bloodrayne-betrayal-pioggia-di-bile.html", "text": "The game is available for download via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Version tested: Xbox 360Bloodrayne: Betrayal is one of the most unique reboots we've ever reviewed. Designed exclusively for digital delivery, this new product takes up the protagonist of a fantasy horror saga that met with moderate success in the last generation, the half-blood Rayne, daughter of a human and a vampire, who, due to her hybrid nature, she was outcast from both worlds, thus embarking on a difficult and deeply amoral life. That's enough. Californian developers WayForward take a totally different path from the action adventures of the past (fortunately also from the horrible licensed films) and catapult Rayne into a two-dimensional platformer with heavy old-school hack 'n slash elements, definitely inspired by Konami's old Castlevanias, exploiting the vague gothic look that characterizes the character. Professional illustrator Alex Ahad (Skullgirls) collaborates to give the whole thing a cartoonish look with a strong oriental overtone. The result from a technical point of view simply leaves you amazed, but this is an element that we will elaborate on later. Don't mess with Rayne WayForward's curriculum paints a decidedly particular team, militant for more than twenty years in productions for various platforms, among the latest Contra 4 for Nintendo DS, from which a game boss is taken which will become your worst nightmare. Bloodrayne: Betrayal is clearly a work permeated by a strong nostalgia for 8 Bit productions. As we have said, the renewal operation is exquisitely specious, recovering the sensuality of Majesco's heroine and surrounding it with very classic gothic horror elements such as abandoned castles, damp caves and gloomy cemeteries, a context is obtained that is sufficiently in harmony with the background of the saga. What remains is a smug and sadistic test of pad prowess. With an incipit as light as a leaf, we discover that we are looking for a manor hidden underground, and that we are helped in the operation by the army, support that would seem absolutely negligible considering Rayne's abilities. Our vampire warrior is able to slash enemies thanks to the two powerful blades mounted on her arms like Tonfa, she can suck their blood to regenerate and take advantage of a deadly series of combos and somersaults to overcome the most unreachable obstacles. The problem is that the fifteen levels that separate us from the source of evil are a sampling of atrocities and deadly traps born from a deviated mind. Rotating blades, missiles, sharp spikes, self-propelled platforms, ravines and lethal liquids are just a part of the sadistic level design. Even if the entire game is primarily characterized by a furious series of fights with endless legions of creatures, often of considerable size, ending with extremely spectacular final bosses. Lives are infinite and checkpoints are guaranteed by fountains gushing blood, arranged in varying quantities for each level. Dominators of Pad All this apparent indulgence is actually a warning sign on the level of difficulty of the game, challenging even for an experienced player, almost unbearable for a casual one. However, not everything is attributable to one's ability. Rayne's movements, while embellished with remarkable animations, cannot be interrupted and have a questionable response to commands, leading to often frustrating situations, the inability to duck, not being able to block and being forced into an abstruse operation for twice jump are frankly incomprehensible and put in serious difficulty in the first bars. The protagonist's energy bar drops profusely, drained by everything that moves on the screen, while the deaths follow one another in an endless cycle. All this leads to one of the most ruthless trial and error systems in recent years, which could infuriate the less accustomed, but which certainly represents a considerable challenge for those who decide to persevere. There is no lack of variety, certain parts of the game see us in the shoes, or rather the feathers, of a crow, in pure Castlevania style, others have slight puzzle elements, with switches to be activated through a laser cannon. The most problematic part is represented by the unnerving platform sections, exaggerated to say the least, which require a precision close to paroxysm and well above the efficiency offered by the jumping system. The same goes for the end-of-level boss fights, exasperating, long and to be repeated in full in the event of death. In the long run, these forced breaks risk becoming an element of rupture, the one that poressentially to abandonment due to an excess of frustration. On the contrary, the satisfaction in succeeding in the enterprise is really great, just like in the old days, but the fact remains that a structure like this is tremendously obsolete. Xbox 360 goals Bloodrayne: Betrayal features the canonical 200 player points, divided by 12 objectives. Getting them all will not be an easy task, especially the one that requires not taking damage in an entire chapter or against an end-of-level boss, a prerogative probably the prerogative of a select few. Know that proceeding headlong until the end of the game will only bring you a measly 25 points, so start looking around for some hidden skulls... Also try pressing a few keys on the chapter selection screen, who knows something unexpected happens! Animated worlds Technically Bloodrayne: Betrayal is a small work of art, often it will seem to you that you are watching an anime with splatter tones. Gigantic and beautifully animated characters stand out against backdrops rich in parallax levels, reaching the triumph of two-dimensional representation. Not only that, Alex Ahad manages to make the most of the characteristics of the protagonist, a mix of sensuality and decidedly intriguing warrior ability, emphasized by the gore rather pushed for the average of the genre, decapitated heads, blood in fleets and quarterings are the order of the day , but it is precisely in the secondary elements that an impressive care is noticed. Leave Rayne still for a few seconds and you will see her stretch like a kitten, restart from a checkpoint and you will see her sipping a blood drink sitting at the fountain, and so on. Jake Kaufman's music is functional and little more, with a series of goth metal songs evidently inspired by the Konami classics, needless to add that the quality is rather distant, even if the versions arranged with the typical 8 Bit style are highly appreciable, obtainable with a Cheat. The title does not have a multiplayer mode, but it is possible to replay the chapters to recover secret skulls, or increase the score achieved in the game chapters, in order to compare it in the online rankings.
