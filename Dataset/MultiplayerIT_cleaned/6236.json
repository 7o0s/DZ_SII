Last year it was our Nibali wearing the yellow jersey on the Champs Elysees in Paris, achieving a success that Italy hadn't had for sixteen years, after the victory of the late Marco Pantani. Like every year, Focus Interactive and Cyanide Studios try to transport the Grand Boucle in pixels, giving cycling enthusiasts the only title capable of putting them in the saddle on the French roads, trying to raise the bar of quality that has always been a raw nerve in the series. Representing a complex discipline such as cycling, made up of endless stages, many athletes and well-established team dynamics, is not a trivial operation and it is difficult to find the right compromise between the truthfulness of the races and the enjoyment of a video game. We certainly can't spend seven hours with the pad in hand controlling a virtual cyclist during a mountain stage, but in the same way you need an engaging gameplay and a minimum layering so as not to get bored. In this sense, Cyanide's ideas are interesting, but once again not entirely successful. The official video game of the 2015 Tour de France failed to make the long-awaited leap in quality Winning team Retracing the formula of recent years, the Tour de France 2015 puts you in command of a team of cyclists with the possibility of controlling one of them in person during the course of the stage, or strategically managing the team by simulating the action on the road and leaving it up to artificial intelligence the task of micro management of the athlete. This is how it is possible to enjoy the classic Tour de France mode, which re-proposes the stage race in the lead of one of the twenty-two teams entered for this year's edition, all completely licensed both in the uniforms and in the names of the cyclists in competition. The three difficulty levels, Amateur, Professional and Champion will test your mettle over the long distance, given that a cycling event of this magnitude is never won on a single stage, but on constant performance. At each level of difficulty it is then possible to choose whether to compete for all 21 stages or to select which ones and how many to go through at will. It is thus possible to focus only on the fast flats or on the climbs of the great mountain passes such as that of Tourmalet, Galibier or Mont Ventoux. In the end, the important thing will be to be ahead of everyone in the general standings, but the commitment required to manage an entire team shouldn't be underestimated at all. At each stage, based on the characteristics of the route and the strengths, we can decide whether to choose the most suitable rider among our ranks and aim for victory, or whether to face them all with the same athlete aiming for the final victory by limiting the loss of seconds and minutes in the general standings on unfavorable days. By selecting a well-trained team and knowing a minimum of real cycling strategies, it's not too difficult to get ahead of everyone, with the challenge becoming more stimulating if the caliber of your cyclists decreases and artificial intelligence increases. In the race, it is possible to give directions to one's teammates by choosing from a wide range of alternatives aimed at the individual or team result: one can talk into headphones with the whole team to call one's teammates to sprint towards the finish line or to warn the most tired not to push too much in order to recover energy for the following stages also on the basis of the individual characteristics we mentioned above. Playstation 4 trophies The Tour de France 2015 offers all virtual cyclists a total of 28 trophies, including ten bronze, eleven silver, six gold and the ever-present platinum. Like any sports game, the focus is all about keeping the player attached to the controller for the dozens of hours necessary to win a complete Tour at Champion level, take gold in all challenges and lead your team to success in Pro mode Team. Decline in performance Unfortunately, all this does not work very well, with teammates who are not always as responsive as we would like and the age-old problem of the dizzying drop in the pace of play. Artificial intelligence is a problem both in opponents and in teammates, inevitably undermining the strategic use of the title and tactical calls to teammates. To win the Tour de France, a good balance between the strategic management of the individual cyclist and that of the team is therefore needed again this year. Especially noIn the first case, it is mandatory to constantly pay attention to the energy level to avoid running dry, using snacks and making sure that we always have at least one other runner nearby to shelter us from the wind. Arriving on the Champs Elysees wearing the yellow jersey will be anything but immediate, but the learning curve isn't excessively steep and after a couple of stages spent in pointless and unprofitable breakaways, the tactics to adopt in the race become clear and the result handy. The strategy will obviously involve not only the yellow jersey, but also the other classifications such as the points, climbers, youth and team classifications, to which specific objectives are linked based on the team's ambitions. For those who are more interested in the managerial aspect, there is the Pro Team mode in which you take control of a fictitious team and its economic management. It starts with the Critrium International and the Critrium du Dauphin with the aim of obtaining results and prizes to earn money and put stronger cyclists under contract. Placing well in the standings and meeting the specific objectives for each athlete will give greater rewards, allowing us to progress more quickly and present ourselves ready for the start of the Tour, obviously also the protagonist in this mode. To close the picture there are the Time Challenges to be completed only for your personal taste. If the playful offer is long-lived and the gameplay finds an excellent compromise between first-person management and that of teammates, on a technical level the Tour de France 2015 still shows many problems both in the polygonal models of the cyclists, poor in details and with elementary animations, both in the creation of scenarios decimated by pop-in textures and pop-ups of surrounding elements such as trees, billboards, barriers and so on. Last note for the ~jumping~ public, who dodge the road in the mountain stages with improbable leaps that are almost endearing.", "date": "2015-06-30", "grade": "6.0"}
