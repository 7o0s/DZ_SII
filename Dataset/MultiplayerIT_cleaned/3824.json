{"name": "PC Building Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pc-building-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "PC Building Simulator is the classic game that can broadly describe itself: it is a PC assembly simulator. More precisely, he plays a young technician who, having inherited a repair shop from his uncle Timbo, who went to spend the last years of his life in an exotic location, must be able to make a career by carrying out increasingly complex jobs. The concept of the game is all here, but obviously in these cases it is above all the realization that counts. After the initial shock of playing a game in which PCs are built on PC, PC Building Simulator reveals its very simple structure and, consequently, the target audience. Basically the protagonist obtains jobs via email and must be able to carry them out in a workmanlike manner, satisfying the requests of the customers to the letter, with relatively few possibilities for improvisation, especially in the initial stages. Despite being a simulation, the game mechanics are very simple: once you have obtained a mission, you have to wait a day for the hardware to be repaired to arrive and, if necessary, additional parts purchased from the game shop, then you have to take the PC and place it on the workbench to perform assigned tasks. When you're done, you can send the computer back to the sender and get the agreed money, always via email. You will have understood that in structural terms PC Building Simulator is really linear and does not offer big surprises. There is the shop rent to pay and there are other deadlines, but by always doing the best available jobs, the economic problems are really reduced to the bone. The complications are all in the technical part, i.e. in the maintenance and assembly work of the PCs. PC assembly Each customer has special needs, which include all the most common cases that can happen to computer owners and which you will surely have heard of if you frequent some specialized forums: ranging from virus removal, to video card and hard disk assembly , up to the assembly of a complete high-end computer. The more complicated jobs, which are also the more lucrative ones, come with increasing character level. To carry them out you have to do exactly what you would do in reality, obviously net of some complications that are impossible to reproduce in the game. For example, if we are asked to remove viruses, the easiest task ever, we have to connect the computer, install an antivirus program from a USB stick, then run it. After cleaning, you need to shut down the computer and unplug the cables. To assemble a complete PC, on the other hand, you need to carefully read the customer's requests, sometimes very specific, other times more generic, so you need to buy the individual parts, including the tower and, once they arrive, assemble them one by one in the right order. From this point of view, it is really impossible to make a mistake, given that the system always indicates precisely where it is possible to install the components and, through a color system, allows you to understand when it is time to attach them. Obviously, as the difficulty increases, the task becomes slower and more cumbersome and, as happens in reality, it is possible to forget something, such as a connection cable or a particular piece. However, the assembly and disassembly work is very simple: just click on the pieces when they are highlighted in green to start the disassembly phase (which usually also requires the removal of the screws or bolts), while to assemble them you have to select them from those available in shop and then insert them in the right places, always highlighted in green. At the beginning you can only work on one PC at a time, but by accumulating enough money it is possible to buy other workbenches to carry out several operations simultaneously. In the final stages of the campaign, complications of a strictly practical nature also arise, which require a minimum basic knowledge of the PC in order not to make mistakes. For example, you need to know the RAM compatibility problems, or those related to the power supply of the individual pieces. These are all problems that anyone who has assembled at least one PC in their life will recognize immediately, but which can block newbies. After all, the developers have never made a secret of having created PC Building Simulator for an audience of enthusiasts, so we imagine that they have taken some basic knowledge for granted. After all we are talking about a title in which the most interesting advanced missions require you to build computers that reach certain performances with the 3DMark benchmark. The very brands of components available for purchase, almost all real, claim onesome knowledge of the subject, at least to be able to make some basic distinctions. It is a game with a gameplay designed for those who don't find this specific activity boring and therefore can't wait to spend many hours assembling and disassembling pieces, perhaps in the sandbox mode where it is possible to try many configurations and admire the 3D reconstruction of the individual components. Of course, everyone else can safely avoid it, since PC Building Simulator is the classic video game that you buy for two reasons: if you love a certain activity or if you want to gain knowledge on the subject.", "date": "2019-02-09", "grade": "7.0"}
