The various aspects of the gameplay have been consolidated and harmonized with a view to driving even in this case is very scalable and full of adjustments, able to make the management of the single-seater accessible to novices or more nervous and multifaceted for those who instead aspire to a realistic experience, to be tackled perhaps by gripping a good steering wheel. In terms of numbers, the offer is quite substantial: in addition to the single grand prix, the Time Trial, the downloadable daily events and online multiplayer (which has the same connotation as last year, but due to lack of users we have had the opportunity to test in a very limited way) in fact the long Career and the novelty represented by the Championships mode stand out. The latter offers a range of tournaments in which to try your hand exclusively at driving historic cars, for a total of twenty different competitions that are unlocked by obtaining an ever-increasing number of traditional ~stars~, supported by individual challenges that are a bit to the classic ~scenarios~, with skill tests in which you have to pass a certain number of cars, respect certain times and so on. Career pilots In short, the approach of F1 2017 is devoted to inclusion, in order to intercept the widest possible audience. Ferrari's recent successes will undoubtedly guarantee the Codemasters title excellent results in Italy, and it is no coincidence that artificial intelligence reproduces the current advantage situation of the Maranello team by putting Vettel and Raikkonen in privileged positions during the races. Having quickly exhausted the shorter and more accessible modes, we obviously dedicated ourselves to the Career, going to verify a whole series of elements that were also underlined by the game in the last edition: the lack of constraints during the initial choice of the car, but at the same time requests very different performances from the less famous teams, which will focus on the confrontation with our teammate and on obtaining points rather than on pole positions and overall victories. Structurally, there are few differences and the ~role-playing~ vision is also valid this year, which allows you to earn experience points by engaging in all the sessions of each grand prix, from free practice to qualifying, finally moving on to the actual race, completing small focused challenges on the development of the single-seater: trajectory tests in corners, tire wear, fuel consumption and so on. The experience acquired in this way, exactly as in reality, will lead the team to study engineering solutions to be applied to the car for subsequent events, but it will be up to us to choose which upgrade to build by referring to a traditional tree, divided into four areas : powertrain, chassis, strength and aerodynamics. The points earned with each victory and with the completion of the various tests will not be very many, but after all even the F1 Career 2017 aims to transform us into true legends of the top racing series, with a horizon of ten seasons during which to pursue a consistent growth. The rich side dish If the novelties of the Career focus more on an adaptation to the new rules of Formula 1, with many facets (primarily the use of engines, tires and components subject to a certain degree of wear and their regulation) which affect more or less marked on the races depending on the degree of difficulty selected, the Championships mode undoubtedly constitutes an extra of great value: a mix of really pleasant mini-campaigns, characterized by different playlists and rules. Alongside a reproduction of the current championship, in fact, we have a classic championship of twelve races, sprint championships over six events, double confrontation tours with qualifying and two racing sessions, short series with reversed grids, classic series with special rules and etc. In short, we are talking about a fresh, fun mode, capable of shuffling the cards on the table and giving us fast and immediate or more consistent driving experiences, combining this approach with the intelligent choice of a progression useful for unlocking the more advanced tournaments. The same goes for the skill challenges, inserted randomly between the races of the Career in order to increase the degree of realism and show in some ways what are the extra promotional commitments of the Formula 1 drivers between a weekend and the other. It is therefore a pity that det have not been added to this aspectsimulative cuts such as the management of sponsorships or conference interventions, but these are elements that perhaps will arrive with the next edition. Driving! As with any racer, even the richest and most multifaceted structure would prove useless in the presence of a mediocre driving model. Fortunately, this is not the case with F1 2017 which, while remaining anchored to a predominantly arcade vocation, boasts a large number of adjustments capable of making the experience behind the wheel more substantial and interesting. The same applies to both the controller and the steering wheel (in our test the excellent entry level Thrustmaster T150), even if the latter manages to really give great emotions and a sensation of top speed where you have the right setup. The visuals are not lacking, and even in this respect there is something for all tastes, in this case two shots in third person and various interpretations in first person: from the pure cockpit to the shot from above, from the absolute first person to a solution mixed in which the nose of the single-seater remains visible. There are presets (beginner, amateur, experienced, professional and elite) that globally modify the settings so as to give us a car that is more or less simple to control, with automatic or manual gearbox, variable traction control, braking assistance and so on; and the difference from one extreme to the other is clearly visible, given that with the more complex setup you often lose the rear end, you have to be more gentle in acceleration and study the circuit carefully in search of the best set-up possible. The latter can equally be customized on the basis of five presets or with targeted modifications, thus meeting any type of approach: from those who do not want to waste too much time and throw themselves on the track to those who have instead set the skill of their opponents to the maximum level and therefore he cannot afford to lose even a tenth in the transition from a tight hairpin bend to the next straight stretch. Speaking of artificial intelligence, F1 2017 performs well on this front: the opponents don't give up easily and you often have to overtake them in braking, but generally they try to avoid collisions and have the most conservative approach possible, as in reality. Also in this edition it is possible to activate the Safety Car and the reconnaissance lap, as well as make the start and return to the pits more or less complex. Finally, using a headset connected to the DualShock will allow you to ask the team for information using your voice, referring to a list of commands: a very nice and well-implemented feature. Playstation 4 trophies The F1 2017 Trophies are often based on ~scenarios~, i.e. on the completion of certain races under certain conditions, but there is clearly no lack of achievements related to the experience gained with the various race sessions, to the Career, to upgrades and victories, both those of single events and of entire championships. Glance The technical realization of F1 2017 rests on the solid foundations of the previous editions, using the Codemasters EGO Engine to provide the most consistent performance possible and an excellent level of detail. The work done on the single-seaters is clearly excellent, the polygonal models are faithful to their real counterparts, the reflections on the bodywork make their appearance and even the historic cars are very nice to look at, with the instruments modified accordingly. The first person views convey a truly enviable sense of speed and the sixty frames per second help to offer an engaging and reactive experience, always very ~readable~, net, however, of some problems that the franchise has been carrying around for a while now ': a fairly marked tearing in the tightest hairpin bends, therefore when the scenario rotates very rapidly, and evident uncertainties in the fluidity when there are several cars on the screen and perhaps the location is one of the richest ones from a visual point of view, such as for example the Singapore circuit, with its many buildings in the background. The rendering of the sky and rain is decent, but from this point of view the standards are growing rapidly and already this year we have seen much more sophisticated titles. As far as the audio is concerned, the sound of the engines seemed quite faithful to us and the commentary in Italian does a good job of presenting the grand prix, but the sentences recited by the engineer are often too ~neutral~ compared to the situations in which they are pronounce.", "date": "2017-08-21", "grade": "8.6"}
