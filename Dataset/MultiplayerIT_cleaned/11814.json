{"name": "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/et-the-extra-terrestrial.html", "text": "Everyone knows the plot of E.T., Spielberg's unforgettable film that has moved entire generations of spectators: it is that of a tender alien who is forgotten on Earth by his spaceship and who is found by a boy named Elliott, who finally manages to help him reunite with your family while avoiding the shady plans of the government on the poor Martian. Obviously this brief description leaves aside all the secondary events that take place in the course of the film, and which serve largely as a background to the over forty minigames that make up the game. E.T. It is in fact a collection of internships with the most disparate objectives and mechanics, however all united by a logic of simplicity and immediacy: in short, the Ojom product is a sort of Wario Ware endowed with a marked narrative component, represented by the cutscenes that briefly reveal understand the storyline between levels. Part of the appeal of the title is guaranteed by a respectable graphic creation, certainly not too elaborate but which still makes its own figure: the game is completely two-dimensional, characterized by an almost cartoonish style and an excellent use of color, and which it does not disdain a touch of class regarding some particularly pleasant animations. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the musical accompaniment, which rests on meager and decidedly repetitive melodies. Especially after turning off the sound, therefore, it is possible to appreciate the good quality of the various minigames proposed by Ojom: as mentioned, the various stages try to follow the plot of the film in a more or less faithful way, even if there are some obviously studied digressions to guarantee a satisfactory quantitative contribution of levels to the title. It starts with a simple minigame in which you have to follow the tracks of E.T. with a flashlight, but the imagination of the developers has really indulged: we therefore find ourselves ordering the teddy bears in Gertie's room, in a sort of Columns, collecting sweets avoiding being spotted (in pure Pac-man style), to catch baseballs with the right timing and so on, in a series of strictly one-thumb gameplay clips that defining ~immediate~ is almost an understatement. What is certain is that, like almost all minigame collections, E.T. it suffers from the canonical ups and downs, with amusing stages flanked by boring, irritating or even ill-conceived sections: but it can be said that these constitute a small part of the overall picture, for an experience that is almost always pleasant.
