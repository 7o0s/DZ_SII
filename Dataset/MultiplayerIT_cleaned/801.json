{"name": "Total Overdose", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/total-overdose.html", "text": "Welcome to Mexico! The game is set in Mexico, where we will play Ramiro Cruz, twin brother of Tommy, a DEA agent. Unfortunately the latter suffered a serious injury during a mission, so it will be up to his brother to take his place to face the crime. A small detail: Ramiro is a criminal recently released from prison, so his methods will be anything but orthodox. As you may have already understood, the Eidos product is a hybrid of various genres composed of city exploration, car driving and breathtaking fights seasoned with reckless acrobatics. Unfortunately the only prominent element of the title is represented by the missions, to the detriment of the other sections treated in an all too superficial way. Starting from the exploration of the city, this is decidedly limited: apart from stealing cars and having a bit of revelry, wandering the streets is reduced only to being able to reach various points where it is possible to train to improve own abilities and to face some sub quests. So forget about shops, girlfriends, speed contests in Total Overdose there is none of this. Then adding a bad driving system and the presence of annoying uploads present in the borders between one district and another, we realize the low incisiveness of this section in the game economy, appearing useless if not even of weight; it is also possible to start the missions immediately without having to reach the pre-established place with the car, and this makes driving the vehicles seem quite superfluous. Once upon a time in Mexico Fortunately, the lack of exploration and guide sections is compensated for by the missions, which, despite not being of great variety, are fun thanks above all to the fights. Our Ramiro is able to perform various stunts, such as double jumps on walls, deadly vaults, somersaults and so on and so forth. All these moves can be assisted by the infamous ~bullet time~ effect (slowing down), making the clashes even more cinematic. To make Ramiro even more offensive there are the ~loco moves~, special abilities that allow our alter ego to use unusual weapons: for example, a loco move makes Ramiro take advantage of two machine guns hidden inside two guitar holders, while another equips a golden pistol much more powerful than normal ones. All this happens with slow motion activated, and obviously only for a limited period of time. But don't worry, because to have the locos moves available (and earn some new ones) it is sufficient to get rid of the opponents by performing spectacular combos, which will be rewarded with the acquisition of the aforementioned special abilities. Another interesting element concerns the possibility of rewinding time (an idea taken from Prince of Persia), so as to be able to start over immediately in case of defeat. Even the surrounding environment will be useful to get out of trouble: bottles to throw, flammable barrels, but above all the machines to hurl against criminals and barriers by throwing themselves out of them at the last moment! All this is supported by a simple and immediate control system (but this does not apply to the sections where you drive), which allows the player to immediately master the situation. To help the main character there is a respectable arsenal of weapons, seasoned with rifles, machine guns, grenades, dynamites, pistols, clubs and much more. The difficulty of the missions appears overall balanced, even if the AI of the enemies is not the best ever. Technical Analysis From a technical point of view, perhaps the programmers could have done a little more. Even if the graphic style adopted (cartoony) does not require obsessive attention to detail, it is clear that the Ps2 hardware has not been exploited to the fullest: the settings appear quite sparse and characterized by a low number of polygons; even the textures could have been taken care of more, since they appear too ~clean~. In any case, the technical limits do little to spoil the ironic atmosphere of the game, thanks above all to an apt characterization of the characters. On the other hand, the sound behavior is well done, seasoned with a respectable dubbing and electrifying musical pieces that perfectly underline the frenzy of the title. Naturally the soundtracks have a Latin American background. Comment Total Overdose is a title of which only half of its potential has been exploited: on the one hand we find a lot of pure action mixed with cinematic spectacularity, while on the other hand we have to deal with driving sections cdry and flat. In short, if the programmers had completely set aside cars and roads in favor of enriching the action side (which is already discreet), a much more valid title would have come out. Instead we are faced with an overall nice game, yes, but faced with the claim to challenge the king, GTA comes out resized. In any case, if you are looking for something adrenaline Total Overdose can be a good choice, but don't expect a clone of the Rockstar jewel as such a product would like to appear. Pros Atmosphere recreated well Lots of action and spectacularity Good sound sector Cons Not excellent graphics Flat driving and exploration sections Too many uploads Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto is certainly one of the sagas most subject to imitation by other software houses: in fact, we could mention titles such as True Crime and The Getaway, and point out to the gaming public how much these video games resemble Rockstar's jewel. But until now no product has managed to match the GTA saga in terms of quality, which still remains the main point of reference for lovers of anarchy, reckless driving and actions. Now Total Overdose arrives on the market, which attempts to challenge the hegemony of the Rockstar title by offering gameplay along its lines. Will he have succeeded?", "date": "2005-10-18", "grade": null}
