However, it should be noted that the problems present in Forsaken Gods were not so much in the denaturalization of the product, but in the incredible, unacceptable and almost tragicomic number of bugs, not only in terms of playability and gameplay, but which even went to undermine the very possibility to start the game. All problems already seen in the third chapter and solved by the same user with an infinite series of amateur patches, but here re-proposed in greater numbers and more difficult to deal with. The result of this collapse was that the title went almost completely unnoticed, also thanks to a tam-tam between users which weighed like a ton on the sales and future of the entire series. It is therefore with pleasure that we welcome Gothic III: Forsaken Gods Enchanted Edition, a full-bodied patch stamped with the stamp of officiality thanks to the approval of JoWood on its distribution, to whose realization however various international communities have collaborated - including the Italian one, which has always been one of the more active. Let no one call me a hero Gothic III: Forsaken Gods Enchanted Edition picks up the story from one of the three endings of Gothic III and sees the unnamed Hero return to the continent of Myrthana to put an end once and for all to the war between orcs and humans, once again on the verge of breaking out in due to the enmities between the new commanders of the various factions. All or almost co-protagonists or important figures in the adventures of the previous chapters. Also this time ours sees himself slightly weaker than he should, this due to his latest disagreements with the great magician Xardas who, contrary to his personal crusade, drove him out of their refuge without much compliments, leaving him powerless at the mercy of a band of marauders who thus took possession of his equipment. Put simply, all excuses to justify the umpteenth beginning as a more or less simple person - even if this time we start from a level ten politician - and above all without adequate tools for the task that is entrusted. After the presentation and taken the first missions, Forsaken Gods in this new Enchanted Edition finally presents itself as it should have and as a product that carries such an honored name should: the world of Myrthana is among us again, with its fortresses in Central European style, its mountains and deserts. The settings overflow with life and details, the interiors are immense and sumptuous as never before, the effects of light, weather and water are completely renewed and able to compete with some of the most recent productions. The human models remain a little crude while the various monsters that inhabit the earth are credible and highly coloured. Above all, Myrthana is alive: she lives in its inhabitants, always engaged in some work or leisure activity, gathered around the fire during meals and peacefully asleep at night - excluding the guards who are instead like golem supervisors - always alert if anyone should attempt to steal savings and ready to defend themselves if threatened or stolen. Myrthana lives and her creatures live with her: the deer that graze the grass outside the walls, the wolves that are often seen engaged in hunting trips and even the scavengers that feed on what remains of the carnivores' prey live. And it often happens to come across real fights between prey and predators, engaged in the daily battle for survival. But Gothic is not only Myrthana: it is also the hero's relationship with his fellow men, the constant search for a trust that is difficult to gain and even more difficult to maintain, the attempt to never give one faction over the other in order not to definitively break out the war, the ultimate goal of a stable and lasting peace starting from little more than nothing. It's also the search for new teachers, because as veterans will know, experience points in Gothic are useless without finding someone willing to explain how to use them to raise skills or characteristics. And, above all, Gothic is difficult: the hero will become such only after many sacrifices, fights and battles. In the first moments he is just a warrior like many others, who has to sweat to win the title of champion of the arena and risks death if attacked by just two wolves. And it is only after several hours of play (but less than the other chapters of the saga) that it will be possible to wander freely along the paths that divide the various cities withoutmake a hasty flight at the sight of a pack of wolves or a small band of brigands. A completely new game If we had wanted to include in the article the list of all the changes brought by the Enchanted Edition, the review would have looked eerily similar to a bulleted list of data and names to the most unknown. We have therefore decided to directly insert the link to the list of changes, diligently divided by subject, and to the full-bodied game manual, taking the opportunity to thank the guys from Gothic Italia for the excellent work done as consultants in the creation of the patch itself and the commitment to translate the game and manuals into Italian. With this box we also point out that the version of Gothic III: Forsaken Gods Enchanted Edition distributed via Steam at the modest price of 9.99 euros also includes their work and therefore the localization in our language. Gothic III, on the other hand, sold for 14.99 euros and NOT necessary to play Forsaken Gods, requires manual installation of the latest Community Patch 1.74 to be playable. I am too different from your heroes Having reappropriated its identity, Forsaken Gods looks like the other chapters of the saga, although it already suffers to a limited extent from the simplification syndrome that in a few years would have affected the entire genre with the mass advent of third generation consoles: once again the world is freely explorable right away, monsters permitting, but the quests are much more guided and reduced than in the past. If In Gothic III, as in the second chapter, it was virtually possible to reach a city and carry out a whole series of missions on behalf of the minor NPCs, in defiance of the plot, with this instead the era of the main quest began, divided into various steps which only once completed will open the doors to the various secondary missions, however reduced in number compared to the past - in the other chapters one could get lost among the thousand requests, now it is very difficult. For example: in the second city you will visit you will find merchants, with whom, however, you cannot talk (not even to trade). Once you have completed a first series of tasks on behalf of one of the protagonists, the possibility will then open up for you to receive the mission to escort them to the city from which you started, where you will still have to return to report to the local lord that you have carried out the orders and receive others with which to proceed in the main storyline. In fact, there is also a fair loss of bite of the non-primary quests: if once even just having brought water to the farmers or having become champions of the arena had lasting effects on the relations of the citizenry with the hero, thus giving a real reason to perform this or that task, regardless of experience points, in Forsaken Gods we see a more linear development of relationships with non-player characters, whose number, increased if we speak in terms of screen presences, is rather reduced when one counts with how many inhabitants it is possible to have personal relationships other than commercial ones. We close by talking about the much feared bugs, or rather the main reason for the failure, at least at first, both of Gothic III and of the original of which the object of this review is a full-bodied review. Many will be happy to know that the mysterious crashes have disappeared - during the entire test session we experienced only one, definitely justifiable by the activation of a rather invasive cheat - and that the graphics engine, while not exactly revealing itself as an example of lightness, manages to handle the numerous on-screen presences and the remarkable graphic effects without frame drops or excessively intrusive jerks; although some slowdowns may occur during travel, moving from one location to another, due to the continuous loading of the details of the environment. Also noteworthy is the excellent combat system, perhaps one of the most successful aspects of the patch. Enemies now act in groups, so while one of them stands in front of the hero in guard position, the others swarm around him hitting him from both sides (it is highly recommended to autosave very often). The aiming routine of the shooters is also good, now fewer snipers than in the past and reluctant to shoot if at risk of hitting their allies. And of any companions, able to engage the opponent with ability, more faithful in following the protagonist and above all less inclined to attack anything that moves within a radius of 20 meters, ruining tactics of circumvention or simply lengthening a journey infinitely by killing any animal encountered along the way.", "date": "2011-03-31", "grade": "8.2"}
