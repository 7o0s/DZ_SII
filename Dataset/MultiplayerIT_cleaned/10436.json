Faced with just over 700,000 copies sold on the two-screen portable, the American label was therefore evidently forced to review the plans related to the exclusivity of the product, going to make a conversion for Psp in the hope of finding on the Sony handheld a more sensitive user or perhaps simply more suited to this type of title. A risky leap It is undoubtedly and evident that the major concern linked to this porting was to be found in the passage to a more powerful hardware, but at the same time without that touch screen control system often and willingly used in an intelligent and innovative way by Chinatown Wars on DS, and which had been one of the main positive aspects of the product. The risk of losing something in terms of gameplay was therefore more than concrete; fortunately the Rockstar programmers have proved their worth again, as if there were a need, by giving life to an episode of GTA perfectly at ease even on PSP. We have already talked extensively about plot and setting during the DS review, so we will limit ourselves to a refresher; the protagonist is Huang Lee, son of a recently assassinated Triad boss, determined to avenge his death and at the same time committed to saving his own skin in the fight between rival gangs. All this within a Libery City almost perfectly replicated compared to the one present in GTA IV, except for the absence of an island. And obviously the biggest difference lies in the view, no longer behind the protagonist but positioned in a bird's eye view, not too dissimilar from the first two two-dimensional chapters of the little-known series at the time. The change of view, evidently chosen due to the technical limitations of the DS, did not, however, affect the variety of situations, events and possibilities offered by the most recent 3D episodes; for the most part, Chinatown Wars behaves exactly like a ~normal~ GTA, to the delight of fans and the surprise of skeptics. Obviously, however, it would be foolish not to make due comparisons between two versions that appeared on such different consoles. As far as the control system is concerned, on the Sony laptop there are evident improvements for some of the actions that using the stylus were a bit awkward or imprecise; we refer for example to the launch of bombs or Molotov cocktails, or to the management of some aspects of the inventory, or more generally to the immediacy for those who have experience with the previous GTAs. This is because the layout of the keys replicates in a practically identical way the one that has always accompanied the other episodes of the series; in this sense, only the never quite reviled absence of the second analog stick for managing the camera weighs a little, which is therefore uncomfortably delegated to the directional cross for realignment behind Huang's shoulders. Where instead the genesis of Chinatown Wars is most noticeable is in the mini-games, originally heavily linked to the use of the stylus and therefore less pleasant in this adaptation. On the other hand, the loading times during the saves are annoying, while access to the menus is quite rapid even if not instantaneous as on the Nintendo portable. Dealing, what a passion The contents of Chinatown Wars on PSP have not undergone major changes, even if Rockstar Games still wanted to add a handful of exclusive elements to make up for the months of waiting. These include the 11 radio stations, as opposed to the 5 on DS, and above all a set of unpublished missions that revolve around the figure of the journalist Melanie Mallard, engaged in creating a report capable of turning her career around. Beyond the actual goodness of this narrative parenthesis, it is pleasant to note how it fits convincingly into the plot of Chinatown Wars, without ever appearing as a forced addition in retrospect. For the rest, however, everything has remained in its place: secondary missions, challenges of various kinds, and above all the drug dealing activity that has caused so much discussion and which has a far from marginal component within the economy of the game. Of course, the same remained unchangedelement related to the level of suspicion of the police, among the most interesting introductions of this iteration of the series; we are referring to the possibility of lowering the stars that indicate the attention of the police forces towards us simply by fighting with the steering wheels until they crash. As far as the graphic component is concerned, Chinatown Wars was able to benefit from a pleasant aesthetic upgrade based on the greater technical capabilities of the Sony console; the higher resolution and the better management of the effects are interesting elements that significantly improve the glance, even if it is difficult to define the aspect of the Rockstar Games product as spectacular. In this sense, in fact, it is obvious that if the technical limits of the handheld were reached on the DS, this does not happen on the PSP; furthermore on the latter platform the previous of the two three-dimensional GTAs places Chinatown Wars in a slightly more difficult situation for fans of the series linked to that type of graphic style. In this sense, even the absence of any dubbing, to tell the truth the only point of criticism of an otherwise very good audio system, can make someone turn up their noses. Nothing new to report instead as regards the multiplayer, also in this case limited only to local wi-fi with a handful of pleasant, but certainly not unforgettable, modes; online elements are limited to exchanging messages, weapons, items, or locations for GPS.", "date": "2009-10-26", "grade": "9.0"}
