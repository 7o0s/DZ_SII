The sniper Karl Fairburne therefore finds himself facing a mission of very high risk in the heart of a dark and devastated Berlin, whose streets are suddenly filled with the living dead. For those who play on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, the one proposed by Zombie Army Trilogy is a completely new experience, which offers all three chapters of the series in a single package, the first two of which have been ~remastered~ for the occasion thanks to the addition of three extra characters, new animations, improved effects and the addition of dynamic physical elements, as well as the novelty of a survival-based cooperative Horde mode, which therefore develops endlessly, becoming increasingly difficult. Zombie Army Trilogy is a must for anyone who wants a third person horror shooter full of gore and tension What if I already own the first two episodes? Rebellion has decided to publish Zombie Army Trilogy in a single version, avoiding releasing the third episode of the series individually for those who already own the first two on PC. The good news is, however, that users who have purchased Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army and Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 will be able to take advantage of a 60% discount on the price of the compilation until April 3, which will therefore drop to 16 euros and change . A great move to thank the historical fans of the series. Zombie head The structure of Nazi Zombie Army has evolved from the first to the second episode, opting for a sequence of ~watertight compartments~ instead of an open scenario for firefights. The formula is quite clear and has been transported in the same way in the third chapter, which sees the epilogue of the confrontation between Fairburne's team and the zombie-Nazi troops, at this point commanded by an undead version of Hitler himself, overwhelmed by the power with which he wanted to turn the tide of war. It can therefore be said that the Nazi Zombie Army 3 campaign is also characterized by a ~horde~ structure, in which each checkpoint corresponds to the advancement of a large number of enemies and their systematic elimination, including bosses. There has clearly been the inclusion of new types of opponents, such as the armored undead and the Leatherface-style boss, equipped with a large chainsaw, but there are also more numerous standard zombies who carry a pistol or a machine gun, although not knowing how to use them. The three difficulty levels ensure a respectable degree of challenge, which in the most extreme version also introduces the calculation of the wind to compensate for the rifle's aim. However, we can assure you that already at the average level you will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to get over the gatherings of the undead during the more advanced stages of the story, and in this sense the use of the mouse / keyboard combination instead of the Xbox 360 controller (perfectly supported, as usual) can actually make it easier to land consecutive headshots and hit the weak points of tougher enemies. Similarly, engaging in the campaign in a cooperative, rather than alone, will greatly increase the fun and accessibility of the experience, especially if we choose to surround ourselves with expert companions. How multiplayer works The Zombie Army Trilogy experience is at its best when played in cooperative multiplayer, and you can select any level of the three campaigns (or Horde mode) to engage in this feature. Matchmaking on PC is fast and the options allow you to create private or public rooms, as well as toggle friendly fire on or off, but in some cases it happens to notice the typical excessive lag issues, with other players ~sprinting~ or shots that take a few moments longer than necessary to hit the target. full package Compared to the starting franchise, Sniper Elite, the Zombie Army Trilogy saga boasts a completely devoid of stealth phase approach, in which the strategic element remains but is used in a different way, for example to place mines in the areas from which we know they will proceed enemies to come and get us. Thanks to a really spot-on sound accompaniment, all growls and synthesizers, the atmosphere is not lacking and fans of 80s horror productions will have toreally what to get excited about. The feeling of being really in danger, surrounded by lots of zombies, in fact takes the tension to the stars and the gore makes the experience inadvisable for those who are easily impressed. A historical flaw for the series, however, is represented by the degree of repetitiveness of the action, and there is nothing in the third episode that suggests a reversal of trend. As mentioned, in fact, the game consists in advancing within the levels and facing explosive situations from time to time, very similar to those that in Left 4 Dead occurred when the traditional switch was pressed, which triggered the arrival on the scene of hundreds of zombies. It is therefore necessary to deal with this production aware of what it offers and its limits, which are confirmed in the collection and basically concern the close combat phases, spoiled in this latest version by some perplexities about the balance of some weapons, including the shotgun sniper when used with the short-range reticle rather than the precision reticle. On the technical front, however, the quality of the animations and scenarios is not excellent, but here too the stylistic choices make the difference and make up the picture of a passionate homage to the horror cinema of the past. Spectacular X-ray kill cams also provide gruesome detail about the aftermath of each successful hit on a mangled zombie body amidst breaking bones, exploding calcified organs and so on. On the test configuration, Zombie Army Trilogy runs at a solid 60 frames per second, with 1080p resolution and all effects maxed out. Only boosting supersampling up to 5X manages to impact performance, but from what we've seen this is a negligible option.", "date": "2015-03-13", "grade": "7.2"}
