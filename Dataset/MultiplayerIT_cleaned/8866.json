{"name": "Iron Brigade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96680-iron-brigade-soldati-in-gamba.html", "text": "The game is available for download via Xbox LiveProgrammed by Double Fine Productions, the house founded by the brilliant Tim Schafer, Iron Brigade brings a breath of fresh air and madness in the genre of games called tower defense, where usually the aim is to protect strategic points from endless hordes of enemies. In this case, however, the formula is disrupted by a strong action component and third-person view, in addition to the very particular setting, let's see it in detail. Mechs and televisions In Europe the title of the game has been changed for rights issues (the original one is Trenched), the story unfolds in a sort of alternate reality after the First World War. The events are altered by the discovery of a mysterious radio signal, capable of conferring an immoderate technological development. The two discoverers of the signal are as brilliant as antithetical minds, Frank Woodruff invents gigantic mechanical legs capable of facilitating the movement of war structures, Vladimir Fansworth, on the other hand, is obsessed with spreading the signal through television, or at least his personal interpretation of Monovision, through which he is able to build creatures with cathode ray tubes. The situation escalates quickly, and sees Vladimir intent on conquering the world with his mechanical aberrations. In the role of a brave soldier, and supported by Woodruff's impressive warship, we have to defend various locations around the world from monster attacks. To our aid comes a real anthropomorphic trench (hence the American title), the result of Frank's research, armed to the teeth and able to place turrets on the field. Precisely these represent the key point of the game, since alone it is practically impossible to contain the waves of enemies, called the Pipes, considering that many of these have peculiar attacks and are able to strike both from the sky and from the ground. You broke my turret The turrets themselves have different types, which we must make the most of, the typically offensive ones are associated with models capable of slowing down the enemies, and other totally passive ones, which however serve to repair any turrets damaged by attacks, or capable of absorbing the wreckage dropped by monsters. These objects are of vital importance, as they provide the raw material for the construction of other turrets, so their collection is essential. Once all the enemy waves have been cleaned up, we are transported to Frank's ship, a real hub that represents the most fascinating feature of the game. On board the ship, the player has full freedom to buy upgrades for his mech with the money earned in the missions, replay the old ones to improve the score or call other players to tackle the campaign in co-op up to four. Which we recommend doing, because it is precisely in this context that Iron Brigade is able to give its best. In single the situation soon becomes confusing due to the lack of a map and the suffocating pace of the game, moreover the player is strongly penalized by a possible wrong choice of weapons, a much less compromising element in multiplayer games. Xbox 360 goals Iron Brigade presents the classic 200 player points of the Arcade titles, this time however divided along a greater number of objectives, as many as 20. This is not a sign of greater indulgence on the part of the game, we are talking about a title that requires a certain commitment and skill player strategy. Completing it alone will result in a very small win, so look for other adventure companions, you will see that the prizes will not be lacking, as will the fun! Walking trenches Technically Iron Brigade is a rather impressive production for a Live Arcade, with an entirely polygonal engine and full of details, especially in the representation of the Pipes, bizarre luminescent creatures that come in various forms, up to the truly spectacular bosses. Unfortunately, however, there are some compromises that reduce the image cleanliness, such as the certainly not exciting resolution and the presence of a blur effect to mitigate the jaggies, which is really excessive. On the other hand, these tricks prevent the engine from losing frames in the most chaotic situations, and we guarantee you that there are plenty of them, thus guaranteeing excellent fluidity even in four players. Most of all, the humor that characterizes this production is striking, from the hilarious dialogues to the very comic characterization of the characters, you certainly feel the author's touch and the very pleasant sfeeling of a product that never really takes itself seriously. Longevity is ensured by fifteen missions and a highly addictive survival mode. Disappointing music, anonymous and uninspired, little more than a functional accompaniment to the action. Iron Brigade is sold at the price of 1200 Microsoft Points, equal to approximately 16. Marketplace Live purchase link", "date": "2011-12-13", "grade": "8.4"}
