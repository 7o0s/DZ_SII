The interest in the portable conversion of the latest Square Enix JRPG is quite significant: it is evident that the unfortunate Sony handheld has not yet been completely forgotten and that the Final Fantasy spin-off has captured the attention of the most than these operations usually do. Which is good, really, because World of Final Fantasy deserves all our support if we want the Japanese software house to give it a well-deserved sequel. Unfortunately our support will not be able to save the Sony portable console, but for its owners this could be a magnificent swan song... The PlayStation Vita version of World of Final Fantasy is suitable for those who prefer portability PSVita trophies You will have to unlock 34 bronze, 12 silver and 2 gold trophies to earn the platinum one, but the undertaking will be more difficult than it seems: you will have to complete every mini-adventure, find every chest, imprint every mirage and, in general, thoroughly eviscerate World of Final Fantasy. The world of mirages For those who missed the review of the PlayStation 4 version or our insights, it is fair to remember that World of Final Fantasy is a spin-off, that is, an episode unrelated to the mother series which, in this specific case, tries a new path: that of Pokmon . It's a bizarre statement, but true. In fact, in the game we play as Reyn and Lann, two brothers who suddenly find themselves involved in an extraordinary adventure: to regain their memory, they will have to capture the ~mirages~ scattered around the world of Grymoire. The ~mirages~ are creatures taken directly from the Final Fantasy universe that Reyn and Lann can use in combat: there are chocobos, mandrakes, behemoths and so on and so forth. The various mirages have different sizes which strategically affect party composition for combat. In fact, larger mirages can carry Reyn, Lann, and smaller creatures. The two brothers, for their part, can change shape and go from ~jiganti~ to ~lilichini~, shrunk and super cute versions that can ride the biggest mirages. Each ~stack~, at that point, adds up the stats and abilities of the mirages that make it up, including elemental resistances and other parameters of great importance. World of Final Fantasy is a rather simple game, actually, but it also has a concrete depth that becomes especially evident during the final bars or in secret areas where tactics are of crucial importance. Considering that the fights take place both in turn-based and in real time, as they are inspired by the classic Active Time Battle of Final Fantasy, and that the story and the dialogues rarely take themselves seriously, peppered as they are with more or less jokes, jokes and quotes less successful, it is clear that World of Final Fantasy represents above all a love letter to the avid fans of the series, but also a kind of introduction for the little ones to the magical world of Japanese role-playing games. The PlayStation Vita version, in this sense, will not disappoint players who prefer to enjoy JRPGs slowly and ~on the go~, but it is clear that one must come to terms with a series of technical limitations which, initially, and above all after testing the version PlayStation 4, they can turn up their noses. The dialogues, for example, will have to be downloaded separately because, quite simply, they did not fit into the cartridge, and we are talking about a download of about 600 MB per package (one for the dialogues in English, the other for those in Japanese in case register the Day One edition code, but don't worry: the texts are completely in Italian). Once this obstacle has been overcome, one immediately realizes that the PlayStation Vita version lacks the good anti-aliasing of its older sister and all the shaders that embellish the game on PlayStation 4 thanks also to a better level of lighting. The result translates into a generally dirtier and more washed out image compared to the triumph of colors played on TV. Despite this, and bearing in mind that World of Final Fantasy is not exactly a very latest generation title from a purely technical point of view, it must be admitted that the PlayStation Vita version defends itself very well overall, returning an experience practically identical to the PlayStation 4 version exhibiting a dancer frame rate that returns visible slowdowns in the most chaotic fights or when the camera hazards shots of awide breath. It must be said, however, that compared to the PlayStation 4 version, loading and menus felt slightly slower, which could annoy players who like to spend a lot of time customizing their mirages. It is also important to underline that the PlayStation Vita version, while lacking the possibility of connecting to the Internet to take advantage of the sparse multiplayer options present in the PlayStation 4 version, supports the ad hoc connection and the cross-save function thus guaranteeing the possibility of importing and export the save in case you decide to also purchase the version for the home console. Perhaps that's why, then, World of Final Fantasy doesn't support PlayStation TV. In short, it is a decent but not exactly excellent conversion, which can be forgiven for the low price compared to the home version.", "date": "2016-12-01", "grade": "8.0"}
