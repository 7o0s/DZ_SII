In truth, the game is not exactly unknown: already available for several years in an early access version on PC, it has only recently reached its definitive form, being launched for practically all platforms, therefore it is a title that has already gone through a period of testing and received enough feedback from the user that it doesn't just blindly hit the market. The explicit title says everything there is to know: Golf with your Friends is really a golf game to be played with friends, which finds its maximum expression in multiplayer, if not the only truly sensible one. There are different game modes and the possibility of tackling everything in single or multiplayer online or offline, but substantially Golf with your Friends gives its best in multiplayer being structured almost like a party game, therefore it is in this condition that it should be enjoyed. although it still offers several possibilities to customize the experience. As a structure it is connected to the ancient tradition of video game golf (or rather mini-golf), from the times of Zany Golf and the like: it is a question of tackling absolutely crazy courses scattered over different settings, generally following the fundamental rules of golf, that is to hit the hole in as few shots as possible. What lies between the starting point and the hole, however, is all madness: there are more or less exaggerated courses but in general they all introduce features that have very little to do with the normal courses of real mini-golf and own. The response of the ball to the basic laws of physics is the constant that maintains the orientation of the whole system, but for each hole there is a huge amount of variables to consider, with obstacles of all kinds. There are no characters to visualize and no look to change, here it's just about putting your ball on the green and hitting the hole, but that doesn't mean the game is trivial. The many souls of (mini) golf Despite its spartan presentation, the amount of content in Golf with your Friends is truly remarkable: it consists of 12 circuits that unfold in profoundly different and strongly characterized settings, each consisting of 18 holes which already represent a considerable abundance of game solutions . The courses, even within the various strands that distinguish the different settings, still have unique elements that make them all remarkably characterized and disparate experiences, truly designed without limits: we start from the simplest and most classic obstacles for mini-golf and it comes to sci-fi madness with modified gravity zones, moving platforms, sea monsters to overcome, switches to activate to allow various passages and much more. The variety is truly impressive, further amplified by the possibility of tackling the holes following different routes but also by the possible application of modifications capable of varying some basic characteristics of the gameplay. The fact that it is possible to make the ball jump when necessary suggests that we are dealing with a rather imaginative reinterpretation of golf, but this is only the beginning: it is possible to apply additional rules that modify some elements of the structure of basic, such as replacing the holes with hockey hoops or goals, thus requiring further actions to reach the coveted ~par~ or some changes to the appearance and behavior of the ball that have varied effects in multiplayer challenges. pace of the game is quite different from what one might expect: the online multiplayer does not take place in turns (unlike the offline one, which instead is based on the classic alternation, passing the controller from one player to another) but sees a up to 12 players shooting at the same time generating considerable chaos on the screen, but also greatly increasing the liveliness of the game. Everything is timed: it is necessary to reach the hole within a certain number of minutes, therefore one must try to combine precision with speed without wasting time, just as the possibility of using the free camera to observe the tracks is also limited. This helps to make Golf with your Friend somewhat chaotic at times, giving a nunew interpretation of golf and a characterization strongly devoted to multiplayer competition, but always with a smile on his face. Simple and filling The control system, as befits a game of this type, is based on the regulation of a bar which indicates the direction and power of the shot, with the possibility of applying effects to the shot but in general a remarkable simplicity in managing the ball, even compared to real golf simulations. One cannot really speak of a nice interface, but if nothing else, the purely arcade simplification makes the game very dynamic and fast, at least after a few games of adaptation, given that some functions fail to be very clear also due to a rather incomplete (but which has the advantage of never hindering the action). All this falls into a rather spartan aspect, as we have said, derived from a production of modest dimensions and also from a total concentration on the gameplay and the amount of game content. The fact is that there are some technical problems, even beyond a certain general graphic poverty: the physical management of the ball is not the maximum of realism even if it is consistent with the ~cheerful~ and not really realistic interpretation of golf, but some rebounds and contacts between structures and surfaces are not convincing and return unpredictable results, also combined with a difficult precise assessment of the power placed in the blow, which in some cases seems to vary in a not very congruent way. Fortunately, these are infrequent situations, but in some cases they give the idea of a somewhat approximate realization, as well as the management of the camera, which sometimes causes problems by getting stuck between the walls and creating real blind spots. In particular, when the ball stops in narrow spaces or under some structures it becomes practically impossible to manage the view appropriately, forcing you to hit a little at random. It's a bit disappointing that the game arrives on console in this condition after spending years in early access on PC, a long process that could have resulted in a much cleaner final form. Regardless of these technical inconsistencies, however, Golf with your Friends manages perfectly to stage a cheerful and lively atmosphere and above all to make every single hole a rather unique gaming experience, with a truly remarkable variety of different interpretations on the basic gameplay.", "date": "2020-05-23", "grade": "6.8"}
