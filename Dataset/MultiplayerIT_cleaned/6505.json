{"name": "Spazio ristretto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146563-sid-meiers-starships-spazio-ristretto.html", "text": "Firaxis Games, the development team led by Sid Meier, is now constantly proceeding on a double production track, with lighter titles alternating with more complex ones such as Civilization or XCOM. Although linked to the science fiction setting of Civilization: Beyond Earth, Sid Meier's Starships is conceptually much closer to the two Ace Patrol, both in terms of content and potential audience. In fact, we are faced with a strategic space focused on a few simple concepts, designed for fast campaigns with customizable density and difficulty, excellent for being played both with the mouse and on a tablet. At the beginning of each game you have to select the affinity and the leader who will lead our civilization to conquer space. Anyone who has played Beyond Earth will surely know what Supremacy, Harmony and Purity mean. Well, forget it. In Starships affinities give a single bonus, as does the selected leader. So no philosophical implications on the development of the campaign, just a choice of convenience, linked to your style of play and the type of victory you want to achieve. Once the size of the map, the number of opponents, the difficulty and the types of active victories have been decided, you can start exploring the cosmos, starting from your home planet. Exploration The exploration screen consists of a map with several planets spread across it. Starships gameplay is turn-based, with the number of actions you can perform limited by crew fatigue. Once our moves have been exhausted, we must leave room for the opponents by sending the men on prize leave. At the beginning of the next round we will be able to collect the resources produced by the owned planets, spending them as needed. We'll be back soon to talk about the slender management section, but in the meantime we have to try to understand how the exploratory phase takes place. Nothing could be simpler, as you just need to click on a planet connected to the one where our fleet is located and select the travel icon to reach it. Once we reach our destination, if the planet is not yet owned by any of the warring factions, we will be assigned a mission which, if successfully completed, will earn us the trust of the population. Once you have accumulated four trust points, the planet will agree to join our galactic empire and start supplying us with resources. On the conquered planets it is possible to build various improvements, which serve to increase production, to grow their population or to strengthen their defenses in the event of an attack by one of the opposing empires. Wonders can also be built on some, which give different bonuses to our spaceships. For the rest, interactions with free planets are really limited, since you can only gain trust by spending resources or obtaining information. The objectives to be pursued to win a game are very simple: conquer a certain percentage of planets, encourage scientific development, make the population of the empire grow dramatically by building cities or, finally, build a certain number of wonders. If you keep all the choices active, usually the most convenient to pursue is the domination of the universe, since doing it, after having sufficiently upgraded your fleet, is not at all complicated. In fact, it is enough to conquer the home planet of an opposing empire to capture all the others within its borders. To say, we have won several games despite a clear disadvantage, simply by making sudden rushes against the enemy, overcoming their defenses, sometimes really poor. Unfortunately one of the problems of Starships is precisely the artificial intelligence that is certainly not smart. What's the point of conquering so many planets if you don't build enough defenses to protect the only fundamental one? After so many heavy strategists, how about trying a light and fast one like Sid Meier's Starships? Fight and die Artificial intelligence does not prove to be a fox even in the second fundamental section of the game, that of combat. But we'll talk about that later. In the meantime, let us try to describe it. Carrying out missions or attacking planets in Starships means managing spaceships on a tactical map divided into hexagons, with the planet you are on at the center. Here, too, the action takes place in turns. Don't let all the numbers scare you here, because there is very little complex The objectives of the missions are different: some ask to destroy the entire opposing fleet, others to escort a cargo ship to a portal, still others to prevent pirates from escaping and so on. There is also a type where you have to overcome a maze of asteroids within a certain number of turns. In general, however, there is not much variety and dfter an hour of play you have seen everything there is to see. In any case, one must learn to manage the means at one's disposal. Each spaceship that forms our fleet has different attack and defense characteristics depending on the customization choices made in the exploration phase, the technologies developed and the wonders built. The action is divided into two phases: one offensive and one defensive. In the first the spaceships move and, if the targets are not covered by asteroids or are not cloaked, laser cannons or plasma cannons are fired. There are also special actions that can be spent every turn, such as torpedoes that cause area damage, or, to give another example, fighters that can be deployed in support of your ships. The defensive phase is quite self explanatory, as it requires you to stand still and hope you made the right moves in the previous phase in order to limit the damage. In general we can say that the clashes with few means are quite flat, while the action acquires an edge when there are many in the field, that is, when it becomes essential to make the right moves in order not to end up surrounded. We did not understand each other At the beginning of the previous paragraph we were talking about the intellectual deficit of artificial intelligence even in the combat phase. In fact, it's a bit of a species to see opponents who sometimes behave with great cunning, while others seem to be guided by tronistas. For example, we've had situations where we've been surrounded, while in others we've seen powerful space battleships pile up at the blast point of a torpedo clearly visible on the screen. Especially at the first three levels of difficulty behavioral problems are noticed which could not be solved even by a very good psychologist. Given that there are four difficulty levels in total and that a player does not necessarily want to immediately jump on the more challenging one, the problem is not secondary, nor can it be overlooked. Another issue, minor for a strategist, is the technical part. Here too there is no need to rush into words: Starships was designed to go on tablets. The power of PCs is not exploited at all. Not bad, since in this way it is playable on practically any system. Besides, there wasn't much else to ask for, given the price it costs. We can always console ourselves with some songs from the soundtrack, really well done and engaging.", "date": "2015-03-11", "grade": "6.9"}
