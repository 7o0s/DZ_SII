{"name": "Ty - La tigre della Tasmania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ty-la-tigre-della-tasmania.html", "text": "Let's start from the beginning At the beginning of the game, you will find yourself in the ~neutral~ location of the Rainbow Cliffs. Your trusty Maurie will take care of guiding you, a talking parrot who will not fail to dispense advice and instructions to tackle the various levels. Of fundamental importance is also the brilliant Dr. Julius, a coala who has invented a sophisticated machine for remote retrieval of the talismans you are looking for. The only problem with this amazing tool lies in its ~fuel~: to work it needs a certain number of thunder eggs, and it is to find them that you will explore all the levels that the game has to offer. Julius can also build you new boomerangs, with ever-changing characteristics, using the golden gears that you will find along the way. To access the levels, you will have to enter the space gates of the Rainbow Cliffs, which will increase in number as you proceed. Each stage obviously boasts a different setting and characteristic characters, with which to interact to obtain the thunder eggs you need, as well as to learn new skills. To give you an example, in the ~seaside~ setting you will meet the wily lifeguard Rex, who will teach you how to swim and ask you to go and retrieve his girlfriend on the top of a mountain that rises in the middle of the sea. The levels are filled with items: opals (collect all of them to get an extra thunder egg), food (to restore your energy), trapped Bilbies (to free), magnets (to attract opals automatically), etc. Once you complete the ~missions~ of each level, you will have the opportunity to face a timed race in the same environment, to earn more thunder eggs. Completing each level 100% will not be an easy feat at all The art of throwing the boomerang As mentioned earlier, Ty has the ability to throw boomerangs to get rid of his enemies. The aim of each shot is automatic, and the launch methods vary according to the boomerangs you will use. For example, the Zoomerangs will allow you to strike from a certain distance, using a zoom function, while with the Fiammarangs you can light fires and destroy the cobwebs that block your way. These are just two of the models that Dr. Julius will prepare for you when you bring him a certain number of golden gears. You can, at any time, select the type of boomerang you want to use, using the directional cross on the pad. In addition to the obvious ability to jump, Ty will be able to glide using boomerangs, take big bites or activate a first person view for called shots. The enemies that you will face will present themselves with different characteristics and modus operandi depending on the case: the Iguanas are eliminated with a simple boomerang blow, while the situation becomes more complicated for the Blue Tongues (large reptiles, with a massive build) and for the Red Kangaroos. There is obviously no shortage of bosses to fight from time to time, and each of them has different weaknesses. All the colors of Ty The technical aspect of the game is impeccable, both in terms of graphics and sound. The developers have created Ty's world without sparing ideas, and the great storyboarding and design work is proof of this. The levels are very colorful, full of objects and well thought out, while the characters show off numerous animations, as well as a decidedly successful design. The graphics engine that moves everything is solid as a rock, and does not give in to any uncertainty, even in the most crowded situations. If you really want to criticize the aesthetics of the game, you can perhaps denounce the small number of ~minor~ enemies that Ty can face, but it is such a marginal detail that you will absolutely ignore it. The management of the visuals, which has always been a risk factor for three-dimensional games, in this case is almost entirely delegated to the player, who can change the angle of the virtual camera quite easily, using the secondary analog stick. The sound has from its music characterized by a compositional quality that is rarely found in video games. The soundtrack of the game, in fact, can also be listened to separately, so much has been created with professionalism and inspiration. I recommend the use of headphones, to recognize the various instruments used and to enjoy the quality of the sound effects. The localization in Italian closes the discussion, which boasts an excellent quality dubbing (even if, wanting to be hypercritical,at the beginning there are some small blunders) and completes the picture of a classy product, which deserves to be popular both among young gamers and among the more elderly ones. Concluding... Ty  The Tasmanian tiger is a platformer that is beautiful to look at and fun to play, which starts from an extremely solid structure (drawing heavily on the classics of the genre) and offers excellent gameplay. Krome Studios has created a product that deserves success, succeeding in the difficult task of combining likeable characters with a technical realization practically free from defects. Absolutely recommended for platform lovers. Pros: Flawless graphics Excellent playability Equipped with a certain thickness Apt cast of characters Cons: Perhaps few ~basic~ enemies Visual to be manually optimized The combination of tigers and boomerangs Ty, the protagonist of the game, believes he is now the last Tasmanian tiger still alive. Raised by the generous Bilby, and now master of the boomerang throwing technique (characteristic element of his species), one day Ty ends up in a mysterious cave and becomes aware of his own destiny. On this occasion, in fact, the Elder of the Bunyips, a mystical and legendary creature, tells the tiger cub how the evil Boss Cass has imprisoned his family and the other tigers of his species in a parallel dimension, in an attempt to take possession of a series of sigils that grant absolute power to whoever possesses them. Before ending up trapped, however, the tigers managed to cause an explosion that caused the seals to disperse in different places, and right now Boss Cass is looking for them to seize them. As Ty, you will have to beat the evil reptile to the punch and free your fellow creatures from the dimensional prison. Will you succeed?", "date": "2003-03-16", "grade": null}
