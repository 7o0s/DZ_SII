In short, in this review of Snack World: Dungeon Crawlers - Gold you will find that the ~new~ Level-5 title unfortunately failed to fill the void left in our lives by the hilarious Fantasy Life of a few years ago. And let's quote that ~new~ because Snack World isn't exactly ~new~: the game was released in Japan three years ago on Nintendo 3DS and then was remastered for Switch in the wake of the moderate success of anime, manga and merchandising. At home, in fact, Snack World is a sort of ~toys to life~, a component that is missing in the localization for our country. This, however, is the least of the problems of a dungeon crawler designed especially for the little ones. Many stories in one Let's recap: the first thing you will do in Snack World is try to remain impassive in front of an opening theme, sung completely in Italian, which balances on the fine line between trash and the most absolute cringe. Then you'll have to create your avatar, choosing from a nice array of parameters that include skin color, face and eye shape, even size. The game begins on the beach of the city of Tutti-Frutti, where you will find yourself in the grip of the typical amnesia as a protagonist of JRPG: Snack World in fact jokes a lot about clichs strictly breaking the fourth wall, as if all the inhabitants of this strange world were aware of not really exist. The dialogues are bizarre and demented, thanks to an excellent Italian localization which includes limited dubbing and which manages to be ironic without overdoing it. Brought before King Papaya, we will find ourselves having to satisfy the whims of his daughter, Princess Melonia, an unbearable girl for whom Chup, the protagonist of the animated series of the same name, has lost his mind. Chup and his friends will often accompany us on our adventures, but they are not the only inhabitants of Tutti-Frutti we will have to deal with. The world of Snack World is teeming with colorful characters who will often ask us for help, involving us in strange adventures and sometimes accompanying us in dungeons: completing these tasks often unlocks the possibility of adding these same characters to our party in the form of ~Snack~. As the story progresses, the number of Snacks that we can take with us also increases, both in the form of active members of the group, who will fight with us, and in the temporary transformation garment that will change our character into the corresponding Snack, guaranteeing us different attacks or abilities . And here an interesting collecting component comes into play, because we can also transform all enemies into Snacks by defeating them a certain number of times and, therefore, photographing them with a kind of mini-game. In this way, players who, like us in the review phase, are unable to play online or locally with friends and strangers can still form a party and customize it with the Snacks - and therefore the characters or monsters - they prefer. Where the weapon falls The problem is that Snack World's structure is heavily repetitive right from the start. ~Because it's a dungeon crawler!~ someone could rightly object, only that this repetitiveness goes hand in hand with the problem of loot, which in the long run makes all its weight felt. It is important to point out that the absence of toys to be purchased separately is almost irrelevant. Also in Japan, the gadgets only increased the probability of finding the corresponding Jare, i.e. the keychains that represent the weapons: this version of Snack World compensates for the problem with a little witch in the city who will give us materials and random Jare once a day. The fact is this: the secondary missions and the main ones that punctuate the story - a story that, moreover, struggles to take off even when it gets a little more alive after several hours of play - all take place in a limited number of maps and only some of these are procedural. And the procedural maps in question are always made up of small rooms alternating with corridors in which enemies appear out of nowhere at pre-set points. What should push players to repeat and repeat dungeons in a dungeon crawler should above all be the loot: Diablo III, Torchlight II and the like teach us that there is nothing more satisfying than exterminating enemies and seeing new ones fall on the ground items to wear or weapons to wield. That's not exactly the case with Snack World, though, since nethe dungeons we will find above all materials and consumables. The Jare are mostly rewards that the game bestows at the end of the dungeon, and it is not certain that it does so: the player's skill affects the quality of the final rewards, increasing the chances that a specific Jara will come out, but the random component often forces to repeat the same, lengthy dungeons over and over again just to get your hands on a new weapon. However, the most controversial aspect is another, namely that each weapon is enhanced by combining it with specific materials... and another identical weapon. Consequently, if we like a weapon in particular, we will have to farm the same dungeon several times to obtain the copies necessary for the upgrade. And the weapons, in the end, aren't that different from each other. Each Jara grants a basic combo and a couple of special moves that depend on the type of weapon. Only passive bonuses are random, and they are the ones you need to think about when deciding which version of the same weapon to upgrade. Furthermore, each weapon is more or less effective against different types of enemies, but since these are so many, you end up relying on the automatic loadouts that the game suggests depending on the mission: they include not only the most suitable Jare, based on the types of enemies that we will face, but also the best dress, hat and accessories such as stats, colors and brand, since even the fashion of the day can become an interesting bonus. In short, there are several parameters to keep in mind for a combat system that does not give all these satisfactions. Most enemy attacks are telegraphed moments in advance and allow the player to move even using the appropriate dodge. Unfortunately, the stiffness of our combos, the approximate hitboxes and the general confusion that arises when mixing characters and enemies together sacrifices any kind of strategic approach in favor of pure and simple brute force. Recommended for children These aspects make Snack World: Dungeon Explorers - Gold a game especially suitable for children or for those looking for an unpretentious dungeon crawler. There are no builds to study, complicated parameters to manage and other subtleties for experienced players. The Level-5 title focuses entirely on deliberate ingenuity, on automatisms that bypass superfluous and sometimes confusing variables to provide the player with the tools to have fun immediately. Even the enhancement of clothing is hand-in-hand with an almost social aspect: what in another game would be combat armor, in Snack World they are casual clothes which we can also change color with each enhancement. The game soon becomes a coming and going for small and large dungeons, more similar to Yo-kai Busters than to the aforementioned Fantasy Life: the chapters of the story unlock new scenarios and bosses to be defeated at the end of certain assignments, more demanding battles than normal probably represent the flagship of the combat system. But repetitiveness is always around the corner and you start to feel it very soon. The rarefied distribution of the most interesting loot - the Jare - reduces the incentive to repeat the dungeons by the hour. If there's one thing the genre has taught us, it's that the player should at least have a sense of progress every time they return to base after clearing a dungeon, illusory as that may be. Snack World: Dungeon Explorers - Gold, on the other hand, rewards the most unfortunate excursions with generic materials that give no satisfaction, and when even the weapons begin to look the same, only changing their name and stats, you begin to feel a vague sense of inconclusiveness in each assignment. We weren't able to test the online multiplayer mode, but we doubt that the social component can significantly improve such an ingrained problem in the structure of the game. And it's a shame because a more solid gameplay would have made us forgive even the dated and simplistic aspect of a title which, unfortunately, ends up making us feel the full weight of its years.", "date": "2020-02-13", "grade": "6.0"}
