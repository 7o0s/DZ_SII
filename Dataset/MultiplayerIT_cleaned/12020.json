{"name": "Rogue Galaxy - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rogue-galaxy-recensione.html", "text": "Pirates of the Galaxy The protagonist of Rogue Galaxy is Jaster Rogue, a bold and mature young man who lives by his wits on an arid planet and subjected to the galactic imperial forces. Obviously the situation is tight for him, and becoming a space pirate is a much more attractive idea. The first notable difference between Final Fantasy XII's Jaster and Vaan is the notable initial characterization: unlike Jaster, Vaan's motivations are weaker and more immature. In short, Jaster Rogue despite his age is a decidedly profound character right from the start, convincingly characterized in his way of acting and behaving. When monsters attack his village, Jaster is on the front line to get rid of them, and ends up meeting a mysterious warrior, forging a temporary alliance to defeat the enemies: before the decisive battle, however, the masked warrior gives him his weapon and disappears into thin air. What Jaster doesn't imagine is that in the meantime two funny space pirates were looking for the legendary corsair Desert Claw, to recruit him to their crew... and needless to say, when they locate the famous Desert Claw weapon in Jaster's hands, after this has defeated a host of enemies, they end up mistaking the young man for their target. From that moment, Jaster enters the crew of the space galleon Dorgenark, and for a change his pirate adventures, assisted by a diverse cast of heroes, will evolve into an epic quest to save the galaxy from the enigmatic threat of the moment, in pure Star Wars style. ... The mini-games are very well done and structured, expanding on an already huge game. A bit of everything'! The main value of Rogue Galaxy certainly lies in the painstaking research and selection work carried out by the Level 5, in search of the best elements that have embellished the most recent RPGs: it is therefore not surprising to feel a certain sense of deja-vu during Jaster's adventure , fortunately filed down by the care placed in the contextualization and improvement of these not particularly new ideas. An example is certainly the Revelation Flow, that is the system through which the various characters learn new skills (called Revelation) or improve their statistics: the Chart is remarkably reminiscent of the License Grid of Final Fantasy XII or the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy X , a huge pattern made up of connected boxes, which spreads out in various directions. Each box basically represents a skill or a bonus, but in order to activate it, you must first insert objects, which can be purchased, released by monsters or found in chests; once a new skill is unlocked, the adjacent boxes will be revealed together with the objects necessary to activate them, and consequently it will be up to the player to decide which skill to learn first, advancing in one direction of the Revelation Flow Chart or not. The mechanism turns out to be more flexible than the License Grid of Final Fantasy XII, while presenting fewer skills, which however differ per character, making them in a certain sense more unique and customizable: let's say that as an upgrade system it is even more reminiscent of that featured in XenoSaga III. Obviously, the Revelation Flow affects the battle-system, inspired by the one perfected for over a decade by Namco's Tales series or Enix's Star Ocean: the transition between exploration and confrontation is almost instantaneous and the scenario does not change with the loading of a battlefield , the clash takes place on site, between our three characters active in the party and the various attackers. Needless to say, the player controls one of the three heroes, and the combat takes place completely in real-time: it is possible to make combinations of physical attacks or shoot a firearm from a distance, throwing objects around or jumping on enemies to hit maybe their weak point. Each action performed will download an indicator, until we can no longer act before it has automatically recharged: a successful parry, however, will fill it completely in an instant. By activating a menu it is possible to use the Revelations, and if the situation becomes complicated, our adventure companions will give us a suggestion on what they could do: by pressing a key, for example, you can allow them to use a healing potion by pressing another he will refuse the advice. Rogue Galaxy's battle-system is extremely frenetic, fun and dynamic, even if it mainly depends on the type of enemies you face: in some cases the cross between unbridled beating and tactics helps to increase the involvement, in other cases the flatness of certain enemies makes fights far too quick, simple, and repeatabletive. The only real flaw present is perhaps the absence of healing skills or spells, as a result the player is forced to stock up on items and potions in order to survive in the most difficult battles. For sure, the bosses created by Level 5 are among the most fun, massive and compelling ever faced in a product of the same genre. Dark Cloud's Legacy Naturally, the trademark of the softco could not be missing, which once again spiced up the central Role Playing Game with a flood of secondary activities that make it simply immense to play: Rogue Galaxy actually inherits the excellent ideas from the two episodes of the Dark Cloud series which were the masters there (to the point of making the two titles too dispersive) and which here instead integrate perfectly with the narrative development and the excellent battle-system. So here we are again creating objects in the appropriate Factories, after having obtained the necessary ~blueprints~, in a simpler and more intuitive way than Dark Chronicle, and decidedly more useful for progressing in the adventure; at the same time, multiple weapons can be fused into a new and better one, by feeding them to a bizarre alien frog named Toady. As pirates, the crew of the Dorgenark can also hunt down ~Quarry~, monsters and villains with a considerable price on their heads: by defeating them, you will get Hunter Points, which are also increased by winning Challenge-type fights, in which certain conditions must be met . Hunter points will allow you to purchase particular ~licenses~, through which you can get discounts in shops, or buy previously untraceable items. Dulcis in fundo, in Rogue Galaxy there is also a sort of decidedly original mini-game called Insectron, more or less a chess game crossed with the idea of Pokmon, in which the pawns are alien insects, which can be purchased or captured: in the latter case, particular traps and baits will be needed, and even special cages that will influence the skills learned by the insect, and which will also become the love nest of two insects, which will be able to generate another one. The possibilities are many, and although optional these mini-games are very well made and structured, expanding an already huge game in itself. Best Looking Game? It is ironic that precisely in this period of decline, PlayStation 2 is able to show real prodigies of graphic technique: if God of War II promises to be absolutely incredible, and if Final Fantasy XII makes its extreme and refined detail an example to imitate, Rogue Galaxy simply stands as the graphically better game for the second Sony console. The cel-shading developed by Level 5 to bring the galaxy of Jaster and his pirates to life is the most sophisticated ever created: the incredible detail, the dazzling color variety, practically no aliasing and the fluid and natural animations make Rogue Galaxy a real interactive cartoon, which is especially true in the cutscenes, in which the excellent dubbing (accompanied by clear subtitles without typos) helps to give the game a truly cinematic feeling. The ability to change the clothes of the various characters is reflected, among other things, in the cutscenes themselves, a small touch of visual class that further gives an idea of the incredible work done by Level 5 in the diversification and graphic variety. The battles are an explosion of colors and special effects, without the slightest slowdown, undermined only by a jaunty camera that sometimes has difficulty framing the action perfectly, especially in the most agitated moments: it is not uncommon to find yourself facing at least five or six enemies together, caught in the crossfire of guns and spells. Thumbs up also for the excellent soundtrack, which does not reach the quality of Final Fantasy XII or XenoSaga III, while remaining on very high levels, even if at times a certain repetitiveness of some melodic pieces is noticed, especially those that accompany the ~dungeon~: on the other hand, the variety of themes and sound effects, together with the random gab of the characters who accompany us and which make even the exploration more lively, denote a cure for this other decidedly over the top technical aspect. Comment The revised western version of Rogue Galaxy includes a host of additional items and weapons, a completely new planet to explore, redesigned and much more varied dungeons than the Japanese edition, a more refined Artificial Intelligence, and more sidequests: the work done by Level 5 to perfect their farewell game to the PlayStation 2 justifies a months delay. Rogue Galaxy is therefore the antagonist of Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2? In reality, the two RPGs are decidedly different: the Square Enix masterpiece focuses more on the plot, which in Rogue Galaxy is rather minor compared to the massive dose of gameplay that makes it in some ways more fun than FFXII. They are therefore two products intended for slightly different targets, and a comparison between the two would seem almost inadequate, considering then that the Level 5 title draws with both hands in the RPG panorama of the last ten years, proposing perfected and recontextualized mechanics and ideas. For sure, the visual quality is absolutely outstanding for PS2, rivaling anything else on the market, handily winning the technical comparison. We've been waiting for it for a long time, and the presence of other competitors now overshadows its qualities a bit, but Rogue Galaxy is certainly even more beautiful than we expected. Pros Technically the non-plus-ultra on PlayStation 2 Simply immense Great battle-system and tons of characters, quests and mini-games Cons Sometimes repetitive fights Some locations are too linear Level 5 are probably the developers who have squeezed the PS2 hardware the most over the years, churning out technically impressive and original titles before anyone else. When Square Enix showed the excellent three-dimensional engine of Kingdom Hearts, the Level 5 countered with the nothing short of amazing Dark Chronicles. Always one step ahead, Level 5 has also collaborated in the development of the amazing Dragon Quest: Journey of the Cursed King, once again showing an unmistakable signature: a painstaking graphic realization and oriented towards a visual experience similar to a real cartoon interactive. Rogue Galaxy was announced a couple of years ago, unleashing the fantasies of those who loved Dark Chronicles, since Rogue Galaxy remembered that excellent action-RPG, promising playful improvements so as not to be as repetitive. To stimulate spirits even more, the new setting: space, in which pirate spaceships navigate, populated by bizarre alien creatures among which the protagonists move, involved in extraordinary adventures. The project was very reminiscent of Treasure Planet, a very successful Disney animated feature film based on Robert Louis Stevenson's immortal Treasure Island. When Rogue Galaxy was released at home, however, the enthusiasm was dampened by a product that was at times incomplete, which did not fully satisfy fans of content-rich games such as Dark Chronicle or the more recent Final Fantasy. The American version of Rogue Galaxy, which had by now been renamed as ~anti-Final Fantasy XII~ (in fact, there are many points in common between the two titles, starting with the protagonists: both blond, young and daredevil), made to wait much longer than necessary, due to the extra contents inserted during the adaptation, which made the final product much more complete and satisfactory than the original Japanese counterpart. And now, does Final Fantasy XII really have to shake? The answer is more complicated than expected.", "date": "2007-09-10", "grade": null}
