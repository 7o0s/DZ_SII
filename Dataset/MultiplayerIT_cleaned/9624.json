Not only was Deceased Pixel's game blatantly inspired, bordering on plagiarism, by the title released in 2006 by indie developer JTR, but what's worse is that Super Mega Worm was also done quite well, taking all the credit and attracting considerable attention of criticism and the press. Having therefore finished second, the only way for Death Worm to stand out and beat the rival worm was to play everything on the amount of additional content, offering many more levels, power-ups, unlockable achievements and even some minigames to pass the time. For the rest, the title is practically identical to Super Mega Worm, with the player who, impersonating a gigantic underground monster, has the task of devouring as many humans, animals and vehicles as possible, suddenly coming out on the surface and being careful not to get eliminate. The tapeworm Given the remarkable similarities of the two games, one cannot fail to make a direct comparison, point by point, with Super Mega Worm. Just like the latter, Death Worm is divided into various levels in which you have to face increasingly numerous and armed enemies, while the worm gradually becomes larger and more ferocious. To the unfortunate civilians are added police, special forces, planes, tanks and even some UFOs, able to give the player a lot of trouble, especially in the more advanced levels. Once again the levels are overcome by killing a certain number of humans, but PlayCreek's game adds a pinch of variety by imposing some restrictions or small objectives, such as making 70 kills in 30 seconds, destroying 5 planes in a row or eating 30 humans without never get hit. The main differences between the two titles, however, start from the graphic style used: while Super Mega Worm has preferred a more original approach with a retro flavor, Death Worm is characterized by much more detailed graphics that give their best especially on devices with Retina display. Let's be clear, this is not necessarily a better choice, but it certainly satisfies the detractors of large pixels. The worm moves clockwise and counterclockwise again, but this time you control it thanks to a virtual stick, which on the one hand is undoubtedly more intuitive and responsive, but on the other it does not offer the same precision given by the Super Mega Worm stick. The choice to insert a dynamic camera, which moves away depending on how fast the player moves, was not very apt. Most of the time it's so far away that enemies appear too small to accurately see or eat. The real battle, however, the developers try to move it to the field of content: in Death Worm every time you pass a level you can choose a characteristic to improve, whether it's the speed, size or resistance of the worm. Power-ups appear from time to time which, if collected, allow you to spit fireballs or enter a sort of berserk mode, in which speed and destructive capacity increase exponentially for a short period of time. Already now it is also possible to unlock two more scenarios to devastate, while new ones will be added in the coming weeks thanks to future game updates. The integration with Game Center, with online leaderboards and a good dose of unlockable achievements, gives the incentive to replay the same level several times, but for those who want to while away the time in a different way, it is possible to face a simple mini-game in which, very similar to Canabalt, you have to go as far as possible while avoiding obstacles along the way.
