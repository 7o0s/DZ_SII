Goo Saga, by the young Greek team Toka Loka made up of six people, fits exactly into this description: it is in fact a two-dimensional platformer whose protagonist is a bizarre gelatinous creature born in a huge secret underground laboratory. However, the disappearance of the luminary pushes Goo (this is the name of the being) to go in search of it, so as to be able to discover at the same time the reasons for its creation. A very simple canvas which, in the final analysis, can be overlooked, and which therefore places the gameplay of an undoubtedly interesting title at the center of the scene which in many ways recalls the platformers of the 16-bit era. Goo Saga is a good platformer, but it lacks the brilliance and depth of the best in the genre Professor where are you? The main feature of the mechanics studied by the Hellenic team is linked to Goo's ability to assume three different states, being able to switch from one to another at any time using a special virtual key positioned on the right of the screen. The three states are Deflated, Normal and Inflated, and as can be easily understood, they guarantee different characteristics to the protagonist, in such a way as to allow him to solve simple environmental puzzles or overcome certain sections of the levels. By deflating, Goo can in fact, for example, overcome particularly narrow passages or slip into narrow tunnels, while from Gonfio the greater agility and speed allows you to reach out-of-reach platforms. This is the basis of a gameplay that makes good use of these elements, giving life to interesting solutions that alternate puzzle moments with sections more dedicated to action with a discreet rhythm: in the latter, the fight against enemies represents a key aspect, which passes through the classic solution of the headshot. Unlike, for example, Super Mario, however, here it is also necessary to press the down key to throw oneself forcefully against the opponent and inflict damage: a choice that increases the complexity and adds to the inevitable imprecision of the virtual keys, thus leaving from this point of view more than a few perplexities. Even the design of the enemies appears a bit superficial, with the latter limiting themselves to performing very basic actions and movements without therefore almost never representing a particularly demanding threat. On the other hand, the possibility of developing Goo by collecting small blobs scattered throughout the levels is interesting: by reaching a pre-established number, a crystal can be obtained, which can then be ~spent~ to improve one of the 8 available skills. These go from a simple increase in energy to the ability to collect blobs more easily or to jump higher and so on, thus giving extra help in dealing with the discreet - but never prohibitive - difficulty of the advanced stages. Replayability is also favored by the three ways in which each single level can be tackled, which alongside the normal one flanks a Survival and a Time Trial. Being a physics-based platformer, Goo Saga manages to guarantee a good variety during the progression; at the same time, however, the inertia that affects the movements of the protagonist should be noted, an element that could annoy players who do not like this solution. From a technical point of view however, the title of Toka Loka is undoubtedly remarkable: the fluidity of the action is always guaranteed, and the very clean high definition graphics with a good level of detail are appreciable. Perhaps what Goo Saga lacks is a bit of artistic quality because the protagonist, supporting actors and enemies are all lacking in personality, banal, unable to leave a mark or be remembered. In the same way, the settings are all a bit similar, with minimal aesthetic variations between the 20 levels that make up the adventure. All elements that reduce the overall value of Goo Saga, which ultimately turns out to be a pleasant and well-made product, which however lacks the depth and brilliance of the most important titles. Worth mentioning is the presence of an editor through which you can create your own levels to then share with the community: unfortunately the complexity of the almost insane interface of this tool and the absence of any tutorial are destined to discourage a large part of the potential interested public . Finally, the price of 4.99: a bit high by mobile standards, even considering the total absence of in-app purchases.", "date": "2016-05-02", "grade": "7.0"}
