{"name": "SSX Tricky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ssx-tricky-7.html", "text": "Snowboarder profession The game offers a large number of well-characterized characters. In all there are a dozen, some will be immediately selectable while others, the strongest, will be unlocked by winning certain tournaments. Each snowboarder is personalized by a voice lent by numerous celebrities, who will not fail to exchange jokes with each other on the starting grid or after the outcome of a race, managing to create a particular atmosphere of challenge and competitiveness. After having selected our ~hero~ we will be given the possibility of configuring him under many parameters: we will be able to assign him our nick, read his identity card and his biography. Apart from the information relating to the characters, we will be able to customize it with numerous items of clothing (from tracksuits to very eccentric clothes, I won't tell you anything else so as not to spoil the surprise) and with a specific board, which will affect the snowboarder's performance. In fact, each of them has 4 skills (stability, speed, tricky, edging) with a certain number of base points. By winning the competitions in the game we will be charged extra points which will be used to increase the skills mentioned above. Even the table (board) used will add certain points to the skills, but this only concerns the more advanced ones that will obviously have to be unlocked. It will also be possible to have access to the tricky book, a collection of the most spectacular and imaginative evolutions created by the user, which the game will automatically record on the hard disk, so that they can be reviewed later. Each character is made in an excellent way, with a high number of polygons and with excellent animations made using three-dimensional models with a skeleton structure; the facial expressions are very convincing as well as the details of the suits and related boards in the game. The voices as I mentioned are lent by notable show business personalities such as David Arquette, Macy Gray, Oliver Platt, Ryan Wall and many more. The challenge begins SSX Tricky will allow us to try our hand at three main competitions, each with a different goal to complete. The first mode is the classic race, where snowboarders will compete along a track to conquer the first position. In this mode the speed of our alter ego essentially counts while the execution of any stunts takes a back seat, for this reason it is useful to have a suitable board that increases the speed value in the skill table. There will be checkpoints on the tracks where extra time will be assigned to continue the race. This mode will be present in the form of a single exhibition and in the World Circuits: a championship where we will have to get first place in each track to continue and unlock the next ones. In the championship, for each track, three races will take place, a quarter-final, a semi-final and the final, where the ranking will be decided, drawn up on the basis of the time taken to complete the course. Especially in World Circuits there will be a large number of bonuses to unlock, from tracks such as Tokyo Megaplex to Alaska up to costumes and snowboards. The second mode or competition is the showoff where we will have to perform the best stunts to earn the necessary points in order to reach the medals up for grabs: bronze, silver and gold. Here too it is possible to juggle a single event or in the World Circuits, trying to complete all the tracks with the gold medal. In the showoff, mode in which all our evolutions on the track will be evaluated, it will be crucial to use a board expressly dedicated to tricky and avoid falling after having performed an excellent stunt because the points will not be assigned (regarding the stunts and the scoring system I'll talk more about it in the Gameplay section). The last mode is the time challenger where you will have to race against the clock to conquer the track record. The practice mode is also available where we will be able to learn and practice trickies before performing them perfectly in the World Circuits championship. Tricky SSX Tricky is a game that ensures a control system that is very simple to learn and use and is revealed from the first minute of the game to be fun and immersive. It is in fact a purely arcade snowboarding game unlike its rival Amped, which appears more ~serious~ and simulative. SSX allows us to perform stunts and out of the ordinary evolutions that in reality could be deadly for all snowboarders. The characters will compete on mMany tracks located in various parts of the globe and equipped for the occasion with steep slopes, breathtaking curves and stepping stones towards the sky. All these factors will allow us to reach adequate speed and heights to try our hand at the most astounding and unimaginable Tricky which obviously will be rewarded with a cascade of points and perhaps a photo to be included in our ~hero's~ tricky book. To perform these evolutions it will be necessary to use specific keys, in this case A to give momentum and therefore to jump, Y, and X to make the snowboarder interact with his board (i.e. various grips using the hands or alternatively the legs) and B to increase speed if possible, while the left analog stick will be used to accelerate or brake and to manage the movements of the character during stunts. The right and left triggers are used to perform grabs: special moves that consist in moving the board from the axis of our alter ego (it's a bit difficult to explain but it's clear from the screen shots). But here we are finally at the most interesting moment of the gameplay section, or how to activate and perform the special tricky. Therefore, during the game on the left of the screen there is a bar, it is an indicator made up of rings which, once completed to the end, activate the tricky mode. However, you will be warned by a voice-over and an increase in the tempo of the excellent music of the game. Tricky mode will activate when you complete the rings on the bar, to do this you need to act in two different modes, either by knocking opponents off their boards during the race using the right analog stick or by performing tricks correctly and landing without falling (if you land incorrectly the points are deducted or halved from the original value). With the bar at maximum we will then be able to perform the special tricky and to use them the game will display on the screen the key combinations to press in order to perform them correctly (for example X or Y + B). If carried out correctly, the score assigned will be stratospheric and will heavily affect the result of the exhibition. I remind you that trickies are not essential in ~race~ mode, but they become so in showoff. Where eagles dare SSX Tricky provides the user with a large number of tracks located in different locations on the planet. The routes wind through impervious mountains or, alternatively, in immense structures with artificial snow and ice, such as the futuristic Tokyo Megaplex, for example. The routes are divided into well-defined categories, depending on the difficulty proposed to the user and initially only relatively simple ones will be available, such as Garibaldi, while continuing in the game and winning the proposed competitions, the more difficult ones will be unlocked. Every track is crafted down to the smallest detail, from the crowd packed grandstands at dizzying heights, to the starting grid that houses the snowboarders, to the ramps needed to pull off our most over-the-top stunts. Furthermore, in each path there will be secret shortcuts capable of making you gain precious seconds on your opponents, obviously when we use the ~race~ mode. Tokyo Megaplex is the example of a level that I could define as fabulous, unique to complete in 3 laps, full of elevated walkways, air gaisers that will literally send us into orbit, giving us the time and height necessary to perform the best tricks; there are also movable objects that will hinder our enterprise and glass that will shatter as we pass. But the most incredible track in terms of construction in my opinion is Alaska, the last one to unlock: incredible curves, dizzying jumps, glaciers to cross at full speed, tunnels under the mountains... in short, a real show, which you absolutely must try. In case you decide to use the showoff mode, where it becomes essential to earn the highest number of points, the tracks are enriched by railings and walkways intended for our evolutions: using them you can earn a good number of points always necessary to get the hard-earned medal of 'gold. Also along the way there will be ~snow crystals~ of different colors, if they are taken (just pass through them) our score for the next jump will be multiplied (yellow crystal X2, brown X3 and red X5). In conclusion, the variety of game scenarios is very high and you certainly won't get tired of racing in breathtaking and atmospheric tracks. ggraphics and sound From a graphic point of view, SSX is excellently made. The characters are composed of a high number of polygons and covered with splendid textures, the physical and facial animations are amazing as can be seen from the selection menu and from the pre-race shots. The tracks are made with a good dose of detail, especially the reflective surfaces which are very nice to see. In some routes there will be volumetric effects, solar reflections, and particle features such as smoke and sleet clouds raised by our snowboards. The game engine guarantees a high level of fluidity in the order of 60 frames per second, without slowdowns of any kind. The uploads deserve a special mention as they are very short and allow us to observe the geographical data of the track and of the chosen character, which will be shown during loading. As far as the sound is concerned, the game uses a very high level soundtrack composed of songs that perfectly recreate the atmosphere of the game: we have tunes that range from hip hop to rap. As already mentioned, each snowboarder is characterized by a voice borrowed directly from a star of the show, which it will be possible to observe during the dubbing, together with the songs from the soundtrack, thanks to the DVD extra section of the game. To mention the dolby digital support for those who have a home theater system. Multiplayer SSX Tricky offers the possibility of having exciting head-to-head matches between two players; obviously to do this you need two controllers inserted into the XBox. In the two-player mode, users will be able to try their hand at races, showoffs and time challengers competing against each other at the same time. Before the start of the challenge, each user will have the opportunity to choose the relative snowboarder and then the route and level of difficulty (amateur, semi-professional and professional). During the game, the screen will be divided into two parts, right and left, respectively for the first player and for the second. I personally tried this mode in the EA offices and I have to admit it's a lot of fun, especially in the ~race~ competition. Extra DVDs In the main menu of the game we will have the possibility to access an exclusive section called DVD extra, where a mountain of special material has been inserted concerning the development phase of SSX Tricky. We will be able to view special ~behind the scenes~ where we will assist in the creation of the animations of the characters and their interaction with the environment, observe the dubbing phases with the presence of famous celebrities and carefully listen to the interviews released by the development team. It will also be possible to listen in full to all the songs that make up the soundtrack of the game collected in the ~Jukebox~ item. Conclusions Concluding SSX Tricky turned out to be a great game, simple, intuitive and immersive at the right point. As you have been able to read in the course of the review, the title has many positive aspects, from the characters to the technical realization, which is really excellent. There are also many bonuses and extras to unlock which ensure considerable longevity, a factor which obviously will also be influenced by the chosen difficulty level. However, SSX is a purely arcade-style snowboarding game unlike the more simulative Amped and it is precisely this immediacy and perhaps superficiality that can alienate those who do not like the genre. Personally I've never been a fan of this type of video game, but playing SSX Tricky I had to change my mind, because I found myself in front of an arcade game with incredible potential. However, those who want a simulation must necessarily contact Amped. Pros: Fun and immediate Bonuses and extras Excellent technical realization Skyrocketing longevity Cons: The genre may not like it Materials: Screenshots Preview SSX Tricky Official site Tips Introduction EA Sports BIG is an internal division of Electronic Arts, and it is the team that dealt with the development of the first SSX that appeared for the PS2 and has now created its sequel called SSX Tricky, a term used to indicate spectacular evolutions performed by the most expert and courageous snowboarders. Unlike the first SSX, the new title was developed for three platforms: XBox, PS2 and GameCube. In particular", "date": "2002-06-23", "grade": null}
