{"name": "GRID", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grid-recensione.html", "text": "When we learned that Fernando Alonso had collaborated with Codemasters for the new chapter of GRID, whose review you can read, we jumped: we hoped that the series that began in 2008 had taken a more simulative path after the innovative momentum of the progenitor, in the following two iterations, had lost a bit of bite. The first doubts arose, however, right from the introductory tutorial that catapults the player into the middle of different types of races asking him to reach, within a few laps, the best possible position: the laps are too few to be able to unbalance himself, but the commentary ~arcade~ and the ~technical~ aids of the track engineer have prepared the ground for what will turn out to be a rival of Ridge Racer rather than Forza Motorsport. But let's proceed in order. Bind Also in this episode the production of Codemasters focuses on the single player mode, with an articulated and varied career. There's not much room for personalization other than name, number and crest, so we're ready to fire up the engines in just a few moments. The GRID World Series is divided into six categories according to the cars admitted; five of these are in turn made up of thirteen mini-championships (made up of a minimum of one and a maximum of four Grands Prix), while the sixth is a collection of twenty-six events in which it is not possible to choose the car. Not all tests are immediately available: they are unlocked as the previous ones are successfully completed (i.e. finishing in the top positions). At the end the Showdown takes place, the conquest of which helps to give access to the final championship. There are three types of races: the traditional ones (there is also the possibility of qualifying by attempting the best time with a flying lap), the Time Attacks (where the winner is the one with the fastest lap) and the point-to-point ones, where the track is not closed. One feature they have in common is brevity: apart from rare exceptions, four/five minutes pass from the green lights to the checkered flag. Naturally it is possible to face a personalized challenge and there is also online play supported by RaceNet servers. Due to the exclusive nature of the code we were unable to test the multiplayer which at the time of the test only featured the ~destruction derby~ mode already known from previous episodes. The carreer In the past we had witnessed some narrative attempts that could add interest to the main mode, i.e. the career; this is not the case with this GRID where all you have to do is tackle the various races in any order you like. The podiums earn money with which to buy new cars, while the computer judges the driving style (based on the ideal line, overtaking, driving cleanliness) by providing experience points. The latter serve to increase the level of the pilot who, as he progresses, is rewarded with initially inaccessible emblems and liveries. The car fleet is good and includes about sixty models belonging to some of the most prestigious manufacturers (although there are no sacred monsters such as Lamborghini and Bugatti); credit must be given to the designers for having brought some jewels back into the spotlight such as the Ferrari 512BB Le Mans and the Porsche 935/78 ~Moby Dick~. Of course, DLCs are planned that will expand the range in the future. Variety reigns supreme: Group N cars such as the Volkswagen Golf or Audi A3 are joined by American muscle cars, rear-wheel drive Japanese cars, Group A racing cars and even single-seaters including the Renault R26 in which Fernando Alonso won his second Formula 1 world championship in 2006. There is no shortage of old glories among which we like to remember the Alfa 155 with DTM-like livery. Physics and AI The driving model is, once again, distinctly arcade. All cars share a tendency to lose the rear, whether you're driving a 1970s rear-wheel drive or a modern-day ~all-forward~ one. The driving aids make recovering from a skid easier and the ~bouncy~ barriers make cornering even less demanding, so we recommend reducing the level of ESP and ABS intervention. Of course, you have to keep an eye on the health of the car which becomes more difficult to control as it gets damaged (until it is completely destroyed), but it is a small price to pay. The famous ~rewind~ mode could not be missing with which to go back a few seconds to correct the wrong trajectory. If on the one hand we must recognize that there is a certain difference in feeling depending on the category, on the other it seemed to us that within the same group the cars behave a bit too similarly. Le Touring are the ones that have convinced the most, the GTs on the contrary are the ones that have offered the least satisfaction, above all because of their mass, which appeared too light. Artificial intelligence is one of the most painful keys. As usual, the only way to move up the standings is to beat your opponents, given that with clean driving it is practically impossible to overtake someone. CPU machines lock the door as if no one were inside and have the obnoxious habit of ramming into the player. Obviously they are almost completely immune to the same action: try to send out those in front of you and you will realize that you are dealing with a tank. The characteristically heralded nemesis is a state in which one or more opponents transform themselves who feel too targeted and which leads them to be more lethal than Senna at Suzuka in 1990. There are two observations to raise: the first is that the ~berserk~ state is limited to the GP in progress and the second, and most important, is that the logic that leads the opponent to anger is random. Hitting the person in front or using him as a bank to stay on track does not always activate the mode, while it can happen that overtaking on the inside causes those who have suffered it to get out of hand. To counteract there should be a more manipulable teammate than Valtteri Bottas, but, apart from a surrender in holding the position, it is an appendix useful only to bring, with one's placement, further money into the player's coffers . The technique With its proven EGO engine Codemasters plays it safe, even the times when it was able to amaze us are long gone. Just launch the original title (dated 2008), which shares some cars and tracks with the current one, to realize that, in eleven years, the steps forward have been marginal. The models of the cars are however well detailed (with slips in the internal view, impractical to use) and so is the creation of the tracks. We liked the ~real~ ones better than the citizens created for the occasion by joining some streets of the most evocative metropolises, such as Havana, Barcelona and San Francisco. In the latter cases, the designers, in addition to preferring simplified layouts (fast folds connected by 90-degree bends), did not take into account the basic rules of motoring, with an almost total absence of escape routes and very high sidewalks scattered in the most dangerous. Everything takes a back seat thanks to the high speed of execution and the scenography offered by the environmental effects, well done and evocative especially during twilight. There is no shortage of races at night and in the rain, but the climatic conditions are not dynamic (and in truth they are not missed, considering the short duration of the races). GRID is very scalable and we are sure that even less demanding configurations than the one used are able to obtain excellent frame rates. The audio side shows the side: already mentioned initially of the unsuccessful dubbing, here we add that even the noise of the engines is not convincing. The rhombuses are all a bit similar and in general there is the impression that they are effects recycled from other productions of the British software house.", "date": "2019-10-08", "grade": "7.0"}
