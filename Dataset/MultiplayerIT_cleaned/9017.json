And it can definitely be said that the developers of 11 Bit Studio have done their job in the best possible way. Saddam was better Anomaly: Warzone Earth can count on an interesting setting, which however is not supported by a real plot: the player is called in a very brisk way to take on the role of a commander of an unspecified military company, committed to countering the 'alien invasion which has been the object of a future Baghdad in reality not too different from the current one. The extraterrestrials have littered the Iraqi capital with defensive towers of various kinds, and the aim of the game is precisely to penetrate the enemy defenses during fifteen different missions. As we said at the beginning, it is a total reversal of the canonical rules of strategic tower defense, and the result is a balanced, exciting and well-crafted product in all its components. The mechanics are very simple, so much so that a few tutorial screens are enough to archive the matter: we start by selecting the units to be deployed on the battlefield, initially limited in number and type but which are unlocked by progressing in the campaign, arriving to count on a good variety of vehicles with various attributes in terms of range, firepower and resistance to damage. Then it is necessary to plan the route of the convoy, acting with simple taps on a map that can be called up at any time for any changes to the itinerary. From here on, the units move independently, following the pre-established tracks and attacking the enemy towers that are within range: however, the user still has to carefully observe the situation, acting in real time to take advantage of the various bonuses at his disposal. By destroying the alien emplacements, in fact, it is possible to obtain a series of power-ups ranging from a repair tool that restores the shields of the vehicles, passing through holograms that attract the fire of neighboring opponents and arriving at real smart bombs that any objective on the map. These are obviously limited resources, which must be dosed with skill and which constitute one of the strategic pillars of Anomaly: Warzone Earth. The others are represented by the juxtaposition and typology of the enemy towers, which are also different in terms of solidity, range and power of their weapons; moreover, the scenarios are often littered with resources essential for buying new units or improving existing ones, whose awkward position forces one to decide in advance whether to risk a more arduous but profitable path or whether to aim directly at the final objective. Which, however, differs satisfactorily over the course of the fifteen missions of the campaign, including activities of escorting allied vehicles, destroying specific outposts and so on. It is therefore easy to be absorbed by the 11 Bit Studio title, also thanks to a considerable level of challenge distributed equally between the three difficulty steps, an impeccable interface and an always excellent level design. Furthermore, once the main mode has been completed, two alternative sections dedicated to the most passionate strategists are available, i.e. a sort of Survival Mode and a reinterpretation of the main stages with different objectives from the originals. The picture is completed by a first-rate technical sector on the iPad, strong in very detailed and defined graphics and which does not skimp on tasty light effects, while on the iPhone it is a little more difficult to understand what is happening on the screen, due of a slight aliasing and the smallness of the polygonal models.
