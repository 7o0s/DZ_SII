The now portable console from Apple is no different and boasts some particularly inspired titles of the genre, including the new Real Tennis 09 from Gameloft. Available directly on the AppStore at the price of 3.99 Euros, the effort of the transalpine team brings a technically excellent product to the iPhones, especially in terms of graphics and audio, but with many questionable aspects starting from a particularly demanding gameplay and poor care about the game modes. Real Tennis 09 does not get lost in preambles and immediately presents the player with everything it has to offer directly in the initial menu; Match Veloce in fact alternates with Championship, Tournament and Multiplayer. An overview of the challenges is a must even if it is difficult to find something truly innovative: Match Veloce is the classic friendly challenge that can be tackled alone or in pairs with the CPU against other digitized opponents by choosing the playing field, the level of difficulty , the number of Games for each Set and the quantity of Sets per Match. A fleet of ten players is made available to the user, who will however perhaps find himself lost due to the lack of Real Tennis 09 licenses. In fact, no real name is present in Gameloft's latest production and the entire experience will have to be faced with characters of the ~caliber~ of the German Takener, the Russian Kantikova and the Spanish Sainz. After choosing the virtual alter-ego of the moment it's up to the field: seven available and here too no license for the use of real names but only the simple names of states and localities. Game, Set & Match Championship and Tournament should be the flagship modes for game longevity, even if in reality they are very similar to each other, since there are no differences in thickness except in the ideology of the final goal. In the Championship, the tennis player is called to climb the top of the World Ranking by first winning less famous competitions, increasing his or her fame, while the Tournament is consumed in a direct elimination challenge with the classic cup up for grabs. The bad news, but in common, is the exclusion of the possibility of modifying the match options: to win the set you are forced to reach six games won, and taking the match home means winning the best of three sets, consequently the game is not really a hit and run, but something more challenging and against the idea of immediacy and speed usually associated with a portable console. Lastly, the Multiplayer mode implemented only locally and available only for 1vs1 challenges, no cooperative to be able to face matches together with a friend. The real game begins right on the field where the classic virtual touch keys are displayed on the screen: left pad for player movements and right button for racket shots. The oscillometer of the iPhone is exploited at the moment of the serve, in which the aim icon is moved by tilting the mobile phone, but for the rest of the match everything is left to the virtual pad. Just the gameplay of Real Tennis 09 is the first obstacle to overcome given its particular non-immediacy linked to a cut that is perhaps too simulative. In fact, the tennis player's movements follow a real model causing delays in direction changes, not to mention the difficulty in using non-physical keys which is a common problem with many iPhone titles. Everything gets complicated, especially in the most demanding moments of coordination between movements and shooting. However, once the control method has been put in your pocket, Real Tennis 09 is a lot of fun once you learn the different shots available and especially when the much-acclaimed smash starts: the Gameloft Sports team has implemented a short bullet time just to enhance the moment of total release. The graphics sector is undoubtedly the flagship of Real Tennis 09 thanks to its really well recreated 3D polygonal models and the animations are never lost in strange twists. Perhaps the classic desperate dive to recover the ball was abused too much, making the player lose a few too many moments. The same care has been given to the environment and to the audio sector, truly perfect during the game in which the points alternating with the screams of the athletes are marked. The tested version is 1.1.2", "date": "2009-07-22", "grade": "6.5"}
