All those who played Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008 know it well, and Xbox 360 owners who were able to enjoy the two downloadable contents released by Rockstar Games following the success of their new generation GTA know it even better: Microsoft exclusives for months, now The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony can also be played by PC and PlayStation 3 owners thanks to a package that offers the two additional episodes simultaneously on a single disc. A new immersion of about twenty hours in the filthiest meanders of a city steeped in violence, greed, corruption and villainy: how to resist? The Lost and Damned The first download content released for Grand Theft Auto IV is in fact the one that should chronologically be played first. Nothing will stop you from starting your adventure with The Ballad of Gay Tony, obviously, also because in reality the events of the two episodes take place almost simultaneously with the adventures of Niko Bellic in the original story. Technically, it is not even necessary to have played Grand Theft Auto IV to understand the story of these additional episodes, but the numerous more or less direct references to situations and characters from the original are the icing on the cake of this pack. The Lost and Damned, for example, will put you in the role of Johnny Klebitz, nicknamed the Jew, second in command of the gang of bikers known as the Lost. Trouble is, Johnny doesn't approve of gang chairman Billy Gray's belligerent attitude, especially when he leads to deadly shootouts with another biker gang, the Angels of Death. A power struggle made of betrayal and deception will then unleash: the fulcrum of the story are these motorcyclists and it is on them that Rockstar Games has adapted the mechanics of Grand Theft Auto IV. Although most of the missions of The Lost and Damned recall the structure, at times even a little repetitive, of Niko Bellic's dirty business, the improvement to the gameplay related to motorcycles has been such as to make the experience even more fresh and engaging . These vehicles are now more resistant and powerful, it is even possible to shoot while driving a motorbike (perhaps using some of the new weapons conceived for this episode) and most of the missions involve the whole gang in firefights aboard the racing cars or on foot: the player is encouraged to help his teammates so that they survive, improving their performance a bit like in an RPG, so much so that it is even possible to call them for help via a phone call. The Lost and Damned is perhaps the least engaging Liberty City episode from a narrative point of view, also considering the rather unpleasant characterization of the protagonist, but the proposed contents are very numerous: new theft missions, optional mini-games, other seagulls to find and, of course, a brand new multiplayer mode, probably the best of the two installments. Among the numerous game modes, two in particular deserve mention for their originality: in one we will have to whiz around on a motorcycle at full speed to avoid the assaults of a helicopter, in the other a player will have to drive a vehicle with a witness on board while a group of players on motorcycles will have to try to kill him. The Ballad of Gay Tony The second additional episode for Grand Theft Auto IV instead sins on the multi-player side, in fact offering only four traditional modes, recycled on those already offered by the original two years ago. Moreover, for some abstruse reason the game servers seem not to be common to the two episodes, which makes the already modest amount of connected users even more meagre. The single player campaign is excellent and far surpasses that of The Lost and Damned. This time the player plays Luis Lopez, a real killer in the pay of Tony Prince, owner of the most famous chain of red light clubs in Liberty City. Luis has arrived, we could say: he is rich, powerful and incredibly ruthless. The characterization of this anti-hero is entrusted to a handful of missions related to his past, but the real focus of the story is Gay Tony and his shady business. Luis will have to work for some of the craziest characters in Liberty City, starting with old acquaintances like the Russian psychopath Bulgarin. On the other hand, the missions of Yusuf, the son of a sheik, are hilarious, involving Luis in thefts or attacks bordering on the impossible: given the considerable length of some missions, Rockstar Games has finally implemented a form of checkpoint that makes a I distantly remember the moments offrustration in the original game (this feature also affects The Lost and Damned). The episode adds salt to the structure of the missions: a new important mechanic is the use of parachutes, given that Luis will have to use them to land on buildings or moving vehicles. Similarly, some missions will involve you in air battles between helicopters, a bit complicated to manage especially as regards aiming, unfortunately without lock-on, but definitely hilarious. The variety of vehicles and weapons in this episode is truly remarkable and the missions are extremely diverse. Even the optional and secondary activities prove to be interesting and enjoyable: among them, the administration of the Maisonette 9 nightclub. The place is yours and you can do whatever you want with it: you can participate in the erotic shows in the form of funny dance mini-games or play the bouncer. As if that weren't enough, each mission of The Ballad of Gay Tony will be replayable at any time and evaluated with a final score based on your performance. And on PC? The PC version of Episodes from Liberty City is identical in content to its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 counterparts. Windows users can therefore enjoy the adventures of Jhonny Klebitz and Louis Lopez, moving from the underground motorcycle gang scene to the champagne and glitter life of those who spends his life on the sidelines of the owner of some of the hottest clubs in the city. Also in this case the two expansions are stand alone, therefore playable even without having GTAIV installed on the computer, and offer more than twenty hours of narration, missions and small or large improvements, which pass through a series of additions on the front of weapons, vehicles and characters involved in the events, to which are added all the changes made to the gameplay, such as those relating to driving motorcycles. Of course, there are also the new multiplayer modes, separate from those of the original title and from each other, so perhaps not destined for a very long life in terms of community but still interesting enough to spend a few hours in company. The game has no activation problems thanks to a finally acceptable drm, which also allows you to play offline and without the mandatory Rockstar Social Club membership, while the adoption of Games for Windows Live guarantees support for both Achievements and the official pad Microsoft, which can be switched to the use of mouse and keyboard at any time without going through any menu. Episodes from Liberty City incorporates all the engine improvements already made for GTAIV and adds another patch released at the exit that should increase performance and fix some minor bugs. The result, as on the console, is a free roaming environment which, two years after its release, remains unbeaten in terms of content complexity and quality, always ready to react credibly to the user's actions. The parameters to work on to best adapt the graphic rendering to your machine are sufficient, from the quality of the textures to the shadows, passing through the manual adjustment of the depth of the visual horizon and the relative appearance of vehicles, pedestrians and various details. Unfortunately and although the two episodes are very suggestive even when not tested with the maximum settings, several frame rate problems remain: stability is not perfect and to go above 30 images per second on average when outdoors in the most agitated situations , unless you own a more than performing machine, it is not very easy; a little more optimization work wouldn't go amiss. In short, overall, even on PC, we are talking about a mandatory purchase, also considering that the price is 29.90 euros for the boxed version and about 20 euros on Steam in digital delivery, where, however, you have to download about 17 GB of data . Either way, a bargain.", "date": "2010-04-27", "grade": "8.8"}
