{"name": "Non temete l'apocalisse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73382-darksiders-non-temete-lapocalisse.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 We were saying a few pages later, on our site, that 2010 in videogames will start with a bang, above all thanks to titles belonging to the action genre, with all the necessary variations. Darksiders has perhaps undergone a longer gestation than it should and has not obtained an adequate sounding board, at least until today. Not bad, because it is the final quality that counts, and the title developed by Vigil Games has an enviable quantity of them. Just like when a topic is ~embraced~ by many and returns to fashion, even in Darksiders the main theme sees the balance of the universe, under its own interpretation. Hell and Heaven have always been opposed in this context, with Men in the middle representing that variable gone mad and without apparent masters. Something, as usual, does not add up, and although a pact has been signed, supported by 7 seals still intact, Hell and Heaven literally fall like meteorites on Earth, triggering a battle with disastrous consequences. You (we?) are War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse who has the task, while the other three are on vacation who knows where, to investigate what is happening and punish those guilty of this incident. Obviously not everything will go smoothly and Guerra will find himself fighting on several fronts, wandering through the game universe to discover all the plots and conspiracies that characterize this intricate system. Darksiders, it should be specified, is the first official title developed by Vigil Games, but among its ranks we have several well-known faces of the videogame scene and above all among the founders there are the ideas and the pen of a certain Joe Madureira, designer within Marvel very well known, especially in America. Joe Mad distinguished himself from the classic trait of American Comics for being able to inculcate typical manga influences in his drawings, giving his characters a softer and even more pleasant to see trait. The result, in the case of Darksiders, is explosive. Long live Manga Comics! Without any doubt we can in fact say that the creation of the characters in the game is among the best ever seen in a video game, in terms of detail, design, use of colors, but also polygonal mass. The various Guerra, Tiamat, Samael (note also names from various religious beliefs) are truly exceptional, they give the idea of fullness and fully reveal the skill of their designer. The game world created for Darksiders takes up the classic scheme that provides for multiple completely different settings, perhaps connected by underground cavities or giant buildings. Not the height of originality, but the thing is proposed so well that it was missed a bit and, like the trait for the characters, their realization shines both from an artistic point of view and as a variety. We pass from gloomy settings to other brightly colored ones, passing through aquatic, sandy ones and so on, all with a skilful use of lights, colors and variety of textures and structures, a real elaborate work to give the idea of player to find himself in an imaginative world and entangled in a great war, with different touches of class such as boss fights under pouring rain reproduced to perfection, giant spiders that infest dungeons corrupted by them, sandstorms that hide giant worms ready to gobble up War in one bite. If we analyze the title in more detail, we certainly don't notice textures overflowing with detail like those of a Gears of War or Uncharted, just as we have a frame rate that suffers several drops in larger environments or in more numerous fights. Even the internal structures suffer more from the minor presence of particle effects or structural detail, but the programmers were very good at inserting light sources often and willingly even in closed spaces, in order to return a better impact. Finally, we were struck by the precision of the shadows projected by each structure and character, as well as the correct and not excessive use of bloom and light sources themselves, which return that extra touch in a final rendering key. Darksiders is completely translated into Italian and we must say that we really liked the adaptation of the lyrics and the names (the same War, Rovina and company don't make it bad in the long run), as well as for the voice mold, which can boast among the others by the same voice actor seen in Crackdown, LittleBigPlanet, Infamous and so on. It is a pity that the same care has not been taken in the technical realization of the dubbing itself, in the sense that the voices seem to be poorly integrated with the ambient noises and sometimes poorly expressedssive in relation to what is happening on the screen, making everything seem ~stuck~ to the rest of the game system. The music is well made, contextual to what is happening on the screen and does its job well, even if it cannot boast of memorable tracks by construction. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten about the Darksiders gameplay, which until proven otherwise is still the main aspect in evaluating a video game. First of all, it is good to frame the Vigil Games title exactly, which although it seems at first glance an action, in reality contains many more elements of adventure and puzzles than one might think. As mentioned, the primary purpose is to wander within the game world to track down various bosses and demons in order to then reach the final one and punish him properly. To hinder the path of War there are, beyond the enemies, several passages accessible only after having acquired certain objects and skills, as well as rather large and intricate environmental puzzles, which are often represented by entire sections of the game to be solved with logic and with the gadgets owned by the main protagonist. In fact, the combat component represents no more than 25/30% of the game and includes the broadsword (usable using the square button) in War's possession to get the better of the enemies, with the double jump, various combos, the parry and the possibility , using the left lower back, to lock on to a particular enemy. Each opponent can be terminated with a specific sequence and with the appearance of the circle button on their head. No timed events however, everything is automated, spectacular and different for each type of enemy, as well as the opening of the various energy boxes, which requires a single press of the dedicated button to be able to be unhinged. Guerra can ~feed~ on some souls, divided into three types, those dedicated to the energy itself, to anger, which represents the mana for magical abilities, and finally the remaining blue ones, which can be used with Vulgrim, a character game key where you can buy new fighting techniques, spells and upgrades, up to the ability to move faster from one setting to another when necessary. Playstation 3 trophies Darksiders offers 43 trophies, of which 3 are Gold and 13 Silver. To unlock them all, you need to finish the game on the highest difficulty level, find all the secret artifacts and armor pieces, kill enemies in a variety of ways, all without having to finish the game twice. Nothing too complicated then if not a lot of dedication in terms of dedicated hours to find all the secrets. Metroidian puzzle? As already mentioned, in addition to the classic broadsword, the main protagonist also has a whole series of secondary weapons and gadgets useful not only to get the better of the enemy, but also to overcome otherwise impassable passages. For example, a sort of steel fist, capable of breaking ice barriers blocking the road, or the grappling hook, indispensable for reaching places located at a great distance. Continuing in the advanced stages of the game, the balance between the action phase and the exploration and puzzle phase leans in favor of the latter, providing pleasant sections in which you have to use the new skills acquired from Guerra to continue. The work done in this sense is quite interesting and always aimed at combining the gadgets in one's possession with environmental puzzles of different sizes. For example in one you have to paper the wall with some sort of sticky material to the point of detonation, then use your rotating blade in sequence first on a lit torch, then on the aforementioned material to ignite it in sequence. And again, in the advanced stages of the game you have a chronosphere, which allows you to activate a time gap between two points that you can cross: well, you have to take advantage of this feature to reach high or distant locations, perhaps on moving platforms and always remembering that the gate can be equipped with a maximum of one entry point and one exit point. Even the clashes with the bosses clearly denote the puzzle inclination of the title, as they always have a weak point that must be tracked down and then exploited with the objects at one's disposal, perhaps by exploiting elements of the scenario and repeating everything several times until the best. They do not sin even in variety, and each one offers a rather different challenge from the previous one, together with the setting and the types of attacks of your opponent. Among the most beautiful we have the one in the cineree lands, dwhere on horseback of Rovina (a steed that is also useful for moving quickly when you have to go back in search of new passages or extras) you are chased by a large worm and you have to attack it from behind with your gun, a scene very nice to see and play. In short, level design and variety at levels well beyond the average, with a constant progression of the main character which also translates into numerous secret areas, upgrades and more to be found later, with backtracking that is never too invasive thanks to the aforementioned portals of Vulgrim and the horse Ruin. However, there are some critical points. First of all, many elements, if taken individually, are already seen and in any case do not offer memorable points in their realization, especially the fights that sin in strategy and are not tiring also because they are not present in excessive numbers. The parade didn't convince us and above all it doesn't respond well to commands while the lock system on enemies with the camera works well only in the presence of a single one. for the rest it is preferable to use the free one. Some sections, fortunately few, seem to have been placed there to lengthen the broth, which is strange in any case since the main adventure needs at least 14-16 hours to be completed, which increase rapidly if, before the final part, we dedicate ourselves to using all the powers acquired so far to visit those previously inaccessible passages or to find all the secret objects scattered around the map. Also because, once the title is completed, there is no possibility of restarting it with the characteristics and souls acquired, just as there is no new mode or extra waiting for the player, a pity after having fully appreciated that that Darksiders has to offer.", "date": "2009-12-30", "grade": "9.2"}
