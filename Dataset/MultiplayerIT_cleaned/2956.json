Around us solitude, in this battle that promises a rematch with each of our victories. The Throne is ours, but it is an ephemeral conquest. Once seated, we can do nothing but reach out to take our weapon. Then, the tragedy. The unthinkable. The terror. Out of toilet paper. Everyone has been there, everyone has seen their crown fall. Experienced rulers betrayed by a distraction. How to do? Which hero can save us? Of course he! The white and shiny Nuovo Rotolo. But where? How can it get to us? To find out, squeeze your buttocks and keep reading our review of Give me toilet paper! This is an Art Attack! We'll have to roll and avoid obstacles in Give me toilet paper! Okay, let's get serious for a second (but not too much). What is Give me toilet paper! exactly, apart from a GOTY 2023 pretender? Well, it's a platformer for Nintendo Switch, already available for the modest sum of 4 euros (to help you, 4 euros is about 8-10 rolls of toilet paper). In short, it is a collection of 32 levels in which we are a roll of toilet paper that must complete a path to be able to reach the hands of the poor man sitting on the Throne who has no way of cleaning himself where the sun does not shine. The idea is crazy in itself, we realize that, but you still don't know the most interesting part. To play you need a roll of toilet paper. As well as a fairly large piece of stiff cardboard and some tissues. It's basically an Art Attack. The idea is this: insert the left Joy-Con inside the roll of toilet paper (new, of course), use the tissues to block the controller from leaving its new home and position the roll-controller on the piece of cardboard. To control your character you will literally have to roll the roll-controller left and right, tilting the cardboard. Can we say we love the Japanese? Yes? Yes! But here we have to make a big confession. We cheated a bit in our game. We didn't actually use the cardboard to roll the controller, we just put the roll on the ground and moved it left and right. This gave us a level of control that we found refreshing and eliminated any frustration that came with the awkwardness of handling the skew of the cardboard. The official control system of Give me toilet paper! and this We also add that at each new level you have to pick up the right Joy-Con to kick off, so when placing the cardboard with the roll it is too easy to drop it and have to reposition it. If you play the game as a party game with friends and want to have a laugh, use the method suggested by the game, but if you just want to play an absurd platformer, do as we do. Easy but satisfying The dangers increase from level to level By cheating, as mentioned, you gain precision and the difficulty actually decreases. However, we had to repeat various levels several times before being able to reach the finish line, since the difficulty is not too low. In each level there are various dangers, such as rotating blades, laser beams, spiked rolls, sharp spikes and more. The design is always nice, with short levels, but full of traps and always with a new idea for the next area. Sometimes you have to find the right path, other times you have to guess the correct pace to pass through mobile hazards, in some cases you get to the base and then go up and down again. There are springs, fans that lift us up in the air, arms that grab us and move us up and down. It is much more well-kept than one might think at first sight, we assure you. The joy in her eyes is worth any challenge We're not talking about a platformer that will redefine the genre, but the uniqueness of the control system and the average quality of the levels creates a fun, streamlined and satisfying experience. The problem with all of this is that the 32 levels are completed in the span of half an hour or so if you check the roll by cheating, as you only die a few times. However, we don't think it can go all the way to playtime, even with the original control system. Having reached the end (no spoilers, but it is more exciting and dramatic than many other games), we realized that we would have gladly played again: had there been three times as many levels, but also four times as many, we would have spent hours in front of the television without problems. Honestly, we're hoping for a bigger sequel with new ideas. Even the sound component could be a little more varied, given that there is only one musbackground ica, but for the little that it lasts that's okay. Out of zeal (veil?), we repeat that the control system claims to disconnect the Joy-Con, so Give me toilet paper! it is not compatible with Nintendo Switch Lite.
