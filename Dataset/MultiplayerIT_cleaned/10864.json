{"name": "Hamster Mansion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hamster-mansion.html", "text": "The very nice hamsters are often the protagonists of video games and cartoons, and on the net there are avalanches of images that portray them in the most absurd poses. Given the influence of these small rodents on the public, the developers of Glu have seen fit to use them as protagonists for their new title. Moreover, Hamster Mansion is not the usual action game with an arcade connotation to which the Californian house has so far accustomed us, but it is an adventure with many facets, in which you have to visit stages to be unlocked from time to time in search of objects and of new allies. The hamster we are controlling has been thrown out of the city of rodents, but after a series of vicissitudes he finds the ancient Palazzo dei Criceti and is invited to live there. His task, from now on, will be to restore the ancient splendor of that residence, expanding its spaces and gradually attracting new tenants. In these situations, the game behaves like a real editor, in which we can modify the Palace at will, adding new rooms, connecting pipes, various objects and so on. Once we find our new home, we will be able to access the various stages using a system of compressed air elevators, after which we will have to concentrate on collecting coins and solving simple puzzles based on the operation of devices and machines. When our hamster is near a mechanism that can be activated, just press the 5 key to allow him to access otherwise inaccessible areas. The controls are very simple, with the d-pad for movement and jumping of the character, and precisely the 5 key to interact with the environment or resort to temporary special powers. We will face dozens of more or less dangerous enemies, and often the only way to survive will be to avoid them: in theory, it would be enough to jump on their heads, as per tradition for platformers, to eliminate them; in practice, collision detection leaves something to be desired and we will often lose precious energy in the simple attempt to eliminate an opponent. Our hamster can climb a large number of surfaces and go through underground tunnels, which is what we will do in most cases: the action is mainly based on exploration and on the calculation of useful times in order not to suffer damage, with the ~collection~ phase which can be interrupted at any time to return to the Palazzo dei Criceti. The game boasts decent graphics, with good character design and some variety in the sprites that populate the locations. It must be said that the choice of generally ~dull~ colors clashes a bit with the nature of the product, which should perhaps have resorted to a more lively and cheerful visual impact. The filling graphic elements tend to repeat themselves, even if this is not noticed that much thanks to the good arrangement of the objects within the stages, while the sound accompaniment is too essential, almost silent, and therefore can be deactivated without problems. As mentioned above, there are some problems with collision detection, which are accompanied by a not always punctual response to inputs.
