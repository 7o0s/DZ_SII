{"name": "X-Men Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-legends.html", "text": "Forgotten legends If the fights certainly don't shine for clarity, the same goes for the on-screen quick menu dedicated to the use of objects: based on almost indecipherable icons, it often forces the user to go through the less agile team status screen (the , to be clear, also dedicated to the level-up and equipment of the characters) even if only to use a simple medi-kit. And also considering the substantial ineptitude of one's companions and their constant need for care, frequent access to this painting certainly cannot be said to be pleasant. Although it is undoubtedly penalized by structural ingenuity of the genre, X-Men Legends cannot however be considered a failure: the gameplay, however plagued by flaws and tending towards monotony, proves to be able to constitute a discreet pastime for fans of the genre, complete moreover, an interesting cooperative mode via Bluetooth. The technical realization then denotes a good overall quality: graphically, the Activision product presents 2D backdrops with a remarkable level of detail, on which two-dimensional characters also move with appreciable modeling and provided with a set of certainly fluid and convincing animations. Ups and downs instead as regards the sound front: the presence of spoken dialogues is undoubtedly welcome, but unfortunately the game proves to be rather ~silent~, with effects reduced to a minimum and music that is activated only in the presence of enemies on the screen. In line with various other aspects of the Activision production, in short, even in this case a little more care would have been needed. Direct conversion of the homonymous action-rpg that has recently achieved good success on home consoles, this X-Men Legends for N-Gage tries to repeat the fortune of its older brother, proposing its peculiar playful characteristics. As has already happened on other occasions for various conversions to the Nokia handheld, however, such a transposition work has not always proved successful. Now let's see if the Activision product will be able to dispel this unfortunate tradition Comment X-Men Legends is a rather controversial product: if on the one hand it can undoubtedly be appreciable for the fidelity to the structure of the original title released for the major consoles, on the other it annoys for the gross approximation of certain fundamental elements of the gameplay. We therefore find ourselves in the hands of a technically well-crafted and conceptually valid action-rpg, but which under a strictly playful profile lacks various naiveties that debase its potential. Despite everything, however, X-Men Legends remains a discreet product, certainly recommended for lovers of the genre with N-Gage. Pros: Good graphics Faithful to the game mechanics of the original Cooperative multiplayer via Bluetooth Cons: Rather monotonous gameplay Often confusing fights Cheesy realization of some technical and playful aspects Little mutants grow up X-Men Legends immediately demonstrates its intention to offer N-Gage users a playful experience in all respects similar to that offered by the original title: starting from the storyline, re-proposed in this portable version in its entirety, with lots of movies and spoken dialogues between the characters (appreciable despite the high data compression). But it is not only the facade elements that have been faithfully transported in portable format, but the entire game structure of the Activision action-rpg. As in the version for home consoles, therefore, the user finds himself having to manage a team of four X-Men, choosing which hero to command directly (it is possible to change character at any time) and assigning a behavioral pattern to the remaining three elements of the party, managed by the CPU. The rest is pure action-rpg academy: one moves within the scenarios, faces enemies, collects objects to exploit in combat or to equip and accumulate experience points in order to level up and enhance physical characteristics of the characters and their related super-powers. And so far so good. Too bad that X-Men Legends naively slips precisely on the most important aspects of its gameplay, or the fights and team management during the action. Engaging in a fight with an enemy almost always leads to confusing situations, with party members running, hitting and dying without the player being able to realize it. And even the attacks of the character controlled by the user himself do not appear clear: poor management of the interactions between the sprites means that there is nono visible difference between a hit and a miss. Of course, there is a special indicator designed to indicate the remaining energy of one's enemy: but for some strange reason, it always tends to appear in fits and starts on the screen, thus making it essentially unusable.", "date": "2005-02-18", "grade": null}
