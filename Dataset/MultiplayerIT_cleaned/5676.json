The need for greater support from third parties was certainly perceived, just as the not particularly comforting sales figures were observed with some concern. Yet the period was, to say the least, exciting for users, with the manufacturer's renewed commitment of Kyoto and a 10-month window capable of seeing titles such as The Wonderful 101, Rayman Legends, Super Mario 3D World, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Mario Kart 8 come to light. Unfortunately, however, that did not turn out to be the big relaunch dusting of Wii U, but more sadly the pinnacle of the career of a home console ultimately destined to be the least sold in the entire history of Nintendo. To open and close this 2016 which will probably be the last year of ~real~ life for Wii U, while waiting and hoping for an NX called to shoulder an enormous responsibility, it is almost symbolic that the hero of the Triforce, that Link protagonist of some of the most beautiful stories lived on the hardware of the big N and one of the most imperishable defenders of a way of understanding the video game that can only be conceived in the society of the new president Kimishima. Twilight Princess HD is a solid and well-crafted remake, if perhaps not entirely necessary Ten years ago If the most important and awaited appointment is undoubtedly the one with the new episode of the series, hopefully destined to come out at the end of the year with the probable double publication for Wii U and NX, in these first few months it is instead another remake that takes center stage of the scene, in an attempt to at least partially alleviate the chronic lack of games and the schizophrenic distribution of the same that has unfortunately characterized a good part of the life of the console. Of course, for the long-time fan it can only be strange this high, if not excessive frequency with which the name of The Legend of Zelda resonates in the ears lately, compared to the long but exciting waits that separated the various chapters a few years ago : between reissues, remakes, Virtual Consoles, spin-offs and so on, it is inevitable to find yourself reflecting on the opportunity for an exploitation that risks inflating and impoverishing such a precious brand. But anyhow, these are the more or less obligatory choices of a Nintendo that is going through a crucial moment in its history. The episode chosen this time to return to the spotlight, even in a rather predictable way, is that Twilight Princess which was released at the end of 2006 simultaneously on the now retired GameCube and on the brand new Wii. No one at the time would have ever imagined that the new hardware would then become a phenomenon of over one hundred million pieces sold all over the world, the absolute protagonist of the bubble of motion sensors and casual gaming. That Zelda episode was almost piloted by the fans, who criticized The Wind Waker's originality and courage to such an extent as to force Aonuma to set up a decidedly more conventional adventure in terms of settings, graphic style and elements of the gameplay, in a sort of direct connection with the seminal Ocarina of Time. A choice that evidently paid off, since Twilight Princess became the second best-selling installment of the series ever. A goal that was certainly not achieved by chance, mind you: it was in fact, and for the most part it still is, a wonderful, engaging adventure, full of personality and balanced in its components. However, the fact of being an episode in some ways more predictable, probably the one with the least innovative charge ever, has led it to be criticized by some fans. The vast but rather empty overworld, some qualitative decline in the dungeons and the lackluster plot, as well as the secondary characters, have in fact made Twilight Princess also one of the most controversial Zeldas, and perhaps one of those aged less well. However, this does not seem to us the right place to question the absolute value of the product, rekindling controversies that have been going on for two decades, but rather to evaluate the work done in this remake and consequently its opportunity. From Australia with love In this sense, it is worth emphasizing that there are two substantial differences compared to The Wind Waker HD: first of all, where the latter gained further interest by representing the only concrete opportunity for Wii U users to access the chapter in question, on the contrary with Twilight Princess the ~problem~ of the retrocompat arisesability with Wii, which in fact has always allowed owners of the Nintendo console to play it. Secondly, if The Wind Waker HD had been created - in just six months - by the internal Nintendo EAD team of Aonuma, on the contrary with Twilight Princess the task was entrusted to the Australians of Tantalus Media. Although it has undoubtedly been carefully supervised by the leaders of the Kyoto house, it is clear that at the moment the vast majority of the commitment of the ~father~ of Zelda is concentrated on the new chapter in development. This gives a bit of a sense of the boundaries within which this latest remake can be found, starting with the fact that from a graphic point of view the detachment with the original is less marked than what was seen in the case of The Wind Waker HD. In fact, to refresh the original, the programmers have done little more than it would be frankly obvious to expect by adapting a 10-year-old product to the present day: here is therefore the high definition at 1080p, 30 frames per second and higher quality textures that guarantee a cleaner image, capable of making visible all those details that were evidently lost with the 480p of the original. The whole obviously gains a lot, but at the same time the reduced polygonal complexity of the characters and settings clashes more. In partial aid comes the new lighting system employed by Tantalus, which makes everything more realistic and enjoyable, albeit with some excess as regards bloom. It could be argued that The Wind Waker HD was also roughly granted the same treatment. This is only partially true, because if on the one hand Link's aquatic adventure was also able to enjoy the addition of 16:9 (more important than one is led to think), on the other it is clear how cel shading is more likely to be fully exploited by brighter colors and increased resolution. Having said that, the improvements on which Twilight Princess HD can count are not related solely to the graphics component. The most obvious addition is obviously the support for the GamePad, which in addition to providing the ability to play in off screen mode, allows in the case of the classic use of the TV to manage the inventory via the controller screen and always have the map of the area where you are. A solution that makes the action more fluid and less fragmented, as it is easy to understand; possibly one could have hoped for a slightly more pleasant job on an aesthetic level as regards the menus in question on the GamePad, really at the minimum wage if not downright ugly. Adjustments have also been made to some sections, rebalancing them on the basis of the criticisms made by fans: for example, the tears of light to be collected have dropped from sixteen to twelve, a ghost lantern has been introduced to make it easier to identify the Souls of Ghost, adjustments have been made to the control system and speeded up dialogues and times of transformation into Wolf. All problems that, in modern games, could be corrected with a free patch, but which instead ten years ago were destined to remain immobile and invariable. The lazy camera from the original hasn't been changed, forcing numerous fixes during the action. Inevitable compatibility with amiibo, which finds its most interesting expression by bringing the beautiful Lupo Link statuette created for the occasion closer to the controller. By doing so you can unlock a sort of survival mode in arenas of increasing difficulty, obviously focused on combat. Unfortunately Nintendo did not provide us with the thumbnail, which is why we cannot give a first-hand judgment of this add-on. Some of the amiibo from the Super Smash Bros. series are also compatible, bringing with them some changes to the game balance: for example, with Ganondorf the damage received is doubled, Link restores the arrows, Zelda and Sheik instead the hearts.", "date": "2016-03-01", "grade": "8.6"}
