{"name": "Big Pharma", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/big-pharma-recensione.html", "text": "If your dream has always been to make money by curing disease or, more cynically, using it to synthesize cures, then this Big Pharma review could open the door to your new favorite pastime. The game developed by Twice Circled stages the pharmaceutical industry in the form of a gigantic puzzle game, mainly focused on chemical combinations on the one hand and careful financial management on the other. We therefore find an interesting representation of this industrial branch formed by a rather playful vision of the production chain, a few touches of scientific research and a good handful of entrepreneurial cynicism applied to healthcare, just to make the picture a little dehumanizing but also very curious. The satirical note in all of this emerges above all by logical deduction, as the game limits itself to being extremely pragmatic in its requests: making money by curing diseases, at the same time trying to optimize the company's economy as much as possible and fighting hand to hand with competitors operating in the same field. Above all, it is a question of navigating between menus, making decisions and calculating production activities and the way of processing resources in the best possible way, but at the center of the whole experience there is also a surprisingly playful component in the construction of the production chain which is configures just like a puzzle game, complete with interlocking different pieces and space management. Trying to tell Big Pharma in words is quite an undertaking, being a game that must be not only tried but also studied and assimilated, moreover requiring a certain period of learning before it can be mastered in the slightest, but we try, if nothing else, to present it somehow. The gameplay as an assembly line The most interesting idea behind Big Pharma is precisely the fusion between the typical elements of the darkest and most serious management system and the most common characteristics of the puzzle game, made up of the exploitation of spaces, connecting pieces together and building complex structures. On closer inspection, this title is part of what seems to be a real trend by now, based on creating games focused on the construction of an assembly line as an element of the gameplay itself, as seen in successful titles of the caliber of Satisfactory and in a certain sense also in Factorio. In this case it is a question of synthesizing medicines and spreading them on the market, starting therefore from the planning of the production line, which must respond to a market need and therefore offer a cure for a disease as well as being economically sustainable, and to try to enhance the effects of the medicine by reducing the inevitable side effects through various raw material processing systems. The latter are the basic ingredients from which one must start for the sintering of various pills and medicines and fall within the research phase, which also includes the study of the effects and the development of new machinery to be positioned in the factory. However, it is inside the factory that most of the game takes place, once the production lines to be carried out have been identified and the objectives to be achieved have been set. It is then a question of passing the ingredients through various devices, carefully choosing which ones to use to achieve the pre-established effects which may concern the concentration of certain effects, the dilution of others, the fusion of different ingredients, synthesis in pills and various other transformative activities on the chemical materials that are gradually modified in a progressive manner. Each machine is connected to the other with conveyor belts and it is the player's task to try to optimize the available spaces in a logical way, also by purchasing new production areas where to build other components of the laboratory but above all by arranging the elements in the most optimal way possible in one of the founding principles of the classic puzzle game. This is actually the most playful part of Big Pharma and it appears almost out of place, at first sight, in the midst of the great general complexity given by the variables to be taken into consideration and the chemical and economic balances to be kept constantly under control, yet it is also a characterizing element of everything. Between play and hard work In management software of this type the boundary between purely playful entertainment and the satisfaction given by completing a real job in the best possible way is often blurred and perhaps this is the very identity of this genre, the secret of its success at a certain type of player. In Big Pharma all this vit is rather extreme, but perhaps more for questionable design choices than for an effective desire to make everything particularly complex and selective. That it is fundamentally a game that does not want to take itself too seriously is demonstrated by its central pure puzzle mechanics, with those crazy Rube Goldberg machines that come out in an attempt to build assembly lines capable of meeting production needs and the limited space available. Yet it is as if there is a lack of cohesion between the colder and more mathematical elements of the game, of which there are many, and its facetious soul almost like a Theme Hospital, so that we continually find ourselves juggling complex menus and daring freehand constructions , between the dullness of the accountant's work and the inventiveness of the crazy designer, without ever feeling a real connection between the two souls of the game. Not that all this is necessarily a problem: management software lovers are used to much more complicated things, but it is good to make it clear that Big Pharma requires great dedication and a certain period of study even just to understand what needs to be done, so there he wants a certain predisposition to the videogame commitment. Here another problem of the game emerges, perhaps the worst: the tutorials are never entirely clear and rely exclusively on the text (in English), which, moreover, is practically unreadable on Nintendo Switch in portable mode. This is a great obstacle to the use of the product: the entire interface has obviously been transposed without calculating the resolution of the console well, so it becomes difficult to play on the small screen, also because the texts must be consulted continuously to understand what we are doing and keep the substance values under control. A further inconvenience of the interface is also given by the fact that it alternates every few seconds different information screens when the characteristics of machinery and products are highlighted, making the notions scroll too quickly on the screen and making them even more difficult to see.", "date": "2019-12-10", "grade": "6.8"}
