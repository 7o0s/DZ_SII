{"name": "Ikaruga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ikaruga_a.html", "text": "Project RS-2 And Ikaruga follows the unwritten laws of Treasure to the letter, like a good student. It is the best shoot'em up in recent years - meaning shoot'em up in its classic and most pertinent sense - and it is hopelessly elite. In short, casual gamers away, and the faint of heart abstain. For the vast majority of current gamers, accustomed to games that are all too easy and to a flattening, due to wild sequelization, of the videogame offer now fossilized on well-defined genres, Ikaruga is a shock. Ikaruga is difficult, bloody difficult, each game requires lightning reflexes, excellent memory and maximum concentration. As chaotic as the situation on the screen is, with hundreds of bullets to dodge by performing millimetric maneuvers, there is always a way out: death in Ikaruga is never an accidental event or necessarily foreseen by the game, it is always a direct consequence of inexperience or player error. There is always a way out, you just need to find it, analyzing and deciphering the sublime alchemy of the enemies' attack patterns, studied with maniacal perfection, and the motion of the salvos of bullets, cunningly combined to create labyrinths of shots of rare beauty. Project RS-2 The subtitle of Ikaruga is heart-pounding for any lover of the genre, with that RS-2 indicating a direct sequel to the game which, he's right, has been considered the best shooter out there for years, Radiant Silvergun for Saturn. But don't be fooled, Ikaruga has little in common with its illustrious predecessor and, vertical scrolling and showers of bullets aside, it is much closer to the concept proposed for the first time in the platform, also by Treasure, Silhouette Mirage. The whole gameplay of Ikaruga revolves around polarity, everything in the game is either black or white: our ship, projectiles, enemies. The polarity of our vehicle can be changed at any time by pressing a button: if white we will inflict double damage to black enemies and we will be invulnerable and able to absorb white shots, if black vice versa. Definitely innovative and refreshing, a sign that scrolling shoot'em ups still have a lot to say and that the introduction of innovative ideas is still possible, but there's more: a brilliant combo system adds further depth to the gameplay , which forces the player to hit enemies in sequences of three by color to achieve high scores. Of course it is possible to play without paying attention to it, but in doing so one of the most rewarding aspects of Ikaruga is lost. It goes without saying that the game was designed to always keep the number of combos at a maximum, linking every single sequence of enemy attacks to three, from the beginning to the last level. But it's inhumane, as a Japanese. Who, moreover, manage to complete the game with only one life. Project RS-2 Unlike Radiant Silvergun there are no extra weapons in Ikaruga. The player can only count on the trusty basic weapon (which can fire single or double shots repeatedly) and on a multiple homing laser, which can be loaded by absorbing enemy bullets, particularly useful in more crowded situations and in battles with end-of-level bosses. Huge and very bad, as per Treasure tradition. There are five internships to be tackled and they all follow the same predefined basic structure  introduction, actual level, boss. Ikaruga, it is true, is not particularly long, but the very high level of difficulty and the good number of extras, among which we point out the interesting Prototype game mode, are able to guarantee excellent longevity. Completing the game even at Easy level is a real feat. From a technical point of view, the latest Treasure effort performs very well. The GameCube conversion is excellent although, if you want to find the classic hair in the egg, slightly inferior to the Dreamcast counterpart, the game's native hardware, designed specifically for the Naomi room card. Excellent as always the design and the engine is flawless, even when the screen is crowded with bullets. The audio accompaniment, pressing and appropriate, and the sound effects are noteworthy. Comment Ikaruga is certainly not a game for everyone. But then Treasure has never made games for everyone, and we're grateful for that. Ikaruga is a sublime hymn to gameplay that will only be appreciated by the most discerning palates and true connoisseurs of the genre. Deliberately, beautifully minimal, a real videogame haiku, the best definition of the game that I've ever read. Unmissable, but only for true hardcore gamers. Others duly stay away, unless they feel ready to take the plunge. Pros: Great gameplay, perfectly tuned Fast-paced andengaging Excellent technical realization Very difficult (hardcore gamer) Cons: Very difficult (casual gamer) A bit too short Curious: it is impossible to start an article on a Treasure game without spending a few lines on Treasure itself, perhaps the most atypical and particular Japanese software house. One of a kind, elitist, hopelessly snobbish, Treasure is the last bastion of a generation that no longer exists, perhaps the only one now to develop only the games it really wants to develop, with an obsessive obsession for two dimensions and in defiance of the sales charts. Certainly there are purely commercial projects (remember, but we'd rather forget, Silpheed for PlayStation 2 and the promising Wario World for GC), programmed on commission and not always up to par, so much so that Treasure has never affixed the sacred seal, guarantee quality. The unmistakable logo, once the stylized casket now replaced by the more traditional name of the company, has always been synonymous with two certainties: 1) Very high quality and original and out of line gameplay 2) Not for everyone", "date": "2003-06-16", "grade": null}
