Again, the fights, in the occurrence of several enemies on the screen, can become frustrating, since it will seem to wait a lifetime until your character can take the initiative and decimate the enemy ranks; fortunately that the battles do not happen randomly as in the Final Fantasy saga by Squaresoft, otherwise the twenty hours or so required to finish the game would hardly be fulfilled by a somewhat demotivated gamer, also due to a little user control system friendly, from the maneuverability of the characters, to the bad response to the commands in key situations such as in battles, but also in moments of calm, when exploring the areas or shopping in the shops. Conclusions To conclude, the technical aspect of the game is not very criticisable, but neither is it worthy of particular praise: backdrops and sprites are of more than good quality, while the special effects, especially after seeing Four Swords included in the conversion of Link To The Past ( The Legend Of Zelda III, perfectly converted from the original for the Super Famicom), do not particularly impress those who are well aware of the potential of the Game Boy Advance. A sound sector of modest level (discreet music, modest sound effects), conclude the games of an RPG of just sufficient quality, certainly light years behind the various The Legend Of Zelda of Nintendo and Flagship, but, for the avid fans of the book or of the film represents a game to try anyway because they could (the conditional is a must) be the only ones who actually want to complete the game. Pros: Inspired by Tolkien's book, richer than the film 20 hours of guaranteed play Cons: Modest technical realization poor controls, tedious in many situations Tolkien in your pocket More than a cinematic blockbuster, Lord Of The Rings can now be associated with a real mass phenomenon, which role-playing games and the publication of the author Tolkien aside, involves media such as cinema (the film trilogy coming soon), gadgets (posters, key rings, miniatures, etc) and, of course, video games; it is now common practice to transport the most successful films (but also anime, manga, comics, etc) in a videogame key, trying to leverage the success obtained in the original form and direct it towards the videogame market. However, it must be said that, most of the time, the final result does not fully convince the specialized press and the public, relying on those fans who collect any object bearing the effigy of their favorite brand (see video games starring Gundam and Dragon Ball but also Batman and the other super heroes), maybe even before the first comments can emphasize the videogame outlay I'm back or beg the unfortunate buyer to save their euros for a better production. The Company of the Ring (original title: Fellowship Of The Ring) is a classic rpg with an isometric view with (similar) real-time combat, inspired, however, not by the first film (of the same name, by the way) but by the first part of the famous book by Tolkien, with some differences, therefore, especially on the characters present therein (some, in fact, are admitted in the film that has gone crazy in cinemas in the past year).", "date": "2003-02-26", "grade": null}
