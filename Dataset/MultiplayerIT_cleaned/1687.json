{"name": "Rayman 3 - Hoodlum Havoc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-3-hoodlum-havoc-8.html", "text": "Watch out... my hair is spinning! Well ladies and gentlemen, the effect of the cannon is over. Here I am lucid and perky, now we can continue the discussion in a more.. um.. professional way. But then it's not exactly a serious game, so to hell with professionalism ^_^. Where were we ? Ah yes, Globox... well what do I have to say, all of us seasoned gamers have had better (and more attractive) backs, but Rayman just can't seem to get him off his back. As I said, the aforementioned obese blue frog has gobbled up Andr, the leader of the bad Lum Blacks, and to remove him we will have to go in search of a doctor capable of performing this operation - unfortunately not Hannibal lecter for me. So here we start again to wander through numerous richly colored levels and prodigal of acrobatic leaps. The ultimate goal is obviously to defeat the usually harmless Black Lums, capable of transforming themselves into anthropomorphic creatures called Hoodlums, who will be Rayman's daily bread. The game is divided into a linear adventure divided into levels, during which exploratory and combat phases will alternate without interruption. After an in-depth learning process of the controls we will all be able to jump, move, flutter (thanks to our powerful helicopter tuft), and fight, and we will be able to travel together with the pot-bellied Globox. For a certain period we will also have a talkative fly who, apart from teasing us repeatedly, will show us the basics of the gameplay. Fortunately we will get rid of it soon, just in time to focus on the real action, and we will immediately learn to hate the levels of connection between some scenarios, real dimensional tunnels to go through with a rocket-surf by jumping on mobile platforms. If going around the levels in search of colored gems and bonuses to accumulate more points will certainly be satisfying and useful for unlocking the extra movies - entitled ~1000 ways to kick Rayman~, not to be missed - but the hard core will be to proceed in the game, and in many parts you will be forced to face enemies. After the first skirmishes it will be a breeze to get rid of the Hoodlums, also considering the high number of.. um.. I don't know if there is a technical term for those red things that heal the energy bar, anyway you get the idea. The inevitable bosses at the end of the level will give you the proverbial fish to fry (but poor cats, I've always told myself...) above all because you will find them both at the end, and in the middle and at a quarter of the level, in short, there they are many and scattered without regularity everywhere. And it must be said that each one is truly unique, original and can be defeated with a different technique, stimulating and entertaining. The witch who transforms into a toad or the colonial hunter-style gecko are just two of the goodies you will face, not without a few too many scurrilous exclamations. Eating spinach is good for you.. but, wait.. those aren't spinach!?! The most publicized aspect (450,000 euros of campaign on television and newspapers... I'm joking, my God how gullible you are...) of this game are the power ups that Rayman can use to deal with difficult situations. And let's face it, each of them has been placed on purpose to unlock a door or a passage, or in any case to proceed in the game. In other words, there isn't much freedom of choice in the use of these gifts. However, since I'm paid to write it (...just kidding, god how gullible you are), let's see in detail what it is. First of all the genius. Could the programmers fall into the clich of colorful and dazzling energy tokens or annoying fairies capable of enhancing the magnificent protagonist? Obviously not, also because Rayman is anything but magnificent. Then the funds were what they were and therefore they made do with cans of peeled tomatoes (or spinach if you prefer), just to make the children's mothers happy, now too fond of low-calorie snacks. A colored beam and some lens flare at will and here are our five power ups, with obviously funny names, almost as ridiculous as certain words heard in the corridors of Hogwarts: Vorticopugno, Sbriciolopugno, Grabberpugno, Siluropugno and Elitrottero. If you haven't already pressed Alt+F4 at this point (if you don't know what this combination does, DON'T do it, I warned you ^_^) I can also tell you that each of these boosts has a limited duration, but the jar that gives it is permanent , and that many of these can only be obtained by defeating a Hoodlum or by freeing the poor Tinzi from their cages (who are the Tinzi? and what do I know? it's written in the manual...). Whether it's the iron fist that breaks down doors, the jaws metallic capable of projecting us, new spiderman, in the air, of the cerebral helicopter (proof that Rayman has nothing in the braincase) or of the missile, are in any case bonuses necessary to interact with the environment to make us continue in the game. And they are too few. There is no alternative way to get past a barred door other than to smash it with the Crumble Punch. Style downgrade: While they look good and all I'd say they could have gone a little harder. Raising of style: however the animated sequences of the power ups are really enjoyable and fun, capable of highlighting Rayman's acting skills. The obligatory Box: the power ups of your dreams! Don't you give a damn? Well I'll show them to you anyway! VORTICOPUGNO: a very sexy green onesie and gloves that generate vortexes. Useful for throwing Hoodlums off stilts and for ~uncoiling~ mushroom stems and platforms that are too high. CRUMBLER FIST: Shod gloves and red onesie that is very Power Rangers. So dressed up you can break down doors and do more damage to the Hoodlums. FIST GRABPER: Light blue overalls and sprung steel hooks. In addition to Hoodlum's electrocution, this outfit is indispensable for fluttering in the air hanging from the appropriate hooks. TORPEDO PUNCH: Orange suit and an intelligently guided missile (.. intelligent?) to press unreachable switches or defeat enemies that are too far away. A real pain to maneuver. HELICOPTER: Yellow pilot's helmet from which a helicopter more dignified than our hair comes out. Too bad it doesn't last long. Such a gummy gummy world What should you expect from a platformer if not a series of colourful, imaginative and cartoonish game environments? Well we weren't disappointed in that sense, wandering through the many levels, well designed and sufficiently varied. The frenzy of the action doesn't leave too much time to appreciate the technical realization and the graphic style of the environment, qualitatively good. Particle effects and plays of light are acceptable, and some settings are even suggestive, even if the aim is to arouse fun, and therefore in most cases we will have improbable structures and landscapes. Certainly a fundamental fact is the interactivity of the environment with our gloved hero: most of the operations and evolutions will combine with what surrounds us, to allow Rayman to use platforms, objects and other elements on his way towards the end of the level. It is true that the degree of complexity of the interaction is low: a glance of a trained mind will immediately understand what needs to be moved or hit, or which path to take. In other words, you can't go wrong. This gives a sense of limitation, of a prefabricated structure that could be annoying to someone. If it's true that nowadays the average difficulty of video games has lowered to allow for greater user-consumer satisfaction, it's also true that there are less simple-minded products, pass me the term. A greater number of power ups, or some alternative way would have made the game more varied and certainly longer lasting. As the good Vanethian would say (but we didn't think it was appropriate to bother him), the audio sector is satisfactory, even if not striking, with a certain variety of tracks, suitable for the different types of setting, but often dispersive and not exactly engaging. Overall it is an apt soundtrack capable of underlining the most ironic moments, but it lacks in the more action part of an involvement that is not always adequate. Applause should instead be given to the adaptation of the texts and to the dubbing (the Oscar undoubtedly goes to Globox's voice, while Rayman cuts a poor figure as a shy debutante. However, the stupid face he manages to make amply compensates for his lack of verbal expressiveness), deserving of having best transposed the comic spirit of the game without ruining the numerous jokes, puns and double meanings scattered in the dialogues. When you least expect it you will be undermined by an extremely imbecile joke, enough to make you miss that last, difficult leap, or a bell will ring in your head, recognizing a cinematic or musical quotation. Needless to say, the work done on involvement is truly worthy of appreciation. Until the last joke! Are you still there? Well, then it seems that Rayman 3 you do not mind too much. After an initial skepticism, fueled by my natural aversion to products of this kind, I must say that the game transported me a lot, both for the calibrated level of challenge (today I have a morbid fixation for anglicisms, forgive me), quite difficult tomake you repeat the less simple passages several times, but not so maddening as to result in a well-known epithet followed by ejection of the CD from the player. When the fingers intertwine on the pad keys in a Fantozzi style and the well-chosen teasing of the enemies who tease us for our ineptitude gives us an ulcer, the spirit and the cheerfulness of the atmosphere calm us down and bring us back to the right mood. Rayman 3 is not a deep game nor has it ever wanted to be: it is a pleasant diversion, a relaxing title with great potential for entertainment, not only intended for younger age groups. The number of citations and double meanings, rendered very well in the full localization, is high and even manages to embarrass even the less youngsters with some cross-references. Without a doubt the team has created an entertaining product, with a rapid learning curve and a decent longevity, enriched by some very entertaining extra cinematics. The only flaw I can highlight is the save system, undoubtedly ~dumb-proof~, but precisely because of its virtual non-existence, uncomfortable: sometimes the levels have a limited extension, other times they are quite long, and in this case it can be frustrating having to go through them all over again as there is no save before the end-of-level bosses or an important section. Apart from this and the soundtrack, beautiful but not exceptional, I don't think there are any other criticisms to level at Rayman 3, undoubtedly among the best platformers available on a platform which, let's face it, does not make this playful genre a source of pride, given the titanic amount of titles on the market even on the lowest of consoles. The third chapter of Mr. ~Turning Tuft~ should therefore be welcomed with enthusiasm and tried without fear of being disappointed, with a glass of water at hand to calm the diaphragm spasms caused by some well-timed jokes. Sure, if reading these lines you already miss a firearm, tomato-colored pixels and deafening rhombuses, maybe you've moved on, but for once we can say with a touch of pride that in videogames there is not only the brute violence, but also a less aggressive and more edifying entertainment. (Wow, I look like one of those respectable journalists from the third page of a newspaper; OK ma'am, the Parents' Association had promised me a hefty fee, did you see that I wrote what you wanted? Now shove the cheque, thanks...). Have fun then, this time it's really the case to say it... Until the last joke! Pros Fun and challenging Endless humor and hilarious extra levels Flawless localization and voice acting Cons Save system leaves something to be desired A few more power ups would have been nice. Manone and Scarponi Help! Run man! The tender and peaceful Lums are in danger, threatened by evil beings who risk transforming our magical and sugary world into a dark valley of torments (too epic I know...) ! Who will help us? Lara was busy signing the papers of her divorce and yet another distance adoption, Mario has been locked up for years - without results - in a weight loss clinic, Raziel is suing its authors for the final derelict of Soul Reaver 2, Pikachu ...well, nobody wants Pikachu. There is only one person who can save us: Rayman!! (well, person... a purple hoodie, sneakers, gloves and a goofy face connected by pure ether... but person is shorter ^_^ ). And we have therefore arrived at the third chapter of the saga.. how? Which saga? But Rayman's! You didn't even know it existed? Well never mind, there's not much to say... and if you've never tried a platformer (but where have you lived so far?) don't worry: you can practice during the early stages of the game, specially designed to get you familiar with the interface and start warming up your pharynx waiting for the chain curses you'll dish out on the monitor as soon as you get into the ~spirit of the game~. But let's go in order, because - they tell me - there is a protocol to be respected, so here's the background. ~Rayman 3 ? The platform one with the thing that flies thanks to a rotating tuft ? Mmm, yes come on, I'll review it~. And here comes the package (yes, you must know that here at the Network we have already patented teleportation) with its nice three-dimensional cover, which temporarily manages to shake me out of the sense of unease I feel in front of the sterile DVD box (I'm nostalgic for hardcovers What are you going to do with it?). First of all the good news: the game is entirely in Italian, and consists of 3 juicy CDs that will keep you pleasantly glued to the monitor during the excruciating installation phase (a", "date": "2003-04-11", "grade": null}
