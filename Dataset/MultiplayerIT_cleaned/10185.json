{"name": "MX Vs ATV Reflex", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74718-mx-vs-atv-reflex-scorribande-su-sterrato.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 Rainbow Studios has been considered for many years now one of the best-known working groups in the universe of video games, at least in the production of titles almost exclusively dedicated to the world of off-road motor racing. Their products, while not proving to be exceptional from a technical point of view, have however proved to be quite valid and have often been appreciated by the public, to the point, in some cases, of deserving important awards such as those of Greatest Hits and Platinum Hits from Sony and Microsoft for games like MX Unleashed and MX vs. ATV Unleashed. Having become one of the internal development team at THQ since 2001, Rainbow Studios is back in the limelight in recent weeks with a new motor racing game set in the off-road world, MX Vs ATV Reflex. A production, we say it immediately, stylistically very similar to other works of the group or of direct competition. In fact, we have the usual modes typical of the genre such as the classic stage career linked to a series of events to face or freestyle competitions, for example, or a fun multiplayer mode that allows you to challenge three friends in split-screen or eleven online opponents. Finally, there are also clearly arcade sessions in which it is also possible to face some fun mini-games that are different from the usual races. Muddy tracks Instead, what differentiates this product from the previous ones made by the same development team and which we would like to underline in this review are two interesting aspects that concern the entire structure of the gameplay: the deformation of the terrain, implemented as we will soon see in a truly convincing way , and the vehicle and pilot control system. In this sense, the promises made in the past by the developers, i.e. those concerning the ~field~ study around the world of the various types of circuits and related terrains to be recreated as faithfully as possible in the video game, have been kept. It is true that this feature is not an absolute novelty in the field of driving games, just think that even arcade titles such as the latest Sega Rally possessed it. But in MX Vs ATV Reflex the conformation of the tracks and the way in which they change in real time in relation to the climatic conditions and the passage of vehicles on them appears more likely and is therefore re-proposed on the screen with a certain credibility. The deformation of the roads is therefore not only a purely visual aspect of the game, but a crucial element of it since it can profoundly affect performance in the race. A route that is heavily ruined by the passage of other competitors makes the vehicle controlled by the user more unstable and has repercussions on movement in general, especially if you drive a light vehicle (controlling a large truck makes things a bit better). So much so that often getting the first position immediately during the race laps can be decisive for the final success. Playstation 3 trophies The Playstation 3 version of the game offers 49 Trophies to be collected as follows: 1 Platinum, 3 Gold, 7 Silver and 38 Bronze. Reaching these prizes will not be easy since you will have to overcome various challenges that require a certain skill both in freestyle competitions and in those where it is important to win, such as finishing first in all the events of the career mode or in 25 Online Playlist matches to get for example two of the three gold trophies, etc. Arcade but not too much And here the discourse linked to the new layout of the controls renamed by the development team for the occasion Rider Reflex comes into play. This control system allows you to manage the driver and the car separately during the race, through the use of both analog sticks of the Pad with which to act on the movements of the vehicle and on the weight of the driver in relation to the type of vehicle driven. In practice, the movements of the vehicle are established with the left stick while the driver's weight is balanced with the right one. In this way it is possible to act on two of the important aspects of a race in relation to factors such as rough terrain, the physics of the vehicle and of the driver or the route, paying attention to control every movement and to calibrate it perfectly to increase adherence to the terrain and avoid loss of balance, falls or going off the track. To succeed in this intent means to master the game. This control system is quite accurate and initially a little difficult to master (although once learned well it gives a lot of satisfaction -Ndr), but it is often supported, so to speak, by some arcade elements created ad hoc by the developers to help newbies or fewer patients. For egWhen you lose your balance, a green marker (an arrow) appears around the user-controlled pilot, signaling a certain direction. To recover your balance, just move the right stick in the direction indicated. Freestyle As can be seen from what has been described up to now, MX vs. ATV Reflex while maintaining a style essentially designed for the general public, does not disdain to indulge in greater depth and simulation in order to satisfy even those players who are looking for something more in a title of this kind and perhaps greater control. Succeeding in our opinion in its purpose. For the rest, the Rainbow Studios title is not free from defects. For example one of its key elements, that is, freestyle competitions present what appears to be in all respects a programming error. In fact, the system that manages the attribution of marks during these performances appears rather confusing, so much so that it sometimes gives strange and apparently random scores when compared to the quality and type of actions performed. Usually in these productions the points received derive from the sum of the results of each single trick, while in our case the final judgment is determined by five different factors examined by the AI within the entire performance. In our opinion, all this constitutes an important flaw as the freestyle tests are also linked to the continuation of the user-controlled pilot's career and when described above it could make the aforementioned experience boring. Other problems are presented by the web game. Two players can challenge each other on the same console and on a single television in the more classic split-screen, or, alternatively, you can try your hand at online multiplayer races for up to twelve people via PlayStation Network or Xbox Live. Too bad only for some connection problems to the game servers and lag. As far as the aesthetic aspect is concerned, Rainbow Studios demonstrates with this title that it is now well aware of the material with which it has been dealing for years. Many off-road cars and motorcycles excellently recreated from a graphic point of view, good scenarios even if some are slightly bare, and an impactful overview thanks also to the quantity of elements on the screen and the discreet attention to detail in the various tracks. The latter are well made and visually satisfying especially when they undergo changes in real time. The positive thing that surprises is the fluidity even when playing via split screen, even if unfortunately in the Playstation 3 version there are some problems in loading the textures in certain tracks and some annoying pop-ups. The audio sector is also good, with all the sampling of the case practically perfect and realistic.", "date": "2010-02-19", "grade": "7.8"}
