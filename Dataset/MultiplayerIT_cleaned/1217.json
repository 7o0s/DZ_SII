And precisely to these aerial duels, the programmers of Silver Wish Games have decided to dedicate their latest effort. After the quick installation of the game (stored on a DVD Rom), having made the appropriate setting of the graphic parameters (the automatic one fails in a sensational way ...) and having viewed a really skimpy intro, I find myself in front of the main game menu and I discover that the modalities foreseen in WoW are three: a main campaign divided into thirteen rather long missions, immediate action (always in single) and the multiplayer game whether via LAN or web. The impressions on single and multiple play are not different but literally at the antipodes! It's not the first time (and it won't be the last) that this has happened, but I'm always surprised when the impressions on single and multiple play are not only different but, in this case, poles apart. And yes, because Wings of War is really boring in single, but it's a lot of fun in multiplayer: not that there's any difference in the control system (with a blatantly arcadey tendency and without any simulation ambitions) or in the action itself (shooting down opponents with some variations on the theme) but on the one hand there is a boring campaign, devoid of any narrative element, repetitive in the objectives (hit the enemy, bomb the turret, escort the civilians, etc.) and which cannot be saved even with ~ sub-quests~ that unlock bonuses of various kinds, ~tainted~ also by a not overly performing artificial intelligence. On the other hand, there are 4 possible variants of the game in company (the details of which you can analytically read in the box dedicated to the subject), an excellent management of entry into the game, many servers already operational, that wholesome fun that air chases without simulative ambitions can give, capable of making me stay in front of the monitor for many hours without realizing it and which produces an excellent mix of adrenaline and acetylcholine. WoW is the typical title that can be loaded with the anti-stress function in a quarter of an hour free on a gray and rather heavy day, or to spend an entire evening in company (whether virtual or real) and take pleasure in bad words: what is certain is that the fun factor is largely guaranteed. I will defeat you Red Baron, whoever you are As widely underlined, Wings of War is at its best in multiplayer, where you have 4 different game modes at your disposal. Death Match: No need for a big explanation. Surely fighting 29 other WW1 aces in a free-for-all can get pretty chaotic Team Death Match: The funnest mode: choose your faction (Germans or allies), your plane and give your all to make win your team. Capture the Flag: This isn't new either, but the game mechanics on an airplane will be slightly different than with a mega-shot in UT2004 and company. Windsock: In this case the player must collect the windsock inside a hangar and once this operation is done, escape from all the others to keep it as long as possible. The points to decree the winners are awarded based on the time that the windsock was had and the number of shot down enemies who possessed it. Moving on to the technical aspect, having played Wings of War after a few days of full immersion in the Martian hell of Doom 3 certainly doesn't help the Gathering title, but trying to be as objective as possible, I can't hide from you that we are facing a slightly dated game as regards the graphics engine but on the other hand the polygonal models of the aircraft are cared for enough to be pleasant, the terrestrial surfaces are appreciated from an aesthetic point of view and the frame rate even with a PC that is not exactly the latest generation remains stable even with a setting devoted to exploiting all the special features. As far as the sound component is concerned, the musical themes take full advantage of the characteristics of feature films with a war background in which the epic is the master and which blend adequately with the action in the skies. Really boring in single, very fun in multiplayer. It is from this dichotomy that we must start to judge Wings of War. Thetitle Gathering did not convince me at all in the ~solo~ mode with a campaign absolutely devoid of any narrative element and with missions that were too long and soon repetitive. But as soon as we dive into the sky of the Web (or into a LAN), things change and we find ourselves faced with a title that in its simplicity and immediacy has managed to glue me in front of the monitor for many hours, whether for a single (or team) deathmatch or in the other two more peculiar modes. Although technically dated, the audiovisual impact is largely sufficient and the budget price for an unpublished title has definitely had a positive influence on the final grade. So put it in your shopping list only if you are interested in facing the Red Baron with other human players: in this case these wings of the war of the beginning of the century will not disappoint you at all also because of a porting of Crimson Skies from X-Box to PC , there isn't even a fourth-rate gossip Pros: Very fun multiplayer Immediate gameplay Budget price for an unpublished title Cons: Boring in single Technically dated Non-existent historical background Whether it's for a passion of yours from that historical period, or because you've read some Snoopy strips above his doghouse - Sopthy Camel intent on battling with the Red Baron, or because at the time of the Amiga you loved flying on the Cinemaware ~Wings~ , whatever the reason, you are probably not without knowledge of dogfights that took place during the First World War.", "date": "2004-09-07", "grade": null}
