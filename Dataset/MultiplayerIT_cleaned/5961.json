The arrival of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in Europe therefore represents an interesting change of course, a courageous bet on which, however, Nintendo does not seem to have bet with great conviction, given the lack of any localization (the game is completely in English , texts and dialogues) and a limited physical distribution in the truest sense of the term. There is also talk of censorship on which the publisher would have pushed to make the product more digestible to the various ~classification boards~, which have always been rather rigid when it comes to fan service and sexual references. In short, the premises are not exciting: net of these difficulties, how is the game in the end? Calm down, we'll get there soon. Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is an ~old school~, woody but engaging survival horror Beautiful and damned The plot of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water revolves around the events related to a mysterious and ghostly place, Mount Hikami, and a series of characters related to it in some way. The first is Yuri, a girl with the ability to perceive the dead, who due to this curse in the past had decided to take her own life, only to be saved at the last moment by Hisoka. The latter is the owner of an antique shop, but she also takes care of investigating the disappearance of some women, in turn exploiting a special ability, that of ~reading the shadows~ and therefore seeing the spiritual traces left by people in the places who have visited. Then we have Miu, a girl who initially figures among the subjects who disappeared on Mount Hikami, where she had gone in search of her mother, and Ren, a writer fascinated by the relationship between folklore and death, accompanied by his inseparable assistant Rui. Yuri, Miu and Ren alternate as protagonists in a campaign made up of a total of fifteen missions, including the prologue, and which can be completed within sixteen or eighteen hours, depending on the approach. After the main story (which has two possible endings), the game allows you to unlock not only a new degree of difficulty (Nightmare) which is added to the two already present, but also a short campaign in which we take on the role of Ayane, the 'skilled purple-haired ninja that Dead or Alive fans know very well. Without wanting to reveal too much, we can say that the gameplay that characterizes the missions with this character is different from that with the aforementioned Yuri, Miu and Ren: where the former follow the spiritual tracks to various places and face any supernatural enemies that appear Suddenly, Ayane has to focus mostly on stealth action, on avoiding being seen by ghosts rather than defeating them, again with the ultimate goal of finding a missing girl. Touches (ghostly) of class In addition to vital energy, in Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water we will also have to keep an eye on another indicator, the one that shows the character's humidity status. Water is our enemy, and getting wet in the rain or walking in streams will lead to a multiplication of random spiritual events, such as those that occur when we reach down to pick up an object. In fact, a hand could appear out of nowhere and grab us, subtracting some energy from us: to avoid this we will have to immediately leave the right trigger, or wriggle out of the grip by acting on the analog sticks. I'll take a picture of you The Koei Tecmo franchise has always found fertile ground on Nintendo platforms, at least in terms of experimentation with the controls, see for example Project Zero 2: Wii Edition, characterized by motion-sensing controls, and the disappointing spin-off Spirit Camera : Cursed Memories for Nintendo 3DS. On Wii U it is naturally the GamePad that plays a central role, since we can lift it and point it towards the screen as if we were holding the weapon of the characters in the game, namely the Camera Obscura, an ancient camera capable not only of to impress the image of ghosts on film, but also and above all to damage them in this way. When we come across a spirit while exploring the scenarios, we will therefore be asked to lift the controller, frame the enemy and ~shoot~ by pressing the right trigger, so as to hit our target until it disappears. The combat system is actually quite multifaceted, given that the shots must be repeated to incorporate as many subjects as possibleand, specifically, the ghosts and their fluttering ~orbs~, up to storing up enough energy to score a Fatal Frame, a blow of extraordinary power, often decisive. Depending on the character, we will also be able to count on further maneuvers, made possible by as many focal lenses for the Camera Obscura: Yuri can mount three different optics among those available, with the possibility of performing special attacks capable of inflicting extra damage, stunning or slowing down spirits, while Miu and Ren can instead only count on specific skills, in this case a shot that slows down the target and a multiple shot in ~burst~ mode. So much wood to open a carpentry shop As early survival horror enthusiasts well know, one of the elements characterizing the genre has always been the woodiness of the controls, often deliberately rendered in this way to convey to the player a sense of helplessness in the face of threats, the impossibility of escaping them easily and as a result an increase in tension and involvement, factors that are not insignificant when the goal of a game is also to scare and distress those who use it. Well, from this point of view Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water does too much, adopting a control system related to the screen and not to the character, but which often ~gets stuck~ between reverse gear and view, making us go through bad quarters of now, especially in the more advanced stages of the campaign, when the enemies to fight multiply. Unfortunately we must quickly reconsider the use of the GamePad to operate the Camera Obscura, given that this maneuver requires a discipline that is difficult to guarantee on all occasions: the controller memorizes the position of the shot and must therefore be ~activated~ only when it is pointed towards the screen, not before, or make do with the analog sticks to chase targets that the gyroscope can't keep up with. We dare not imagine how intricate the final boss could be in this way, but fortunately from the options it is possible to exclude this possibility and fall back on traditional control methods. Compared to the previous episodes of the series, the possibility of running has been added, moreover without having to stop and catch your breath, and this undoubtedly allows you to face the preponderant backtracking with more enthusiasm, also and above all thanks to the good solutions adopted by the developers in terms of design: there are no random encounters, each ghost is linked to a certain situation or place, and therefore returning to an already visited area does not imply facing already beaten enemies again. We breathe a sigh of relief: doing something different in this sense would have inevitably led to episodes of great frustration, considering the puzzle solving based mostly on identifying parts of the setting. On the other hand, in terms of balancing the difficulty, the question is thorny: throughout the campaign there are too many ~healing herbs~ and miraculous potions, so it is really rare to come across game over, but this does not affect the duration of the game in any way. experience, evidently calibrated to be enjoyed precisely in this way. Pimp my camera The Camera Obscura is our weapon in Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, and as such we will be able to upgrade it. How? By taking photos of the spirits, even and above all the ~impromptu~ ones that appear in the background, and which must be portrayed promptly, we will earn points that can be spent to improve the flash recharging speed, the shooting power and the range, as well as improving the individual lenses equipped. The older generation The developers of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water have done an exceptional job to make the most of the beauty of the protagonists, in some truly breathtaking moments. There was talk of the use of Dead or Alive technology to emphasize its shapes, but there are no ~bouncing~ or excessive transparency, although this may be the result of the cuts we mentioned at the beginning. It is also surprising how this factor is connected with an all in all modest polygonal count, thus covering any limits of the models (which in any case come out during some sequences, see for example when proceeding on all fours to overcome an obstacle) and obtaining the best compromise possible. We even enjoyed the animation of the run, which in the case of the girls is decidedly ~Japanese~, the funny trudge of someone who has gone to explore a mountain dressed in a miniskirt and platform shoes. The speech of the enemies and the scenarios is different, as well as the direction from the point of view of the ~scary~ factor, almost completely absent. During the campaign, dozens of edozens of doors, yet never once did that result in a jump from a chair, never a door suddenly bursting open or anything popping out of a closet. Episodes like this can be counted on the fingers of one hand and unfortunately they are not striking, and to say that we almost always played at night and with the lights off. On the settings it must be said that there is an excessive recycling, one often returns to the same areas and therefore a huge job has not been done in this area, although in terms of narration it has been managed well and the only really boring phases are those in which, in the role of Ren, we have the task of checking the video surveillance of the building where the girls live to identify any anomalies and intervene where necessary. The sound design has been well done and gives the feeling of actually being in the places we see on the screen, as well as the English dialogues appearing with due conviction.", "date": "2015-10-19", "grade": "8.0"}
