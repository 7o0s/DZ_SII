At its core, it's a top-down arena shooter that resembles a twin-stick shooter setup, even if it doesn't really fall into the category. The main feature is the fact that they are based on tanks, so they are not very fast vehicles but which can sustain a certain amount of hits, while unloading hails of assorted projectiles on their opponents. In all of this, our aim is to try to advance from level to level within a map, progressively unlocking various checkpoints placed at a certain distance from each other, which turns into a sort of endurance race and destructive capabilities. Tankhalla puts us driving a tank in a small arena Each level consists of a small arena, on which various elements of the scenario such as structures and buildings can be scattered, useful for providing a precarious shelter from the rain of enemy fire. Beyond the sporadic bosses, we are always clearly outnumbered: within these arenas we have to find a way to eliminate all the opponents and thus obtain the end-of-level bonus and the opening of the door to the next area . After the very first stages things become decidedly complicated, requiring great speed of execution, ability to dodge enemy bullets and adaptation in the use of scenarios as momentary shields. The action is very simple and basic, but also for this reason it is irresistible thanks to the continuous progression, once you enter the mechanism: from this point of view it closely resembles the excellent Archero, even if Tankhalla is more limited from the point of view of view of the general design and original solutions. Continuous blitzkrieg The gameplay is centered on the control of the tank and its constant progression between levels, enriched with a rogue-lite dynamic whereby you always have to restart from the beginning of the area of the map where you are at each elimination ( except for the possibility of using, just once, in-game currencies or seeing advertisements to restart immediately). However, the ~lite~ elements that lighten the roguelike refer to the persistent evolution that is obtained anyway, by playing: in addition to the momentary bonuses that are obtained at the end of each arena, advancing between experience levels one obtains constant progress such as expansions of the 'energy of the tank and active and passive bonuses, which remain even after each death on the battlefield, making subsequent repeated runs much easier. Furthermore, with the coins conquered in the game it is possible to buy better tanks and drones that can support us during the clashes. The scenery elements in the Tankhalla arenas are to be used strategically as cover There are three game modes that partially differ in terms of the objectives to be pursued, but on the battlefield the action is practically always the same: these are close fights that are resolved in a matter of seconds, in which we have to eliminate the opponents trying to stay alive. Driving the chariot is simple, but being a vehicle that is not very agile, it is necessary to calculate precisely the movements to dodge the bullets, while dosing the blows to be inflicted in the best possible way. Primary fire is automatically aimed at the closest enemy, with a loading bar signaling when it's possible to fire in bursts, which triggers a certain cooldown to keep the rate of fire up. At the same time, the secondary attack must be managed strategically: the latter is a more powerful blow that must be directed through a pointer. By performing a parabola, he is able to pass obstacles and strike from a distance, but he is clearly slower and must be calculated in time. A good combination and timing in the use of the two types of attack allows you to get away even in the worst moments, together with the numerous bonuses and progressive multipliers that can be unlocked from level to level. In Tankhalla there are also sporadic bosses, which substantially change the action Finally, we come to the age-old and inevitable question of free-to-play. Tankhalla is a game that has no PvP and online elements in any of its three modes, which in itself already rules out the risk of pay to win. The micro-transactions are there and also abundant: the game contains three different types of in-game currency, two of which are pothey can be won by playing while the third requires the expenditure of money. New tanks and various upgrades can be purchased simply with the rewards that come from the gameplay, although it takes a good amount of time to reach the required sums. The most valuable currency is the one that allows you to continue the game immediately from where we are at the time of game over, or to obtain additional energy points that allow you to play new games (the bar recharges as time passes). Ultimately, it is a rather fair system that does not force in-app purchases but requires, in this case, to accept the harsh reality of the roguelike and make forced breaks between game sessions.", "date": "2021-03-12", "grade": "7.3"}
