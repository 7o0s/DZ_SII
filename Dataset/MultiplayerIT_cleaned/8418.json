With the first chapter of the Squids series, The Game Bakers have definitely started off on the right foot in this sense, achieving good success with audiences and critics: let's see if there are the conditions to continue on the right path with this Squids Wild West. For a handful of pearls The story picks up immediately after the end of the first episode, with our four tentacled heroes Clint, Sammo, Steev and Vahime always busy fighting a dark threat that threatens to endanger the entire seabed. It should be noted that anyone who had not played the predecessor could find themselves initially displaced: the summary of the plot -although present- is not the most exhaustive, and even the playful mechanics are liquidated through a few on-screen suggestions that do not clarify all aspects of the gameplay. Given the absolute goodness of both chapters, we therefore recommend starting the adventure in order, in order to avoid spoilers that would undermine the (unexpectedly considerable) interest of the previous plot. Squids Wild West immediately showcases some of the features that have made the fortune of the young saga: colorful and functional graphics, a clean interface and a tasty search for characterization for all the characters, each with a well-defined personality and look and often very original. Winning team does not change, and The Game Bakers have wisely decided not to make changes to a gameplay that keeps freshness and quality intact even in this second chapter. The title is to all intents and purposes a very successful hybrid between a turn-based strategy and an action game - with a splash of rpg elements that never hurt - fragmented into short-term stages to facilitate the use of small bites typical of mobile gaming. The user has control over a handful of four squids, to be launched at the enemies with a slingshot movement not unlike the one made famous by Angry Birds, in order to cause damage and progressively vanquish the opposing ranks. Very simple in its premises, the play structure of Squids Wild West actually hides a respectable depth, supported by a whole series of well-balanced gameplay elements. Squids can belong to four different classes, each with its own peculiar characteristics and which determines diametrically opposite behaviors in battle: to be successful, it is therefore necessary to exploit the potential of your team properly, carefully planning the moves to be carried out even in relation to the type of enemy you face. Almost as if it were a pinball machine, moreover, the game rewards with bonus damage attacks that make the opponent bounce off a surface, that push him against elements of the scenario such as spikes or explosive barrels or that rebound him between two or more team members. party. Finally, there are elements that can be purchased from a special shop, whether these are extra weapons or hats that enhance the abilities of the individual squids, to have which you have to spend the pearls collected on the battlefield and which also serve to level up the various characters. In short, Squids Wild West has absolutely nothing missing, not even the replay value: each stage has three set objectives (to make all the companions survive, finish within a time limit and find a hidden star) which increase the income of pearls if brought to term, and which act as a real stimulus to retrace one's steps.", "date": "2012-07-19", "grade": "9.2"}
