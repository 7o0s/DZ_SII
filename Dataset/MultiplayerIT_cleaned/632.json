The Miracle How could this miracle happen? Thanks to the most important manufacturer of graphics cards, NVIDIA, which has extensively sponsored the production, and the imminent Electronic Sports World Cup, one of the most important and prestigious competitions in the gaming field, where the organizers have asked French programmers to create a ad hoc version of TrackMania with which players from all over the world will be able to challenge each other in the finals next June and July in Paris (with a final prize of 400,000 dollars!) and in the meantime train at home without spending a single euro! I think that more than one player will have this thought: ~don't wake me up, it doesn't seem real~... The Secret of Success For those who have never had the good fortune to play with the first TrackMania or the subsequent Sunrise, we can say that we are dealing with a blatantly arcade racing game but not only. It is true that the driving setting is really immediate and pleasant, regardless of any simulation ambitions. But one cannot fail to be almost enraptured by the dynamics with which the very simple interaction of the commands (via keyboard, pad or steering wheel ... even with the Xbox 360 pad the game works perfectly) manifests itself on the screen: the minute machines react so immediately even when they are in flight and are so easily dominated by the player that they make the gameplay of Trackmania something very close to the infamous term ~Stylish~. There is always a few tenths of a second to shave off, finding the most advantageous trajectory without leaving the course (which happens very easily). It's the classic game of ~the next is the last~ and instead it will never be. It is the title for a night in front of the monitor but also ideal for that free quarter of an hour between one commitment and another. It is simplicity that becomes gameplay with an excellent dose of spectacularity that does not hurt at all. in TrackMania the challenge is mainly against yourself and the more or less hidden pitfalls of the circuits In TrackMania the challenge is mainly against oneself and the more or less hidden pitfalls of the circuits since the presence of the car controlled by the CPU (but also by the other players in multiplayer) does not lead to a Micromachines-style interaction with possible races based on door and pushed towards the cliffs. If the thing, at first glance, could worry someone, at a distance the choice of programmers can be said to be the right one given that the frenzy and speed of the challenges would not have allowed our reflexes to properly manage even the dirty game of the opponents. Wonder Editor But the real peculiarity of Nadeo's work and which has led it to become a real point of reference on the net is certainly the track editor, also present in TM Nations. With very few clicks of the mouse (or with the same number of keystrokes) it will be possible to build customized circuits worthy of the best dreams (or worst nightmares) of the urban planner in you: tunnels, trampolines, impossible curves, chicanes, banked and much more. And the beauty that it will then be possible to use them for online challenges and exchange them with those of other players without any problem. The Circuit of Nations So let's go and discover the peculiar characteristics of Trackmania Nations: the immediately evident novelty is the new aesthetic look of the game. As you can see from the images, it was decided to set the title in a sort of realistic-like circuit with lots of stands and the public, also to get closer to the competitive spirit of the Electronic Sports World Cup. And so the cars also look a lot like the racing cars of the Formula 1 with splendid skins (however also editable) that represent the colors of the 53 nations participating in the event. The Nadeo programmers then pushed the Sunrise graphics engine towards new qualitative peaks thanks to a high optimization (especially on NVIDIA cards and you can easily understand why ...) without exceeding in hardware requests since all the visual parameters are easily settable . it was decided to set the title in a sort of realistic-like circuit complete with stands and an audience, also to get closer to the competitive spirit of the Electronic Sports World Cup Repeating mania All the features that have created the immense game community are confirmed, including peer 2 peer data exchange and online multiplayer (or even via LAN) with a truly user-friendly interface. Regarding this last aspect, the excessive and unexpected success of the Gioco has led to some small problems since, while we are writing this review, the world ranking with the best times has been disabled, which however does not prevent you from playing online with thousands of other players. And if you are an absolute newcomer to TrackMania, there are 90 circuits divided into 3 levels to play alone (or with other friends via the typical ~hot seat~) to learn the ABCs of the perfect Trackmaniac... There are $400,000 waiting for you in Paris! Final comment A miracle. There is no other term to define the ~TrackMania Nations~ operation: an absolutely free game that can be downloaded from the network and played without even needing to register. And don't think of a reduced version of TrackMania since Nations, in addition to the new graphic design that is clearly more ~serious~ for a competitive event (the Electronic Sports World Cup for which the game was specially created) and a significant optimization of the engine 3D, has all the features that made the series so successful, starting with the multiplayer, the track editor and the ability to exchange your creations with players from all over the world. This comment can only end with the same word it started with: Trackmania Nations is a true miracle. Pros Completely and absolutely free! If you're really good, you could win 400,000 dollars Otherwise you'll still have a lot of fun Cons Too much success has made the online ranking temporarily unusable Maybe the waiting time during the download? Small Advertising Space For many years there has been talk in the digital entertainment world of advertising within the video games themselves but up to now there have not been major material advantages for the end user (if we exclude various free minigames which however leave the time they find ) given that even if the signs of a 3D city were bought by a sportswear or fizzy drink multinational, the game was not marketed at a lower price than a ~No-Logo~ title. Therefore, the arrival of an absolutely free and complete and very high quality product such as Trackmania Nations is surprising, and not a little: you understood correctly, the new chapter of the Nadeo masterpiece is completely free and you can download it from the multiplayer servers at this address!", "date": "2006-02-03", "grade": null}
