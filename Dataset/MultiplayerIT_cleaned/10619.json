Choosing the faction and choosing the specialization of the character, you can enter the game and start shooting. The aim is to conquer the control points of the map, taking them away from the enemy. The team that manages to conquer them all or the one that resets the score of the enemy team wins. Available weapons vary from class to class; there are sniper rifles, machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers and so on. Too bad that with any weapon, killing an enemy is a matter of patience rather than skill, since it takes many shots even when shooting at point blank range. Also, don't expect the action to be too fast paced, as the characters move with a certain ease. By playing and accumulating the so-called value points, it is possible to buy more performing trinkets than the standard ones. Furthermore, by eliminating enemies and conquering control points, experience points are accumulated which level up the character, allowing him to increase skills, such as rapid running or shielding. The Battlefunds Battlefield Heroes is free, but if you want you can spend real money to buy Battlefunds, which, fortunately, do not give game advantages over other players, but are just a way to buy customized clothing for the character. Want a cool pair of shorts for your spy? Well, you just have to pay. Designed for everyone The big limitation of Battlefield Heroes is that it was really designed for everyone, yes, but for everyone who? Without wanting to be snobbish, we wonder how much a similar product can entertain the most experienced users, i.e. all those who eat bread and shoot online every day. The problem isn't just that you leveled down all the elements that make an online shooter worth playing, but how you leveled them all down. Let's say it clearly: the slow characters, the large amount of shots needed to eliminate an enemy, the weak and unsatisfactory weapons and the lack of any possibility of fighting in a more technical way, make Battlefield Heroes flat and not very dynamic and, after the initial excitement for experience points and purchasable weapons, we begin to regret paid titles such as Unreal Tournament III or Team Fortress 2, not to mention the classic Counter-Strike or any other chapter of the same Battlefield series. Even Quake Live, itself free, much older both technically and in concept, is head and shoulders above it. Fire inconsistency It may be said that the deficiencies listed can be overcome by trying to develop teamwork, but this is not the case. Despite the presence of various characters with different roles and equipment, it is difficult to talk about tactics or strategies other than attacking all together head on. The only strategy that works is trying to overwhelm your enemies by outnumbering them. The great resistance to bullets and the purely arcade nature of the title make it useless, if not even counterproductive, to look for cover or try encircles, also because, let's face it, the casual player usually doesn't like following tactics or working for the good of the team , but pursues immediate and quick gratification, possibly the result of not excessive efforts. This philosophy produces all too obvious falsehoods: for example, a bazooka shot against an enemy soldier causes less damage than a single machine gun shot, while using a tank, it takes four or five well-aimed shots to eliminate an opponent, with the result that it is easier to survive a man-to-tank engagement than a man-to-man engagement. The planes then, given the difficulty in driving and to score the hits, are real flying coffins which, at best, can be useful as a means of transport to parachute onto the enemy base. Militant asepticity The basic problem of the game is that it seems to be designed with insurmountable barriers that undermine its depth, in favor of everything and immediately, a temptation that has repeatedly proved to be counterproductive in the long run, i.e. when an online game is called to prove everything its value. This is also why we avoided the day one review: we wanted to seriously test the criticalities of Battlefield Heroes, without rushing to make summary judgments. Now searchdon't get us wrong, we're not talking about a bad game in the absolute sense. It's simply designed not to frustrate the player who, during the first few games, doesn't want to be killed without understanding how or why, by some deity who lives and breathes on the game servers. Furthermore, wanting to target the widest possible audience, the developers have seen fit to mitigate the violence as much as possible, making the killings rather aseptic and, above all, totally absent of various bleeding and dismemberments. Unfortunately in Battlefield Heroes killing with a machine gun, shotgun or artillery shell produces the exact same effects.", "date": "2009-07-20", "grade": "6.0"}
