Because what you are facing is not a simple agglomeration of graphics, playability, sound and longevity. What you have in your hands is a beautiful piece of modern video game history. Through the Master Chief's gaze we have reached the definitive affirmation of the first-person shooter on consoles and the mighty back of the armored hero has been the driving force for competitive online played with a pad. For many years John was the backbone of Xbox, beautiful to look at, play and listen to. The last two entries have remained intact and with the necessary refinements of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which include the 60 frames per second, they are in step with the times. On the other hand, we will talk about the graphic rendering shortly. But faced with a collection like this we certainly can't stop at the technical part. The narrative component is one of the cornerstones of the series created by Bungie and almost always effectively alternates articulated plots and moments of pure Yankee adrenaline. The pace is not always impeccable and it is not possible to expect everyone to be equally passionate about a faceless hero who is certainly not the perfect symbol of multifaceted character design. But in the economy of the series it is undoubtedly functional. Everyone can wear a helmet and feel Spartan and in all this it is said that an extravagant and memorable design is synonymous with great characterization. This, in fact, can be obtained indirectly and it is precisely the case of the Master Chief who has transformed himself from armor into a character through his actions, encounters, enemies, events and stories. A large part of this evolution is included in the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, a massive package that includes all the numbered chapters of the series embellished with obvious aesthetic improvements. The second Halo, specifically, has been heavily revised and the result, we anticipate it, is really excellent. Halo: The Master Chief Collection packs the Master Chief epic into one massive experience Spartan II John-117 Halo was not the first quality shooter on consoles and we must admit that the great success of the series created by Bungie is also due to its ability to leave the screen thanks to a massive promotional system. Each Halo was an event even before its release, made memorable by the tortuous viral campaigns, unforgettable commercials such as Dioramas and the powerful notes of the unmistakable Martin O'Donnell theme reinterpreted by Steve Vai. But the longevity and success of the series they don't just depend on the hype or the outline. Born in the sign of Apple, which wanted to acquire Bungie by launching itself into the world of video games, Halo immediately ignited the desire of gamers with an incredible 180 megabyte video dropped by surprise during Macworld 1999. Shortly thereafter, the brand and developers were acquired by Microsoft to act as a standard-bearer for the nascent Xbox project, in turn the backbone of the online revolution on consoles. An inevitable revolution but accelerated by the aims of Bill Gates and the gameplay of Halo, a set of mechanics capable of making sense of the pad with the implementation of an auto-aim that does not sacrifice too much the skill of the player and enhances it with a melee that in some situations even comes to remember a fighting game. The infrastructure of Xbox Live has embraced the series only since the second chapter but Halo has arrived at the appointment in dazzling form thanks to a tight gameplay, balanced and perfectly supported by a multiplayer of great thickness. Yet the donut, however tasty, would still not have had its hole without an engaging universe to complete the work. A universe made suggestive by the secret of those large rings suspended in space and by the constant presence of the Covenant, an alien race characterized by customs, beliefs, objectives and enemies. Master Chief traverses this galaxy of dangers and mysteries as a bulldozer. Never delicate or hesitant. Always decisive. Always ready to serve and fight. Yet even the inscrutable super soldier has room for personal growth. He becomes someone, as we have said, thanks to what surrounds him and what surrounds him includes the delicate relationship with the artificial intelligence Cortana. The attractive Cortana who is at first a computerized assistant but soon becomes something more. The cold Cortana becomes the lost Cortana, scared, then corrupted and insane. An AI that becomes capable of influencing the actions of the inscrutable hero. Become less and less of a hologram and more and more of a character, with hundreds of lines of dialogue, in one procit of characterization that is reflected, inevitably, on the Master Chief. The hero par excellence, pillar of a humanity in disarray, would not be such without his Cortana. In the Spartan armor there is a fallible being and this aspect is materialized both in its weaknesses and in its greater strength. We are talking about something that is impossible to learn or synthesize in the laboratory: luck. A fundamental factor, the latter, in characterizing the human component of John 117. Something that emerges clearly at the beginning of the third chapter when Cortana's voice recites the words Dr. Elizabeth Halsey: ~I could choose. You can't ~Did I ever say? I chose my favorite Spartan. You know me. I searched a lot. I watched you become the soldier we wanted. You were strong, quick and brave, like everyone else. A true leader. But you had something in more. Something that only I have been able to see. Do you know what I'm talking about? Luck.~ And this is the key to understanding a big and bad hero like few others but made memorable by his human component. Master Chief is an empty helmet only in appearance. The John who lands on Xbox One brings with him the Spartans who died to give him a chance to save the world. Desperate heroic deeds. A dramatic epilogue. A suggestive rebirth. Another mysterious threat. All connected to an ever-expanding narrative galaxy, populated by enemies who are almost never banal operetta villains. Relations with the Covenant evolve, the Flood discover themselves to be something more than an infestation and the image of the forerunners changes radically, taking the form of a fearsome and unexpected threat. But there is still something behind it. The fear of men. Betrayals. Secrets. A dense universe that we don't explore further so as not to spoil the surprise for all those players who have never set foot in the Master Chief's universe and could do so with a collection that makes all the main chapters of the series available on the same console. It is both a clear invitation to prospective new players and a grand summary for longtime fans, a bridge to a Halo 5 that will fit into the same unified, all-encompassing interface, enriched by all genres of multimedia content designed to give life to a real Halo Channel, an evolving hub that probably won't have its final form until the arrival of the fifth installment of the series. But the new interface immediately translates into the definitive farewell to external services in exchange for a hub that allows us to access all Halos, Ridley Scott's Nightfall TV series, additional content, the shop, news with just a few clicks , social dynamics and content sharing. The multiplayer sector obviously includes the personalization of one's own tag, support for clans, the personalization of every single avatar with all the specific options of each chapter and detailed statistics, including rankings for any imaginable ranking, all reset compared to the past for a completely new beginning, under the banner of 343 Industries. Furthermore, in all this, a decidedly advanced spectator mode should also arrive, which we have seen but which we do not know when it will be launched, which will allow us to observe a game, evaluate its statistics in real time and only at that point decide if it is worth worth playing. The Halo services revolution will begin with a mega update, already downloadable for those who own the digital delivery version of the title, which will be followed by the launch of the Nightfall series. Subsequently, in December, the Special Operations of Halo 4 will also arrive, for now excluded from the package, and finally it will be time for the multiplayer beta of Halo 5: Guardians, scheduled for December 29, access to which will be guaranteed to all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Thirteen long years Before talking about gameplay, it is good to take stock of the graphics that represent the main change for all four experiences. We talked a lot about the first Halo in the Anniversary version, already released on Xbox 360, and in this new version only the frame rate and resolution change (the whole collection, except Halo 2, runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second). The greater definition of the image is evident and the fluidity further improves a gameplay that has remained incredibly young. But there are some awkwardnesses, the fluidity involves some glitches and in general, from a technical point of view, the weight of the years is felt. For Halo 2, however, the speech is different. Already more advanced in origin, the second Halo, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary, enjoyed a treatmore intensive action which also involved the sound sector. And by changing the game engine, the difference is immediately felt in the cleaning of the sound, in the altered audio levels and in the new samples that give a completely different rendering to explosions and weapons. But what is surprising is the work done on materials and lighting. Models, vehicles and weapons literally leave us speechless and give us back an almost unrecognizable title, embellished with new graphic effects and quality particles. A clear improvement that stands out in multiplayer, in radically transformed maps, but which miss the great valleys of the single player, rather bare areas whose rendering clashes when compared with the amazing one of the new models. Furthermore, Halo 2 is the only one of the four titles not to enjoy 1080p resolution. But this renunciation was necessary to reach 60 frames, preferable to full HD given the impact on gameplay, while maintaining the ability to switch instantly from the original engine, including the original sound, to the new one. We are talking, in essence, of a massive work reserved for a title that now has ten years on its back. It would have been difficult to ask for more and in any case, to compensate, there is a decidedly pleasant surprise. The interlude scenes, in the original made with the game engine, have all been redone in computer graphics and are almost up to those of Halo 4 even if the latter is obviously unattainable from a technical point of view. The fourth chapter is the first made by 343 Industries who know the engine inside out and immediately demonstrated that they know how to do it when it comes to graphics and optimization. And in the transition to high resolution what we find in our hands is a title that we could almost define as cross-gen and which, apart from some slowdowns related to map loading, runs at a constant 60 frames. In other situations, on the other hand, the increase in resolution reveals some not particularly defined textures but this applies to all four titles and does not bother too much even in the title in which it is most evident. We're talking about Halo 3 whose changes, excluding frame rate and resolution, focus on improving the lighting. But we have to say that missions like Sierra 117 and The Tsavo Highway still allow themselves to be watched with immense pleasure and this thanks to a rendering of sunlight that is already amazing in the 2007 original. But there is one element that unites all and four titles and supports the aesthetic component. Let's talk about the amazing animations. Let's talk about the marines who sit on the side of the Scorpion, the stealth kills of the third Halo, the arrogant walk of the protagonist. Thanks to all this and thanks to the suspension of the Warthog and the sinuous movements of the Ghost, Halo is still able to support the weight of a great soundtrack. When a thick soundtrack appears detached and distant from the accompanying images, that is the exact moment in which the graphics of a game can be defined as old-fashioned. But this doesn't even happen in the case of the first Halo which, despite being technically weaker than the others, still transmits everything needed to push us to explore the Master Chief saga, a universe now made even more inviting by aesthetic improvements and faster loading that they also ensure a better multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, this is not yet fully usable but we were able to test it exhaustively on a London trip. The map selection interface works very well and the netcode is, as in the originals, responsive and flawless. The only doubt, which we will only be able to dispel starting November 10, concerns the speed and functionality of matchmaking now extended to an incredible number of maps and modes. Xbox One goals Trying your hand at Halo: The Master Chief Collection means having the ability to unlock achievements for 4500 points. A monstrous amount that corresponds to the completion of four campaigns, with their secrets, and even playlists. Then there are tons of objectives that can be conquered by performing spectacular actions, the true trademark of the series, and a long list of multiplayer enterprises, shared between all the chapters of the series, none of which are particularly demanding. On the other hand, getting to unlock everything is already in itself no small feat with 450 objectives available. The backbone Halo: The Master Chief Collection includes four different experiences but all sharing a single backbone made up of excellent control response, automatic aiming that does not exclude skill, the constant of only two weapons carried, grenades equipped with an excellent physicist", "date": "2014-11-07", "grade": "9.5"}
