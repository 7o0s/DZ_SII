Developed by Simteract, which also has a very interesting taxi simulator set in Barcelona in the works, this Train Life tries to provide the classic train game with a career mode worthy of the name. To make it very short and very simple: Train Life tries to do with trains, what Euro Truck Simulator did with trucks. But it is not easy. In fact, Euro Truck Simulator manages to convey a tangible everyday life: you stop at an autogrill to sleep, you can change route to avoid unexpected work in progress and despite the scale reproduction, it conveys the idea of a journey. This does not happen in Train Life, the experience remains impersonal, it lacks bite despite the commitment put by the developers into the project. The game also looks very good, graphically clean, sounds in their place, there is even a radio with decidedly surprising songs and that no one would expect in a similar title, but not even in others to be honest... dance nineties in a train game? You are bloody geniuses. Learn the trade Train Life: The stations are very well done, but nobody is ever there! Even if the driving and navigation mechanics are not very complex, the tutorial in Train Life remains an obligatory step. The introduction to the game consists of five scenarios which, once completed, will allow us to get our hands on our very personal train driver's license: it is the beginning of a new career. From now on, although the job offers initially won't be so numerous, we will be free to choose how to use our personal locomotive. In Train Life we will be able to transport goods or passengers along the tracks of a Europe in which each country has its own particular characteristics but which for the most part will appear too generic. This is the price of having what we could define as a sort of open world, instead of the classic scenarios that distinguish other games dedicated to the world of railways. Train Life requires attention: you need to pay attention to signs, speed limits and exchanges, and finding your way around the stations is never a given. But woe to you if you forget one of the lessons of the tutorial: in fact, there seems to be no way to review things that you will soon forget, and you will necessarily have to use. They are not functions related to the train, more to the navigation of the different possible operations and this is a big problem: despite a certain familiarity with the genre, shortly after the tutorial we found ourselves stuck between the platforms of a station because there seemed to be no way to get back in the shed, nor to take the pre-established load and finally start the journey. We have not found any solutions in the list of commands, nor among the few tips that the game will give along the gameplay and the only way out was to go through the training from start to finish. It wasn't realistic and it wasn't fun. Trans Europe Express Train Life: Both cargo and passengers can be transported in the Simteract game After all, there is little realism here. Train Life is good enough to make you believe you are a real train driver, but the proposed system is not very credible and, this is the real problem, all too predictable. The map may be large, but it is clearly devoid of verve, of life: where are the passengers waiting? Two-dimensional models would have been better in place of this ghostly silence that surrounds every station, even the largest and most important; also very little traffic managed by the AI and practically non-existent any unforeseen events that would make each journey more thrilling, fun. In Train Life the journeys can also be very long, about forty minutes, and this would be a nice point in favor of the Simteract game if it were even slightly more eventful. More and more good Train Life: Driving a train in the rain is always a great experience However, the career is interesting, especially at the beginning when it will be necessary to work hard to create your own fleet of trains, and avoid any driving errors that could compromise the integrity of the vehicle and increase the prices of repairs. It is always necessary to keep an eye on any diesel locomotive fuel, so as not to find yourself walking a few meters from the target station. Of course, managing everything will increase in complexity as you buy new locomotives and above all you hire new engineers, who can do the dirty work for you. However, it will be necessary to continue to get involved personally because completing the tasks will also increaseh the experience level of your alter ego, who will thus be able to accept more demanding and, consequently, remunerative jobs.", "date": "2022-11-28", "grade": "6.5"}
