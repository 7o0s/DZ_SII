Think of an old-fashioned cartoony version of James Bond, with aesthetics that recall animation classics like Hanna & Barbera cartoons like ~The Jetsons~ and you have an idea of what Agent A: A Secret Secret has to offer. offer. It is a graphic adventure with an investigative setting that sees us play the mysterious and highly skilled Agent A in pursuit of the dangerous spy Ruby La Rouge, responsible for a cowardly bomb attack against a cruise ship. The game takes place according to the dictates of ~point and click~ but has the advantage of offering an approach specifically designed for the touch screen, in a title that is designed for mobile use. We are used to seeing high-profile graphic adventures arriving on mobile devices from the PC world, but in this case we are witnessing an excellent example of a title designed for smartphones and tablets, structured according to the adventure tradition but able to offer a cut experience for portable devices. Which also translates into extremely logical and not very cryptic puzzles, which on the one hand make up a fluid and pleasant experience but on the other can be simple for fans of great classic adventures, except for some more complex passages and for the possibility always aware of missing some elements of interaction due to pixel hunting, however here much less pervasive than in many other cases. The result is a title characterized by a high-profile production, with a distinctive graphic style and a particular atmosphere that can also overcome a certain simplicity and brevity with these weapons. The magical world of spies is revealed in all its charm in the adventure Agent A Adventure in style The structure is therefore that of a point-and-click adventure with a first-person shot and static screens, with the possibility of interacting by touching various elements of the scenario or by acting on them with inventory objects. To get an idea, one can think of a sort of Myst but with a much simpler puzzle structure, which forces a little lateral thinking but in general places the solution within easy reach, simply by observing what surrounds us to find clues or with a very logical use of inventory items. The simplicity, however, is not excessive and the puzzles are in any case well studied and able to give a certain satisfaction for each solution found, they simply do not pose a challenge that is too demanding and practically never frustrating. The problem is that such a fluid flow between the puzzles should be supported by an adequate length of the game, given the speed with which one proceeds in the investigation inside the splendid seaside villa of the spy Ruby La Rouge, in search of the elusive mistress of home. Instead, everything ends within 3 hours of play (even 2, for the more experienced), moreover with a truncated ending that suggests the presence of further episodes in the future. An episodic structure for such an adventure is also welcome, as is a sort of final cliffhanger that leaves room for further evolution of the story, but such an abrupt conclusion above all leaves the feeling of a general incompleteness of the gaming experience. and it's a shame. It is extremely strange if you look at the high level of production that distinguishes all the other aspects of Agent A, from the intelligent construction of some puzzles to the excellent tactile interface, but above all as regards the technical aspect, with a memorable graphic style that makes the gaming experience truly special.", "date": "2015-11-10", "grade": "8.6"}
