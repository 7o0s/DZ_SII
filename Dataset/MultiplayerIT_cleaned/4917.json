{"name": "Puyo Puyo Tetris", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182413-puyo-puyo-tetris-la-strana-coppia.html", "text": "The strength of a couple is to stick together and find the strength to make things work together despite the enormous differences: on the one hand there is a serious, rigid and somewhat angular character; on the other a lively, cheerful and much softer but not nave for this. It could be the incipit of a romantic comedy but, twist, it is the closest explanation to defining the essence of Puyo Puyo Tetris. Maybe it's not what the guys from Sonic Team and Sega were thinking about when they imagined joining two historical puzzle games like these, but the result is more or less the same: an unexpected combination that works between ups and downs... because it goes admitted right away, this bizarre puzzle mix is not always effective, but the fun that the title gives players makes them forget all the little flaws! Puyo Puyo Tetris is a colorful and fun mashup that has something extra on Switch Modes for all tastes Obviously we will overlook the game dynamics of both Puyo Puyo and Tetris, also because if you don't know them, the only plausible excuse is that you moved to planet Earth no more than two weeks ago. The game offers a lot in both single and multiplayer. Before accessing the menu, we will find a quick selection of challenges being able to choose between a Puyo Puyo against the artificial intelligence, a Fusion game (we will explain what it is shortly) always against the CPU and a Tetris marathon. The main menu then consists in turn of six different items or Adventure, Solo Arcade, Multiplayer Arcade, Options, Online and Lessons. Adventure and Lessons speak for themselves respectively offering a fairly challenging path with a minimum of story while Lessons will teach you to master all the secrets to tear your opponents apart with both puzzles. The options included in the Solo and Multiplayer Arcade are very interesting, where the former contains one more mode than the latter. These are the Challenges, or the classic challenge games with objectives to be achieved such as Endless Puyo or Tetris Ultra. With this small exception, the other modes present for both single player and multiplayer are Versus, Fusion, Swap, Party and Big Bang. The first is a classic challenge between players where everyone can choose whether to stack colored beans or geometric blocks regardless of the choice made by the other opponents. In Swap instead the game alternates between Tetris and Puyo Puyo and the peculiarity of the challenge is how the chains can be developed: when the screen ~swaps~ it will continue to drop useful material even if the screen is momentarily inactive and, if the piece is falling will land in a spot that allows Puyo to burst or eliminate a row, that move will count and add to the damage inflicted on the opponent the best strategy? Prepare a combination before swapping and drop the winning piece slowly while the screen is idle! Party provides for the drop of power-ups on the screen that can only be used by eliminating material near them, thus inflicting malus on the opponent and lowering his score, whoever has scored the most points wins. Big Bang, on the other hand, is an Endless Fever where chains of material are prepared ad hoc for both players, who must eliminate it as quickly and effectively as possible. At the end of each round an automatic count of points is made and whoever is at a disadvantage suffers visible damage in a ~bar of life~, whoever tears the opponent down with loud chain blows wins. We left the Fusion mode for last which should be the heart of the entire title but which unfortunately is initially the most difficult to digest. In fact, during these challenges both Puyo and Tetriminos will be dropped on the screen and players will have to use both materials to compose their own chains. The rules are a little different than usual because together with the classic mechanics we find some new ones, such as the difference in weight between the various elements and the presence of special pieces of a dual nature; depending on the need, you can choose which form to use them in, remembering that the geometric blocks are heavier and will crush the Puyos if placed on top of them. It is certainly an interesting mode and it is also well studied but it is not very effective in the eyes of those players with a lot of experience on their shoulders, so used to playing in the classic way that they are unable to get used to the new method immediately and the demonstration are the very few matches playable online. Oh my, what have I done? Although the CPU at high difficulty levels gives a hard time, the beauty of Puyo Puyo Tetris is that you can play it with your friendsand the Switch factor is indispensable! You will be able to play multiplayer games with a minimum of two and a maximum of four opponents by choosing either split screen (both TV and Tablet versions) using a number of Joy-Con equal to that of the players or locally, each on his own console. Puyo Puyo Tetris is configured as the portable title par excellence, capable not only of adapting to the needs of players thanks to the nature of Switch but also succeeding with that pinch of nostalgia, almost to hurt the heart, taking us back to the times when we travel as kids always with our Game Boy in our pocket ready to compete with shots of Tetris or Puyo Puyo. It must be said to be honest that in the review phase it was not possible to try the split screen for four players in tablet mode, so we don't know in terms of gameplay how comfortable this can actually be. A few words must also be spent on online, in which we will find free games and the Puzzle League. The first are friendly challenges that the player can choose by attending the Rooms dedicated to each mode while the others are ranked games and get ready, because Japanese players are unbeatable! During our test, testing the online was frustrating to say the least because the opponents of the Rising Sun are particularly skilled but despite this the match making has always been balanced, based on Rank and Rating, and we are sure that when the game comes out even in Europe and the United States the level of players will equalize. Now there is a long-standing but important issue to be resolved before closing the review: the commands. The problem lies in the conformation and sensitivity of the Switch peripherals where the feedback of the pad is too woody while the analog and directional joysticks of the Joycons are too sensitive: therefore a very annoying picture follows because in the first case you lose reactivity (essential in online games) while in the second it's even worse and a hard drop (ie the automatic descent of a piece) can turn into a tragedy making you scream, hence the title of the paragraph, ~oh my God, what have I done?~ The solution was soon served as the game offers three different command configurations, each with its own reverse version, but if you've been playing Tetris or Puyo Puyo for twenty years, in a certain way it's not pleasant to get used to a new configuration. Obviously this does not affect the playability of the title because it is enough to get used to it, moreover it is a fussiness that only very old players will suffer  a sort of compromise that must be accepted if you opt for the Switch version. Finally, we remind you that the game is only available in English and not localized in Italian.", "date": "2017-04-24", "grade": "8.0"}
