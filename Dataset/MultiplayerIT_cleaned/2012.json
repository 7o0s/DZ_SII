{"name": "Men in Black 2: Alien Escape", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/men-in-black-2-alien-escape-2.html", "text": "Blast aliens, somersault, blast aliens, open a door Men in Black II: Alien Escape is a third-person shooter that puts you in the shoes of agents Jay and Kay, the now famous Men in Black, engaged in solving an important case of illegal trafficking of weapons and illegal aliens on earth using the fist of iron and a good handful of irony. The Melbourne House types immerse us in a mindless shooter game system, entirely oriented towards fast action, with puzzles that would be reductive to define as simple, the usual pile of aliens to kill and the even more typical baggage (not even too rich) of weapons to use and upgrade to take out the bad guys mentioned above. The basic control layout provides for movement by degrees of intensity of the character and rotation on its axis with the first analog of the controller, lateral movement (strafe) with the back buttons L1 and R1, the X button in the task of being worn out for continuous shooting, the kill-all smart bomb on R2 (one per level); on the remaining buttons we find the 180  movement and the somersault, useful in moments of excessive confusion to turn quickly, get out of a hail of enemy shots or avoid the devastating blows of the bosses. The main game mode comes with five main missions, in turn divided into sub-levels, to be solved obviously through the pure and simple blasting of aliens and by defeating the end-of-level bosses to conquer the much coveted final and a secret bonus level. Other game modes include: weapon training (strangely achieved after learning the weapons themselves); the boss mode, in which you can re-face the end-of-level monsters already defeated in the main game; and the secret data, which are nothing more than simple cards of the main characters (agents Jay and Kay) and the game's aliens with a small biography, the polygonal model (unfortunately not zoomable) and a fun character card; the offer is concluded by the ~making of~ cards and the original trailer of the film, localized in Italian like all the dialogues in the game. The whole construction of the game, therefore, therefore provides for the classic progressive locking system to keep the interest of the game alive: by passing a level you will have access to a part of secret data and to the training of the five weapons available, as well as being able to end-of-level bosses whenever you want. Blast aliens, somersault, blast aliens, open a door But does this system work? The answer is, unfortunately, negative. Men in Black II is a fairly superficial title, offering little even short-term engagement and making no attempt to be original; is a shooter in which everything has practically already been seen, whose few attractions are largely drowned by an action that is too repetitive and devoid of satisfaction for the player: this outcome is probably due to the hasty development and the strict production timelines deriving from the to have been launched in parallel with the blockbuster film of the same name on which it is based. In saying this we could expose ourselves to the accusations of having settled on the prejudice of the ~law of tie-ins~ exposed at the beginning, but it is precisely knowing certain production mechanisms that we are preparing to evaluate MIIB beyond the film from which it is based, in relation to the pure factor of entertainment, interaction and challenge that it offers to the player. The work of the MIBs must be decidedly bureaucratic because that's how the game is. The main defect of MIIB is the boring playability it offers to the player, which derives from its absolute repetitiveness even if it is an action game: the environments tend to resemble each other inexorably, and only propose an interaction structure in which not only the enemies to blast are practically the same from level to level, but also the only obstacle to overcome to unlock the new rooms (excluding sporadic activations of switches that leave the time they find). The save system, then, which states that the only way to save is to completely finish a mission, only makes things worse: to save it you will have to complete it all in succession, subjecting yourself to the ordeal that derives not from the difficulty of the game itself, but by the fact that you will be forced to perform the same actions and kill the same enemies for dozens and dozens of minutes without stopping and without the slightest trace of variety. The usable weapons, even if nice to see for the beautiful light effects, will soon tire you: they can be upgraded within six degrees, but have strengths and weaknesses.and not specific enough to warrant strategic use. Upgrading them does nothing but increase their destructive potential, which doesn't help you have more fun: it's an important factor for continuation but it doesn't improve the lack of freshness of the action and, on the contrary, makes it worse, since the blows suffered will make you fly up in the air the power-ups already taken, which you will have to re-collect in a few seconds if you don't want to regress to an even more boring shot. The work of the MIBs must be decidedly bureaucratic The simplistic objective of the game is therefore resolved in shooting all enemies without exception, waiting for the barriers to magically ~jump~ as a result, facing a new pile of enemies, occasionally activating switches to operate an elevator, reblast all the enemies and get to the end-of-level bosses, the only sections that are good fun. However, you will absolutely have to defeat them with the lives remaining from the initial three: it is possible to continue with the same energy of arrival as many times as you want but, in case you get bored and want to resume from the last part of a mission, know that you will have to repeat the whole mission all over again, even the already abundantly passed levels. The characteristic of the save of being valid only for entire missions is not resolved, as probably in the intentions of the programmers, in a greater degree of challenge, but in a high rate of frustration due not to the difficulty of the game (which is absolutely average) but to the bad structuring of the bailouts. A couple of massive and spectacular bosses are not enough Ultimately, the player will be reduced to patiently carrying on waiting for the coveted bosses, which in some cases turn out to be decidedly massive, well designed and animated and with a high level of spectacularity. However, the patience required to overcome very long repetitive sections for a boss challenge is short-lived, however, and the fact that the programmers have decided to make these encounters available without redoing the levels after passing them the first time betrays their awareness that it is of the only attraction offered by MIIB, in addition to the few data to unlock such as the small biographies of the protagonists, of the aliens or the ~making of~, absolutely negligible in terms of devices to extend the life of the game. Don't expect the Smash Bros gallery-museum, because the bios of the enemies are only those of the 29 present in the levels and the characters are not even zoomable. Not even the weapon training, absurdly unlockable following the levels, which attracts the player out of simple curiosity, constitutes a concrete contribution to longevity. The flaws of the game also include an antediluvian, repetitive and very slow loading system even in the options sub-screens, probably designed to get even more exasperated players to the missions. Nice effects, decent polygons, slightly silly voices The production defects of MIIB, i.e. carelessness, non-originality and repetitiveness, are naturally reflected in the audiovisual sector of the title. Once again it is the bosses who provide the game with the opportunity to redeem itself: large, monstrous and disturbing, they are animated in a cinematic way, emit violent and spectacular shots and make the game adrenaline-pumping with their ferocious grunts. On the contrary, the environments are poorly cared for, blocky and with texture mapping of little more than sufficient quality, like the rest of the characters who, although well done, have decidedly average animations and are devoid of any facial expression as well as being afflicted, in sporadic interlude animations, of very stupid movements, probably the result of the attempted imitation of Will Smith's ~cool~ movements (applied indiscriminately also to the far from ~groovy~ agent Kay). The positive note are the light effects: each weapon has its own effect and color which becomes more massive and spectacular with each upgrade until it literally fills the screen with flows of luminous energy. Properly opacified, the same effects make the way enemies dematerialize by melting away when killed is spectacular, or the way enemies are presented as holograms in training mode is nice. But however well done, the lights do not improve the discrete graphic proposal of the title much. As for the sound aspect, the situation does not improve: the sound effects are the usual heard and resentful (apart from the beautiful grunts of the bosses), the speech is sparse and the music is simple background themes that soon become repeateditivi. Definitely... MIIB is a title recommended only to great fans of the genre, who love to shoot, shoot and shoot even if this does not involve any variety. The game is otherwise recommended to all others for a quick weekend rental, if only to blast a couple of massive bosses. MIIB is in fact, for the average player, boring, repetitive and unattractive even on an audiovisual level. Not even fans of the film saga or animated spin-offs could be interested enough: the plot of the film has been totally watered down, the characters are bad copies of the original actors with poor movements (the thin line between coolness and awkwardness has been abundantly broken), the biographies are practically useless in the economy of the game and the voice actors are very far from those of the film. In the Italian-language version, then, there is a massacre of a clear Mediaset matrix on the voices of the protagonists, a sign that Japanese anime were only the first victims: whoever has ears to hear, hear... Definitely... Pros  Nice lighting effects  Massive end-of-level bosses Cons  Very repetitive action  Very slow loading  Poorly structured longevity  Neither original nor well made Direct transposition of the cinematic blockbuster, Men in Black II: Alien Escape (henceforth MIIB) is a shooter that falls into the category of tie-ins, playful transpositions of cinematic or animated successes that suffer from a sad phenomenon: that to be games made with more in mind the official license than the actual originality of the title. Follow us to find out if MIIB escapes this sad rule which, far from being a prejudice from reviewers or an urban legend, is reconfirmed in the history of videogames since ET for the Atari 2600, passing through Street Fighter: the movie and Tom&Jerry on the SNES.", "date": "2002-09-12", "grade": null}
