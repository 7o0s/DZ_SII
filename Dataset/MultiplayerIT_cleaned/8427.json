We've just released a preview of this creepy title; now is the time to go all the way. The drama of the game is set in an abandoned sawmill in Val D'Ayas, which by the way really exists. Before getting to work, the developers took many photos of the place, collected news on bloody events that occurred in those parts and on local folklore. The result is a story that distances itself from the news (ghosts don't exist, did you know that?) but maintains deep ties with the land that inspired it. The game begins with the amnesia of a university professor who, driven by the discovery of some mysterious photos, finds himself on the lawn in front of the sawmill. Words appear in the glare of the sun illuminating the valley. These are the thoughts of the protagonist, who first remembers a name, Anna, and then an old promise of love. Nothing else. If he wants answers, he has to continue. And we with him. But how the heck do you get into the sawmill? Open up, Anna! Anna is simple to master but hard to crack, at least compared to many adventures out there. There is no clear direction to follow and there are many objects to examine. The secret is letting go, abandoning yourself to madness. Even better if at night, in the dark. It's like studying a new species: you do different tests to find out where it's most sensitive. That's why getting into the sawmill is tricky, although it's only the beginning of the game. However a closed door remains a closed door. And we have to open it. Once inside the sawmill, the game changes radically, and we have to constantly adapt to its rules. Several times the ground floor and the attic change their appearance. The lights change, the arrangement of the objects, and sinister images appear on the walls, such as wide open eyes or scenes from a forgotten story, drawn in chalk. However, our task is only one: to solve the puzzles to reveal the last mystery of the Val D'Ayas. Luckily the puzzles are all very inspired. And in fact one of Anna's great qualities is that she never slips into the banal. It is also true that some passages are unclear, and the correct sequence of the puzzles almost always remains obscure. But losing every point of reference is part of the game. The only risk is getting stuck. Luckily it doesn't happen often, and in any case we can activate the hints, faithful friends of the lost player. Or the lazy one. Among the Dreampainters the voluminous game designer Simone Tagliaferri stands out, who has been shouting uncomfortable truths to the crowds for the past decade on these pages. We have treated Anna with impartiality, but it is still good to point out the strong bond we have with Simone. Never let a dead man rest in peace Anna is a thoughtful yet tormented horror game. Jolts, slamming doors, moans, and throbbing organs are some of the thrilling events designed to wear down the player's nerves. There is always something lurking, but it never shows itself. On the other hand, the less we know what's going on, the more we get scared. Thanks to the fact that the protagonist can only walk. In fact, many times you feel like running, especially because of the noises, which are like a sharp blade in Anna's ghostly hands. We have already told you about the excellent sound design in the tested. Now we can tell you that until the end is one of the most successful aspects of the game. However, together with the settings, hurried in the generic furnishings, such as tables and shelves, but which reveal an out of the ordinary artistic direction as soon as they are deformed due to an esoteric event. Above all, the use of colors enlivens each room and signals the transition from one phase of the game to another. Anna is a dark and brooding adventure but uses shades of red, blue, green and purple abundantly. And it contrasts light and dark. In the sawmill, on the other hand, everything moves, even the memories and the colors. The truth hurts There are three endings. Each offers a different degree of truth based on the level of madness the player has reached. It's hard to say how Anna recognizes our behavior and calculates how much sanity we've lost. All the better: we feel even more at the mercy of the nightmare in which we have been locked up. The events of the game are in fact designed to make us doubt everything, even ourselves. There is, for example, a moment when the roof disappears; the effect is so unexpected that we don't know whether to marvel or lock ourselves in a closet. Voices are also heard during the adventure. They belong to a man and a woman. Unfortunately we were only able to hear spoken English, which does a decent job between ups and downs. Localization in italiano will arrive with the release of the first patch. The dialogues are discounted; we appreciated much more the notes written in the protagonist's notebook, which are present together with the game in PDF format. On the other hand, the quality of the soundtrack is indisputable. Created by the gothic group Chantry, it adds the necessary pathos to the drama of a morbid passion. This brings us to the core of Anna's narrative. Even if the underlying theme is widespread in the horror genre, the Dreampainters have developed it in an original way, between myth and painful reality. However, the feeling remains that this story still has a lot to tell. Maybe. Other events, repressed emotions that have not found a voice. One thing is certain: Anna is an intense, intimate horror adventure with a lot of personality. There couldn't have been a better debut for the Dreampainters.", "date": "2012-07-16", "grade": "8.0"}
