Yet, thanks to a hilarious performance by Bruce Campbell and a unique setting in the film series Houses, Sam Raimi's film earned a large following in the early 90s, becoming a cult horror comedy. Armed with a license of this caliber, development developers Backflip Studios has created Army of Darkness Defense, a small and lively game for iPhone and iPod Touch that traces the exploits of the brave Ash Williams against a horde of undead intent on taking possession of the Necronomicon, the necromancy text in which incredible powers of black magic are kept. From the hardware department to the Middle Ages For Army of Darkness Defense, the development team has re-proposed the same formula that proved successful with Paper Toss and Ninjump: simple and perhaps quite repetitive experiences in the long run, but which level after level keep the player glued to the screen thanks to a series of unlockable contents and intuitive mechanics. The game is a classic castle defense in which to face and repel the opposing army on a horizontal game plane, in this case trying to protect the Necronomicon at all costs. The plot of the film is barely hinted at, limiting itself to introducing the character of Ash, a shopping center clerk who, back in the Middle Ages and armed with a rifle and chainsaw, must lead King Arthur's troops against the evil army. The first, and perhaps the only difference with games like Armageddon and Legendary Wars is represented by the possibility of directly controlling a hero, moving him within the playing area and deciding whether to attack or flee. In fact, the player is able to move Ash to the right or left of the screen, in order to slow down the progress of enemies or weaken them using one of several special abilities. Instead, your own units behave as usual, only moving forward once summoned. The eliminated enemies then drop two types of resources: metal, useful for quickly summoning new units, and gold, essential if you want to unlock upgrades for your army. Between one level and another it is in fact possible to choose whether to reinforce a particular unit, improve Ash's special abilities or equip the castle with defense systems, such as catapults, archers and traps. However, the difficulty curve proved to be very permissive, so much so that we passed most of the 50 levels in one go and without ever seeing the Game Over screen. It is in the last three or four levels that Army of Darkness Defense suddenly becomes infamous, suddenly increasing the strength of the enemy armies and showing the side of what is our main criticism: rather than stimulating the search for a winning strategy for neutralize the attacks thanks to specific units, the game limits itself to harassing the player forcing him to repeat the same level over and over again, in order to accumulate enough money to upgrade his troops and overcome the enemy in strength. You will thus be forced into a sort of continuous and frustrating grinding in the very last levels, or you will be able to simplify your life by obtaining gold thanks to in-app purchases (see the link now?). And it's a real shame, especially in light of the good variety of soldiers available: from fast knights to armored swordsmen, passing through support units capable of enhancing one's army. There are even some heroes of the film, who if evoked can sometimes overturn the outcome of an entire battle. In short, the conditions for a more strategic experience would be there, but above all they need a better balancing of the levels by the developers. Developers who, on the other hand, have managed to do a commendable job in the aesthetic characterization of the game: graphically lively and colorful, Army of Darkness Defense tries to conquer the fans of the film by proposing the absolutely exaggerated exclamations of Ash played by Bruce Campbell. Once you have finished all the levels and defeated the final boss, you then enter an endless level, where ever numerous waves of enemies follow one after the other. It must be said that, in this case, the accumulated gold is much lower, and upgrading the remaining units to unlock all the objectives thus becomes a tedious and repetitive undertaking. A design choice clearly born with the aim of enticing in-app purchases, but which in practice proves to be very unfortunate.
