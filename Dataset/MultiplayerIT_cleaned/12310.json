{"name": "Circus Extreme: Turbo Camels", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/circus-extreme-turbo-camels.html", "text": "Given the unique nature of the mobile gaming industry, it is very difficult for software houses to make a name for themselves and win loyal customers. The developer team Mr. Goodliving, employed by a ~major~ like Real and spearhead of the RealArcade division, however, seems to have found the key elements to obtain such results. First of all, as it is natural, their products start from a captivating idea, which can marry in the best way with the characteristics of a gaming device as particular as the mobile phone. Secondly, they attach great importance to the technical realization of the games, always seeking the best compromise between aesthetics and functionality, thanks to the work of extremely capable graphics and programmers. In this sense, Circus Extreme - Turbo Camels is just another demonstration of talent. As mentioned in the introduction, the game sees us manage the circus show of a fearless camel, Baldwin, who gets shot from a cannon far and wide and bounces off the walls of the big top with the aim of collecting a certain number of objects (variable depending on the stage) and then to land in a pre-established area. All while respecting a rigid countdown and using the thrust of two jetpacks that can ~push~ him when he needs it, consuming a bar that is charged with each impact. Explained in these terms, the gameplay of Circus Extreme appears at least obscure, but just play a few games (and follow the very useful initial tutorial) to understand perfectly how to extricate yourself from its mix of inertial action and puzzle solving. The game is also inclined to reward efforts aimed at refining the ~technique~, and rewards the collection of all objects with bonuses and with the unlocking of subsequent stages. Even longevity has been taken into great consideration, with as many as sixty levels divided between three different settings and a gradual increase in difficulty. As for the technical realization, Circus Extreme: Turbo Camels really shows excellent things. The graphics are really well done, with well-designed sprites and scenarios and with animations of a much higher than average quality. The intermission screens are also excellent. The sound sector includes a series of effects that are perhaps not very appropriate but functional to the spirit of the game, together with good quality music. Moving on to the control system, to try Circus Extreme just use the joystick of the mobile phone (or the corresponding number keys), with some difficulty only in the correct input of the diagonals, which in some cases can make the gaming experience quite frustrating. PRO Immediate and solid gameplay Technically excellent Long lasting and inspiring AGAINST Sometimes frustrating Not recommended if you hate the circus... ...and the flying camels", "date": "2007-05-06", "grade": "S.V."}
