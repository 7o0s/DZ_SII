{"name": "Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-stitch-experiment-626.html", "text": "Chronicles of Mediocrity With this premise, the player must explore the various worlds that make up the game by collecting various types of objects but, above all, by disintegrating anything that moves thanks to the use of one or more laser guns (up to a maximum of four, equal in the arms of Stitch), in a mix between platform game and third person shooter. Among the athletic characteristics of Experiment 626 are the ability to double jump to reach the farthest platforms, to climb certain surfaces and to hang from the ceiling like a new Spiderman. Furthermore, by concentrating, he has the ability to slow down his surroundings in a sort of Bullet Time a la Max Payne. For this operation it is necessary to collect particular spheres of energy which recharge the appropriate bar. Other objects to collect are the various DNA specimens necessary in the continuation of the game, greenish chicken legs (which make up the game's health packs) and cinematographic films that allow you to unlock secrets in the appropriate shop. The graphical aspect of the game is disappointing to say the least. Bare and poorly detailed scenarios, polygonal complexity worthy of a PSOne game, barely enough textures denote a lack of care for the cosmetic aspect by High Voltage. In many scenarios the chromatic choice is questionable and the continuous use of ~futuristic~ elements such as pipes, cables and conveyor belts of various types, in the long run, can tire the gamer's eye (already put to the test by the other aspects of the graphics department ). The ~special effects~ deserve a negative note, and above all the effect of the shot itself, a simple 2D image badly compressed and integrated into the three-dimensional environment. In this mediocre scenario, the only positive notes are represented by Stitch himself, fairly modeled and animated, and by the general fluidity (and God forbid...). The same mediocrity can be found in the sound sector, with not exactly apt music and average sound effects. In this context, the positive note is represented by the dubbing entirely in Italian, which will certainly be appreciated by the target audience for this title. Camera Experiment But let's get to the real problems, or those that directly affect the gaming experience. The targeting system is the most superficial we've ever seen on PS2. We find ourselves hopping around like marsupials trying to dodge enemies and hoping that the crosshairs land on them. Furthermore, since the shot is perfectly linear and the worlds full of various irregularities, very often the projectiles will collide with protrusions and protuberances of the playing field, preventing you from hitting from a distance and forcing you to shoot during a jump so as not to be involved in the explosion than a simple box. The camera is certainly the most serious shortcoming as regards the technical sector. It seems to be driven by a schizophrenic and, despite the manual adjustment via analog stick, the situations of total chaos are countless. Not even the key to instantly reposition it behind the protagonist's back can solve this problem, which is more serious if we consider the type of user to whom the title is addressed. Finally the gameplay ... which to define simplistic is an understatement. Shoot anything, jump where necessary and if possible, collect some items. Throughout the game you can set your gray matter on standby and there are chances that you will be able to complete it anyway. The only incentive to continue in the game is given by the discovery of the aforementioned films, which can be spent in the appropriate section to purchase extras, generally clips taken from ~Lilo and Stitch~ himself. Comment Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626 is an incessant blazing activity, interrupted only by more typically platforming sections in which all the camera-related problems emerge. The target system is poorly designed and should be indulged rather than mastered. In general, the game is only recommended for younger audiences, armed with a lot of patience. Pros + Fun for a not too demanding audience + Accessible even for the little ones + Sufficiently rich extras Cons - Disastrous camera - Repetitive game mechanics - Poor graphics department Punctual as a Swiss watch, yet another production based on a Disney animated feature arrives on shelves throughout Italy. Disney's Stitch: Esperiment 626 borrows the alien koala co-star of Lilo & Stitch and is presented as a sort of prequel to the aforementioned film. In fact, the events precede what is told in the film and see Jumba, the scientist who gave life to experiment 626 (familiar to the world public with the name of Stitch), give the small but destructive creature the task of collecting DNA samples from the various planets of the galaxy , to give life to the final experiment: a more evolved being.", "date": "2003-01-13", "grade": null}
