The identity of the blue hedgehog has been somewhat lost sight of in the last decade and what was the protagonist of some of the best two-dimensional platformers on the market has found himself in isometric worlds, three-dimensional adventures and BioWare RPGs, often even aside to make room for his many supporting actors. With Sonic 4: Episode 1, Sega tries to revive the spirit of the original Sonic, with an operation similar to those of New Super Mario Bros. and Megaman 9 but, in a sense, completely different. Act after Act If nowadays it is difficult to make a sequel for a modern franchise, let alone how it can be for a title from the 90s, above all trying to maintain its spirit and structure without wanting to make a simple remake. The developers of Dimps Corporation have succeeded, in part, by drawing heavily on the original level design, but incorporating some more recent features of the series into the gameplay, such as the ~homing attack~ which now becomes more of a tool than a real weapon. Sonic 4: Episode 1 is strongly inspired by the first three episodes of the series, proposing a reinterpretation of some of the most typical and characteristic stages to start this new ~series~ by also leveraging, and above all, on nostalgics. So here is the typical ~Hills~ starting area which also introduces new players to the main feature of Sonic games, the unbridled speed which characterizes some passages: it is only the first of four areas, divided into three acts each plus a relative boss, which revive some catchphrases of the franchise. There are the psychedelic casino area and the ancient temple, just to say, but not all of them manage to keep intact the feeling of finding a game from the past in high resolution graphics in your hands. In short, if Splash Hills and Casino Street are sensational homages to the hedgehog of the Mega Drive, the same cannot be said of the other two stages, often frustrating and excessively slow, or of the bosses themselves: the altercations with the usual Dr. Eggman, guilty of having kidnapped animals to transform them into robots, manage to be, if possible, more frustrating than in the past. And yet it moves It's also a matter of perspective, probably, because whoever expects the frenzy and recklessness, always and in any case a bit tactical, of the original Sonics or the recent Sonic Rush for Nintendo DS, will be partially disappointed by the moments in which the speed, finally just triggered, it is abruptly held back by unfortunate design choices, such as simple puzzles or self-propelled platforms that require precise jumping or calculated movements. The illusion in those moments, fortunately not too frequent, collapses inexorably and one suddenly realizes that he is playing a Sonic that, by a hair, fails to be a real sequel. Despite this, Sonic 4: Episode 1 offers the best a fan, and even a neophyte, could want from an ~old-fashioned~ Sonic game: numerous alternative paths to complete the Acts, to try and try again in search of the best record at level of time and rings, and the dear old Chaos Emeralds, to be obtained by completing a series of special levels, accessible only under certain conditions, in which we will not move Sonic but rather the entire stage around him, trying to lead him to the goal. The technical sector, moreover, manages to be more than satisfactory, winking at the new generation without straying too far from the original style of the series. The various areas are an orgy of colors and details, in which the polygonal model of Sonic moves, a more than faithful reproduction of the character who, however, demonstrates a slowness and awkwardness of animations that are a bit out of place. The action is accompanied by musical pieces that refer to the original ones: not as memorable, true, but certainly catchy and spot on (especially in the case of Splash Hills, perhaps the most successful Acts of the game, in every respect).", "date": "2010-10-18", "grade": "7.8"}
