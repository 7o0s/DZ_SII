{"name": "Boomerang X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boomerang-x-recensione.html", "text": "When you have a single excellent idea, especially if you're an independent studio, it's good to create something that revolves around that main concept, even if that means cutting out all the other surrounding elements. It is a mantra that is often forgotten but which, for those with few resources and usually limited time, can make the difference between the publication of one's title and the total abandonment of the project. DANG! he has treasured this concept, bringing Boomerang X to PC and Nintendo Switch, a tremendously linear action shooter in its essence, but packaged in a package with attention to many aspects. An unmissable title at the time or could something have been done differently? Let's find out in the Boomerang X review! There are never enough arena shooters A scene from Boomerang X It's amazing to watch the evolution and growth of arena shooters in the indie market. As huge fans of the genre in recent years we have been able to get our hands on games, perhaps essential like this Boomerang X, but with absolute qualities. Let's think of Devil Daggers, for example, and its ferocious darkness ready to devour you as you try to reach a new personal best or that little pearl of BPM: Bullets Per Minute which, even today, we still occasionally bring out for an adrenaline-pumping match between rock guitars and accurate revolver shots. However, such quality and variety in the offer has obviously also raised the bar of expectations and this is perhaps the first and most significant misfortune of Boomerang X: it is forced to deal with many other masterpieces that can be recovered at a now negligible price. However, if you want to try something completely new, the Devolver Digital title provides you with a rather unique weapon, a toothed boomerang capable of piercing enemies and endowed with mysterious powers. There is no real narrative structure behind the title, but it is also understandable if we think of the reference genre and the overall duration enclosed in about three / four hours of adrenaline-pumping battles. You will arrive on a mysterious island after a shipwreck and everything you discover will be told through statues and scattered clues, without a real story as a backdrop. As we said initially, therefore, it is only the fight that will push you to move forward and, fortunately, it is precisely what Boomerang X does best. The hours of play to finish the title are thus divided into thirteen different arenas of progressive difficulty, with a practical system of waves to resist before the doors of the rooms open and you can thus proceed to the next obstacle. One of the best things ever experienced on our skin is obviously the difficulty curve, not only extremely balanced and gradual but also capable of inserting new enemies in conjunction with new powers for the player, so as to transform the experience into constant growth and avoid the very strong risk of marked repetitiveness which in titles like this is usually irrepressible. A painstaking combat system So let's talk about the heart of the combat system. The only weapon at our disposal can be launched quickly or with a charged piercing shot, can be bounced off enemies and then instantly called back into our hands to kill everything in its path. With a combat system tied solely to a weapon things could get boring quickly, but luckily for us DANG! he also gave absolute importance to all movement management, not only linked to the protagonist's lateral movements or jumps but also to the possibility of teleporting to the exact position of the boomerang once launched, even if it were to be in mid-air. This leads to seeing the arenas as a playground where you can move in complete three-dimensional freedom, using vertical axes to surprise enemies from above or avoid bullets fired at head height. The enemies, dark monstrous-looking creatures, can be killed outright most of the time but some, tougher ones will require the identification and destruction of some weak points, indicated by red gems. In this way the arenas will force you to think and devise strategies based on positioning, for very different and always stimulating fights. Too bad that everything, once the first run is completed, loses its edge by not putting the player in a position to compete for online rankings like Devil Daggers did or offer a quantity of weapons and alternative levels such as BPM. It doesn't help either the graphic style, pleasant but not eye-popping in tconceptual terms, designed more to be digested by any platform, Switch in the first place, rather than made to titillate your eye.", "date": "2021-07-24", "grade": "7.5"}
