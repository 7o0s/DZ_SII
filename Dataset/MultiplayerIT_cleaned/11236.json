We will therefore see the ~growth~ of Po, who from the first ~imaginary~ raids will move on to real action, training seriously to become the warrior everyone was waiting for. We are dealing with a third-person action game with a classic setting, which on Wii has a control system also based on motion detection: we move the character with the Nunchuck analog stick, while we have to tilt the controller to the right or left when Po finds himself walking balanced on something (a wall, a tightrope, etc.), to manage his balance. The same expedient is used in some sequences that go beyond normal gameplay, for example when we are being chased by a giant crocodile and we have to control our movement only by tilting the Nunchuck in various directions. The Z button allows us to activate a sort of ~invisible barrier~ to parry attacks, while the C button centers the view, freely rotatable via the Wii-mote's d-pad. Moving on to the Wii-mote, we have the B trigger which allows us to perform the fast attack, while for the strong attack we will necessarily have to shake the controller sideways. Motion detection is also invoked in some other cases, for example during ~dive~ flying attacks or in the execution of the special shot, which ~charges~ by placing the Wii-mote and Nunchuck vertically and then making them return to the departure, releasing a very strong punch. Finally, during the fight with some bosses, the game requires the execution of certain movements to carry out our attacks: on Wii, this translates into moving the controller as indicated on the screen, at the right time and in the correct sequence. All of Po's abilities can be upgraded across multiple levels by spending the coins collected within each location. Kung Fu Plagiarism? While the image of a panda practicing martial arts is fascinating, it's certainly not an original idea. In fact, Rumiko Takahashi fans will remember the Ranma 1/2 series well, in which both the protagonist and his father Genma, martial arts experts, are victims of a curse that leads them to transform, in contact with cold water respectively in a girl and in a huge panda... Outline elements All of Po's abilities can be upgraded on several levels by spending the coins collected within each location, and new fighting techniques can be purchased with the same system. The possibilities in this sense are numerous, even if the way in which they have been implemented appears confusing: it would have been better to propose only a few elements at a time, enhancing them, rather than listing everything immediately: the player finds himself lost and often ends up focus on the most ~basic~ skills, ignoring other elements that may be equally important, or that could add a pinch of variety to the action. Alternating fast and heavy blows gives life to a whole series of combos, which in the game we will be able to experiment with both against animated opponents and against the puppets used for training. In some cases, in the stages we will find weapons (the stick in primis) that can help us clean up the enemies, greatly increasing our offensive range. It is also possible to pick up certain objects (especially vases) and throw them at an opponent, which is done ~live~ on the Wii: you have to press the ~-~ button on the Wii-mote to grab the object, then shake the controller towards down to launch. Technical realization Kung Fu Panda's graphics make use of very well done polygonal models, faithful to those seen in the film, with good animations. Po, in particular, has a very large set of movements, given the large number of techniques that can be used. The scenarios are never very extensive, because for better or worse each stage is resolved within a few minutes, but they boast a certain number of interactable objects (especially vases and chests, which the character can destroy to find precious coins or other) and not they never give the impression of being ~empty~: the arrangement of the various elements is done with criteria, and you end up turning a blind eye to the chronic lack of detail. The versions of the game for Wii and PS2, unfortunately, sometimes suffer from drops in frame rate and various uncertainties, which manifest themselves above all while quickly adjusting the view, while on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 everything runs smoothly and you can certainly enjoy textures best. The sound compartment is common to all versesoni: it has the great merit of counting on the official voices of the film (which boasts a respectable cast in the USA: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, etc.), but beyond that there is little else to be excited about , given that both the music and the effects appear subdued and not convincing. The control system on the Wii proves to be the least precise, with a movement detection that is anything but reliable, which often makes it difficult to execute certain maneuvers and, in combination with some technical shortcomings of the game, can produce episodes of frustration (in the stage of the pond, for example, in which a too short jump results in sinking and it is difficult to understand what the exact position of the character is...). Comment Kung Fu Panda is a discreet tie-in, which lets itself be played but fails to involve that much. The developers have tried to vary the game action as much as possible, inserting alternative sections and so on, but in most cases these are lackluster moments, which add nothing to the overall experience. It must also be said that the thirteen stages available can be completed within a few hours, and that the calibration of the difficulty suggests a product created only for an audience of young and very young people, who, galvanized by watching the film at the cinema, will try to impersonate Po even in video games. Faced with such a reduced longevity (and almost not at all supported by a multiplayer mode that is produced in some ~party game~ style application for four players, but without ever shining), it is clear that the management of upgrades could not be less confusing or ~hasty~ than it is. In short, we are faced with the classic tie-in that young fans of the film will certainly appreciate, but which we would hardly recommend to anyone looking for a product with depth. Pros Nice graphics Very faithful to the movie Po has a lot of techniques... Cons ...that we will never use Too short and easy Control system not always brilliant What about Nintendo DS? As is often the case with multiplatform titles, Kung Fu Panda on Nintendo DS turns out to be a very different game: no longer a third-person action game, but something more like a two-dimensional platformer. A perhaps reductive definition, given that for the dual-screen portable console the developers have thought of really interesting and innovative mechanics: Po moves and jumps using the d-pad, but fights and performs his own special techniques relying only on the stylus and the touch screen. In practice you have to ~draw~ lines on the screen that determine the direction of the attacks or their type. In the presence of an opponent, if we draw several lines, the character is produced in the classic combo, while if there are objects around (barrels, crates, etc.) we can grab them by ~tapping~ on them and then throw them at more resistant than usual. The game also features a different storyline, which is based on finding the Five Furies, imprisoned by the evil Tai Lung, and learning their individual techniques. Thanks to these, in fact, Po will have the possibility of performing actions that would otherwise be impossible: jumping from one handhold to another, giving more power when throwing objects, etc. The animations and scrolling are very fluid, and the characters boast an excellent design, while the sound leaves something to be desired as well as the far from excellent longevity.
