{"name": "Samurai Puzzle Battle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-puzzle-battle_a.html", "text": "The puzzle game genre plays a leading role in the field of mobile gaming, after all they are two compatible realities from many points of view. Over the years we have been able to try any type of production belonging to this trend on mobile phones, and the reality that emerges every time is always the same: the great classics of the past always manage to entertain, perhaps thanks to a modernization of the gameplay, while it is much more complicated to find an idea that is both new and effective. Of course, there are publishers who have focused heavily on this genre and have invested time and resources in creating titles that combine great quality with an original concept. In the case of Samurai Puzzle Battle, we are faced with a hybrid product, which on the one hand introduces a mixed and in its own way original structure, on the other it refers to already rather well-known titles for the puzzle sections. First we will have to select our shogun from those available, each characterized by a particular inclination (benevolent / evil) as well as a different level of difficulty; after which we will find ourselves managing our territories, with the ultimate goal of conquering all the lands visible on the map. As illustrated by a short introductory tutorial, during our turn we will be able to produce new troops (there are so many, all with specific characteristics) and place them in the territories surrounding the castle, possibly mixing different types of units to obtain stronger groups and rich in resources. Zones may contain ~variables~ that affect what takes place within them, but in general the act of attacking part of an enemy army is pretty simple: just invade its territory. At that point the action changes and we move on to the puzzle section, which, as mentioned, refers to the mechanics of a classic like Bejeweled: we will have to put together rows of three or more identical objects, through the box swap mechanism, and each object eliminated it can transform into an attack of a physical or magical type, in the regeneration of our energy, etc. Once the fight has ended successfully (the enemy's energy bar must be reset), we will move on to a new board in which we will have to try to collect certain numbers of different gems, in order to multiply the gold in our chests. In fact, to generate new troops, we will need variable amounts of money. The control system is simple and intuitive, but the game itself requires some experience to be ~understood~, given the large number of factors to take into account. The sound sector of the game unfortunately falls within the average of mobile video games, that is, it consists of a few MIDI music that does not enrich the experience in any way. As far as graphics are concerned, we have a good use of colors and fairly well done icons, with good solutions for the puzzle sections. Note the excellent text scrolling, among the most fluid ever seen in the mobile sector. The presence of numerous combat units translates into as many sprites, characterized by a discreet design, which however are not represented in the same way once they are placed on the map. PRO Rather original ~mixed~ structure Thick rich gameplay A large number of shoguns available AGAINST Discreet graphics only Maybe too challenging Far from immediate", "date": "2008-11-26", "grade": "S.V."}
