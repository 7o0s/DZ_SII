{"name": "Medal of Honor: Airborne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-airborne_a.html", "text": "Medal of Honor: Airborne represents the second release of the series on mobile phones, sequel to a decent two-dimensional action game and conversion of the homonymous title planned for consoles. In reality, this mobile version has very little of ~airborne~: the parachute in fact plays an absolutely secondary role, when instead it could easily have been the protagonist of mini-games or separate sections. Beyond this questionable omission, the last born in the EA house is a convincing shooter, certainly not without defects but still of an above average quality level. Starting from the graphic design, totally three-dimensional and which does its job well: the frame rate is stable, the elements on the screen are quite numerous and the polygonal models are up to par. Some doubts are raised only by the use of colors (gray, brown and dark green are the masters) and by the somewhat narrow animations of the enemy soldiers, while the sound is based on few effects and music but of good quality. On a purely playful level, Medal of Honor: Airborne proves to be an action game with rather simple but well-implemented mechanics: the first indication in this sense is given by the efficient control system, made up of eight keys for movement and two others for fire and changing weapons. The action is framed by a three-quarter aerial camera, which allows an excellent view of the surrounding scenario: here the user must move from cover to cover, eliminating the Nazi soldiers and proceeding towards their objectives, which fall within the classic canons such as (reaching a checkpoint, destroying an enemy installation, and so on). Although the play mechanics are all in all elementary, Medal of Honor: Airborne is not without a pinch of tactics in firefights, which is achieved in the choice of adequate cover and in the use of the most suitable weapon: along the way in fact, it is possible to come across grenades, sniper and trench rifles, turrets and more (including smoke bombs that are used to call an allied paratrooper as reinforcement) each with immediately recognizable strengths and weaknesses. Another point in favor of the EA production lies in the design of the eight stages, capable of always showcasing some new element as we continue. Turning instead to the painful notes, Medal of Honor: Airborne is above all really short, a defect exacerbated by a rather low level of difficulty. Secondly, the various missions are perhaps a little too long for a mobile game: it would certainly have been preferable to have double the stages with half the time required to complete them. PRO Simple and fun Good graphics Height control system AGAINST Quite short Impeccable pace of play There is no ~airborne~ element", "date": "2007-10-12", "grade": "S.V."}
