The package created by NetherRealm Studios includes everything released so far in the form of DLC for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, or six new characters (Martian Manhunter, Lobo, General Zod, Zatanna, Batgirl and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat) plus a whole series of alternative costumes, unpublished STARS missions and various changes to the lobby waiting for multiplayer matches and training mode, richer and more detailed in purely informative terms. In short, many new contents that are added to the already numerous ones of the ~smooth~ version, all set in a graphic design enhanced to 1080p which, alas, does not make one cry for a miracle. The DC heroes of Injustice: Gods Among Us - Ultimate Edition arrive in next gen sauce Playstation 4 trophies Injustice: Gods Among Us - Ultimate Edition rewards the player with 51 trophies, 38 bronze, 10 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum. The trophies require us to properly dissect the whole game, both online and in single player, and they also engage us in companies that should not be underestimated. How to get the maximum rating in S.T.A.R. lab missions, win all battles or unlock ~all unlockables~ in the archives. Lots of content This Ultimate Edition is therefore to be understood as a complete package and ~enough~, which does not seem to have done much to go to fix the criticisms we had leveled at the game seven months ago. Criticisms that in any case we had not prejudiced the outcome of the NetherRealm Studios project, and which in spite of everything do not catastrophically affect the gaming experience. That is a long and full-bodied story of course, but undecided between the comic and the dramatic tone, but above all a balance of the characters that is still a bit problematic, given the presence and power of attacks from a distance. For those who have only started listening now, our advice is to go back to reading our previous review to learn all the details about the gameplay in detail, but a small summary of what we find on the disc is still a must. The story, as per NetherRealm Studios tradition, is really long, and goes beyond the simple canvas to connect the fights to each other. With an adult air, he stages parallel universes and suffered losses, all in the name of a gloomy tone which unfortunately, as previously written, often derails in comic moments that have nothing to do with the drama of the events. However, it works to get away from the classic arcade and effectively shows us all the characters in the game, introducing them slowly and stimulating our curiosity until the end. Next to the campaign we find the aforementioned tests of the S.T.A.R Laboratories which vary from ~simple~ fights, to mini-games, to clashes with various parameters or ~out of scale~ and the Arcade, called Battles. It is not the usual sequence of clashes, but fights to be unlocked gradually using the game currency, in which modifiers heavily change the cards on the table, affecting the time available, the energy available and much more. The combat system essentially revolves around three attack buttons, and a very vast series of special attacks, enhanced attacks, active parries and obviously the hyper choreographed super moves and the effective environmental destructibility. A decidedly substantial list of attacks, initially unsettling and which takes a long time to master, and which betrays the desire of NetherRealm Studios not to stage an ~easy~ fighting game whose appeal is all based on the license, but to try to compete even with more serious and technical titles, despite the presence of super moves that elicit much more than a few laughs. In short, Injustice lends itself so much to a ~light~ use, almost like a button mashing, however rewarding, but which best expresses all its many potentials if played at its best, especially when you go down to the multiplayer arena. On a technical level, except for the progress of the resolution, Injustice: Gods Among Us - Ultimate Edition does not do much to differentiate itself from the previous old gen version. Let's be clear we're not talking about an ~ugly~ title at the origin, quite the contrary (even if with some limitations), but it must be said that very little has been done to exploit the greater potential of the new consoles. The wrestlers appear more defined, but other than that there was no additional work to improve the visual rendering, there is no surplus of effects to betterimprove a visual impact that still pays for the presence of not exactly exalted textures in some elements of the scenario and also in the characters themselves. A modernization work done at the minimum wage therefore, which perhaps rests too much on the good starting points, but which certainly does not do justice to the new consoles.", "date": "2013-12-05", "grade": "7.8"}
