{"name": "Farmside", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/farmside-recensione.html", "text": "For years and years, in the videogame field, a certain fascination with agriculture has been going on, which has been expressed through various highly successful solutions. One of the most ~epochal~, in the sense of the importance it holds in the field of entertainment and even popular culture, is certainly represented by FarmVille, whose success has also been intertwined with the rise of social networks, amplifying their resonance. We are looking at a sort of evolved descendant in this review of Farmside, which aims to propose a hybrid alternative between micro-management of crops and construction of the farm in a context totally free from microtransactions, and it is no small feat. in fact, within Apple Arcade it determines a fundamental change in the economy of the game, which in this way gets rid of all the typical traps of wild monetization to offer a more relaxing and genuine experience. Strangely, many typical features of free-to-play are still visible, perhaps a sign of a project born with other intentions and only arrived later in the subscription context: in fact, there are waiting bars and bonuses to reduce them, but everything is disconnected by spending real and timed money, therefore, in a more humane and much less annoying way, with decidedly shorter and more digestible forced breaks. Among the many mixed solutions that we have been seeing in recent years on the theme of agriculture, this is perhaps one of the most simplistic, but for this very reason it can find space as a simple light pastime, taking the place of the old FarmVille for Apple Arcade subscribers . Escape to the countryside The Farmside structure is the classic one of the genre The story is barely hinted at, but it precisely clarifies the spirit on which Farmside is based, which is the typical one of this kind of game: the escape from the gray urban reality, in search of peace and serenity in the countryside, in contact with the nature. The principle is trivial but always valid, being somehow rooted in the human soul, even though the bucolic vision is not necessarily realistic. On the other hand, we are dealing with a stylized representation to the max, so there is no need to go too subtle: between Animal Crossing-style escapism, Harvest Moon atmospheres and tight progression in line with the aforementioned FarmVille, The Label's game doesn't shine for originality but still manages to be pleasant and well-constructed, playing it safe. In the guise of a fresh heir to an old family farm, we find ourselves having to put fields and structures back together and relaunch agricultural activity. Through a simple but complete tactile interface we can manage the available space in various ways: arrange various types of crops, think about irrigation and harvesting, build structures to transform raw materials into various products and diversify production by dedicating spaces to various activities including breeding and cultivation. In addition to the direct management of the fields, Farmside also requires you to manage the spaces and build additional structures in the progressive expansion of the land, which are unlocked with the advancement of the experience level and allow you to intensify and vary production more. The various activities also include elements typical of management sandboxes, with the collection and transformation of raw materials that are somewhat reminiscent of the most basic crafting. This works well to increase the variables involved and make the simulation a little deeper, but its structure still largely adheres to the canons of mobile games.", "date": "2023-03-05", "grade": "6.5"}
