In addition to these great virtues, Nitrome is also extremely prolific in its releases: therefore, a few weeks after the last Leap Day we return to talk about a product of the house, or the Redungeon present here. Immediate, fun and also quite difficult, Redungeon is another hit scored by Nitrome A step at a time To be precise, Redungeon is not developed directly by Nitrome, but by the small Ukrainian team Eneminds which in any case was given all the necessary support from London: the partnership was evidently very solid, given that the title sports all the trademarks of British society, starting with a simple but decidedly pleasant and effective pixel art graphic. Framed from a top view, Redungeon puts the user in the role of an adventurer who must try to get as far as possible within a path full of obstacles of all kinds: a formula that starts from the well-known mechanics of endless runner, but which thanks to the contribution of a series of precise design choices manages to differentiate itself substantially from the chaos of titles belonging to the genre. To begin with, the protagonist does not move independently, but must be moved in four directions with swipes on the screen to advance one box at a time. However, you have to hurry, because if you linger too long in one position, a horde of demonic creatures rises from the bottom of the screen enveloping the protagonist and leading to an immediate game over. However, this is not the only challenge factor of Redungeon, which focuses entirely on a considerable variety of dangers that one finds oneself facing: there are pitfalls, traps, monsters and so on, each with a more or less regular pattern that it must be observed before you can take the right countermeasures and avoid it without consequences. At each game, a new route is randomly generated - an element that helps to stem the risk of excessive repetitiveness - which does not even provide for a progressive increase in difficulty, immediately putting the player in front of a pretty tough challenge. And if on the one hand this choice undoubtedly increases the number of times you will see your alter ego succumb, on the other it helps to keep a product as simple as Redungeon pleasant over time. However, for the more involved users there is a depth factor to which the ubiquitous (but largely bearable) mechanics linked to in-app purchases are linked, which translates into the collection of coins that can be spent to upgrade one's hero or buy new characters from the 'special shop. The grinding necessary to unlock everything without putting a hand in your wallet is quite heavy, but it must be said that the virtual currency packages are sold at more than fair prices and that the possibility of earning small sums by viewing short ads is always offered advertisers. Fortunately we are quite far from the excesses of commercials that afflicted Nitrome's recent Leap Day, a sign that perhaps the software house has received the negative feedback from users in this sense. Returning to Redungeon, we can conclude by saying that it is a solid mobile game, expertly made, fun and exciting enough and certainly capable of filling the spare time of everyday life for a good period of time. Certainly we are not talking about an infinite game, which indeed suffers from a marked monotony in the setting and a gameplay that once the novelty effect is exhausted tends to lapse into routine, but we are still in the free to play area that absolutely deserve to be downloaded at least for a trial.", "date": "2016-06-30", "grade": "8.4"}
