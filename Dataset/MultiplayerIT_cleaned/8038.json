Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a cent. Six planets controlled by hostile forces and a brave pilot determined to liberate them: following in the footsteps of the first episode of the series, released in 2011, Fractal Combat X does not get lost in pleasantries and goes straight to the point, offering us a total of thirty missions with increasingly higher degrees of difficulty, in which our goal is to eliminate certain vehicles or positions, often and willingly within a time limit. The evolution of the aerial shooter by oyatsukai.com (the Italian team - based in Tokyo - of former Square Enix Davide Pasca and skilled graphic designer Max Puliero) is evident right from the start, thanks to a completely redesigned interface, of great impact, which allows us once the game has started to use the initial credits to buy an aircraft among the six available (divided into three classes) and perhaps unlock upgrades that affect the power of the reactors, the effectiveness of the missiles, on the reactivity of the controls, on the solidity of the armor and on the automatic lock-on system. Speaking of lock-on, the combat system hasn't changed, so we will have to get close to the targets to be able to lock them and then shoot some missiles at them, in the meantime trying to avoid enemy fire by keeping an eye on the radar located in the upper right part of the screen. Also unchanged is the extremely precise control system, based on a mix of accelerometer and touch screen, with the first determining the movement of the plane and the second responsible for activating the weapons and regulating the speed thanks to a ~lever ~ in the left part of the display. Finally, there are two game ~styles~ available, arcade or simulation, which substantially influence the experience. During our tests, both on the iPhone and on the iPad, we always had a great time selecting the second option, but if you want, the settings screen allows us to customize the commands in various other ways. Fractal Combat X represents a substantial step forward from the first episode What you want will come true The first six missions of Fractal Combat X, set in the desert lands of the planet Solarium, act in practice as a tutorial with respect to what awaits us from the second scenario onwards. In fact, if at first we manage to maintain a calm and reasoned approach, proceeding at full speed towards our objectives to eliminate them without many problems, almost undisturbed, very soon this feeling of peace will be replaced by a frenetic urge to carry out evasive maneuvers, while around we are just hostile vehicles competing to unload everything they have on us. Completing a level allows us to earn credits to be used to upgrade our plane, and the possibility of replaying each unlocked mission at will in order to scrape together the nest egg we need to make our weapons more effective or to thicken the just enough armor to withstand situations that are unlikely to be faced lightly, and which involve high-speed passages through swarms of missiles. One of the most interesting features of the series, or the complete absence of limits and barriers, also appears here and allows us to take off or even get out of the atmosphere to see the stars. It is a pity that this possibility has not been exploited for gameplay purposes, perhaps by positioning some large ship very high compared to the planet, or that the excellent control system cannot express its full potential within stages that provide for example the passage in a canyon or skill challenges that test our ability to maneuver the aircraft. We hope that oyatsukai.com takes these considerations into account for future updates. On the technical front, the work done by the developers expresses the best possible synthesis between budget and capacity: the planes boast an excellent design, the frame rate runs at 60 FPS with very rare uncertainties (noticeable only on the iPad, moreover), there are appreciable light and some sequences manage to be truly spectacular without resulting in chaos. Finally, our missions are accompanied by some very impactful, very well written pieces of music.", "date": "2013-01-26", "grade": "8.7"}
