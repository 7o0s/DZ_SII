{"name": "Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valkyrie-profile-lenneth-recensione.html", "text": "An unusual RPG In a two-dimensional world very similar to that of a platform, our heroine thus meets the character on duty, she knows his story and if she manages to convince him, he becomes part of our party becoming selectable. Interestingly, the plot revolves more around the drama of individuals than on what is about to happen. The catastrophe is imminent, but we experience it in some ways against the backdrop of the vicissitudes of the protagonists, whose personal stories almost have a primary space, even if, we repeat, they are then inserted into the narrative context of the end of the world upon us. The same thing is repeated from chapter to chapter, in order to allow the gamer each time to form groups of fighters that are always different and with varied technical characteristics. Formed the team of heroes, Lenneth guides them through their journey to the world of Odin, which consists of hard training in dungeons or other scenarios, fighting against monsters and creatures as in any self-respecting Rpg, to get points experience and Level-Up, or to find useful items for the final battle. The fights always take place on a 2-D and turn-based plane, as per the oriental tradition, even if in a somewhat atypical way. The battle party consists of 4 elements, one of which is always Lenneth, and can be controlled by the canonical Menu. Each of the characters is also assigned a Pad button, pressing which activates a previously assigned attack during his turn. In relation to the weapons equipped or the skills acquired, devastating attacks can be developed from the combination of buttons and the relative ~moves~ of the heroes. Especially if each Pg's special attacks are triggered. Odin's heroes Each member of the party is characterized by a series of basic parameters plus some distinctive ones, such as those relating to the level of cowardice or optimism, for example, which must be suitably upgraded in order to also increase the ~heroic value~ which will then allow the PC to turn to enter Asgard. In fact, when it is believed that a hero is powerful enough to fight the final battle, as mentioned in the introduction, he can be sent to the other world. The important thing is to always plan everything well, also bearing in mind that the time available for each chapter is not infinite. Lenneth, in fact, consumes part of the 24 periods we were talking about before with practically every choice: entering a city or a dungeon, for example, consumes ~periods~, as well as finding souls. So time cannot physically be wasted. Furthermore, Odin evaluates our work and a negative trend in the adventure can lead to game over or the impossibility of accessing the best ending, so much so that it becomes advisable to send him some warriors at the end of each chapter. Of course, this can sometimes be unnerving, especially if you consider that an RPG enthusiast becomes attached to the members of his party and therefore would not want to detach himself from any of them. Furthermore, choosing which ones to let go is not always easy, not even from a strategic point of view. The game graphics are, as mentioned, in two dimensions, and appear to our eyes very colourful, brilliant, with a cartoon style very similar to the best SuperNes productions. Even if not very accurate in terms of details. The characters are very cute and discreetly characterized always from a visual point of view. On the other hand, the interludes in CGI are splendid, which often allow the gamer to immerse himself further in the narrative context of the game, given that in a very cinematic way they enhance the psychological introspection of the characters in our eyes, telling us the personal story of the latter and the events that led to the end of their lives. As for the sound, the Square-Enix production offers us a well-made soundtrack even if the sampling is not excellent, and well-packaged in-game effects suitable for the type of game. Comment Despite the years on its back, Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is arguably one of the best J-RPGs currently out there. Although in some ways atypical, this game has a very engaging plot and a gameplay which, if understood, can reserve pleasant surprises and a right sense of satisfaction in the most hardened gamer. Obviously, its particular structure requires from those approaching it for the first time a certain predisposition to change, to novelties, rather than a strong taste for the tradition of role-playing games. The strategic management of the party and the setting halfway between an RPG and a platformer is not easyand appreciation for the most. However, if you manage to enter the Valkirye universe, understand and appreciate its particular mechanics, it cannot be disliked and loved by every fan of the genre. Otherwise it is right to look elsewhere. Pros: Great FMVs. Very intriguing plot. Interesting technical structure. Cons: Gameplay style not for everyone. 2-D platform-style visual that limits the interactive experience. The Valkyrie Profile saga has always been considered by J-RPG enthusiasts as something in its own right, due to a type of game that is too markedly niche. Its particular, atypical, not very linear and difficult gameplay, and its technical setting very similar to a two-dimensional platform have meant that it was never actually understood and appreciated by the masses. This Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is no exception, released seven years ago or so on Psx (without the suffix ~Lenneth~) and re-proposed for the occasion on the Sony portable console with the addition of CGI cutscenes. Ragnarok, the apocalypse according to Nordic mythology, is upon us, and the final battle between good and evil promises to be extremely bloody. The God Odin, lord of the Aesir, decides to send Lenneth, a Valkyrie of Valhalla, to the kingdom of men, Midgard, in order to gather an army of heroes in view of the epic battle. The warrior has the gift of perceiving the proximity of the death of individuals, and her purpose therefore is to stay close to them in those moments and convince them to ally with the forces of good, sending them to Asgard for the sacred war. And it is on this aspect that the gameplay of Valkyrie Profile is structured: the search for the character, his training and our evaluation of the best time to make him go further, sending him to Asgard. The game is divided into 8 chapters, each of which consists of 24 periods. At the beginning of each of them Lenneth moves on a map to reach the set goal after having identified the Pg to recruit. The Valkyrie, in fact, through a special command, ~listen~ to the prayers, the complaints of men, perceives their proximity to death, and subsequently goes, in fact, to the places from which these ~messages~ arrive.", "date": "2007-06-01", "grade": null}
