{"name": "Stronghold Crusader", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stronghold-crusader_a.html", "text": "But with the crusades it's a whole other story. Word games aside, that's exactly how things are: history was the great absentee in the first title! The great (and in some ways sad) story of our ancestors who, driven by lords enlightened by promises of holiness, set out several times in an attempt to appropriate lands deemed ~sacred~. This precise space-time localization means that the entire game can take a precise turn. The clash between the Crusader powers and those led by the half moon can only excite even those less interested in the genre. Those who have previously had the pleasure of trying Stronghold will notice very few differences in terms of gameplay, almost all of which are linked to the new setting (obviously desert). In the desert it will be very important to manage water resources in the best possible way (useful for the survival of the village and for remedying the fires set by the enemies) and to ensure that our commoners, dedicated to hard work and tilling the arid desert soil, survive the attacks of new fairs. The management of the city is almost identical to the original, except for the heightened importance of factors such as the morals of the population (easily controlled through a balanced production of beer) and faith (as it is obvious that it is, since we are in the midst of a religiously motivated war). We will have a completely new army at our disposal, led by the terrible Middle Eastern warlords with whom you will have to confront for absolute domination in the holy land. Waiting for you there will be the terrible troops of Saladin and his submissives who will welcome you with myriads of incendiary arrows, troops of fearsome horse archers, platoons of warriors armed with scimitars and elite of royal assassins skilled in sneaking silently between the walls of your inaccessible castle. The influence of Arab culture has also changed the appearance of some architectural components: we could also use very tall and tapered towers, thanks to which it will be possible to target even very distant enemies with our arrows. Fundamental importance has been given to the fire that you can use in the dual function of both attack and defense weapon. In fact we will still find, among the available weapons, the terrible cauldrons filled with incendiary oil, the pools of pitch to be hidden among the dry grass and the dust that covers the ground ready to be lit by flaming arrows as the enemy passes. To counter the enormous power of fire, it will be possible to manage the scarce water resources precisely to prevent the very dangerous fires that could ruin the positive developments of a siege that has been going on for hours near our walls in just a few minutes. If in Stronghold we could only use the well in the city, now it is possible to save water, collecting it in huge pots which must be kept by three engineers at the same time. Game mode. Finally completeness! Yes, finally completeness, because this was precisely what the first title lacked more than anything else. Or rather, it could be said that in the light of the facts, and that is what they offer us with this Stronghold Crusader, we are faced with what happened a few years ago with Age of Empires and its expansion, The Rise Of Rome (which in fact came out shortly in a new guise called AoE: Gold Edition, which included game and expansion set in order to offer a complete product). Crusader can be considered as the real Stronghold, the one that has reached the final stage of its production. Now we have a well-finished and compelling background, a historical setting and respectable characters, greater accuracy in the details and balances between the various units, two different armies, opposed in the winning strategies and in the weapons used. Finally, there is a wide range of game modes to satisfy every user group (from the expert to the novice, to be clear). These are not simple levels of difficulty, but real game modes that are different from each other and capable of satisfying all players. The ~crusader~ mode allows you to choose between a path of guided missions (there are really many, in my opinion almost double those available in Stronghold) aimed at letting us know the hardships of the crusader armies and a personalized game mode where you can choose which army to belong to, enemies, allies and starting resources (not bad I would say!!!). Under the heading ~campaigns~ we could face four different game situations by learning the winning mechanisms of the game through short missions, thus learning throughrso practice (and not with boring tutorials) the secrets of the two supplied armies and the management of the cities. The ~build a castle~ mode offers the most peaceful and tranquil gamers the opportunity to build and manage a castle in the shade of palm trees and under the dull gaze of camels, without enemy intrusions (but so no siege guys, where's the fun , the beating hands, the blood. The multiplayer. Of course nowadays there is no game that does not include the possibility of crushing your friends in bloody multiplayer matches, and for this Firefly offers you a juicy mode for simultaneous combat against your friendsenemies (who can do without it anymore!) . Remember that in general multiplayer extends the longevity of a game by not limiting it only to use in single player mode (which runs out most of the time in a rather short time). The ~multiplayer~ option offers the same opportunities as the ~custom crusader~ mode, i.e. you can plan tailor-made battles against your friends using classic network communication protocols (TCPIP, IPX, serial). You will also find it very useful to be able to take advantage of GameSpy Arcade, a service that will allow you to meet many fellow players with whom to confront and refine your deadly strategies. In any case, Stronghold Crusader's multiplayer offers nothing more and nothing less than what can be experienced in the single player game on custom maps (apart from the intelligence of the opponent which is hopefully higher in multiplayer). Also present in the previous version, an updated editor could not be missing, for this you will also find a nice voice that will allow you to create your favorite scenarios. The only flaw is the fact that there is no ~freeze~ mode in the editor and that for this reason your trusted warriors will start destroying any life form nearby, even if theoretically the game shouldn't have started yet (a mess when placing troops to simulate face-to-face combat). But please, try to surround a group of rabbits with a pack of wolves, fun is guaranteed! Sore notes. Before leaving, however, the sore points. If graphics are not Stronghold's strong point (in 2002 isometric graphics are decidedly outdated, even if they are advantageous from the point of view of hardware requirements) neither are the music which has remained unchanged in its medieval monotony (no change since 'original). There's a risk of collapsing under hypnosis after a long play session (and these too are things that could be addressed in an expansion). Gameplay-wise, it took me a few play sessions to figure out the issues with this title. First of all, I criticize the absence of specifically Arabic constructions, which creates a fairly evident void in the game as a whole. In a nutshell, the presence of the Arabs in Stronghold Crusader concerns only the military part, without caring in the least about the management aspect that it would have been interesting to dedicate also to the fearsome masters of the Middle East. The game remains completely dedicated to European armies without delving into the Muslim chapter too much, which could have been a welcome change. The presence of Islamic peoples in this title is limited to a simple appearance which does not affect the evolution that should have affected Stronghold in the transition to this new title. In fact, the constructions available among Saladin's ranks are completely identical to the European ones, which makes simulation perfectionists turn up their noses who would like some attention to the graphic aspect in games like this. Not even the banners, the trimmings, the lace or more simply the windows of the buildings show the slightest Arab influence (apart from the new type of tower similar to those that overlook the mosques). All this is a bit sad, at least from the point of view of the finishing of the product. Two final words. But in conclusion what does this title offer us? New troops, new missions, new environments and adjustments to the balance between the various components of the game that make Stronghold Crusader a must for all fans of the genre and above all for all those who, despite having seen Stronghold, had not decided to buy it. Finally remember that Stronghold Crusader is a complete game, which does not requireede possession of the original version to be able to work, a real deal for those who still do not know the fascinating world of the siege. Time for crusades, the real ones! Ready for release on the market, the new title from Firefly Studios promises to add a pinch of realism and historical context that seemed to be missing from its predecessor. Stronghold Crusader could really be defined as ~everything you wanted to find in Stronghold but didn't find when you installed it~. The innovative power of the first title consisted in introducing the theme of the pure siege in the universe of battle simulation in isometric graphics. If Warcraft 3 focuses on the compelling story, special effects and breathtaking graphics, Stronghold plays its best cards in the field of simulation of one of the most agitated (but often overlooked) moments of the attack on a manor: the siege. Managing large populated cities, mining and food resources, weapon building and defense/attack strategy (because good defense can be better than fierce attack) at such a critical time in a castle's life is not thing to overlook. On the other hand, in the past the siege was one of the most popular methods to demoralize opposing armies and it was essential to be able to offer strategic game lovers such a realistic (and at the same time enthralling) approach to battle.", "date": "2002-09-30", "grade": null}
