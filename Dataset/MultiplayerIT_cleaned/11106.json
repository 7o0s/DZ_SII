{"name": "Mega Man 9 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mega-man-9-recensione.html", "text": "The more or less recent videogame history is dotted with remakes of classic titles rewritten in a modern key, in order to attract fans of the original and younger users at the same time. It is therefore surprising to see a title like Mega Man 9 go in a totally opposite direction, especially in light of the considerable changes that have always affected the series over the years: therefore, Capcom offers us a deliberately vintage product for this latest episode... Older than old school Mega Man 9 even arrives 11 years after the last chapter of the so-called ~classic~ series, released on PlayStation and Saturn in 1997 and after which the blue robot concentrated on spin-offs and parallel adventures. As we mentioned at the beginning, the Capcom title is extremely rigorous in its intent to bring the series back to the tracks of the first glorious episodes. In practice, this translates into a platform game deliberately sparse compared to current standards, but at the same time incredibly deep and challenging, and for this reason also very satisfying. However, this statement is valid only for those who consider a high level of difficulty (sometimes even excessive) an added value to the playful experience and not an obstacle to its enjoyment: in short, if you fall into this last category, you can safely stop read right now, because Mega Man 9 is not a title for you. Fans of the series will instead rejoice knowing that the Capcom product has eight stages of pure 8-bit nostalgia, filled with platforms, enemies and battles with the inevitable bosses. Structurally, Mega Man 9 refers to the same mechanics of the second episode, released on the NES back in 1988: the user therefore freely chooses in which order to face the stages, even if a certain logic (which in the first games boils down to pure and simple luck) allows for an easier continuation, given that the upgrades obtained by defeating a boss help to generate more damage in the clash with another opponent. For the rest, we always find a protagonist whose only abilities are limited to jumping and shooting with his cannon mounted on his arm, and who also proves to be particularly exposed to the pitfalls of the various levels: the simple contact with pools of lava, spikes or anything else decrees an immediate game over, while even the smallest of enemies can cause huge losses of vital energy. It must be said that Capcom in some ways has overplayed the hand a bit, inserting real traps within the stages that cannot be avoided in the first instance except by people endowed with the power of foresight: an element of which it certainly didn't feel lacking in an already extremely difficult platform game of its own. Precisely this aspect, however, also constitutes the source of greatest satisfaction of the entire product, given that completing a level instills a sense of gratification that only old hardcore titles are able to give. For users looking for ~strong emotions~, however, Mega Man 9 offers the beauty of 50 challenges accompanying the Story Mode: some are rather conventional (such as the one that requires you to defeat a boss using only the Mega Blaster), but others sensationally flow into the territory of madness, when -for example- they set the goal of completing the game without ever taking damage... Everything has a price However, it is not only the gameplay of Mega Man 9 that is old-school, but every element of the game is oriented to the remote past of videogame history. The plot that forms the backdrop to the adventure, to begin with, is trivial and approximate as only that of the 8-bit platform could be. In this ninth chapter, the evil Dr. Willy publicly apologizes for his past crimes, but when eight terrible robots throw the world into chaos, he appears on TV accusing the benevolent Dr. Light (creator of Mega Man) of being guilty of all this: promptly determined to unmask Dr. Willy, the little blue robot embarks on an adventure, with simple 2D cutscenes to highlight the progress of the story. Above all from a graphic point of view, Capcom has remained faithful to the line traced by the first chapters of the series, presenting a two-dimensional cosmetic practically indistinguishable from the aforementioned Mega Man 2. Pixelated sprites, limited color palettes and prehistoric animations are therefore the masters (not not even the flickering and slowdowns typical of the 8-bit era are missing), together with menus that concede absolutely nothing to modernity: although undoubtedly in line with the gameplay offered by the product, we leave it to everyone's judgment to consider Capcom's one strict or convenient choice, considin any case, as other remakes have shown that they are able to maintain the original play structure even in a more pleasant graphic context (for example, Bionic Commando Rearmed). However, one aspect that we feel openly contesting concerns Capcom's decision to request payment for downloadable extra content: it seems to us objectively absurd for a title that is never so low-budget as this to capitalize not only on its own sales but also on that of items such as new costumes or additional difficulty levels Comment Mega Man 9 should be seen exclusively as a tribute to the fans of the series: in fact, it is unlikely that a user other than the retro-hardcore one will find a technically prehistoric product pleasant, with a limited play structure and a sometimes frustrating level of difficulty like this. For those interested, however, Mega Man 9 undoubtedly remains an excellent chapter in the series, albeit debased by Capcom's decision - which smells a bit of mockery - to also charge extra content. Pros A worthy chapter in the series Rigorous through and through Challenging difficulty level Cons Suitable only for the hardest hardcore Extra paid content", "date": "2008-10-24", "grade": null}
