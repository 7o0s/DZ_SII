The maps, in the Activision tradition, are quite expensive, 1200 Microsoft Points, but add a fair amount of variety to the smooth mechanics of Black Ops. However, this does not mean that they are an essential purchase, 14.40 net of the conversion is a very important figure, but it must still be said that Treyarch has not limited itself to doing the homework, putting its effort into trying to give substance to each euro spent. The American boys have in fact placed the emphasis on the interactivity of the maps, on how they are not simply places to go, but on how they offer unprecedented tactical possibilities to the player. East West From this point of view, in Berlin Wall we have a no man's land between the two sides of the wall which, if crossed, activates automatic fixed stations; in Discovery an ~underground~ frozen bridge that can be blown up, while in Kowloon, the best map in the pack, we can use a suspended rope to move quickly between buildings. However, all this has a relative impact on the gameplay, this is certainly not the added value of the DLC. The intentions are to be commended, the result a little less though. However, what is commendable is the level design of the maps, truly inspired and capable of supporting the most disparate approaches to action. The map of Hong Kong, Kowloon, ~remake~ of the Numbers mission of the single player campaign is exemplary in this sense. Meanwhile, the vertical development of the level is immediately noticeable, with an intricate ~fusion~ of buildings one above the other, which pile up as if they were different tiers of boxes in a theatre, asymmetrically however, so as to generate a full structure of points that overlook courtyards, roofs, balconies, where you play cat and mouse entering condominiums, jumping between balconies and apartments, also managing to score shots from a distance thanks to an often very vast visual horizon, despite a plan problematic regulator, we could say. It goes without saying that such a plan is definitely versed in the ways in which it is required to hold or conquer strategic points, being able to arrive at hot spots from different roads, in the same way the defense will be able to enjoy many tactical solutions. The Discovery map is also derived from a single player level and allows us to fight in the secret Nazi base seen in the Black Ops flashback. Although it is built in a more canonical way, with many structures on two floors connected to each other, it is certainly appreciable in the way it manages to merge both clashes from a great distance and furious close-up assaults. There are two particularly interesting areas, a side walkway from which it is possible to keep an eye on the whole map, and a small ice bridge located underground in the middle of the level, which can be destroyed, but which is only an alternative way to move between the ends of the base. In the middle, a maze of narrow streets, laboratories, snow-covered passages, huts and sheds that alternate with large spaces where you can run at breakneck speed avoiding the crossfire. A map, as previously written, ~classic~, good for all types of game and for different types of approach. Berlin Wall makes little use of the peculiarity of no man's land, ending up proposing a simple hit and run battle between the buildings on the other side and on this side of the wall, giving chills only in the bottleneck points of the map, or in the face of large leaks open in the wall. For the rest, a functional level, without however particular flashes, graced by the ~faithful~ reconstruction of checkpoint Charlie, with the border police sentry boxes, the tanks facing each other and architectures that denounce the difference between East and West. Here too, a perfect balance between close and long-range battles, with the latter favored by elevated positions overlooking the wall and the path controlled by the turrets. Xbox 360 goals Call of Duty: Black Ops - First Strike rewards the player with four achievements, all related to the zombie mode. The first forces us to use all three Lunar Landers, while to get the second we have to kill five zombies with one shot of the weapon that creates black holes. The last two, however, are the toughest ones, such as the one that requires us to kill a monkey using an explosive trap. Stadiums and cosmodromes Stadium is instead the Nuke Town of the lot, small in size compressed between the hockey stadium, some structures and the small onepark in front. Apart from the roof of a shop, the level certainly does not invite massive camping, on the contrary it forces us to be as mobile as possible, running at breakneck speed between the various areas that compose it. A map without any pretensions, fun and caciarona, with a couple of interesting strategic points, such as the staircase to go up to the second floor of the building, but which seems to be the weakest of the group. Ascension, the level dedicated to the zombie mode, is set in a Russian cosmodrome, along the lines of the one seen in the Launch map, only here it starts in a beautiful black and white (until a sumptuous Technicolor will replace it once the electricity is restored electric), transported to the ground by a strange flying platform, and as you proceed towards the exit, climbing numerous stairs and passages, it will be possible to earn new perks and use a couple of new and very powerful weapons, B-movie stuff like a weird contraption that generates black holes and fragmentation matryoshkas. A very large, inspired and absolutely well designed map, complete with space monkeys steal perk.", "date": "2011-02-09", "grade": "7.8"}
