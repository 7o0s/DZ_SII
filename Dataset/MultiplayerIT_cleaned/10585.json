And as often happens in these cases, numerous software houses have decided to immediately jump on the bandwagon, enjoying the reflected light and the sensitivity of the public. Among these is Gameloft, which with Brain Challenge has created a franchise that has touched almost all current gaming platforms, starting from mobile phones and arriving on the online services of PS3 and 360. Now it's the turn of the DSi Shop. Time hasn't changed you In reality Brain Challenge is not a novelty on the two-screen laptop, having already been released in the classic version on cartridge over a year ago; the difference lies beyond obviously to digital distribution, in an extremely low price - 800 points - and in a very marginal if not negligible use of the DSi camera. The production of the French house follows the mold and structure of the numerous games of this type: the fundamental concept is to improve one's brain capacity through daily workouts and thanks to the support of a team of virtual experts ready to follow the user by giving him advice and suggestions, including regarding healthier diet and physical activity. Nothing particularly new under the sun therefore, assuming that one does not want to ascribe the decision to evaluate the player's abilities not on the basis of mental age, but with a more classic percentage under the novelty factor. The only minimum excursus of Gameloft must therefore be sought in the Stress Training mode, parallel to that of Brain Training; the difference lies in the fact that with the first one finds himself having to face games in which secondary factors disturb or influence the user, so as to require a further effort for the solution. For example, insects walking on the screen obstructing the view, mice trying to reach the cheese, annoying characters who dictate in which box to write the result of arithmetic operations, sirens that sound and so on. The Brain Training instead offers 6 exercises for each of the 5 categories, for a total of 30 tests available. The categories are Logic, Calculations, Memory, Sight, and Focus; obviously there is no shortage of graphs and statistics to monitor your progress and the areas in which you are most deficient. A handful of relaxing bonus games, including a simple paint, therefore conclude the Gameloft production offer; obviously little to say about the technical component, which in any case tries to differentiate itself from the similar Nintendo title thanks to a much brighter and more vibrant color palette.", "date": "2009-08-07", "grade": null}
