{"name": "Autorobot", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68920-transformers-la-vendetta-del-caduto-autorobot-trasformatevi.html", "text": "Version Tested: Xbox 360There has been much talk about the film reinterpretation of the Transformers: there are those who have fully appreciated the work done by Michael Bay, those who have remained disgusted in the face of the unusual restyling of the most famous robots in the world; who hates Shia LaBeuf a priori and who instead loves Megan Fox unconditionally. Human actors who actually serve as a mere side dish to the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons, the real protagonists of the film returned for a sequel which draws a bit from the Beast Wars Transformers series and a bit from the classic one, with references to the Matrix and the advent of the enormous Devastator. We therefore find Optimus Prime and his faithful subjects in an adventure that sees them oppose not only the revived Megatron, but also his ancient master, the ~Fallen~ (ok, now let's ask ourselves why the film is called ~Revenge of the Fallen~ when instead the character in question is then called ~Fallen~ or even ~the Fallen~... mysteries of adaptation!). In the game, this translates into more than forty missions divided between two distinct campaigns (Autobot or Decepticon), set within fourteen locations around the world: from Shanghai to Cairo, passing through the United States and crossing the ocean depths. Did you miss something? If you own a backwards compatible PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 and you missed out on the best Transformers video game, you can pick it up for a fraction of the price and enjoy its extraordinary qualities. The game was developed by Melbourne House for Atari, and you can read the review here. If, on the other hand, you are curious to know how the Transformers were born and how they have developed over the years, on the occasion of their twentieth anniversary Multiplayer has dedicated a rather in-depth special to the most famous robots in the world. Find it here. Which side are you on? Once one of the two available campaigns has started, we find ourselves controlling a different Autobot depending on the mission: the fourteen areas must be unlocked gradually and each of them contains from one to three main missions, as well as as many secondary missions. The completion time of each internship is subject to scrutiny by the game, which times our performance by awarding us a bronze, silver or gold medal depending on the results. The better we play, the more Energon is given to us at the end of the stage: it is the energy that Transformers feed on, and in this case it can be used to improve the ~collective~ characteristics of our characters such as the health bar, the system weapon cooling, the effectiveness of melee attacks, the time required for the special ability to recharge, etc. The leader of the team (on one side Optimus Prime, on the other first Starscream and then Megatron) discusses the terms of each expedition with his subordinates, commenting at the end what has been obtained. The objectives of the missions often involve eliminating all enemies from the stage, rescuing areas taken by storm, or escorting human characters from one place to another in the location. The campaign with the Decepticons appears slightly more varied than the one with the Autobots, but in the end things don't change that much: the action is often repetitive and there is a clear level design problem where the ~transformation~ skills of the characters they could and should have been used within much broader and better organized scenarios. Given the ~refillable~ health bar, very often the best strategy for completing stages is to attack enemies until things go well, then quickly escape from the fight and wait for energy to restore. Xbox 360 goals Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen offers the beauty of 1000 points divided by forty-one objectives. Given the presence of the medals, it is clear that many objectives are unlocked by obtaining them all within the various stages, but there are also those that require the elimination of a certain number of enemies, the collection of a large amount of Energon or the victory on particular opponents such as Megatron or the Fallen. Extreme transformation The developers of the Luxoflux team, responsible for this transposition, have tried to organize the game controls in order to make the transition from robotic to vehicle form as natural as possible. Let's say that the goal was only partially achieved, given that a lot of practice is needed to manage everything well. The left analog stick moves the character, the right controls the camera and possibly the crosshair, which appears as soon as the left trigger is held down. The right trigger opens fire with the weapon equipped (there are two, different for each Autobot or Decepticon), which must be changedusing the d-pad. Also from the d-pad it is possible to change the distance of the view from the character, while the main buttons of the pad are used for the melee attack, jumping and grappling. The latter allows our character to cling to the walls of any building, then climb it to the top like a new Altair (not with the same grace, however). To switch to vehicle form, you have to press the right trigger alone, using the same button to accelerate: it's not the most immediate solution in the world, but in the long run you get used to it. While transformed into a car or plane you can still fire at the enemy (albeit with minimal effectiveness compared to the robotic form), and holding down various pad buttons results in performing moves of various like, the most mundane of which is the transformation in flight to take opponents by surprise. The Transformers that we can use in the game are on the one hand Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Ironhide and Breakaway, on the other Starscream, Sideways, Grindor, Starscream and Megatron. Each of them boasts different characteristics in terms of resistance, speed and offensive capacity, but it is above all the weapons that make us prefer one character over another: Bumblebee has an excellent homing missile launcher as a secondary weapon, for example, while the Aerialbot Breakaway has a sniper rifle for ranged shots. Once you complete a mission, you can replay the stage to get a more important medal or give it a spin in free mode. Robot multiplayer The game has online multiplayer via Xbox Live that works quite well and allows us to participate in ~all against all~ matches, team deathmatches or ~One Shall Stand~, which is a mode in which teams have to knock down their respective players to win leader (on one side Optimus Prime, on the other Megatron). The access rules and player management are the classic ones, it is possible to select any of the available Transformers and the progress of the matches is rarely marred by lag or problems of any kind. Technical realization The polygonal models of the Autobots and Decepticons are faithful to those seen in the movies, and the quality of the animations is good. The need to make precise choices in terms of color (whereas the film, on the other hand, gets by thanks to the confusion of many sequences) gives the impression that the robots are sometimes ~out of context~, but the effect is not so marked. The differences of the various weapons come rendered well both visually and practically, but the clashes often appear more confusing than spectacular. The graphics in general appear adequate, the problem more than anything else are the settings: some better than others, but with a constant limitation in terms of size. It goes without saying that characters capable of transforming into very fast cars or airplanes should be able to move with greater freedom rather than running into invisible barriers. Interactivity with the environment follows the same rules: a crack appears then and there, but the buildings are ultimately hardly damaged by the battles raging around them. The sound is up to the task, with good music and effects, the Italian dubbing has its ups and downs.", "date": "2009-07-13", "grade": "6.9"}
