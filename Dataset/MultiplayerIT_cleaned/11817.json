{"name": "F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fear-perseus-mandate-recensione.html", "text": "Deja Vu The sense of deja vu grows the further you go in the game. And not only for the constant references to events already experienced. The levels are also very similar. So similar that if you've already finished F.E.A.R. and Extraction Point you can go and read the comment directly, given that the novelties can be counted on the fingers of one hand and are only variations of what has already been seen: two new weapons (a machine gun with precision scope and an electric shock rifle) and two new enemies (agile and extremely resistant super soldiers and an occult creature that attacks from the floor). For weapons there is little to say, given that a weapon with a sniper scope already existed and therefore the addition is quite useless, while the electric rifle is used little. Even for the enemies too many words should not be spent because the super soldiers are rarely encountered, still offering the most interesting and difficult battles of the game, and the creatures that come out of the floor are easily avoided by paying a minimum of attention: in fact they have the bad tendency to announce themselves by leaving large patches of shadow at the points where they intend to attack the player. The rest? More of the same. the choice not to add practically anything to the story, apart from a few secondary details, makes the narrative uninteresting Deja Vu We were talking about levels. Well, they are identical to what we have already seen, except for a trip to the mine that will take place towards the end. Obviously their design is different, but the elements that compose them are the same. One of the major criticisms leveled at the Monolith title was precisely the lack of variety in the settings, now accentuated by having to go through them all again without significant news. Even the dream sequences have already seen and Alma who kills a couple of soldiers with the force of unwashed armpits from birth no longer impresses very much. Moreover, the horror atmosphere has been sacrificed a lot and the developers have focused more on firefights, effectively castrating one of the strong points of F.E.A.R.. Something to talk about?

Perseus Mandate adds nothing to F.E.A.R. and, indeed, it is below expectations. Not that an expansion should revolutionize, but it should at least try to add something to the basic formula from which it arises. However, if the original drove you crazy, you will not disdain to try this extra pack that offers the same, identical, gaming experience. You are warned. Pros Smooth even on old systems Fights are always hilarious Lasts enough to be an expansion Cons Add-ons are minor Sense of deja vu will stay with you throughout the game Original atmosphere is a bit sacrificed F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate is available for PC. F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate is the second expansion, this time stand-alone, of F.E.A.R., a shooter by Monolith Productions released for PC in 2005, for Xbox 360 in 2006 and for PS3 in 2007. Unlike Extraction Point, the first official expansion, which continued the story of the original title by putting us in the shoes of the same protagonist, Perseus Mandate chooses the path of the spin-off by putting us in the shoes of another member of the First Encounter Assault Recon committed to facing the same facts of the previous two episodes from another point of view . Overcoming the seven chapters that make up the game, all the events already experienced previously will be relived and all (or almost) the characters already encountered will meet again, including, inevitable, the histrionic Alma capable of killing in an increasingly varied and articulated way. The first feeling you get when starting the game is a very strong sense of deja vu. If someone hadn't told us that the protagonist is different, we wouldn't have noticed. Even the choice not to add practically anything to the story, apart from a few secondary details, makes the narrative uninteresting, which resolves itself into a series of twists and turns that are not for those who have already played the other two products. However, we would like to immediately point out the excellent Italian dubbing, which does not look bad in front of the English one. We do this because lately there have been quite a few disappointing products from this point of view (Blue Dragon and Clive Barker's Jericho above all). In fact, it is surprising to see how an expansion is more accurate than products of higher caliber and price.", "date": "2007-11-19", "grade": null}
