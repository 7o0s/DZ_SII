{"name": "Azurik: Rise to Perathia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/azurik-rise-to-perathia.html", "text": "Graphics: a swing of colors... and more... The main point, where all xbox games must comply; with the power available to the console, this video game, like all the others after all, takes full advantage of the capabilities of the great X? As I announced in the title of this paragraph, Azurik is graphically fluctuating... not only for the use of colors adopted by each kingdom, which in any case are always well mixed and allow you to identify at first glance in which ~world elemental~ we find, but also in the structures, in the textures and more generally in the very construction of the various environments. Sometimes one has the feeling of being faced with a copying of other titles, a sort of poor half-brother of some more popular game... I felt this feeling above all in the graphic contents and not only of Azurik. For example, the conception of the gem system, classic both in their construction and in the functioning system... in short, without making new additions (or variations) to a gameplay already seen and revised in many predecessors. An element that is also negatively reflected in the playability of the title is the graphic creation of the keys, indispensable for the continuation of our adventure: they are too similar to each other, taking into account that there is no ~assistant~, no map , table or very stupid list that helps us sort out all the keys and the corresponding locations where to use them. Luckily, there are not only thorns in this game... many times we will be enchanted by the fantastic and dreamy landscapes that the various kingdoms interpret with their own colors, by the passage of time itself, as evening approaches, the sky is tinged with black and the stars begin to shine with ever greater ardor ... and then again morning while the first lights timidly come forward and the creatures of the night return to their caves ... As you will have been able to understand, I was very struck by the realization of the landscapes and by some highly poetic and sure-impact locations, such as the suspension bridge that connects the city with the realm of water, where we will find the conjunction of two immense waterfalls of Water and Lava as a backdrop, while the day is drawing to a close and the great moons of Perathia are colored with an ancient yellow... Ok enough with the sweet words... let's continue with our ~aesthetic analysis~, passing through the creation of 3D models of the creatures that populate this imaginary planet. Here too the catchphrase of the swing returns... some enemies are made and characterized very well (the creatures of the realm of death are a valid example), others instead seem foreign to the world of Perathia, as if their ~aesthetics~ make them lead to seem all too alien to the elemental realms to which they belong, such as the Golems that seem to be a cross between a giant gorilla and a cyborg or bots, flying robot slugs (the nice thing is that their cries sound like a dog yelping! !!). The animations are well made, both the movements of our character and those of our enemies are always fluid and well done; even particle effects such as fire or water perform well, reaching excellent levels even without ever reaching the faithful reproduction of a Transword Surf. Last note for this technical sector goes to the vastness of the levels designed by the developers... each kingdom is very extensive and usually consists of several areas, requiring several hours of play just for their total exploration. Kudos to the designers then, for their patience and unrestrained research in recreating a fantasy world based on the ~elements~, as varied and extensive as possible... it's a pity that whoever had to deal with the conception of the various parts of the game forgot to a small detail ... but let's go in order ... Playability and Longevity: two determining factors. Every self-respecting action/adventure must have a solid foundation on these two factors, so that it does not soon fall into the cold oblivion of ~forgotten~. The game system is well thought out, full of combinations and variations, both for the presence of hits and combos that can be achieved in rapid succession, with different effects depending on how we combine the elemental powers that we acquire during our adventure, and for how it concerns the management of the elemental powers themselves. It is something that leaves us a lot of freedom of action, to study alternative tactics to deal with the various ~daily problems~ of Perathia and, if desired, allows us to develop our owntro personal approach (to the game itself) on how to carry out our ~mission~. The commands, although not configurable, are well thought out and respond promptly, A and B carry out the attacks carried out with your trusty halberd, while with the left trigger the acquired elemental powers are intuitively recalled; each of them is in fact distinguished by a color, as are the main keys A, B, X and Y. Therefore we will find on A green the powers of the Earth, B red the Fire, x blue the powers of water and finally Y yellow the air force. The system for recalling powers allows you to combine two or more elements to give life to different effects, ranging from temporary weapon upgrades with far more harmful effects for enemies than the ~smooth~ version of our halberd, to the creation of armor elementals, useful not only against enemies, but also basic to be able to overcome (or unlock) certain otherwise inaccessible passages. Surely this also helps to lengthen Azurik's longevity, since it will be very important to research all the possible upgrades that we can take advantage of. One thing, perhaps minor, but which I found annoying, is the running of the character. We can make it run only and only when we push the right analog stick ~forward~, in all other directions it will only walk. To be able to run not only in a straight line, we will have to use the STICK, right to turn around... do you know the Halo guide system? Virtually identical with the only exception that the X-axis is inverted!!! This is because with the Right Stick we turn the camera... consequently our alter ego follows the ~main~ direction of the camera itself. In short, Azurik has elements of a driving game... pity that Azurik's ~racing~ speed is more similar to that of a turtle rather than that of a car! The longevity of this title depends a lot on our patience. If we only took into consideration the vastness of the levels, the number of enemies to face (different from kingdom to kingdom), the long collection of various types of gems hidden in ~everywhere~... the time required to complete Azurik 100% would be enough to satisfy even the most stubborn players... but the real problem is: how far will you go into this adventure? Will you be able to resist the great sense of bewilderment and abandonment that Azurik communicates to you ~especially~ in the first hours of the game (and to a lesser extent also in the following ones)? Unfortunately the developers have not thought that creating a very large world inevitably requires the introduction of a mapping system, albeit elementary; capable of ~finding us~ where we are, even with simple means... it would have been enough to have a paper-like reproduction, similar to the one adopted in Silent Hill, where as we discover new elements, they are noted ~by hand~ on the map itself. Many times, the sense of bewilderment, mixed with anger, assailed me as I wandered through the various ~elemental realms~ in a desperate search for one or more particular keys... which, by mere chance, look very similar to each other. .. Other times you are left wandering without a precise destination, without being able to understand what is missing, where to find it, bewilderment, pessimism, annoyance... In short, this could be one of the many ways that our state of mind will be tempted to go... certainly not everyone will react the same way or follow the same ~steps~, but if you don't have patience or if you are not willing to come to terms, I doubt you will reach different conclusions. The best way I've found to go ahead and enjoy this title as much as possible is to ~help yourself~ when we don't know what to do anymore, stop for a moment before our psyche starts hating the whole world of Perathia and look for a good one. internet solution (a Walkthrough!)! I know, purists will cry scandal and heresy, but I assure you that there's nothing wrong with taking a little ~peek~, when you really don't know what to do anymore... when you realize it's the third once you go all around Perathia, but that damned key won't come out!!! Certainly the best thing would be to have a simple list of things to do, without however revealing how and where, just so as not to leave us there all alone in a hostile world, perhaps without understanding a tube of spoken English, also because the few suggestions that will be provided to us, will ~sgorgheranno~ (only vocalmente) from fountains of light called Deluvian Oracle, placed (in low numbers) almost everywhere in Perathia. Suffice it to say that the guide that I was able to find on the internet is something like sixteen pages full of text only!!! Just to carefully follow the solution will surely take many hours (also because Azurik is a snail when it comes to running). Think now, how long it would take to make the equivalent of the solution, without having it!!! I think it could easily compete with the more serious and noble RPGs!!! Sounds, Music and a pinch of A.I. I'm not sure why... but I love writing titles that are a little different from the usual ~Graphics~, ~Playability~ etc. I like to leave a subtle trace, which gives a tiny preview of what I'm about to ~elugubrate~ along the paragraph, just to intrigue the reader... but let's go back to the analysis of ~Azurik: Rise of Perathia~. As you well know, the ~phonic~ sector is very important, it is able to immerse us completely in our game session; however, this does not mean that its evaluation remains very subjective. I can only limit myself to saying how much the audio sector has been the subject of attention, if the music ~fits~ well with the game philosophy and if the final result is appreciable or simply to be forgotten. On the sound side, we are on good levels, there are no negative notes, or effects that make you turn up your nose. The ~sound~ sector does its job decently, without ever really surprising or striking us. I really liked the voices chosen to dub the various characters, deep at the right point. Too bad I can't understand much of what they say. I will never stop reiterating how important subtitles are in a non-localized (aka ~Only English~) game! The music is pleasant, a pleasant background that accompanies our long wanderings with the right rhythms and harmonies. I speak of ~pleasant background~, only because its volume is generally very low. Perhaps it could be a problem derived from the fact that I don't have a stereo TV and that in the already scarce options available in Azurik, there isn't the possibility of having a mono output of all the audio. And here we are finally at the most curious part of the whole paragraph: the pinch of I.A. Oh yes, we are talking about a pinch, of a small handful of Artificial Intelligence, of which the ~greedy~ programmers of Azurik have ill thought of dispensing with a dropper to all the creatures belonging to Perathia. You can see it from the first skirmishes: the enemies (especially the smaller ones) tend not to pay attention to us, at least until we enter their narrow field of action. It seems that the only tactical bases they have are head-on attacks and the famous hit and run, a technique that is very used when we hit them too hard or when they are about to kick the bucket! The most striking example of the limited AI that our enemies are equipped with, we get it as soon as we move away just enough to forget about us all of a sudden, as if by magic. Naturally the programmers, in order to compensate at least in part for this ~chasm~ of deficiency, have introduced two simple tricks, one attributable to the high number of opponents present at the same time (naturally not in all areas, otherwise it would become a scrolling fighting game) and in the respawn all enemies whenever we die (even if we saved the game previously). We can certainly say that this is one of the most relevant problems of the whole game, together of course with the omnipresent feeling of loss. Conclusions and an important caveat The effort put into the realization of this adventure is certainly remarkable, even if I think it was spent more on quantity than on the search for quality. There are many points in its favor: the vastness of the levels, the ~infinite~ things to do, the possibility of developing one's own fighting style by combining combos with more elemental powers and in any case, the attempt to create a captivating fantasy world, drawing ideas valid, even if classic (such as the use of elemental powers, the collection of gems that lead to the enhancement of various skills ...) from other titles. Unfortunately, some ~gaps~ significantly undermine the final value of Azurik, without compromising it completely, in my opinion. In the first place, as I have repeated many times, the sense of bewilderment is very strong; the cause lies in several factors which together determine this state: very broad levels and", "date": "2002-07-07", "grade": null}
