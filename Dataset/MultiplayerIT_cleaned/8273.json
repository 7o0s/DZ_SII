The game offered a decidedly different experience from the usual and a great depth, therefore it was received with enthusiasm by the critics and soon built a solid base of fans. Enthusiasts who perhaps still play video games today and who certainly won't miss the opportunity to try Carrier Command: Gaea Mission, the remake of that title created by Bohemia Interactive for PC and Xbox 360. The team that wins does not change, and so the original structure has been practically revived without variations: still in command of a large warship we find ourselves on the moon Taurus and our task is to conquer thirty-three islands full of hostile positions, at least in the ~strategic match~ mode. In fact, it was decided to add a series of contents to the original offer, in this case a story mode that tries to provide us with ~reasons~ for what we are doing and also plays the important role of tutorial for the gameplay that nostalgics will well remember . The problem is that this part of the production did not go as expected and the final result constitutes a real barrier to the real usability of this new Carrier Command. If you don't know things, salle The incipit of the game is made up of cutscenes and first person shooter-style sessions, in which we play the role of an officer in charge of leading the vanguard with a view to the maneuvers to conquer the territories we mentioned earlier. The feeling at this juncture is that something is not right, unfortunately: the control system prevents us from running and reloading the weapon, which works with a single magazine to be restored at certain points on the map. The question is: what happens if we run out of bullets, since there is no alternative attack at all? Luckily we didn't find out, continuing to make our way through the enemy troops, tremendously easy to shoot down because they are equipped with an artificial intelligence of the lowest level. The level design has in no way improved the situation, simply asking us to find passages from one area to another to reach a Walrus, or an armored vehicle on six wheels. Here things are in some ways even worse, because the controls provide that the movement of the vehicle takes place through the use of the left analog stick, while with the triggers of the controller you continue to aim and shoot. Assigning acceleration and brake to buttons A and X, just to give an example, would have greatly facilitated the various maneuvers and made driving the Walrus much more pleasant, whose role from this point onwards assumes great importance given that it is part of the units that we can launch from the mothership to conquer the various islands. Furthermore, on several occasions, we happened to ~get stuck~ in a wall or boulder with the impossibility of disengaging ourselves and the obligation to load a previous save or checkpoint. These are drawbacks that unfortunately the Bohemia Interactive title encounters quite often, therefore we suggest you, in the case, to often use the quick save feature of the game. Take off and nuke When, in the story mode, the mother ship is reached, the game mechanics finally take on the characteristics of the original Carrier Command, with that valuable mix of strategy and action which also in this case reveals great potential. Not quickly though: the lack of any introduction to the new interface, very bizarre and far from immediate, constitutes a second barrier for less patient players, who at this point in the experience may have already given up (also for us the temptation was strong, we admit it). In fact, the default screen allows us to select the available units one by one, which in addition to the aforementioned Walrus include the Mantas, agile aircraft but which can be equipped with heavy weapons and therefore represent ideal for a reconnaissance of the island capable of disable any advanced defense system. By pressing the right back button it is possible, at any time, to assign tasks to the various vehicles and, therefore, let them complete them independently. In short, if we take a ride with a Manta but end up suffering excessive damage, we can order the vehicle to return to the base while, perhaps, we start another one. Scenarios often hide a large number of pitfalls, but things to do yesThey are basically always the same: identifying the targets to destroy and those with which to interact, completing both operations until the island is conquered. Xbox 360 goals There are forty-five objectives contained in Carrier Command: Gaea Mission, for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints. They are basically divided into categories: the 5G achievements are obtained by completing very simple tasks, such as destroying an enemy unit with the Manta for the first time, while the more substantial loots arrive when we begin to collect various islands, perhaps equipped of advanced defense systems. Welcome to Silent Hill We have said that Carrier Command: Gaea Mission hides great potential, and we confirm it. Unfortunately, however, the best side of this production ends up never emerging; it can be glimpsed but it is not revealed, due to a series of major problems relating to artificial intelligence, to the game design itself and to the technical sector, which for the tested version (Xbox 360) certainly does not shine. In this case, the guys from Bohemia demonstrate that they are as skilled in developing spectacular engines on PC (albeit very heavy) as they are uncomfortable on consoles, given that the scenarios are full of fog and poor detail, the vegetation is also made It's dodgy and, above all, the frame rate drops every two by three, highlighting the lack of appropriate optimization. We were talking about artificial intelligence: as well as for the enemies on the ground in the FPS sections, the various vehicles, especially those that we decide to entrust to the autopilot, often get wrapped up, get stuck in a patch of ground and remain there, or get stuck in some obstacle, effectively nullifying the value of a gameplay that allows us to be able to move quickly from one unit to another. Added to this is a very dull, colorless shootout gameplay, in which there is no satisfaction from killing the enemy and, therefore, from any prize that victory may entail.", "date": "2012-10-10", "grade": "4.5"}
