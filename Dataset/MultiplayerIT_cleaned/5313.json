The illegal copying of the software in this case has nothing to do with it, given that we are talking about raids for the seven seas on a ship in search of fortune. In short, it is a title along the lines of Pirates and all that follows, albeit much more dynamic. Wanting to summarize it, we could describe it as an open world in which you travel from one port to another and in the meantime you attack ships, hunt for loot and carry out missions to accumulate more and more resources, in order to improve your vessel and become increasingly competitive. The missions to be carried out are varied, but all easily understood from the theme: ranging from the simple transport of goods or men, to supporting the factions that dominate the various islands by helping them in naval battles, to looking for opposing pirates who have decided to put a stick between the wheels or, better, the cannonballs in the hull. Tempest has a main campaign, which from mission to mission tells us a story of classic piracy and without particular flashes. The hundreds of secondary missions are instead available in the ports and are assigned based on various criteria, such as the relationship with the local government, fame and so on. Entering a friendly port means being able to take advantage of various services, such as a warehouse in which to store surplus goods, a shop in which to buy cannonballs, special items and goods, and the classic tavern in which to hire the crew. Entering an enemy port instead means being bombarded by watchtowers, which can be suitably knocked down, provided that one is powerful enough to do so (otherwise it is better to escape and return at a later time). You should have already understood how membership of a certain faction is determined: help her and all doors will be open to you, cannonade her and she will give you her lead. Pure mathematics of basic social relations. On boarding Tempest is structured into several screens that help you manage your adventure. Usually you navigate by setting your course on a map. This is the most comfortable way to go from one point to another and, above all, to see where our objectives are. The second system, much longer and more tedious, is to directly take control of the ship and travel in real time. The right time to take the helm is during battles. From this point of view Tempest offers a very simple system: with the movement keys you rotate the ship and increase the speed. To hit an enemy ship you have to get it within range of the cannons, then press the fire key. Depending on the crew on board, the quality of the ship and the guns and the objects possessed, there are variations in the width of the firing range, in their accuracy and in the speed of reloading, as well as in the effectiveness of the shot. In some cases it is also possible to board the enemy ships, after having suitably weakened them, and leave to board. This way you get more loot (retrieving it from the ocean always loses something). The direct clash between the crews depends above all on how many men we have used for the task and how we manage the forces in the field. Usually you have to take out a few of the enemy shooters first, then get on board and finish the job. However, different situations may arise depending on the strength of the opposing ship. In short, the combat system is quite simple, but not trivial and fits well into the flow of the game, made up of very fast passages (you never lose too much time in a single operation). Such a structural choice is justified by the possibility of playing the entire campaign online: too many delays would have ended up making the games heavy. Instead, in this way, it is possible to play even for relatively short times, without losing anything of the experience. We reviewed Tempest, a pirate open world that half convinced us: find out why Wrecks at the bottom of the sea Unfortunately Tempest has more than a few problems. One of the most obvious, but also the one that can be more easily compensated for with practice, concerns the interface, which especially at the beginning is dispersive and not very intuitive. For example, one wonders why the summary of missions is not on the same screen where you take on tasks, just as you can easily agree that it would have been better if the shop allowed you to compare what you buy with what you already have , perhaps through a more traditional inventory. In general, the interface seems to have been designed more for a touch screen than for the mouse, with dragging of screens and so on. As already mentioned, however, in this case thePractice more than compensates for the difficulties and the problems faced are soon forgotten. Decidedly more serious are some defects that afflict the gameplay, some determined by bugs, others by a short-sighted design. Let's start with the bugs by describing a situation that has happened to us several times: we are at sea, we face a fight and we are defeated. The game system penalizes us by making us lose the load and makes us return to the nearest port. So far nothing strange, a pity that sometimes, trying to visualize the port, you end up with the ship sinking, despite being docked at the pier. The second sinking, completely independent of our actions, still carries with it all the penalties of the case and makes us lose other precious resources. It hasn't happened very often, but it has happened and, especially when you are at the beginning of the adventure and you are in constant debt of resources, it can be a particularly frustrating experience. Another problem concerns the difficulty of entering the game. We usually don't complain about arduous games, but Tempest sometimes goes overboard in its unpredictability and nastiness. For example, it may happen that you come across some ship to plunder or some cargo adrift. The problem is that by driving the ship to fight or carry out recovery operations, we risk being attacked by fleets of ships that suddenly arrived from who knows where, much stronger than our current level. Running away is often not an option, as opponents can easily sink us with artillery. In short, the defeat, with relative load loss, is certain. Also in this case the experience helps to save oneself, but the real risk is to alienate the player in the first hours, making it difficult to continue.", "date": "2016-09-05", "grade": "7.0"}
