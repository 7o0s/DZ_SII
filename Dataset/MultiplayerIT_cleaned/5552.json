At first, governments try to hide the incidents involving extraterrestrial forces, thinking they can stem the phenomenon, but soon the offensive becomes impossible to manage: within a few months, the planet is in check. In a last, desperate attempt to repel the invasion, the Earth army develops an assault team equipped with powerful exoskeletons and a devastating arsenal, the only ones able to liberate the cities under the control of the aliens and launch a attack on their bases to turn the tide of war. As one of these soldiers, our task will be to fight to save the world. Will we be able to? Spiritual sequel to Dead Nation, Alienation basically replaces zombies with aliens, keeping the original formula of the Housemarque twin stick shooter unchanged, but improving it from all points of view. In fact, three different classes are included for the characters (Bio-specialist, Tank and Saboteur), the cooperative multiplayer goes from two to four participants (unfortunately sacrificing the local co-op, which however could find a place in one of the future updates) and the combat system acquires further solidity and thickness. Alienation is undoubtedly one of the best twin stick shooters ever made Alien combat Alienation encourages us to complete the campaign three times in a row, since each class corresponds to a different approach and it is not possible to change the parameters during the work. The Bio-Specialist represents the traditional support unit, thanks to the ability to heal its companions, but has an equally devastating repertoire of moves and excellent mobility. The Tank, which we favored during the tests, is instead the strongest and most resistant soldier of the lot, a true war machine that dispenses death and destruction, but can also offer shelter to allies thanks to the energy shield. Finally, the Saboteur is a bit of the ninja of the situation, he can strike enemies with a blade and camouflage himself to proceed undisturbed in times of need, for example when it is necessary to eliminate a target by carrying out a surprise attack. In all cases, the combat system is particularly dense and coherent, with an alternation between main, secondary and heavy weapon (to be selected by simply or holding down the Triangle key), the possibility of performing melee attacks to get out of off enemies in the event of an empty magazine, a Gears of War-style active reload system to halve reload times and an excellent balance on the ammunition front, which often leads to experimenting with new tools and new approaches. The scenario also plays a fundamental role, with the various vehicles that we can blow up, involving nearby opponents, and a large number of stakeouts that allow us to take shelter from enemy fire. The controls are precise, reactive, completely customizable and in our specific case we wanted to operate a single variation, assigning the reload key to the R1 backbone and the melee attack by pressing the right stick on its own axis. In fact, leaving the recharge on R3 often happens to activate it inadvertently when aiming down or in the most agitated situations, which can get us into serious trouble when the enemies are many or particularly tough. Speaking of enemies, the work done by Housemarque on the bestiary front is commendable: there are many different aliens, each with its own modus operandi, weak points and attacks to which you must pay close attention. Furthermore, depending on the scenario, further variants are introduced, such as the invisible stormtroopers or the annoying ~zampers~, swarms of spiders that emerge from monstrous broods. The variety of the arsenal is also excellent, which for example in the case of the Tank allows you to select the secondary weapon and the special one among many alternatives: a powerful shotgun, a devastating ~one shot~, a long-range revolver, a missile launcher , a minigun, a flamethrower, and so on. The loot represents one of the elements of main interest for the purposes of exploration and completion of the challenges, and through this function it is possible to find weapons of common, rare, special or legendary grade, with more or less pushed statistics and the further possibility of apply cores for enhancement. Better alone or badly accompanied? The Alienation campaign consists of about twenty missions, divided into four different scenarios: Barrow (Alaska), Ashland (Nebraska), Pripyat (Ukraine) and Fort Itaipu (Brazil). To these are added the training camp in Hawaii and two alien structures, however visible only during certain phases of the story mode. To complete all the internships, a minimum of six or seven hours is needed, although the duration of the experience is strongly influenced by the level of difficulty selected, by the presence or absence of permanent death (something to be decided at the beginning of the game) and by the desire to explore the locations in depth, given their wealth in terms of collectibles, challenges and bosses to find. It is possible to play alone without any problem, choosing one of the three available classes and completing the missions in sequence, but having reached the last stage, the presence of companions becomes practically mandatory: since there are no checkpoints in that case, each game over implies the having to start the level over again, unless you have a companion available who can revive us when needed. Let's therefore spend a few words on the cooperative, of the drop-in / drop-out type, therefore with the possibility of joining games in progress or opening one's session to the participation of anyone, provided of course that one has a subscription to PlayStation Plus. matchmaking is lightning fast and we didn't encounter any latency issues in character control or gunplay, although the aliens tend to collapse a moment later than when shots land. Clearly we will have to wait for the game to be released to verify that the system holds up, but the premises seemed excellent to us and we doubt some particularly relevant flaws will occur. However, it is a pity that there is no local cooperative, at least for two participants, all the more so given the approach chosen by the developers for that last, problematic mission. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-three Trophies of Alienation are obtained by taking care of the enhancement of the characters to make them reach the maximum possible level, completing the various missions with all three classes and making a certain number of eliminations. Then there are some dexterity-based achievements, such as the one you unlock by completing a level without ever using your skills or never firing a shot. Technique from another world While we had to settle for 1080p at 30 frames per second instead of 60, the developers of Alienation have done an excellent job technically, optimizing the experience in such a way as to offer rock solid performance, without ever a dip or a stutter. not even when literally hundreds of characters move across the screen. The solidity of the system is evident above all in multiplayer sessions and is supported by a truly inspired level design, which puts aside the perennial darkness of the Dead Nation stages in favor of daytime locations, embellished with touches of class in terms of reflections on puddles, the quality of the water near a river, the very nice smoke effects following collapses or explosions, as well as a truly spectacular physical rendering of the detonations, with aliens being shot at the camera and scattering around in a coherent. The very appearance of the extraterrestrials leaves no room for doubt when you find yourself approaching them, since each one has specific physical characteristics that reflect their capabilities, from the most modest units to bosses. Perhaps more could have been done on the front of human exoskeletons, but this is the proverbial hair in the egg. The excellent graphics are supported by a valuable sound sector, which manages to enhance the sound of the weapons (the machine guns reverberate in the ~Aliens - Clash Finale~ style, and it is a great feeling) and to accompany certain sequences with epic music at the right point. The dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian) perform their task fairly well, although on the narrative front we would have expected something more: the plot of Dead Nation, told through static images, managed to offer a much greater degree of involvement and original ideas which are completely missing here.", "date": "2016-04-25", "grade": "8.7"}
