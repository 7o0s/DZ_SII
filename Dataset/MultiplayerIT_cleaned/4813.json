Playing the role of a farmer determined to make ends meet on his farm didn't seem to be a particularly successful starting point but the market, the crazy videogame market, decided that such a bizarre idea was necessarily rewarded. Thus Farming Simulator arrives today in its ninth iteration, with a truly impressive sales record in legacy, such as to allow developers to move away from that PC and console audience that had supported them until now to also reach the niche of small PlayStation Vita laptops and Nintendo 3DS, obviously awaiting even the arrival on Nintendo Switch in a few months. Curious as ever to see how much sense this operation could make, we turned the keys of our tractor and set about plowing the fields. A 3D that is not noticed 3D on Nintendo 3DS is becoming a feature less and less used in a creative way and the titles that take full advantage of this peculiarity of the console can now be counted on the fingertips. Farming Simulator 18 is certainly no exception but its primary function, that is to offer a greater depth of field, is still proposed in a positive way, especially at close-up camera. With the bird's eye view the textures blend together making it annoying to keep the 3D active. Arms stolen from agriculture: never again. Farming Simulator 18 on Nintendo 3DS doesn't get lost in chatter and without any preamble or introduction puts you aboard your first tractor with an entire field to plow. To tell the truth, it almost seems that this new title is designed for an audience that already loves the series and not, as it would be reasonable to expect, for novices who get to grips with it for the first time. In fact, a full-bodied tutorial is missing that accompanies the player step by step in the first actions, thus leaving him initially lost among the thousand incomprehensible icons on the screen and the dozen possible actions to do. However, it takes little to understand that you can jump from one tractor to another with a click on the directional cross, you can hook up a plow by approaching in reverse and thus start tilling the soil simply by passing over the dedicated area. Our luck is that we had given an eye to some previous chapters of the series and in this edition, extremely simplified, we managed to juggle it smoothly, however, immediately noticing many shortcomings. The most obvious one, probably, is the absence of a first person view, a feature that is highly appreciated in the major versions. We will thus be able to drive the alleys only with an external view, even if completely free, enjoying a technical sector that is not exactly exciting, with a strongly marked aliasing and two-dimensional textures spread a little everywhere in a bad way. The possibility of choosing a particular plot of land is missing, a choice that is made automatically at the beginning of each of our new games, and some goodies on the day/night cycle are also missing but, net of all this, the essence of Farming Simulator is however remained unchanged. This is how we start working the fields and patiently waiting for our crop to grow before being able to reap it and resell it. It is unfortunately a tedious and frustrating process given that the speed of play cannot be altered this time and, especially at the beginning, with only one field available you will only have to watch the passing of the hours passively. Things obviously improve when, advancing in the game, you can obtain different fields and diversify the type of activity but until then expect a bland and almost boring pace, a step that could become unsurmountable for those who want to progress quickly towards the heart of the game . If on the one hand, therefore, the first few hours show a terrifying grinding, things are gradually improving thanks also to the possibility of enlisting helpers for collection or refueling, but also to the presence of the autopilot, which will cost the player credits but it will guarantee managerial management of its possessions, a wise choice to try to cushion the heaviness of some cyclical actions to be performed. However, keep in mind that Farming Simulator 18 is just that: an extremely repetitive game that will ask you to perform the same actions endlessly throughout its duration, with the only push to continue deriving from the possibility of buying new vehicles and machinery ( most of those present in the home version). However, the possibility of buying different structures from the usual silos and fields does not appear, further reducing the modalitiesof income and decreasing the variety of things to do in the long run. Positive note instead for the touch interface, extremely practical and quick to use, which allows you to continue playing seamlessly and without the need to wander through endless purchase menus. With a simple tap on the lower screen you can get new properties, assign tasks and manage your business, the only smart addition of this new version.", "date": "2017-06-17", "grade": "6.0"}
