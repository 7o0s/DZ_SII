Why the Dreampainters have decided to put their hands on the debut game while they are busy with Mater Obscura: A Sine Requie Tale is soon said. At the time when Anna came out on the market, our brave developers had to think about maintaining themselves like many ordinary mortals and consequently they could only work on the game in their spare time or at night. Then Anna came out, Pewdiepie got terrified by playing it on YouTube and many newspapers declared themselves in favor of the Dreampainters, so that the funds necessary for the group to become a full-time software house arrived. At that point, instead of choking on gastronomic dishes of Roman cuisine, the developers decided to give their fans the best, transforming Anna into the game they wanted to make from the beginning, and without asking for an extra euro from those who already own the title original. The changes are many and substantial, so if you have already finished it you will find yourself in front of a new adventure, which deserves to be replayed, as if it were your first time in the mountains of Val D'Ayas. If, on the other hand, you discover it only now and feel attracted by the mystery that leaks out from the rusty jambs of the sawmill, you have arrived at the best time. Detractors, on the other hand, have no reason to change their minds, because the soul of the game is always the same. Before doing a reconnaissance tour outside, among the stems of soft green grass, we point out a hint of an important change that appears in the loading screens. Dreampainters are no longer alone. Now with them is Kalypso, an international publisher who brought them to Steam and who we hope will support their future projects in the best possible way. Well, we've waited long enough. Get ready Anna: Extended Edition, we're coming to track you down. A difficult love With the help of new collaborators the Dreampainters rethought the entire project, keeping the sawmill and its two main floors as a base, but opening a new attic wing and a never-before-seen room on the ground floor. But also something else that we leave you the pleasure of discovering. Given the coat of paint on the walls and furnished the interiors, the developers have dedicated themselves to the most delicate aspect, the structure of the puzzles. Anna is a journey into the mental labyrinth of a man who collides with amnesia, recurring thoughts and desperate dives into memories, in search of answers that give him peace. The inner nightmare translates to the outside in a world that continually offers him cunning and cruel riddles. That's why the overhaul of the puzzles has helped create a new adventure even for players who have already experienced it. With the exception of the three or four most successful puzzles, especially for the visual impact, the rest has changed. There are new interactions, different objects, fresh mental paths. Already starting from the area outside the house. In part this choice was dictated by the new structure of the environments and by the desire to narrate some backgrounds that had remained in the mind of the author, but on the other hand it responds to the criticisms that had been addressed to the standard edition, judged too convoluted due to certain passages. And in fact Anna gave a few too many headaches. Now the thoughts of the protagonist and the many illustrated books hidden in the sawmill take care of directing the player on the right path, without however holding his hand. Anna is still a tricky point-and-click adventure compared to the average, especially for the fact that it leaves us free to immediately access many areas together and work on several puzzles at the same time. It's the nature of this game and you can't change it. If you don't feel like racking your brains a bit that's fine, but don't let the difficulty scare you. The only time we got stuck was for a minor oversight that didn't depend on the game, so courage and strong neurons. Anna: Extended Edition also features an improved game interface and inventory, and two new gameplay elements: insights and the sanity gauge. Let's start from the first. There are many objects to examine in Anna and some of them activate the protagonist's thoughts, which are represented in the form of icons in the inventory. Usually these are doubts, questions, particular observations. By combining the right intuitions, insights are obtained that increasingly illuminate the mystery behind the figure of Anna. They are an original way to tellthe story engaging the player and an incentive to revisit the house in subsequent games, since, with eight endings available, there is more than one reason to backtrack. Next we come to the sanity gauge. During the adventure it happens to witness frightening supernatural events that empty the indicator. To find our inner center we have to continue the story and solve the puzzles. A welcome addition that shouldn't cause anxiety, because Anna remains a point and click adventure, so take your time as well. If the bar then empties you will see one of the possible endings and you will unlock an achievement on Steam. There are worse fates. Among the Dreampainters the voluminous game designer Simone Tagliaferri stands out, who has been shouting uncomfortable truths to the crowds for the past decade on these pages. We have treated Anna before and Anna: Extended Edition now with impartiality, but it is still good to point out the strong bond we have with Simone. Who has seen it? This new edition dissects the story behind the name of the game and does so with all the means available to a video game: texts, lights, colors, music and images. Anna: Extended Edition is more beautiful to look at but above all it is more consistent in the recurring elements, such as the disturbing mannequins. Symbols, tales, esoteric scenes and findings are firmly intertwined with each other, reinforcing the gaming experience. There are still obscure elements but this is not a novel and does not have the duty to reconstruct a story as an investigator would. Objects also have a role in telling the story and the player is invited to complete the spaces, surrender to the mystery, let the chromatic and musical suggestions suggest the answers. The only real limit of this adventure lies in its soul of point and click video game. After an exciting event we find ourselves grappling with puzzles, time dilates, tension drops and the rhythm loses a few beats. An inconvenience resulting from a courageous choice: choosing a game system born for classic adventures and building a three-dimensional world around it in which the player would like to feel more and more involved, but which forces him to slow down. Anna is a great horror adventure, with a lot of personality and an original approach to the subject it deals with. And this Extended Edition improves on all aspects of the original game. It still lacks the punch, compactness and irresistible force of masterpieces, but as a debut game it has already achieved astonishing results. Multiplayer.it interviews the Dreampainters Alessandro Monopoli, programmer, composer and co-founder of Dreampainters answers Multiplayer.it's questions about Anna Extended Edition and the group's future projects. Let's immediately get out of curiosity: how did Anna fare in the smooth edition? Can you give us an indicative idea of how many copies it has sold? Are you satisfied with the result? We can't give you specific numbers, but the game has outsold our wildest hopes. However, I think I can say that we are in the five zeros. Why the Extended Edition? What content have you added to the game? There is also talk of a physical edition, is it true? We made an Extended Edition because we think our buyers should be listened to, as all criticisms should be listened to, as well as compliments. We wanted to improve all those aspects that, for budgetary reasons, it had not been possible to take care of as it should be. To understand each other, Anna was developed by me on weekends and when I could in general. I spent the nights on it, doing everything. I believe that, excluding a hypothetical salary for me and Simone [Tagliaferri], Anna cost around five thousand euros, a figure that is ridiculous to define as an understatement. Anna Extended Editiom has a much more substantial budget. There is a retail version in production, yes: it will be released on April 12th across Europe. What improvements have been made from a technical point of view? From that point of view we have improved: particle effects, shaders, lighting, drawings and some textures, postprocessing in particular on detail cameras and physics management. In short, a lot! In the game you have extensively modified the interface, removing the verb system. How come? Because we've listened to feedback from fans and reviewers, we figured out that wasn't the way to handle the interface for a modern graphic adventure. We've completely redesigned the interface to have significantly fewer mouse clicks and to make it easier to interact with the world and handle errors in combinations. In some interviews you talked about ~other versions~, can you tell us which ones? It will finally be disIs there a Linux version available? The Linux version is confirmed, yes, but there are other versions in the works. We will announce them shortly. What do you think of next-gen consoles? Do you find them interesting or do you prefer to remain mainly PC developers? I think next-gen consoles, especially Sony and Microsoft, are really interesting. I've worked almost ten years on consoles and seeing hardware like this excites me: being able to think much more about the game and much less about making it fit on the console is a huge relief. However, Dreampainters remains a software house focused on the PC: each of our games is born for the PC, in order to then be resized correctly on the other targets. We think that this way we can provide the best game on every platform. How is the development of Mater Obscura: A Sine Requie Tale going? Do you have something new to show us? The development proceeds quickly and the quality we aim for is really high. At the moment we have nothing to show, but this claim could become false in a few weeks. We've been hatching some really interesting announcements on Mater Obscura and I'm sure that when we release them, you'll be really happy to hear about them. Mater Obscura is a role-playing game, are you thinking of making other graphic adventures in the future or do you prefer to dedicate yourself to something else? Our philosophy is to make narrative games, so we haven't abandoned graphic adventures, quite the contrary. However, we believe that it is time to dare a little more. We've already done a first-person 3D graphic adventure with Anna: it's not like there aren't many adventures done like this. But we can go further and here too I hope to have announcements for you, but I'm afraid we are talking about a few more months of waiting...", "date": "2013-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
