The alien deployments follow one another according to a certain order and an inevitable symmetry: if a swarm is presented on the left, the next one will descend from the right, and so on. There is even that upgrade that allows us to suck in two enemy ships to transform them into as many side pods. The differences between the two products, clearly apart from the decades that separate them, lie in a whole series of not too obvious adjustments to which the Warblade developers have resorted to in terms of structure and gameplay. In fact, we are faced with a title that is only apparently simple and linear, which after a few games reveals a considerable thickness made up of upgrades, special sections, bosses and score multipliers. Who by the sword wounds... Equipped with a classic mode with hundreds of stages and a ~time attack~ designed for when we only have a few minutes available, Warblade offers us by default a control system based on both the touch screen and the accelerometer: our ship opens the fire when we press the appropriate button at the bottom of the screen, and it moves left and right following the inclination of the device. It is an immediate and rather precise solution, which however will hardly allow us to extricate ourselves from the hundreds of shots fired at our address, especially during the boss fights. Fortunately, by accessing the options it is possible to choose between two other types of combinations based only on touch: the first, quite uncomfortable, with separate commands for the two directions and for opening fire; the second, much better, which sees the large fire button used as a sort of touchpad on which to slide a finger to dictate the movements of the spacecraft by taking advantage of the autofire. In the latter case, the price to pay is the ~interval~ rate of fire, which is a disadvantage when enemies move in large swarms. Beyond these basic elements, the game allows us between one stage and another to spend any money earned to buy the upgrades we want, but which we may not have been able to collect during the action: double shot, triple and quadruple with more effective variants, laser beams, additional shields and armor, speed increases and decreases, etc. If you happen to lose a life, the system recognizes you when you return as having an immediately ~lower~ power than the one you had, thus preventing the occurrence of frustrating situations in which a carelessness affects the entire game and you find yourself facing resistant opponents with the starting cannon only. The linearity of the game mechanics is broken by alternative phases such as the ~rain of asteroids~, an obstacle course that we can cross at a more or less high speed to get extra points, or as the malfunction in the hyperspace jump, which catapults us into a fold of the universe populated by disreputable creatures. Apart from the horrific starting screen, the technical realization of the game is good, with a spectacular use of colors but a design perhaps too simplistic for our ship and the many enemies. The background, which generally consists only of stars and galaxies seen in the distance, manages not to be repetitive thanks also to the implementation of multi-level scrolling, which adds a certain sense of depth. Finally, the sound sector is essential but spot on. The tested version is 1.33 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2010-07-30", "grade": "8.5"}
