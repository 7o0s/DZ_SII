The first forty-five minutes are therefore spent trying to find the tokens that the new Charon needs to transport Sam and Max to the place where they can change Bosco's destiny, completing a couple of puzzles that are rather simple in substance but brilliant in their being placed at the service of the screenplay: giving life back to a machine to take advantage of the death of the mother of the one who wants to be saved, is a reasoning that the player can hardly accept but which, turned upside down in other terms, acquires an - almost - streamlined meaning. The puzzle complex aimed at continuing the experience proves to be effective as always, with the usual solution model that contemplates the union of multiple objects to be used at the right time and place, rather than a setting linked to the completion of logic and math. Good for everyone, therefore, with the help system given by Max, modifiable at will and balanced so as to prove useful without resetting the challenge level. The approximately four hours of duration pass quickly as always, with a further quid given by the sensation - very personal - that the awareness of having to create the last appointment of the season has prompted TellTale to play many tricks up its sleeve, presenting unforgettable environments and situations. The completion of this speech and perhaps the most beautiful corner of Hell in What's new Beelzebub?, is the room dedicated to the victims of Sam and Max: the two find themselves discovering, despite ourselves, that the souls of all those who died because of them, even involuntarily, they inhabit a gigantic space specially created and which can be consulted within dioramas which represent the most significant setting of their past existence; the dialogues and aftermath that follow this discovery are phenomenal. Now a memory, the sprinkling of more arcade gameplay or linked to mini-games has once again not been taken into great consideration, giving a clear signal of how the development team wants to focus and be remembered for having created splendid graphic adventures and nothing more.

As with the first season, this second season of Sam & Max also concludes with an episode that seeks  and succeeds perfectly  to give an answer to all the doubts previously left unresolved, while maintaining a high level of fun, both under the profile of humor as far as the more strictly playful part is concerned. The main theme is eternal damnation and hell, the one from which the detective duo will have to extract the soul of poor Bosco, recovered only physically after previous excursions between alien spaceships and time travel. Considering the delirium generally proposed by the graphic adventures of TellTale, it is not difficult to imagine what heights of sagacity and sarcasm one aims at when one can count on the blackest and most macabre of settings: between quotes from a famous videogame of which thousands of cartridges had been buried , E.T. of the old Atari, resurrected robots and ghosts with a mocking fate, all occasions are good to make fun of clichs and mental schemes. A sparkling fifth chapter, therefore, which offers itself as a gloss on the events narrated by the two who preceded it and makes use of a very large number of already known characters, each of whom is reserved a significant space, albeit perhaps limited in the times of the apparitions . The only real but important news regarding the cast is none other than Satan himself, a skilled but stern office manager who manages his daily hell with skill and passion...", "date": "2008-04-16", "grade": null}
