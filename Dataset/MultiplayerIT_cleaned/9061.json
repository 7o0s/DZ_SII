The national news didn't inform the citizens and kept talking about liposuction and care bears, people preferred to go to the beach, humming silly songs dedicated to the local prisoners, rather than accepting reality, but in the meantime the war was raging and the Daimyo fought for try to get power and become Shogun. Their armies were mostly made up of peasants, people who, up until the day before leaving for the war and putting up their pens, had spent their days at the bar playing Super Enalotto and had lost interest in politics. It was an era of blood, which remained strongly imprinted in Japanese history and culture. Speaking of video games, Sengoku is not the first title to be set during this historical period. Creative Assembly's two Shogun: Total War share the same scenario and, of course, there are countless Japanese titles that have clear references to this era (for example Sengoku Basara, but also Nobunaga's Ambition). There are also reconstructions in other titles, such as in Civilization III and IV, which had scenarios dedicated to this period, while in many games the historical names of families and leaders are used or mentioned in a more liberal way, but with clear references to real events . The point of view of Sengoku: Way of the Warrior is the classic one of the Paradox titles, i.e. the game tries to reconstruct in detail the historical geographical situation of the period, giving the player the possibility to guide a Daimyo to change (or confirm, why not ) the course of history. completeness and complexity As with any strategic game developed by Paradox, it is worth recommending that you immediately try to understand what type of game you are dealing with, in order not to make the mistake of buying a product other than the one you were hoping for. Sengoku is not a game for everyone, but it is specially designed for true strategy lovers, i.e. those who are not afraid of not having immediate feedback for their actions and who know how to plan and manage campaigns that can last several hours, if not days . The game starts by asking you to click on a Japanese region to take command of one of the fighting families. There are no tutorials and the player has only big text screens to help him. In reality, a tutorial for such a title would be absurd, because it would itself have to last many hours and still not be able to exhaust the complexity of the title. In short, Sengoku requires you to read quite a bit of text, unfortunately only in English. The entry curve into the game is very steep, similar to other Paradox titles. The reconstruction of the initial political situation is so well done that to learn how to play we benefited from reading a few pages of history, which described the situation in general. Indeed, knowing the forces at play before choosing who to play is not a bad idea, so you avoid running into the worst factions when you still have to practice the interface and the various options. Obviously the game provides a whole series of valuable information that give the same result and which are enriched every time a new element is explained to us. Honor and war Playing it is clear that we are faced with a great product that tries to delve into every aspect of the ongoing war. In addition to choosing how to manage the kingdom and which personalities to assign to the various leadership roles, as well as forming the army and defending itself during sieges, the player must take into consideration what is perhaps the fundamental factor for winning, or good repute. A series of decisions and elements revolve around honour, which can overturn the outcome of the war. Bringing it down too much, by carrying out despicable actions, can be lethal for a Daimyo who is weak or balanced compared to the others. Moreover, if the value drops too much, it would still be game over, so you have to be very careful about how to act. The battles are decided directly by the artificial intelligence, which calculates the result based on the forces in the field, the terrain of the battle, the state of the troops, the charisma of the general who leads them and so on. In addition to the regular army, it is possible to resort to the help of ninja armies and, going down to several compromises, to that of foreign forces. The important thing is not to panic if at first you end up routed without fully understanding the reason or if a choice creates a kind of chain reaction that compromises an apparently rosy situation. Of courseente, it is all bread and butter for real strategists, while others may find it unbearably difficult, but this was already taken into account. The technical aspect deserves just a few words, since it's certainly not the graphics and sound that make the difference. The map of Japan is reconstructed quite well and with a good number of details, but we stop there. A less minimal interface would have been welcome, especially at higher resolutions, where reading the numerous text screens on the screen becomes real pain for the eyes (understood because then we go and get the history books). Fortunately, at least from the point of view of convenience, always with regard to the hundreds of actions to be performed, Paradox has once again proved to be a master in putting up a practical and never dispersive menu system, which is best evaluated when it is done some practice. The oriental-style music, for its part, serves only as an accompaniment, as well as the few sound effects that underline some screens or some events. In short, technically everything is quite functional, which is what enthusiasts expect.", "date": "2011-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
