Rochard and his colleagues will have repeated it several times, as they moved unsuccessfully from one chain of asteroids to another, now desperately looking for precious minerals to extract. When you work for a corporation that practically enjoys a monopoly in the galaxy and you haven't gotten results for months, then the risk of being fired begins to materialize. However, by chance, during the last expedition, the team led by good old John makes a particular discovery, which is greeted with amazement by Mr. Maximillian, their boss at Skyrig. However, the discovery also results in a chain of very dangerous situations, with the team's space station suddenly being attacked by a group of soldiers who seem intent on eliminating anyone inside. But who sent them? And what is so important about the structure unearthed by drilling? We will find out through five chapters in which we will play the abundant role of John Rochard, determined to save his companions Skyler and Zander, and to understand what lies behind this matter. Developed exclusively for the PlayStation Network by the independent team Recoil Games and produced by Sony Online Entertainment, Rochard immediately focuses on the most characterizing elements of its gameplay, equipping the protagonist with a G-Lifter that allows him to lift certain objects and ~drag~ them around the stage, canceling the force of gravity. Gravity force which, thanks to some machines, can also be modified in real time, almost allowing us to float in the air and therefore to make jumps and jumps of greater range. At first the game gives the impression of being an action platform, but the assumptions are very different and focus more on puzzle solving, with the stages that follow one another almost like those of the classics Another World and Flashback, in the sense that they confront us adversaries and pitfalls that we are called upon to neutralize by using our resources in the best possible way. And this is how the G-Lifter can make us lift boxes immune to enemy bullets, which we can launch to exploit their weight offensively or use as a shield, to bounce the shots towards the sender (the first trophy is we unlocked just like this). Squeeze your brains, trippone! We were talking about puzzles and the force of gravity, two closely related elements in Rochard. Using the G-Lifter we can ~hook~ some speakers and move them using the right analog stick of the Dual Shock. By pressing the L1 backbone instead we have the possibility of zeroing, or almost, the force of gravity inside the stage and therefore modifying the same capabilities of our device, which will be able to launch the crates further away and/or with different trajectories. All this will be used to activate and deactivate switches and consequently open the doors that will allow us to continue in the adventure, with the additional puzzle factor represented by the force fields: the blue ones allow people to cross them but block inanimate objects, the red ones do the exact opposite, so from time to time you have to understand what to pass and from where. If the Recoil Games title had continued to take this path, thus proposing each new stage as a puzzle to be solved, even in its action implications, the vote you immediately went to peek at would have been at least one higher. The fact is that at a certain point Rochard takes the road of the action shooter and does it without knowledge of the facts, the G-Lifter is practically equipped with a small energy cannon (later also with a grenade launcher) and the fights of a sometimes they lose all their potential charm, going from problems that can be solved with strategy and reasoning (~the enemy on the lower platform didn't notice me: I lift a crate and drop it on his head~) to very rough firefights , which at worst are resolved with a classic stomp (Circle button) from close range, also implemented in an at least simplistic way. Playstation 3 trophies There are fourteen trophies that can be unlocked by playing as Rochard: eleven bronze, two silver and one gold. The latter is obtained by completing the game with a ~speed run~ in less than three hours, while for the others it is necessary to perform a rather particular series of actions: kill an enemy by falling on him, use an object to deflect his blows and eliminate him in thus, get all the upgrades, defeat the final boss and so on. Expectations disappointed In the list of what was legitimate to expect from the game figurecertainly also a pleasant screenplay, endowed with a humor that the protagonist's appearance can only recall. Let's face it: John Rochard poses as the exact opposite of the typical video game character, fat and middle-aged rather than young and with a sculpted physique. It was necessary to complete the work by putting a few good jokes in his mouth, but instead nothing: the excellent acting of Jon St. John remains an end in itself, getting lost in the twists and turns of a plot that really has nothing new to tell. Going back to the gameplay, it becomes clear after just a few minutes that the key configuration had to be thought of differently, because even the most trivial ~platform~ operations turn into extremely cumbersome maneuvers and at the fourth hour of play (it takes more or less five to complete the adventure) we still caught ourselves making the wrong buttons in key moments, often incurring game over. Similar notes can also be moved to the technical sector: on the one hand, the graphics flow smoothly (apart from very rare cases), have beautiful colors and a good characterization of the scenarios, on the other hand, they lack variety both in terms of animation (Rochard in the ~ cutscene~ he just shakes his fists...) and as far as the opponents are concerned, almost always the same. Finally, the ~signed~ soundtrack combines a nice selection of different styles and songs which, however, often have little to do with the action shown on the screen.", "date": "2011-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
