The approach chosen for some time now by the developers is that of the well-known MyClub mode, however applied to the overall experience: after choosing a team and hiring a coach , we start with a shortlist of amateur footballers and try, victory after victory, to obtain the credits necessary to win weight reinforcements for the various departments, consequently modifying the formation. There are players who perform better in a certain position, others who bring down the enthusiasm of the team, still others who can solve the game with two touches: we can freely decide how to deploy them on the pitch or rely on an automatic system that will choose the setting improve as the club is enriched with new elements. It should be emphasized that this year too PES has chosen to adopt a permissive freemium model, which allows you to play without waiting or particular limitations: an indisputable added value so much for those who want enjoy the experience for free, as for those who intend to invest a little money in the purchase of coins to speed up the progression and get better players. Novelty, gameplay and structure Making use, at least on paper, of the suggestions of an international star like Iniesta, the developers of eFootball PES 2020 Mobile have introduced new conclusions from before which immediately prove to be as effective as they are spectacular in front of goal. Precision dribbling also finds its place in the game, to be performed by touching the screen when trying to jump the man: a maneuver of great impact, not only visual, which from a certain point onwards significantly influences the gameplay. For the rest, the system is the one we had already appreciated in the last few editions, characterized by good solidity and the possibility of choosing between two different layouts for touch controls, traditional or gestural, both able to guarantee a good precision and responsiveness thanks also to some fine adjustments. Unfortunately Konami did not want to include support for Bluetooth controllers, which would have substantially changed the experience and opened up a whole series of possibilities, especially in the context of home use and not on the move: too bad. If, therefore, from the point of view of the mechanics the situation is optimal, with some important innovations that integrate within an already well-tested system, although still subject to some uncertainty, unfortunately there are no substantial variations as regards the structure, which remains anchored to a controversial and rather slow formula, especially in the early hours. In fact, there are no classic modes such as the championship, tournaments or the traditional Master League, but a single campaign based on progression through a virtually infinite number of matches to be played against other users in asynchronous mode, thus facing simple bots. A concept that once again proves to be very boring during the first hours, when the level of the teams is low and the comparisons end with tennis scores, moreover without the possibility of speeding things up in any way. Luckily there's the option to play games in true online multiplayer, which work surprisingly well and don't have excessive latency (but early releases, well, can be a problem), as well as try your hand at a series of special events at rotation. Together with the training management operations and the various facets related to the player purchase system, this aspect undoubtedly represents the best part of eFootball PES 2020. However, it is still too little if we consider the potential of the game, which technically makes its appearance thanks to the fluid graphics and the many new animations, while the surrounding elements betray excessive simplifications and gimmicks used to lighten the load (see the creation of the public). The commentary in Italian, which can be downloaded separately, finally seems to include some new sentences, while the signed soundtrack effectively accompanies our stay on the screens between one match and another.", "date": "2019-10-24", "grade": "7.3"}
