{"name": "Monster Madness: Grave Danger - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-madness-grave-danger-recensione.html", "text": "Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia was proposed last year by South Peak Interactive to fill the gap in the playrooms that belongs to ~pure~ arcade titles, now practically absent from the global gaming scene. The idea was quite nice: essentially an action-game, a bit of a fighting game and a bit of a shooter, in which the player plays a teenager dealing with hordes of zombies, monsters and infernal crap of various kinds. The execution, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired: Monster Madness was a poor product, especially from the point of view of the controls. With this sort of remake, Grave Danger, the developers have tried to solve some problems that afflicted the original game, while adding new features to improve the experience. Did they succeed? Well no... Putrescent Starting a game of Grave Danger is really immediate: the player selects one of the four stereotypical protagonists, practically identical to each other apart from the visual aspect, and begins to destroy enemy after enemy, alternating between close combat and firearms of all kinds. There is no shortage of variety in the second case: flamethrowers, machine guns, there are really quite a few systems to eliminate enemies from a distance, and due to the emphasis placed on this attack system, the developers of Psionics have thought of reworking the controls, assigning them to a second stick: compared to the original title, the improvement is tangible and it is much simpler and more intuitive to wander around the stages wiping out monsters of all kinds. Unfortunately, the new control system does not save the pace of the game from tedious mediocrity: the continuation is one-way, the game maintains a rather slow and monotonous pace, interrupted only by special stages in which you find yourself piloting vehicles. In these cases, the situation worsens significantly as the control of the vehicles is imprecise, rather than benefiting the pace these stages are in the long run irritating and useless. We return to the ground, and the monotonous destruction of dozens of creatures and sporadic bosses begins again, characterized more by the length of the battle than by the actual difficulty: the result is therefore a frustrating game, which offers excessively simple phases alternating with other really difficult ones. The positive note is the possibility of tackling the main mode in the company of three other players: together with the banal story, however told through nice comic screens, it is perhaps the only element that saves Monster Madness from total rejection. Technical aspects Certainly no one expected wonders from this Monster Madness, but compared to last year the improvements have been practically non-existent. The graphics engine continues to offer annoying frame-rate drops, gameplay killers in the frequent hectic situations in which dozens of creatures appear on the screen, and there is no shortage of irritating screen-tearing. The camera maintains an appropriate distance from the polygonal models in order to keep as much of the playing area visible as possible: in reality it is probably a system to hide the low quality of details and textures, an expedient even summarily implemented, given that the camera movement is often unsmooth. All in all, Monster Madness has a huge advantage, namely that it presents itself with a truly captivating and particularly comic style, so much so that even the four, very stereotyped protagonists are pleasant: the aforementioned comic sequences help to increase this feeling. Thumbs down for the audio sector, however, characterized by repetitive and banal music tracks, as well as a truly terrible dubbing and a series of decidedly embarrassing sound effects and screams. Extra challenges Compared to the previous Battle for Suburbia, Grave Danger offers an alternative game mode in which the player is called to face twenty-five stages of increasing difficulty with various objectives, typically concentrated however in the continuous extermination of monsters and zombies. These challenges do not affect the main game mode, but reward the player with additional features, such as the ability to change the protagonists' clothes. Along with the online mode, it's probably the best feature of this new edition of Monster Madness. Comment Grave Danger tries to remedy the defects of the ~prequel~, it is true, but the attempt is listless and naive: in reality, apart from a renewed control system and a couple of extra modes, the problems of Monster Madness remain, and the game continues to be boring, repetitive and extremely unbalanced difficulty. The technical aspect also contributes to the negative judgment, really oldor and dejected by technical flaws of various kinds. However, it remains one of the few real arcades on the market, which can be entertaining in small doses thanks above all to the online mode (with unfortunately frequent lag) and the co-operative one.
