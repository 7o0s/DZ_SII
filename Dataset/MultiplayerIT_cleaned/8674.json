Yes, that's right, it's terribly stupid, but we just can't resist. On the other hand, we felt just as stupid playing the castrated version of LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 on PlayStation Vita, already released a few months ago in two editions. As happened previously, even in that case the guys from Traveller's Tales had to find a compromise, creating an ~integral~ version for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and a slightly more rose-water version for Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Wii and Sony PSP. The gameplay in both versions is of excellent quality, that's not the point: the problem is releasing the simplified version on a console that runs titles like Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and Uncharted without the least problem... Wands and bricks Before complaining about the quality of this port, it is perhaps appropriate to explain what exactly a LEGO Traveller's Tales video game is, especially for those who have never played one. We are faced with a sort of adventure with strong platform hues, but a good ninety percent of the characters and objects have been reproduced with the most beloved plastic bricks in the world. Each level is inspired by one of the most important moments of the reference franchise and in this specific case the last four cinematic adventures of the Harry Potter saga, each divided into four stages of variable length. The aim of the game is not only to get to the end of each stage, but above all to collect as many bricks (or ~studs~) as possible to unlock the many additional contents, especially the bonus characters. Indeed, the LEGO Traveller's Tales games place a great deal of emphasis on repeating levels with the sole purpose of collecting studs and secret items to buy all the various extras available, an activity that can take hours, especially as some areas can only be entered. some characters thanks to their peculiar abilities. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 this feature is particularly accentuated by a huge variety of characters and spells with the most diverse functions that enrich the game with puzzles and situational puzzles. Virtually every spell devised by J.K. Rowling finds a match in the game: for example, the devastating Reducto allows us to destroy some obstacles while the light of Lumos loosens the grip of the plant Devil's trap, Wingardium Leviosa will allow us to levitate heavier objects and with the curse in their place without forgiveness Imperio we will be able to take remote control of other characters. Thus, while only some evil characters can access areas closed to those unfamiliar with dark magic, others will be able to use their pets to activate levers or collect special items: the puzzles are intuitive and fun, particularly suitable for a younger audience who will appreciate even more the humor of the computer graphics skits that tell, in their own way, the salient moments of the story. PSVita trophies It is possible to get a good number of Trophies in this LEGO parody of Harry Potter: 22 Bronze, 15 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. It's also quite simple, just collect all the characters, Minikits, gold bricks and whatever you can collect, accumulating as many studs as possible, and that's it. A joke worthy of the Weasleys In short, the novelties compared to the previous LEGO games are missing again this time: however, the formula works and continues to entertain, plus the PlayStation Vita touch-screen allows you to interact with the environment and cast spells simply by touching the target, rather than moving the cursor with the left analog stick. The answer is not particularly precise but it is an addition that deserves mention and is particularly useful during the sporadic duels of magic. Unfortunately, however, the version proposed by the Traveller's Tales guys in their debut on the new Sony laptop isn't the best: instead of converting the richer and more complete version, already released for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the software house limited itself to recycle the edition for 3DS, Wii and PSP; it is therefore a lightened port both from a technical and content point of view, in which only one character is visible at a time, some levels have been removed and even the central area is decidedly more restricted. The variety of puzzles is not up to that proposed on home consoles and, in general, there is an excessive simplicity. Even the pre CG cutscenesfeel unpleasant signs of compression, shortened to the point of being really incomprehensible. What really left us perplexed is the final visual rendering: compared to the equivalent portable version for 3DS and PSP, LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 undoubtedly appeared more defined and sharper, yet it is marred by frequent and inexplicable frame-rate drops that do not occur in more graphically complex and elaborate products. Even the 3DS version wasn't weighed down to such an extent by the optional stereoscopic effect, so we can't explain the poverty of the code proposed on a portable console that could easily handle (with the right compromises) the versions for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. fortunately, the quality of the soundtrack has remained intact, which reproduces practically all the cinematic songs.", "date": "2012-03-15", "grade": "5.0"}
