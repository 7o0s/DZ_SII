{"name": "Road To India", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/road-to-india.html", "text": "Indian peculiarities? To take Road To India home, the unquestionable minimum consists of a P2 350, 32 bm of ram and an 8mb accelerated video card; to play the new Microids product in a more than good way, the system requirements are slightly higher, settling on a P2 350, 128 mb of ram, 16 mb accelerated video card and 400 mb of space on your HD. Such low system requirements obviously find an explanation in the type of game that certainly does not need an endless number of polygons or frame rates that barely reach 3-digit numbers. Ditto for the sound, it is related to the land where the events take place and is, for the most part, halfway between relaxing and ~drowsy~ while the Italian dubbing is of a good standard (for once NdLL). I don't think there is much to say about the game structure of such an inflated gameplay, given that a good mouse is indispensable for analyzing objects, walking or, better still, for interacting with everything that Microids has placed around us (since we can rotate our 360-degree view of the environment). The topical moments of Road To India are the day, the dream and the night: needless to say that this separation, between reality and illusion, greatly characterizes the style of puzzles that you will have to solve. Speaking of the latter, there shouldn't be any particular problems in solving them since they are all quite obvious and therefore you should easily get to the end in about twenty hours, unless obviously you are stuck in some location. Obviously not being able to reveal anything about the plot and the puzzles, the time has come to draw ours. Conclusions Road To India comes with a respectable audio-visual look and with a good dubbing that easily introduces us to the wonderful Indian world, albeit steeped in terrible mysteries. For lovers of point and click adventures, although it is not the longest running title of this genre, it is practically a wedding invitation; for newcomers to the genre, the new Microids point and click is once again a good buy: the puzzles, not too difficult due to an already mentioned rationality, do not pose any frustration to the user not accustomed to the point and click genre . Conclusions We are therefore faced with a good product recommended to everyone, obviously excluding those who just want to blast enemy on enemy or waste hours trying to get a plane to take off. Beautiful there, Microids! India.. Microids is certainly a software house to which most gamers equipped with PCs owe a minimum of thanks: between a Roland Garros and a Warm Up, the French label has churned out various graphic adventures that have behaved well in the review and of sales. After the 2 episodes of Dracula and Necronomicom we now have the Road To India here to crowd the scene of point and click adventures. Once the game is installed, contained on 2 CDs (almost half a gigabyte of free space on HD), a full motion video sequence of slightly above average quality starts (perhaps because there are no less than fifteen minutes of FMV); a young couple exchanges their last effusions before saying goodbye for a while except that, some time later, a letter reaches Fred Reynolds (our alter ego) from his beautiful Anusha, known at the university and now far away in India. The letter sounds like a farewell: she will remain in the East, definitively abandoning the United States. Definitely worried about such a sudden change, Fred decides to leave immediately for the same destination as his beloved, trying to understand what actually happened to her. Arrived in beautiful India, it won't take long to understand what or, better, who has changed Anusha in such an evident way: the Thugs, worshipers of the Goddess Kali (but yes, the one with many arms, the same one from ~Indiana Jones and the temple cursed, do you remember now?ndLL).", "date": "2001-08-29", "grade": null}
