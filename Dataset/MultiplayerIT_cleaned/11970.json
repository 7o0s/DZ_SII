{"name": "Sam &amp; Max: Season One - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-season-one-recensione.html", "text": "Not many months have passed since the release of the individual episodes that make up Sam & Max: Season One and there is already talk of subsequent adventures. Before looking to the future, however, TellTale has decided to give the opportunity to enjoy their latest work to all those who cannot - or do not want to - buy content via the internet, bringing to the shops a packaged version complete with the six most some extra content. For all those not aware of it, the protagonist duo of the bizarre and often paradoxical detective adventures treated here, is made up of the curious juxtaposition of an anthropomorphic dog and a rabbit: if the former adheres to many of the styles of the private investigator, rising to absolute protagonist, the latter is the comic sidekick par excellence, capable at times of illuminating the scene with bizarre but ingenious deductions. Each case is completely separate from the others, leaving it up to the user to decide in which order to tackle them; in any case, the albeit feeble underground plot recommends an orderly development, taking advantage of a homogeneous average quality. Those Six Times Good Guys To open the dances is Culture Shock, a nice mockery of Pop culture and a leap into the past for many of the players who had already experienced the first videogame appearance of Sam and Max. Between one memorabilia and the next, the hypnosis, the recurring theme throughout Seson One. Situation Comedy is instead more current and disenchanted, set in the studios of a famous  in fiction  television broadcaster. The desire to make it a mirror of the less than sublime contents offered by the small screen does not slow down the overwhelming pace of the chapter, capable of being the most varied in terms of situations and gimmicks. Perhaps too light but not in bad faith is The Mole, the Underworld and the Meatball, which delves into the difficult mafia theme, albeit for the first and only time in the series in an uncritical way. A casino is therefore the background for about four hours of good entertainment, even if certain peaks of excellence are reserved for other appearances. Abe Lincoln must die! is the demonstration of how you can talk about politics in a video game, comparing for the presidency of the United States of America nothing less than the statue of the famous ex-president and Max the rabbit. It's up to you to seal the fate of a messy election campaign. Unmissable for enthusiasts, Reality 2.0 is a journey into the virtual but not too much existence in the years of the Web and video games, straddling previously unthinkable services and a pinch of solitude. Turn-based combat and, above all, a purely text-based final part, are the moments not to be missed for any reason. Finally, the light side of the moon is less linked to a specific theme and is proposed as a container for characters already seen previously. The lion's share, in any case, is the lunar setting. For all six, the gameplay is the same, firmly anchored in the tradition of point and click graphic adventures, with generally well thought out and not overly complex puzzles, so as to favor a more fluid gallop towards the end. To alternate there are short arcade sessions that increase the adrenaline after so much reflection. The additional content you expect! Some small goodies have been included to the delight of fans and to reward those who have waited the months necessary to pack the packaged version. The full-size Sam & Max poster is a perfect addition to many a child's room, while the behind-the-scenes footage transports you to the TellTale studios as the work progresses. Wallpaper, artwork, trailer, soundtrack and biographies of the characters conclude this overview of great value. How I draw you Sam & Max From an artistic point of view, Steve Purcell's trait can be recognized right away, pleasant in its cartoony and disproportionate composition of the bodies and in the environments adorned with many details and touches of class. Technically, the inexpensive system requests are not the prelude to a poor realization: the polygons are in good number and the textures are always precise, with the only lack of effects to partially turn up the nose. The choice of music is very good, which always worthily accompanies all the stunts of the two private detectives. Simply splendid, however, the dubbing in English, the only one available, with actors able to understand the difference between a simple reading and an interpretation. In this regard and for the first time, the Italian subtitles are present and allow you to relieve yourself of the obligation to understand the not always simple speech, full of slang expressions and puns. Commentor 7.8 Sam & Max: Season One is an excellent purchase for lovers of the genre, who will find six self-conclusive adventures in their hands with each of which to spend a pleasant evening. The quality between one chapter and the next fluctuates slightly and it is difficult to define dissatisfaction, while the difficulty and the learning curve, both facing downwards, facilitate the experience even for less skilled players. Finally, this packaged version includes some improvements such as extra content and the expected Italian subtitles. Pros Exhilarating and well written All six adventures collected together Technically commendable Cons Classic graphic adventure structure may not appeal to everyone Longevity of individual episodes could have been better Sam & Max: Season One is available for PC.
