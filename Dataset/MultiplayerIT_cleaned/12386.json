However, in recent years, and especially in the past two seasons, the US giant has begun to follow an unpleasant trend, which consists in introducing very few innovations in the new editions of a series, the bare minimum to be able to justify the increase of a number on the name. This both for the principle ~as long as there is no competition we can obtain the maximum result with the minimum effort~ and for the ancient Zen adage ~better to spend more time and money on some titles of the nextgen consoles~. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 is absolutely no exception, and indeed is a perfect example of what has just been described. The innovations included are marginal, and are mostly summarized in new holes and new game modes. It must be said, however, that a golf enthusiast will hardly be bored with this title, and this is largely due to the numerous selectable modes. They include stroke play, match play, skins, practice, stableford, alternate shot, scramble, and four-ball. Among the novelties of this year we find the ~bloodsome~ and ~greensome~ matches based on team play: For those who don't understand a golf club in the first case it is possible to choose the best shot among those made by one's own team, in the second the opposite occurs, and it is the opponents who select which of the shots made will be the official one (of course they will select the worst one, if they have any wish to win). Another novelty is ~one ball~, where you alternately hit the same ball as your opponent and try to place it so that the opponent, on the next shot, finds himself in the greatest possible difficulty (trust me: do it against a human opponent and not against the CPU). Clearly there is also the classic PGA Tour Season mode, which unfolds in 29 different events marked by a calendar in real time, with the possibility of organizing oneself in order to play even a few minutes a day without compromising one's career. From the point of view of playability, every fan of this sport can feel inside an iron barrel. With Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 the real golf experience is well conveyed on the screen, there is little doubt about that. The character editor deserves a small special mention, which is considered by many to be the best ever created. Too bad for the lack of a circuit editor, which would certainly have given the product an edge. Graphics and sound Even speaking of graphics, the underlying theme always remains the same: very little has been done to improve the 2006 edition. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 can easily be mistaken for its predecessor, and only a closer look brings to light the very slight improvements that have been made. However, the result is more than discreet, and both the golfers and the courses are all to be admired: every single professional golfer has his own personalized swing animation and is made up of a more than good number of polygons, while it seems that compared to the past a more lively and ~full~ color palette is chosen for the rooms. Speaking of the audio sector, it is clear that in such a title one cannot expect who knows what masterpiece, also and above all because the type of game does not require anything of the kind. And in fact Tiger Woods 07 does its job well, and nothing more: the crowd is beautiful, noisy as always, the ambient sounds are excellent and the two commentators David Feherty and Gary McCord are very bad as always, always ready to comment on every little mistake by the players . Final comment It is easy to summarize Tiger Woods 2007 in a few words: this title is the best golf game in existence, but it pays for a certain laziness on the part of the developers which makes it very, very similar to the previous edition. All golf lovers without an adequate title would do well to slingshot, while those who already own the last version would do well to think of other ways to spend their money. Let's hope that with the end of this transition period between the old and new generation of consoles, this behavior by Electronic Arts will also end, fruitful for the company but close to being fooled from the point of view of gamers.Pro The best golf in existence Interesting online mode and character creation Cons Virtually identical toAT previous version Less rich career mode than in the PC version Now part of the large family of Electronic Arts historical franchises, Tiger Woods PGA Tour has also reached the 2007 edition, and is preparing to conquer once again all those players who, tired of frenzy, shootings and car races, want to spend a few hours to the peaceful and reasoned game of golf.
