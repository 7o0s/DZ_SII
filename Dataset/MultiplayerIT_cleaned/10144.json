Conceptually inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, this game tells of the disappearance of eight-year-old Charlotte May and the investigation carried out by former private detective Robert Conway to find her. '50, staging a thriller in which not everything is as it seems: despite being a story driven game, therefore without decisions that really influence the events, the search for truth presents some unpredictable and unexpected turns. All of Robert's neighbors could be guilty of kidnapping Charlotte May, it's up to us to figure out who is responsible in a residential complex where everyone has their skeletons in the closet. In our review of Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View we discover all the qualities of this work. Observation, research and analysis Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View, Robert begins to investigate the disappearance of Charlotte May There's one thing we haven't told you about Robert Conway: he's paralyzed from the waist down: so he needs a wheelchair to get around. This physical limitation brings him closer to James Stewart in the aforementioned Hitchcock film, with the difference that Conway does not spend his time spying on his neighbors. This also means that part of the puzzles involve creating a path that can take him where he needs to go. In general, the level design is built so that Robert can move with a certain agility (as far as the wheelchair allows) inside the apartments of Dhalia View. The polygonal interpenetration intervenes to help him, which allows Conway to rotate without getting stuck or blocked against obstacles of any kind represented by the furniture. One soon learns not to notice it anymore, even going so far as to silently thank this small graphic defect: that said, it does not mean that Robert half disappears inside a bedside table or a wall, simply one notices that sometimes the wheels of the wheelchair they pass where they should bump into something. That said, Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View is based on three phases. Observation, research and evidence analysis. Focusing on one neighbor at a time, we will observe it from the window of our apartment, immortalizing what appears suspicious to us through the camera. Once enough information has been collected, we will have to find a way to access the houses to be searched, looking for clues inside them in a process made up of exploration and puzzles to solve. In general they are well done and range over different degrees of difficulty, avoiding being frustrating or prohibitive, although a couple have proved to be quite complex. Once we find everything we need, we will return to our apartment to connect the clues together and get closer and closer to the culprit. An unconventional protagonist Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View, Robert's disability sometimes requires taking the long way round Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View is not in itself a long game, however it manages to involve due to its duration, leaving us from time to time with the desire to understand who may have kidnapped Charlotte May. Each investigation does not seem to lead to anything really relevant and, as the finale approaches, one has the feeling of never really having the full picture of events. We liked the decision to put ourselves in the shoes of an unconventional protagonist, a man enslaved in his own physical limitations and therefore unable to perform an action taken for granted such as running (or even walking). To enhance Robert there is also the conflict with his daughter, an agent of Scotland Yard who refuses his help not only for legal issues, but also to prove that he is a valid policeman. A relationship that sours when, obviously, we begin to investigate on our own. This leads to the staging of a rather nuanced character, that of Robert, and above all misaligned with the figure of the hero in spite of noble intentions. A useful fact to understand that a protagonist is not necessarily a hero, the two words are not connected to each other and even less should they be used as synonyms. Robert's haste, combined with the unexpressed, but evident lack of faith in Scotland Yard's methods, leads him to take several missteps and ignore his daughter's requests, running the risk of compromising an investigation that is in itself delicate. Without adding other details, we find him a well-defined character, as are the other inhabitants of Dhalia View. Not only on a character level, but alsohe aesthetic, thanks to an artistic style that is very pleasant to look at. Artistic direction Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View, the art direction is one of the most striking aspects White Paper Games relies on hand-drawn textures and stylized environments, a choice that derives from the desire to create games whose artistic quality is of a high level, but at the same time can be created by a small team. The scarcity of resources therefore led the studio to develop a certain type of pipeline, so that production was always rapid without depriving their games of their own uniqueness. The artistic style of Conway: Disappearance at Dhalia View builds on the stylized quality of Ether One and combines it with the more grounded realism of The Occupation, also plucking from external sources to find elements capable of making it recognizable within the parameters established by the development study. Among these we find the already mentioned film La Finestra sul Cortile, in terms of lighting, and the 2D animated film The Illusionist in terms of art direction. We then move on to Toy Story 4 and David Fincher, but not only, as regards shots and shooting techniques. Summing up, we cannot deny the new White Paper Games game a strong attention to detail and technical staging. We would not have minded seeing the same in-depth gameplay, because beyond well thought-out puzzles and credible dialogues, the game doesn't offer much else. Although it is an investigation, the fact that it is story driven does not allow us to approach it in a different key than how it is proposed: the order of the neighbors will be decided beforehand, the occasional presence of multiple choice dialogues has no relevance in the scenes of ~interrogation~ and the even rarer timed sequences, if they involve other characters, have no repercussions on us or on the investigation itself. Similarly, turning neighbors' apartments upside down has no consequences and it doesn't matter that everything is very different from how they left it, before we entered: they don't notice it. This breaks the immersion a bit and leaves the feeling of a wasted opportunity to give life to an even more engaging investigation than it has proved to be anyway.", "date": "2021-11-02", "grade": "7.0"}
