There are three bikers at the counter, but more will be arriving soon. The agent is quickly surrounded and the fight begins. In the eyes of a casual observer, however, it might seem more like a dance, a set of punches, kicks and repositionings so fluid as to give the impression that everything is calculated to the millimeter. And indeed it is, because it is we - calmly - who decide what to do in the battle. What are we talking about? Of a strategic and turn-based deck-building rogue-lite: here is our review of Fights in tight spaces. Cards and spaces The Fights in tight spaces agent can throw enemies off the map Fights in tight spaces, recently available in full version after a long period of Early Access, is a new turn-based card-based game. Unlike other exponents of the genre, such as Slay the Spire or Inscryption, we play in a real 3D environment in which it's not only about attacking and defending ourselves, but also about managing our position in the best way. Each match is placed in a narrow space (hence the title), whether it's a bar, a balcony or the prison police van. Each place is divided into squares and each attack, ours or that of the opponents, has a certain minimum and maximum range in order to be activated. We will therefore have to understand how to position ourselves, between one blow and another, to maximize the damage inflicted and reduce (or better yet cancel) the damage suffered. Furthermore, the opponents can suffer friendly fire and this pushes us to condition their movements in our favor. Finally, almost all maps have points where it is possible to drop enemies, so as to eliminate them in one fell swoop. Beyond the placement management, Fights in tight spaces is a fairly classic card game that won't confuse those accustomed to the genre. First of all, each game provides us with a basic deck (we will be able to unlock various types) with few cards and each victory allows us to get at least one card to add to the deck. During a match, we will have a certain number of points to spend and the cards have their own cost. You must therefore calculate each move of the round in advance to make sure you don't make any mistakes: also for this reason, the pace of the game is rather low. A small change is related to the combo counter. Fights in tight spaces offers some cards that have no cost, but require you to have a certain level of active combo. Each attack increases this value, but each move of our character's box decreases it. The combo therefore pushes us to optimize our actions and not go overboard with the repositioning. Enemies and power ups Various types of enemies on the roof of a building, in a fight of Fights in tight spaces It is also very important to think about the capabilities of the enemies. Fights in tight spaces pits us against multiple types of gang henchmen and the most disparate criminal gangs. Beyond the narrative characterization, what interests us is what they are able to do. The opponents of our secret agent, by default, attack in their turn, but have capabilities such as the counterattack (which is self-explanatory) and the annoying automatic attack that is activated every time we act and we are within their reach. Others are immune to frontal hits, still others dodge the first strike every turn. Others can inflict bleeding or debilitate our character with various penalties. The variety of enemies is excellent and, even if the arenas are all a bit the same and tend to get lost soon, the clashes are always fresh and interesting, also because it all depends on our cards. Even an identical clash can have very different results due to a few tactical choices, as we were able to prove ourselves by retrying some clashes (which is possible on some difficulties, which we will discuss shortly). What, on the other hand, did not particularly convince us is the management of the bosses. Fights in tight spaces is divided into missions and at the end of each mission you have to face a more powerful enemy. In this case, however, both the arenas and the clashes are not too dissimilar from the standard ones. In more advanced missions, the bosses have additional abilities, even unique ones, but the substance does not change and they never give the impression of really fighting a unique battle, more like a slower version of a normal fight. Certainly there could have been a little more effort to characterize them and propose situations that required more elaborate and precise tactics. By spending money you can upgrade cards Beyond the bosses, every fight is satisfying, also because it allows you to get various bonuses. The simple victory gets us a card, but if we are able to complete a series of second objectivesdari (winning within certain rounds, eliminating enemies by throwing them off the map, collecting a briefcase placed in a box...) we will be able to have various upgrades, such as a larger compo counter, more points to spend each round to use cards and above all money . The money is used to heal the character, increase his maximum life, buy new cards, upgrade the ones we have or eliminate a useless card from the deck, all in specific places positioned between one battle and another in each mission. Furthermore, there are events, non-combat scenes with multiple options, which often allow us to obtain money, life or other bonuses, with results also based on luck. The events have a brief narrative introduction, but are often poorly contextualised: if we are exploring a prison why at some point do we find ourselves entering a hotel room or in the middle of the ocean to punch a shark? Overall, Fights in tight spaces does not particularly care about context and plot, which are only a summary justification for putting us on the field and making us fight. Each player will decide whether a narrative component is relevant in a rogue-lite game or not. Rogue-lite and difficulty levels The agent suplexes an enemy Speaking precisely of its being rogue-lite, Fights in tight spaces offers a classic advancement system. In each match, at the end of each fight, we will be rewarded based on our performance (number of enemies defeated, damage suffered, number of rounds required, secondary objectives completed...) with a score. When we have completed the game, winning or losing, the points will level up the character who will thus unlock new cards and new deck archetypes to choose from at the start of a new game. The points obtained are generous even on low difficulty so in a few games we will be able to unlock many new cards and the various decks. Even those who are less capable shouldn't be afraid of getting stuck and feeling like they're not achieving any results in the event of a defeat, it being understood that at some point you'll have to learn to fight well. Luckily, Fights in tight spaces offers multiple levels of difficulty which also allow you to undo mistakes and progress through the missions with a little more peace of mind. The lower levels allow you to start your turn over if you make a mistake. In case of defeat, it is also possible to simply repeat the battle from the beginning, also returning to the map to try to change the exploration direction and choose a different battle. Also, at low levels you are guaranteed a movement card every turn, so you can always get out of trouble. In essence, the game can also be played very calmly and without being punished. Obviously the opposite is possible, aiming for the maximum difficulty, without help of any kind, thus obtaining more experience points. This freedom of approach is not taken for granted in the rogue-lite genre, so we can't do anything but praise the development team. Visually everything is very flat, with few full colors and few details Finally, a quick comment on the graphics. Fights in tight spaces has a simple, minimal, even too much aesthetic. White environments with gray shadows and full color enemies tire quickly. It's great that there is a night mode, to make the environments dark, but overall on a visual level we could have worked to make everything more intriguing. The advantage of this graphic is that it is always very readable, even if we would have preferred to be able to rotate the camera freely, instead of being forced to choose between one of the four pre-set isometric viewing angles.", "date": "2021-12-09", "grade": "7.8"}
