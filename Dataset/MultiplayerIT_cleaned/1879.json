{"name": "Dragon Ball Z - Budokai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai.html", "text": "Who are you? Goku don't you know.. For those who know the TV series, we believe it is rather useless to lay out a plot, but since the Story Mode of this game faithfully retraces what happens in Toriyama's manga, two lines are mandatory for those who are not hardened otaku. No one knows who Son Goku actually is, a boy who is certainly very particular: very strong, invincible and with a very suspicious monkey tail ... Only after the arrival of the extraterrestrial Raditz, who proclaims himself his brother, many things will change in his life. life: in fact, he will discover that he is not an earthling, but an alien called Saiyan, one of the strongest people in our galaxy... The Saiyans have a great fighting nature, and do not hesitate to subjugate the peoples with whom they come into contact, but the Goku's noble soul, raised among humans, will push him to fight his own kind and beyond, in an attempt to protect the human race: on his way he will meet other extraterrestrials, such as the evil Freeza, and creatures sprung from such a brilliant mind how diabolical of terrestrial scientists, such as Doctor Gelo's Cyborgs... Until the final confrontation with Cell, the perfect cyborg, capable of annihilating anyone who tries to hinder his lust for destruction... Even if the main protagonist will be Son Goku , his friends will play a decisive role in the success of the story, starting with Gohan, son of Goku himself and potentially much stronger than his father. It's not just about saving the earth from enemies: Saiyan pride requires you to constantly improve yourself, to overcome your physical limits to reach the power that no opponent will ever be able to match. But you have to train hard to get stronger and stronger. Body Change! Turning on the PS2 and starting to play, what impresses most, especially comparing it with the previous PSX titles, is the incredible speed with which the matches take place, just as it was in the style of the cartoon, very adrenaline. Graphically the characters are well drawn and animated in a convincing way, they interact with each other in a realistic way and are equipped with a large number of moves, grips and combos. Unfortunately, the same attention to detail has not been used for the game stages, which instead appear as immense empty expanses, with few elements in the distance: definitely a step backwards compared to DBZ Legends, in which the elements of the backdrop such as rocks and mountains they interacted with the characters. Even the sound faithfully reproduces the TV series, complete with speech (subtitled in Italian) and sound effects coming directly from the Japanese edition of the cartoon, helping to increase player involvement. Having to be a game aimed at everyone, including geek children, the control system is deliberately very simple and immediate: three buttons for kicking, punching and parrying blows, to which is added a fourth that controls one's energy spiritual. With it you will be able to launch simple waves of energy, or by combining the keys all the special techniques of our favorites will be reproduced, including the transformation into Super Saiyan. Too bad, however, for the almost total lack of battles in the air at great heights, another feature of the previous DBZ titles that would have given even more variety to the encounters: there is no button to get up from the ground, only on some occasions, by throwing our opponent, we will be able to continue the fight suspended in the air, but only for a short time. As far as the gameplay is concerned, finally the Story Mode, which represents the backbone of this game, can finally be called such: in fact, retracing all the clashes present in Toriyama's work, from the arrival of Raditz to the clash with Cell, the adventure of Goku will not only be a one-on-one sequence as in the most classic of fighting games, but between one encounter and another in order to advance in the game we will have to perform certain actions, which will allow us to overcome the fundamental stages of the story. All seasoned with filmed interludes, made with the same graphics engine of the game, which underline the progress in the story. If we add to all this a lot of other game modes, able to unlock new characters, and with special abilities that are acquired gradually during the game, longevity is certainly ensured even in single player mode, not to mention the endless challenges in the VS. It's just a pity that the story ends with the Cell Game, thus missing all the last part of DragonBall, starting with the appearance of Majin-Bu, which will probably be implemented in a possible sequel. Definitely.. Those who loved Toriyama's work will find a faithful version of the cartoon in everything, from the characters to the voices of the voice actors, up to the different combat situations, while others may find it very funny, even if there is no shortage of fighting games on PS2. Not bad in every respect and very long-lived for those who want to master all the techniques available to the characters and discover all the hidden surprises. If before the DragonBall titles were aimed almost exclusively at fans of the animated series, this time Bandai has tried to make the product interesting in the eyes of all fighting game lovers, especially those who are not looking for realism at all costs. Pros: - Very fast and adrenaline - Easy to master and with many moves available - Very long-lived if you want to acquire all the special skills and secret characters Cons: - Rather slow loading - Game stage with meager backdrops - Some characters, supporting characters in the cartoon, not very interesting to use After appearing on practically every home system, DragonBall finally has a video game version for a latest generation console like PS2, which seeks to address not only those who loved the cartoon but all lovers of fighting games ... Bandai will be able to to forget the previous, as well as very questionable, games released for PSX years ago?", "date": "2002-12-12", "grade": null}
