To tell the truth, this title is above all an evolution of the concept already implemented by Tinytouchtales seven years ago with the first Card Crawl, which was also released in a period in which this type of mixed gameplay was not as widespread as it is now. The developers have recovered the graphic style, settings, atmospheres and part of the original mechanics to offer a more evolved and perfected version of the RPG card game, which is more refined in some respects but inevitably less fresh and original than the progenitor, given the many derivative elements directly from this.Despite the cordial and welcoming aspect, Card Crawl Adventure can easily disorient from the very first minutes: it is a game based on complex and rigorous mechanics, which requires the utmost attention from the player even simply to be understood, to then need further insights to be properly assimilated and mastered. From this point of view, even the terse tutorial can represent a challenge if it is not followed with due attention: there aren't many rules but the game situations emerge from a large number of variables, while the margin of error is minimal. For these reasons it is a game that requires a certain amount of attention and patience, which is rather rare in mobile titles but able to satisfy those looking for a higher level of challenge and a pastime capable of stimulating the strategic spirit properly. All of this is then presented in a humorous and charming style, which gives the strange game world a truly magical aura. A chained card game Card Crawl Adventure, some screenshots This is the typical case in which the technical description of the game can be cumbersome and difficult to understand compared to a direct test, in any case we try to give a general idea: Card Crawl Adventure is a card game structured as a sort of RPG dungeon crawlers, or maybe the other way around. The aim is to take down monsters, collect the loot, defeat the boss and reach the exit of the ~dungeon~, so to speak, but it's all done through a game of cards. There are also secondary objectives and other elements to take into consideration, but the basic meaning is to eliminate the monster cards from the table until you reach the boss, defeat him and exit the battle/dungeon, possibly conquering the treasure and getting the extra rewards. Each game takes place on different runs of cards, distributed starting from a common deck between the player and the opposing boss, with a constant shuffling that leads to a certain basic randomness. One of the main peculiarities of Card Crawl Adventure is the fact that it requires actions chained: the nine cards laid out on the table for each hand can only be selected through a path between adjacent figures. Each card touched requires a certain amount of strength points to be used, after which the health points are affected, so you have to be very careful to dose the moves and make the right decisions. Card Crawl Adventure, other images of the game There are attack cards that allow you to hit monsters on the field, or other types that concern defenses, collection of treasures or even interactions with NPCs: in fact, in drawing the selection path of the cards to be activated it is as if we were choosing to follow a path in an RPG dungeon and this correspondence shows how the game manages to be really a mix between a card game and a dungeon crawler role-playing game. The progression involves the progressive unlocking of new ~taverns~ which contain further quests and challenges, while weekly challenges, achievements and the ~Cursed~ mode add some variety to the action. Card Crawl Adventure is a rather generous free-to-play, but purchases may be necessary to avoid some frustration: being a roguelike, the classes and items unlocked are not permanent, but become so through microtransactions, which however they are never excessive in terms of required disbursements. For the rest, the graphic style adopted is the same seen previously in the Arnold Rauers signed productions and is therefore very pleasant and characterized, able to give a remarkable identity to the game even if everything is very close to what was previously seen by by the same authors.", "date": "2022-08-20", "grade": "7.8"}
