The beat 'em ups are not dead and we were able to see the practical demonstration recently with the pleasant surprise of a title of the caliber of Dragon's Crown. It is also right to remember that often the modern re-enactments of such masterpieces, from a not so distant past, have unfortunately passed into the hands of some software house that has exploited the brand to try to bring sagas back to life that perhaps it is better to leave to rest in the memory, rather than violating its name, read Double Dragon Neon or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled. Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds brings back fond memories for anyone who lived through the 80s and 90s In the guise of a high school student The robust roster of young warriors will allow you to play the ideal fighter to face the legions of enemies of the evil Phantom. The cartoonish style goes perfectly with the 8-bit sprites of the old cabinets; weapons range from classic swords, spears, claws and a pinch of magic that never hurts. The three types of basic attacks allow you to face monsters, some weaker to certain attacks than others, so as to keep the combat system minimally variable, although overall, you could press randomly to get the same result. In fact, the difference lies in the fact that the greater your ability to achieve combo attacks one after the other, the greater the loot and the loading of an energy bar that allows you to perform a super blow capable of wiping out anyone present on your screen. Of course you could settle for exploiting a part of the accumulated energy, without this having reached 100% to inflict minor damage on the forces of evil. The movement of the characters is two-dimensional, they will scroll along a horizontal line, even if by pressing a key it will still be possible to jump to a second level placed in the background. The amount of opponents on these two lines, between the first and second floors, will sometimes prevent you from understanding where you will be, as there will often be some beings that will block the view. In general, the difficulty level will not cause any kind of problem, if not perhaps just a minimum with the boss at the end of the scheme, but considering that your character will be able to benefit from an increase in level and his own attack statistics, it will be resolved with the first upgrades. The variety of enemies is excellent, a pity that, except for some specific patterns, it is more of an aesthetic element. The overall duration of the storyline is around two hours, but you can always decide to play the game in co-op or in arcade mode. The latter is a survival mode in which to start from start to finish, without interruptions, and try to complete the adventure without ever dying, in which case the statistics will be counted with your performance. At the end of the main story you can start the adventure again, perhaps at a higher difficulty level, even if, as I said above, the level of the challenge is medium-low, however varied and fun it is. Love bugs What you will find on Steam seems to be a direct port of the version released on the Xbox 360 marketplace. When loading the game, in fact, you are still asked not to turn off the console, not to mention that, although the keyboard is supported, from the options menu, among the commands, only the controller of the aforementioned Microsoft platform is visible. Venial sins, to which however must also be added a latency in the response times of keyboard actions, typical of a development optimized for pads. The layout of the commands on the keyboard is not the best, or at least you won't reach all the keys comfortably without taking your eyes off the screen. Despite this, we completed the title without the aid of the pad, with some swearing, also to understand to what extent it could castrate the experience and this was not the case, or at least not entirely.", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "8.0"}
