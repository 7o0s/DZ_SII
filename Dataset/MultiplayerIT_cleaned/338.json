Nintendo's idea is as simple as few: to offer a collection of 42 of the best-known games for its portable console, and to enhance the title with WiFiConnection support, allowing up to eight players to challenge each other online. Naturally a selection had to be made and, especially among the French card games, some games could be missing. But the most illustrious representatives are certainly present: classic poker, the Texas Hold'em variant (albeit with heavy limitations), Rummy, Black Jack, etc. There are also numerous table games, among which Chess, specifically afflicted by questionable AI even on the highest difficulty level. 42 Timeless Classics is the quintessential representative of hit and run fun Much better to experiment with your strategies against an online opponent. The presence of games that in the real counterpart would require a certain physical skill is also appreciable, such as bowling, darts, and an unfortunately bad variant of 9-ball. From the first start, the title is rather tidy and essential. The single player mode provides the possibility to start playing right away by choosing your favorite game; you establish how many opponents you want the CPU to control and, if the game foresees it, there is the possibility to set the level of difficulty and the rules according to your preferences. Of course, it is possible to consult the rules of each game, at any time and very quickly. In some cases the papyrus can be daunting to read, and it was perhaps preferable to include an interactive tutorial. In any case, it remains an indispensable option for lesser-known games, but also to refresh your memory with the more famous ones. If we wanted to express an opinion on the variety and quality of the game book offered, it would be positive overall. Alongside the sacred monsters mentioned above, the immortal Solitaire, MahJong and a bizarre but stimulating Fuga could not be missing. Of typically oriental origin, and perhaps less accessible, the curious Shogi and KoiKoi. Almost all games are well made; the use of the two screens proves to be very functional: with the touch-screen you interact with the game tables, while the upper screen is responsible for displaying the scores, the situation of the other players, statistics and so on. Even graphically, the title fully fulfills its main task, i.e. expository clarity and general cleanliness. In every situation and with every game, the sensation is that of a very rational management of the screen surface and the use of the stylus. Navigation between one menu and another is always very fast and not at all intricate; with a few clicks you switch from one game to another, open and close windows, play, restart. Everything happens extremely quickly and without waiting. Here are the 42 games: Simple Cards Donkey, Spit, Doubt, Fan Tan, Memory, Porco Intermediate Cards BlackJack, Peppa Tencia, President, Rummy, Straight Seven, Last Card, Last Card PlusCards Advanced 5-Card Draw, Texas Hold'em, Nap, Peppa, BridgeTable simple Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Dots and Boxes, Hasami Shogi, Othello, Connect 5, Naval Battle Advanced Table Backgammon, Chess, Shogi, Bellicum, Ludo Various Games Shake the Bottle, Dominoes, Koi Koi, Words and Balloons Action Games Bowling, Darts, 9-ball, Balance, Conquest For one player Solitaire, Escape, MahJong Also among the modes for one player, it is possible to play all the games in sequence, in the so-called ~Stamps~ mode; to move on to the next game it is necessary to score three points, and three are the points that are earned in case of success. But if you lose, you'll still be awarded a point, so there's no danger of getting stuck in a test where you're lackluster. The ~Missions~ mode closes the options for one player; are sort of scenarios that require you to make particular plays: 500 points in Black Jack, five consecutive strikes in Bowling, a perfect Rummy, etc. As regards the evaluation system, we point out the absence of a centralized score for all games. If you play poker, you start the game with 500 points and whoever has the most money at the end of all hands wins. This does not preclude the possibility of opportunistic behavior: whoever finds himself clearly in the lead a few hands from the end can keep the advantage by betting little or withdrawing from the hand. Serious, then, is the lack of any saving of one's own records. The most gluttonous mode of 42CST is undoubtedly the online multiplayer, especially playing with friends whose respective code you have. In this caseyou can create game rooms that other friends can join, even while the game is in progress. The one who opens the room has the power to choose the game and the rules. A fast and functional retractable chat window is active at all times, with which you can communicate with friends, undoubtedly creating more colorful and fun game sessions. In online matches against unknown opponents, the chat features are very limited, being reduced to a list of pre-selected phrases. And at the end of the game, the player can see which position he occupies in the world rankings. 42 Timeless Classics is the quintessential representative of hit and run fun, which gives its best played online against friends. In an instant, nostalgic rematches are organized in naval battles, ruthless round tables in Black Jack and Poker, tight challenges in Darts or Bowling, timeless chess games. Playing alone, the title loses part of its charm, the fault of an AI that can be criticized on several occasions. The incentive to outdo oneself also fades, given the impossibility of saving one's records. Nintendo offers a collection at a budget price which, albeit with various limitations, turns out to be rich and substantial, although it seems to focus more on quantity than quality. Pros Neat and functional 8 players online with integrated chat Eternal in multiplayer Budget price Against uncompetitive AI Some games are limited Cannot save records A long time ago, when video games didn't exist yet, there were other pastimes to spend a few hours of carefree fun. Board games, card games and logic games. Many of you will have spent entire summers playing it with friends. Someone else, younger, will have only heard of them, or at most will have played them inside a boyscout tent. Times change. But some games, despite having a centuries-old history behind them, always remain current. Played by millions of people all over the world. Universal to the point of becoming timeless classics.", "date": "2006-10-13", "grade": null}
