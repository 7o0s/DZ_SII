Appearing for the first time in Japan in 1997 and still being published, the comic created by Eiichiro Oda has given life to a rather popular anime also in Italy (where it was renamed, as unfortunately almost always happens, ~All'Arrembaggio !~) as well as a rich merchandising which obviously also includes video games, developed by the usual Namco Bandai. On PlayStation 2 we have so far been able to see nice mixes of action and exploration (One Piece: Round the Land, One Piece: Grand Battle and finally One Piece: Grand Adventure), particularly attractive for fans of the series. Now it's the Wii's turn with One Piece: Unlimited Cruise 1 - The Sunken Treasure, the first episode of a series that is gaining acclaim from the Japanese specialized press and which offers us a game structure that combines the inevitable fights with a more multifaceted and oriented towards the collection and transformation of objects. Treasure hunt! Engaged in the search for the legendary One Piece, an immense treasure found somewhere in the most treacherous seas of the planet (the so-called ~Rota Maggiore~), the crew of the Thousand Sunny suddenly finds itself facing a cataclysm of unspeakable proportions. Monkey D. Luffy comes into contact with what is probably an alien life form, which gives rise to a gigantic tree and some islands all around it from the waters. The mysterious creature wants to test the One Piece pirates, so he challenges them to find the fragments of a map that will lead them to a very special treasure. To succeed in this enterprise, Luffy and his companions, however, will have to face cunning and determined enemies, who in some cases will return from the past to take revenge for the defeat suffered. Everyone the crew members willingly accept to undergo the test (apart from Usopp, of course...), without knowing that a small being with magical powers will join them in this new adventure. Renamed ~Gabri~ due to the cries he makes, the character assumes fundamental importance in overcoming obstacles on each of the five islands of Unlimited Cruise. His mouth can transform objects into something else, so we'll have to feed him everything we find to unlock passages, open doors and create devices useful for our exploration. Certainly finding the necessary material will not be difficult: the islands on which we can land are very rich in objects to collect and discover, and our characters have rather large bags. Furthermore, as the game progresses, Usopp and Franky will build tools for us that allow us to visit otherwise inaccessible areas: pickaxes that break rocks, vacuum cleaners that eliminate poison in the air, etc. Violent punches The exploration and collection of objects are interspersed with a large number of fights, with the enemies becoming stronger and more resistant as we visit the various islands. In the game we control one character at a time, but in reality all the heroes of One Piece are at our disposal: Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Usopp, TonyTony Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook. We can switch from one to the other at any time by pressing the ~-~ button on the Wii-mote: this operation is especially necessary when we have to face the bosses, given that the energy bar at our disposal is quite short and just take a few hits to have the character ~frozen~ until we get back on board the Thousand Sunny. Under the energy bar we find the one relating to ~effort~, which is consumed when we make a quick sprint (pressing the C button twice) or when we dodge an attack (A and B buttons together), but it recharges in a few seconds. The view, unfortunately, cannot be managed directly and follows automatically the character in his movement, often creating intricate situations. It can be centered using the Z button, which is also used to ~lock-on~ the closest opponent, but the accuracy of this solution sometimes leaves something to be desired. The B trigger is responsible for jumping, while the attack maneuvers depend on the A button as well as combinations made by shaking the Wii-mote and pressing the C button. The more enemies you eliminate, the higher your character's level rises, such as happens in role-playing games, with the difference that new more powerful and spectacular moves are unlocked: Luffy, for example, at the beginning can only perform a sequence of punches and kicks, while as he levels up he becomes capable of grabbing enemies from afar, throw a flurry of punches, charge a roundhouse kick, or comporre a devastating combo. Finally, the ~+~ button opens a pause menu from which you can view the map as well as the events still to be completed on the island we are on, while button 1 activates the first person view. Alternate game modes One Piece: Unlimited Cruise 1 has a Versus mode which joins the main adventure, and which allows us to challenge the CPU or a second player using any of the available characters. The clashes take place in locations of your choice and follow the combat mechanics seen in the game, in truth very distant from the thickness of any match-based fighting game. Technical realization The first impact with Unlimited Cruise 1 is decidedly positive, especially thanks to colorful, detailed, well-animated polygonal models and characterized by a design that is very faithful to Oda's original. Luffy and his friends boast a spectacular rendering, which while not relying on the usual cel shading manages not to miss anything, including mouth animations. The problems are unfortunately highlighted when the graphics start to move: in the intentions of the developers everything was supposed to be very smooth, but in practice the drops in frame rate are very noticeable and frequent. Nothing that can alone bury the enthusiasm of the fans, who however will then find themselves dealing with an at least nebulous level design, with the usual graphic elements to represent the vegetation and a few ideas capable of giving a smile. The five islands to be explored boast different structures and colors, but in no case is there anything to cry out for a miracle. The excellent dialogues in Japanese are subtitled in Italian and whoever took care of their translation took care to find out about the names used for the series in Italy, practically making an ~average~ between what you read in the manga and what you see on TV. Music and effects aren't extraordinary, but they accompany the action in a decent way.", "date": "2009-07-06", "grade": "7.0"}
