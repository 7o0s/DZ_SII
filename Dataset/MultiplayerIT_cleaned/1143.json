{"name": "NBA Ballers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-ballers.html", "text": "Once familiar with the various commands available, many possibilities open up and they all find application when needed. The Olympic feat of the Italian national basketball team has probably brought many people closer to this sport, and I was the first to find myself following with some involvement matches that until now I had always considered unspectacular and rather repetitive. In the USA, of course, the problem does not arise and indeed videogame developers are looking for alternative ways to create out-of-the-ordinary basketball simulations. This is the case with NBA Ballers: we are faced with a game that doesn't show us basketball on the parquet floor, but street basketball in one-on-one battles (but also with three players at the same time, each for himself) where the goal the main thing is to humiliate your opponents and ~be cool~. Thanks to the active cooperation of several NBA stars, Midway was able to do a good job in every respect. The game NBA Ballers offers you the possibility to organize free one-on-one matches, challenge a friend or use a rather complete online mode. The true depth of the game, however, is contained in the ~TV Tournament~ and ~Rags to Riches~ options. In the first we will have to choose one of the twenty-five NBA players available and face a series of tournaments in sequence with the aim of unlocking other superstars, so as to bring their total number to sixty. Matches are generally won by reaching eleven points, but the matter does not end with scoring: the NBA Ballers control system, in fact, allows us to perform a large series of movements and makes the game decidedly strategic, especially when the opponents start to be really strong and smart. It is possible to make more or less elaborate feints, and to this is added a ~trick~ system which raises a special bar: once full, you can solve the encounter with a single shot. As already happens in the NBA Jam series, when players get excited they go into ~on fire~ mode and become more difficult to counter, at least as long as they keep scoring. Once familiar with the various commands available, many possibilities open up and they all find application when needed. The TV Tournament mode, however, often reserves surprises, in this case special rules that appear at the beginning of certain matches and which will force you to act in a certain way to achieve victory. For example, in some cases you will have to keep your opponent under five points, or fill the trick bar to win, or even face it against two players at the same time. Completing each tournament not only allows you to acquire a new player, but also gives you access to extra movies (whose appeal is directly proportional to your interest in basketball and its protagonists) and a sum of money that can be spent in various ways. ~Rags to Riches~, on the other hand, is the classic ~career mode~: create your player from scratch and try to win competitions to earn money and improve his characteristics. Midway has paid particular attention to the creation of this part of the game, with a truly precise editor and an ~intelligent~ improvement system, which increases the skills that find more effective use on the pitch. With all its substance, NBA Ballers is a candidate to be the game to have if you are passionate about basketball. Of course, this is not ~team~ basketball, but the matches are rich in strategy and there are many moves available. Furthermore, the respectable technical realization and the large number of enjoyable extras cannot be ignored. So, what are the defects of this product? Basically the mechanics of basketball have been reproduced well, even if you will not fail to feel frustrated in the defensive phases. But the most important thing, what can make the difference between considering NBA Ballers a masterpiece or a decent title, is your sympathy for the sport in question: if you like basketball and you know the world, then here's a must buy ; otherwise it would be a shame to only partially enjoy all that the game has to offer. Pros: Great graphics Lots of players, stages and extras Playable and varied Cons: Sometimes frustrating Slow loading If you don't like basketball Technical features The numbers of NBA Ballers are very respectable, starting from the total players available and passing through the numerous internships. The latter are extremely varied, ~picturesque~ and very well made, with a completely polygonal audience and with an above average level of detail. The real masterpiece of the developers, however, lies in the reproductionof NBA superstars: faithful to the real counterparts, both in appearance and behavior. This is a feature that the average Italian gamer only considers when football is involved, but you just need to stop and think for a moment to understand the enormous work behind this or that animation. To top it all off there is an equally rich sound sector (with a signed soundtrack) and a series of truly convincing extras. The version we tested did not have Italian subtitles, which we strongly hope will be added to fully enjoy the various videos. [C] The classic replay brings you the best action again. Here is a special rule. So funny. The players humiliate each other, between one basket and another... [/C]", "date": "2004-11-11", "grade": null}
