{"name": "Playboy Black Jack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/playboy-black-jack.html", "text": "Not much to be said for introducing a product like Playboy Black Jack. Qplaze has seen fit to use a renowned brand in the adult entertainment sector to create a black jack of which there are dozens, starting from a well-tested structure and adding photos of some girls who gradually lose their clothes... The game table is divided into three stations, which can be played together or not. At the top right we have the money at our disposal, which decreases as we bet. The bet is made when the first cards have already been dealt to us, and it is necessary to decide whether to take other cards (possibly doubling the stake), stay with the number reached or abandon the game by losing only half of the money committed. For the uninitiated, blackjack is nothing more than our dear old ~seven and a half~, with some very slight modifications and with the aim of reaching twenty-one. When we begin to reach certain figures, our opponent will ~sell~ us her clothes one by one, remaining naked when we win. On a technical level, this product does not reach particular quality levels, in relation to the genre it belongs to. The photos are clear and detailed, at least, but the graphical interface leaves something to be desired and even manages to be confusing... For the rest, we have a sound that clashes with some cell phones and a basic control system, that allows itself the luxury of not being timely in responding to inputs. PRO Maybe you like blackjack Surely you like beautiful girls Good photo quality AGAINST Absolute lack of originality Sound glitches on some terminals Technically mediocre", "date": "2007-09-10", "grade": "S.V."}
