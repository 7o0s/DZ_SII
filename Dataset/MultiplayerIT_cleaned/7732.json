Vacation from Inkubak Mario and Luigi's new adventure begins in an unexpected way, that is when the two, together with Princess Peach and all her court of Toads, are invited for a relaxing stay on the Guanciale island, receiving a warm welcome upon their arrival which does not portend anything dangerous. However, the ever vigilant Mario begins to get suspicious in the face of some oddities, such as the mysterious absence of the owner of the resort, Dr. Abbiocco, and the almost schizophrenic behavior of some of his collaborators: the fact is that, after some events that we leave the delighting the players to discover, the princess inevitably ends up being kidnapped, this time by the evil bat lord Inkubak who drags her with him into the Dream World. The key to solving the matter this time is in the good Luigi's possession, more precisely in his ability to fall into a deep sleep almost on command: sleeping on special stone pillows scattered around the Guanciale island, Luigi is able to open portals to the Dream World in which Mario can dive to look for clues about Peach's disappearance and at the same time to free the Guancialini, ancient inhabitants of the place imprisoned by an Inkubak spell. As can be seen, the plot of Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. is rather full of events and characters (among which we point out some illustrious returns such as that of Dorastella), while remaining very simple and light-hearted in its narration: the the result is the usual, very pleasant, development to which Nintendo has accustomed us, embellished with an Italian translation that is excellent as always, capable of maintaining unchanged - if not even highlighting - the brilliance of the dialogues. It must be said that the fluidity of the adventure, especially in the initial stages, is a bit weighed down by the excessive use of dialogues for their own sake and tutorial screens that can appear really redundant, especially to users already accustomed to the gameplay of the series. Traditionalist but with some novelties, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. is one of the best RPGs for 3DS In this regard, anyone who is even slightly familiar with the mechanics of the previous episodes will have no trouble orienting themselves in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros., but at the same time new users will be introduced in a comfortable and progressive way to understanding all the facets of the play structure: in the best Nintendo practice, the game proves to be a balanced mix between maintaining the tradition and introducing new game elements capable of differentiating this latest adventure from the previous ones. So here is that the foundations of the gameplay have remained substantially unchanged, for a product that starts from the premises of the classic RPGs of oriental origin to then add a touch of action and more dynamism. On the one hand there are therefore all the essential aspects of a member of the genre, such as the exploration of the environments, the dialogues with the characters, the presence of the inventory and the improvement of the statistics of the two protagonists by accumulating experience points; on the other hand there is an evident drive towards interaction with the scenario, given that the two plumbers start with the possibility of jumping freely and as the adventure continues they learn new techniques with which to face the environmental puzzles offered by the island Jowls. Things take a different turn in the Dream World, with the levels taking on a two-dimensional structure, stimulating Mario to brush up on his skills as a platform hero: a solution already tested in the previous Bowser's Inside Story, but which here is enriched with a strong contribution from Luigi. Since these sections are nothing more than a projection of the unconscious of the protagonist in the green jacket, he does not physically accompany his brother, but presents himself in a psychic form - appropriately called Oniriluigi - endowed with special powers. These translate first of all nn the interaction with the so-called Magiluigi mechanisms, i.e. the elements of the scenario with which Luigi can literally join to lend a hand to Mario and whose activation often requires the user to interact with the figure of the real sleeping Luigi that stands out on the touchscreen : here, therefore, that Oniriluigi can, for example, transform into a shrub whose fronds move by pulling the protagonist's mustache in the desired direction with his finger and can be used by Mario to reach otherwise inaccessible places. The Magiluigi mechanisms that are found in the adventure are different, and the pleasure of their discovery is perhaps even more satisfying than their use itself, which is usually resolved in environmental puzzles so simple as to become more of a routine than an element of gameplay really inspiring. The 3D effect With its mixture of two-dimensional characters and polygonal backdrops framed from above, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. will perhaps not go down in history as the most impressive showcase for the stereoscopic effect of the Nintendo console (so much so that by completely lowering the slider one certainly cannot say that much is lost), but it is undoubtedly noteworthy for the inventiveness of the developers aimed at exploiting the feeling of depth especially during fights: especially when performing special attacks or during the clashes with the bosses, there are numerous solutions adopted to divert the action towards the screen or away from it, with effects that may not be technically exceptional but always very pleasant and funny. One, a hundred, a thousand Luigis However, a self-respecting RPG is also made up of turn-based combat, and Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. obviously does not escape the rule, re-proposing the typical formula of the series with a few more touches of color. In their battles on the island of Guanciale, the two plumbers can hit enemies using their jump or hammer, perform a special attack that consumes Skill Points, or use an item in their inventory. With the exception of the latter, all the indicated actions require active control by the user, given that by pressing the indicated key at the right time it is possible to maximize the damage inflicted. Even when it is the opponent's turn, it is advisable to be on guard, given that a punctual pressure allows you to avoid blows or even to produce an effective counter-move, actions made less trivial by the fact that each enemy has a couple of types of attack , which, moreover, it performs with different timing and methods. As in the previous chapters of the series, the result is an always dynamic and fun combat system, but which this time takes on a new connotation in the Dream World: here we find ourselves facing real legions of enemies, however benefiting from the fact that Oniriluigi literally merges with Mario, enhancing his characteristics and improving his offensive capabilities. The blows landed in these situations take advantage of the psychic plumber's ability to split into multiple copies of himself, each of which will inflict extra damage to one of the opponents; in the same way, even the special attacks are modified, allowing the multitude of Dream Luigis on the screen to be exploited in decidedly original ways and cause great losses among the enemy ranks. All elements that contribute to making Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. a certainly rich and satisfying experience, also equipped with a truly enviable balance. Not only as regards the pace of the gameplay, well distributed between exploratory phases and more lively situations, but also and above all for an indulgent level of challenge with newcomers but which does not hesitate to satisfy the most hardcore players. In addition to the element of the duration of the adventure (which stands at 25-30 hours) increases exponentially if you go in search of all the secrets, a greater number of boss fights compared to previous episodes has urged the developers to insert a 'option that allows you to repeat a fight in facilitated conditions in the event of a game over. At the same time, finishing the game unlocks an extra mode thanks to which you can start the adventure again at a higher level of difficulty that promises to give even the most expert a hard time. In short, there is something for all tastes, even if trying to nitpick Nintendo could be accused of a certain lack of courage in exploiting the characteristics of 3DS, relegated to little more than a mere side dish. Beyond the stereoscopic effect described in the dedicated box, the gyroscope and the touchscreen itself are also intended for standard uses, without any acute details. Also as regards the prographic thread, the transition to polygonal backdrops is undoubtedly a pleasant novelty, which however has perhaps led to a slight loss of personality in them, which have become much more conventional than in the past. On the other hand, nothing to say about the excellent work done on the two-dimensional characters, cared for down to the smallest detail and equipped with incredibly fluid and varied animations. The developers' labor file also stands out in almost imperceptible details, such as in the jolts of the sleeping Luigi framed by the touchscreen, which reacts dynamically to the events of the Dream World taken from the main screen.", "date": "2013-07-12", "grade": "8.6"}
