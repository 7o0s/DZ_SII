Every day we heard the voices of Geron and Sadja asking us to come back to finish the story, and answering the call was a pleasure, without exception. Thanks above all to Kevin Mentz, who has spent his time well honing his writing skills one adventure after another. We challenge any multimillion-dollar production to churn out such an intense and wide-ranging adventure, with so many twists at the right point. Certainly the developers were good at fully exploring the universe of The Dark Eye (from us A look in the dark), the famous paper role-playing game which, with its infinite setting possibilities, provided quality raw material to the pen by Mentz. But what throbs between the Memory screens you won't find anywhere else. If you missed the first chapter, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, never mind, even if we advise you to start from there. You will appreciate more the scope of Geron's final choice and you will have made friends with him and Nuri, his beloved fairy, who has been affected by a spell in this sequel. In fact, Geron's task is to reverse the process and restore her to her original appearance before she loses her memory completely. And it will be precisely by remembering a very ancient story, now forgotten by everyone, that Geron will arrive at the solution of the riddle that imprisons Nuri. We will live all the main passages of this past story in the role of Princess Sadja, heroine of a world on the brink of a devastating war against demonic forces, obsessed with the desire to carry out a grandiose enterprise that survives her. But don't let yourself be enchanted: in this story, no character is just what it seems. And this is especially true for the supporting actors, finally much more than side characters, actors with a crucial role in the life of the protagonists. Like the talking bracket on Sadja's shoulders, or the apprentice Bryda, the most promising student of the magic academy that rises in the city of Geron. The force of fate weighs on them which, by putting them in front of crucial choices for their lives, will force them to play their part on the stage of history. But now enough talking, it's time to start remembering. Memoria is simply the wonderful new touchstone for point-and-click adventures Crossroads of existences The most interesting aspect of Memoria is the alternation of moments lived in the present, in the role of Geron, and in the past, under Sadja's commands. It's not just a change in point of view: the two stories offer very different scenarios, and each develops on its own conflicts and motivations. Even the tones of the story and the approach to solving the puzzles change according to the narrative line we are following. Furthermore, the passage from Geron to Sadja and vice versa takes place with almost perfect timing, and is never arbitrary. The two events are linked to each other, and every time we change the timeline there is a precise reason and an event from the past that has repercussions on the present. And then we are often left with an unanswered question or the character in danger, so that, Geron or Sadja, it makes no difference: the attention is still high. But above all, the echo of the titanic enterprise that involves them penetrates the player's soul, because Daedalic Entertainment has taken all the time necessary to let the plot breathe. One never gets the impression of a hasty and botched story, as too often happens in adventures. Even the ending, the weak point of many games, is a long swirl of events, with continuous reversals and relaunching, up to the last, fatal decision, which leaves you excited and satisfied. As far as the game system is concerned, the main difference between Geron and Sadja concerns the use of spells. The road of magic has been traveled before and now it's finally a solid element of the gameplay. If Geron, as already happened in the previous game, can break or repair small objects, Sadja for his part is capable of petrifying small living creatures, activating or deactivating magical devices and sending visions to a character whose personal object he possesses, with that system of associations dear to many recent adventures, one above all Cognition. Actually Geron also has a second spell this time, the ability to detect magical traces in the environment, a direct quote fromi The Night of the Rabbit, the previous adventure of Daedalic Entertainment. The use of magic is very well integrated into the natural flow of puzzles and, in addition to increasing the variety of situations, it makes the fantasy setting of Memoria even more likely. What struck us however, and which helps to make this game a touchstone for contemporary point and click, is the thoughtful introduction of all the innovations that have refreshed the genre in recent years. There will therefore always be objects to click and combine, but also labyrinths, puzzles that are based on dialogues or on the ability to put sentences in the right sequence, and collaboration with a second character present on the scene, for example Nuri, as well as other interesting variants of the classic model. It should be noted that the developers have devised systems to prevent the player from relying on chance to solve puzzles based on the choice of answers, and the elegance with which they have overcome this problem emerges in particular in the final bars. In another case, however, the result was an arbitrary solution of the riddle among the many possible ones, but in any case nothing painful. On the difficulty instead take our opinion as subjective. Usually the adventures of Daedalic Entertainment make us sweat, and in the past we have more than once got stuck in gloomy despair. In this case the puzzles slipped away one after another without ever being trivial. The logic behind the puzzles was always clear, so solving them was a pleasure. Don't expect strokes of genius, they are almost always the same situations that have been repeated in these games for years, but the way in which the puzzles are linked to the surrounding environment and keep the story going stimulates the enthusiasm of even the most seasoned player. Having said that, it is perfectly fine for the less experienced to find themselves in difficulty and some experienced adventurers find them difficult anyway. Our mind is unpredictable. And speaking of the mind, the time has now come to talk about memories and the power they have to rewrite an entire life. For eternal memory The quality of the details is remarkable and is also appreciated in the possibility of replaying some sections of the adventure to try different answers, especially to the final question that fate will ask Geron. In particular the ability to scroll through inventory items with the mouse wheel, making them appear one after the other on the pointer, is a welcome touch that allows us to keep the inventory off-screen as much as possible, thus increasing the immersion in history. For such a long game, eight chapters and ten hours of play at least, the constancy with which the production is maintained at excellent levels is commendable, but the artistic impact still suffers from some awkward lack of proportion or from the quality backgrounds fluctuating: some are magnificent, evocative and full of details, others seem to be the result of a still incomplete work. The artists of the German team insist with the pictorial style also applied to some secondary characters, but the animations just mentioned make them look like caricatures of talking paintings. Thankfully there is so much content that even the unhappy passages quickly slip away. We then noticed some inconsistencies in the speech, although rare, but overall the level of the English dubbing seemed good both in acting and in content. However, consider that the game was born in German, so we can't tell you anything else about the quality of the adaptation. Beyond the technical delicacies, Memoria hides themes of considerable importance under the dreamlike lightness of its magical world. We talk about what remains of our lives if no one is able to remember them and above all how these are never immutable over time, despite our actions being real. In fact, memories, which incessantly distort and rewrite even our ongoing lives, can work magic, for better or for worse, with the lives of those who are no longer there. And maybe give them a second chance.", "date": "2013-09-19", "grade": "8.6"}
