For more intimate details on the prehistoric first-person action adventure signed by Ubisoft Montreal, we refer you to the above article; in fact, here we will limit ourselves to explaining in detail the technical peculiarities of this specific iteration. While it's smoother and more visually appealing, Far Cry Primal for PC doesn't outperform the console versions Bittersweet debut Before diving into the technical analysis of the work, it is necessary to underline an important detail: during our tests we did not experience the infamous ~88500014~ error, which, according to information leaked on the net, is preventing a portion of players from normal use of the title with a block on startup. Specific data on diffusion at the moment there are none, however a part of the negative reviews published on Steam (about six hundred out of a total of sixteen hundred) are linked precisely to this error code, which has become a bogeyman in the gaming communities. In the past few hours the news has even circulated of a phantom refund from Ubisoft for anyone who does not want to wait for the release of a corrective patch (in addition to the approximately 900 MB one released on March 1st) and a free game on Uplay for more patients, however it turned out to be completely groundless and was denied by the French giant. We remain at the window waiting to understand what is triggered by the aforementioned error code and above all for a patch that definitively solves the problem. After closing the necessary parenthesis, let's go back to our analysis of the title, which occupies about three GB more on the hard disk than the console version, or sixteen against thirteen. At the completion of a third of the download it is still possible to start playing with the now famous prologue dedicated to the mammoth hunt, which culminates with the first encounter with the harvester Sayla and the arrival of the protagonist Takkar in the fascinating Land of Oros. In the main menu we immediately noticed a curious difference in the basic settings with those of the PlayStation 4 version: if on the Japanese flagship the brightness adjustment is facilitated by the traditional logo to be made ~almost invisible~ on a black background, on the PC it must be done reference to the simple image of a birch forest to be set with a marker. Although less intuitive, this solution is accompanied by a couple of additional items, namely the adjustment of gamma and contrast. As for the advanced graphics settings, net of a good scalability, they still offer a package of choices that are only discreet, without including cutting-edge solutions (such as Nvidia's HBAO+ ambient occlusion) or particularly in-depth anti-aliasing filters. We will come back to it in the next paragraph. These limits are reflected in the overall rendering of the image, which although it is much cleaner and more defined than that of the PlayStation 4 iteration, differs significantly only for the fluidity given by the sixty frames per second. In a nutshell, we are faced with the classic console porting embellished with a simple finishing job. It is sufficient to carefully observe the volumetric effects and the wealth of details of the vegetation to realize this; despite being sharper, in fact, they are completely superimposable on the (excellent) result obtained by the Ubisoft graphics on the Sony flagship. If with Far Cry 4 the technical gap between the two versions was substantial, in this spin-off it is much thinner, and is probably the result of the shorter development time compared to that dedicated to the chapter set in the fictitious Kyrat. Few but good Texture quality is usually one of the most important and effective parameters to adjust in PC titles, however in Far Cry Primal there are only two values, namely Normal and High. Waiting for the potential release of a package suitable for higher resolutions, at the moment we have to settle for a fluctuating result and only slightly higher than what is already appreciated on the console: approaching a rock, climbing a wall or observing the details of the bark of the trees, it results in fact the ~coarse grain~ of many surfaces is evident. However, the greater cleanliness of the image enhances numerous details, among which the prehistoric clothing of the characters stands out (especially during the cutscenes), the hairy mantle of theanimals and the yield of fabrics and materials, such as those that wrap the bags of resources hanging from trees. In this regard, on PC we would have expected greater care of the physics applied to the rope that keeps them suspended: unfortunately, by hitting it with an arrow it ~explodes~ with an effect that is anything but realistic and gratifying. As for the shadows, it is possible to adjust them from Low to Ultra, with the maximum setting capable of giving body above all to the fascinating primordial vegetation. However, good results are also obtained with lower values. The only other advanced graphic item to be set to Ultra is the one relating to the so-called ~Geometries~, i.e. the polygonal complexity of the game world; also in this case the detachment with the PlayStation 4 version is not so clear, although being able to count on a greater refinement of some three-dimensional models, such as those of the weapons equipped by Takkar. Among the other graphic options we find the Post FX, the volumetric fog, the quality of the ground, water and the environment, which at maximum detail are practically superimposable on the result obtained on the console: the excellent particle and volumetric effects (in particular such as those related to fire, a real flagship for the Far Cry saga) and the rendering of the bodies of water make the three main biomes reproduced in the Land of Oros (Arctic tundra, swamp and boreal forest) a real feast for the eyes. As specified in the previous paragraph, the options for the anti-aliasing filter are quite limited; in addition to the inevitable FXAA we find only SMAA (Sub-pixel morphological anti-aliasing), a technique developed in 2011 by Crytek that works quite admirably, but which on Far Cry Primal does not allow you to adjust the mask value (2x or 4x ). Fortunately, the ladders are very little noticeable and you can avoid intervening from the video card panel. The motion blur, the distance of the field of view (default set to 75) and the V-sync mode, which can be normal or limited, close the graphic settings picture. The greater sharpness of the PC version does not only involve advantages, but also the emergence of some (small) defects related to the porting; among them are the radar map in the lower left a bit grainy and some details that underline the polygonal nature of the models, such as the cut of Syala's eyes. The price of fluency With our test configuration, which you find indicated in the box above, at maximum detail Far Cry Primal behaves quite admirably, with an average fluidity of 57 frames per second detected by the Benchmark in the options menu. Curiously we obtained the same result both with the 361.91 driver and with the 362.00 from Nvidia, the latter linked to the ~Game Ready~ line and released at the same time as the launch of Far Cry Primal, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and the latest update of Dying Light, just to improve its performance. The drops below sixty frames per second are however sporadic and in the most critical moments we have always remained around fifty: one of the most demanding sequences for our system we experienced during the ~Beast Vision~ mission, approaching the polygonal model illuminated by the spirit of the eagle owl. For those with a less performing configuration, the title is still flexible and it is possible to lower the value of some parameters and filters, obtaining good results without sacrificing too much visual performance, a symptom of the good basic work done with the Dunia Engine. We close our overview of this specific version of the game with a mention of mouse and keyboard commands. Unlike the pad, unfortunately, with these devices it is not possible to reverse the view in flight to control the owl; this creates some headaches if you are used to the reverse mode, especially in the aforementioned Beast Vision mission. However, the controls are fully customizable and the default key layout generally mirrors that of previous Far Cry and other first-person shooters. The DualShock 4 touchpad, through which the map and other submenus are accessed by pressing L1 and R1, is replaced by specific keys on the keyboard, such as M for the map, I for the inventory and K for Takkar's skills.", "date": "2016-03-03", "grade": "8.2"}
