This is essentially the strong point of Warped Kart Racers, which in the total imitation of the reference model, in an almost ostentatious way, finds its justification in trying to answer an inevitable question. There's always a desire for Mario Kart, as we said, and so even a clear, slightly rough imitation can be welcomed positively. The classic license on which to base everything is not missing either: according to a sort of unwritten rule, the kart racer must often be based on characters belonging to videogame or animated series, who somehow find themselves fighting on board vehicles in this new context as in a sort of alternate reality. In this case we are dealing with a cross-over of various licenses that bring together the characters of Family Guy (~Griffin~ in Italy), American Dad, King of the Hill and Solar Opposites. The impression is a bit strange, but the charisma of the characters is all there and it is well reproduced, even if obviously we are far from the satirical and scathing humor to which the respective series have accustomed us. In any case, the climate is spot on and, all in all, the chosen characters adapt really well to this strange world of karts, crazy weapons and bizarre tracks. A full-blown racing kart Warped Kart Racers, a screenshot of the game It must be said that Warped Kart Racers doesn't really do anything to try to hide its being fundamentally derivative, on the contrary it almost seems that it wants to make it as clear as possible. The structure of the game is that of Mario Kart that has been codified for years, but some quotations are so direct as to amaze: among the power-ups there are turtle shells, for example, and the customization system includes precisely the same elements seen in Mario Kart 8 and Deluxe, including the ~gliders~ for gliding in the flight sections. The gameplay is therefore precisely what is expected of this type of game, complete with a distinction in the two standard modes of the Nintendo series: racing and battle. Warped Kart Racers character select screen In the first case it is about finishing first on various tracks, combining driving skills with the ability to use attack and defensive power-ups in the most strategic way possible, while the second mode places us inside an arena and focuses on physically eliminating opponents with the use of weapons. In both cases, the best use is certainly in multiplayer, also available here online for up to 8 players, but given the amount of elements to unlock, the single ~campaign~ also represents a rich proposition. The control system is also positive, which offers the infamous virtual stick via touch screen but which behaves surprisingly well. they are used to it. In particular, the arcade driving model can certainly be improved, but it is above all the track design that is not often among the most inspired, with some interesting paths and others absolutely anonymous. If nothing else, the use of characters and settings taken from the animated series in question manages to give the game a certain charisma and fans of Family Guy, American Dan or King of the Hill will surely find bread for their teeth, between crazy situations and various quotes. Warped Kart Racers, an example of vehicle customization From this point of view, the remarkable level of customization also helps to immerse us in the spirit of the series, given that alternative clothes and accessories also recall typical episodes and situations with decidedly hilarious effects. Furthermore, the fact that the game is distributed through Apple Arcade totally eliminates any possible problem deriving from microtransactions or progression-related traps, given that in fact it is a ~premium~ title in all respects.", "date": "2022-05-27", "grade": "7.2"}
