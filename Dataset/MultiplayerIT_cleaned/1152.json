{"name": "Leisure Suite Larry: Magna Cum Laudae Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/leisure-suite-larry-magna-cum-laudae-recensione.html", "text": "conquer all available girls and consecrate our rise to Playboy status A world of stereotypes Magna Cum laude is a simple game with an equally simple and clear premise: conquer all the girls available and consecrate our rise to Playboy status by participating in Swingles, a television game show where two contenders vie for the interests of a third. But here the problems arise because we find ourselves in the role of Larry Lovage who, unlike the famous Uncle, is not brilliant and has not developed a bubbly personality to balance his deformities. Indeed, the unarmed protagonist embodies the worst stereotype for those who dream of being a conqueror: the college nerd. If nothing else it's in the right place. The setting of Magna Cum Laude starts from a college up to the surrounding neighborhoods full of 80's college movie characters and others even more excessive we will have to exploit the peculiarities of these caricatured stereotypes to achieve our goals. We will meet everything, starting from the alcoholic Vietnam veteran, passing through a 70s pimp in a purple suit, to arrive at a large group of daughters who came out of the worst nightmares of a sexual behaviorist. Leisure Suit Story Back in 1987, with the graphic adventure genre in full swing, Al Lowe turned to Sierra, queen of point-and-click adventures with the famous Quest series, to give life to the first saga dedicated to adult humor: Leisure Suit Larry. As expected, Larry Laffer became a cult character embodying the B-series playboy, capable of exploiting women's weaknesses despite a ridiculous physique towered over by a record bigwig. With these premises and with the uniqueness of the series, Larry spun boldly maintaining the sacred premises and skipping even the obstacle of three dimensions. Thus his positive series continued even in 1996, surpassing Lucasarts stopped in 1995 with The Dig and launched towards 3D with Grim Fandango. And it is here that the abandonment of the scenes of Al Lowe and the misadventures of Sierra, with Leisure Suit Larry 8 in full development, have also stopped the last of the two-dimensional heroes. Leisure Suit Larry thus arrives in the hands of High Voltage who wisely decide not to re-propose a simple point and click adventure and to even change the main character. Larry Laffer, despite a small cameo in Magna Cum Laude, remains inviolate, leaving the task of conquering the female gender to the simpleton Larry Lovage, the nephew of low hopes who carries the inevitable big head of the family on his shoulders.

Through Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude Getting around in Magna Cum laude means scampering through clearings looking for NPCs, and interacting with the map is limited to looking for money and tokens hidden in the most unlikely of places. Everything else is made up of dialogues and mini-games the most important of which appears during the dialogue sessions and represents the exclusive heart of the game. Once we have attracted the attention of a girl we will, in fact, have the possibility of displaying an impressive series of absurdities in an attempt to catch her Through Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude Once we have attracted the attention of a girl, in fact, we will have the possibility of displaying an impressive series of absurdities in an attempt to catch her or at least interest her in us. A bold sperm engaged in a uterine slalom will be our only tool to guide the dialogue towards happy outcomes, making it reach smiling faces. Each mistake will lead to a wrong sentence, an insult or a gross gaffe that will irritate our prey, as well as generating dialogues that are sometimes spot on and funny, sometimes absurd and unnecessarily vulgar. To earn money we will have to play Tapper, the old game of the bartender engaged in throwing beers at a gang of angry customers, who will present himself to us in a thousand different guises but with the same playability as 23 years ago and to gain fame we will have to deal with a simplistic dance game where we will have to repeat the opponent's moves by performing combinations of keys. Every other activity will be linked to a mini-game, from Wack-a-pole, or a sort of solitary pong with a sexual metaphor included, to target shooting which in Magna Cum laude takes the form of shooting a glass with a coin also known such as quarters. In addition we will have the possibility to take and sell interesting photographs which will generate a couple of additional mini-games. There are also two further elements represented by self-confidence and the degree of drunkenness. The Pthe first affects our social relationships while the second slows down our reflexes and, consequently, increases the difficulty of the minigames, but both factors act in a mostly mechanical way without adding anything to the game structure and without changing Larry's behavior during the dialogues. The eye wants its part Aesthetically, the new Leisure Suit Larry is well below average despite an attempt at characterization in the look and movements of the characters. Animations appear in fact, they are sufficiently cared for and enjoy a certain variety which raises the technical content of Magna Cum Laude. Nonetheless, the beauties sketched in three dimensions, complete with squared breasts and posteriors, do not help to identify with the situation considering that we are talking about a game that loves to linger on erotic details and gags made with the game engine. Furthermore, the settings are almost always devoid of characterization or details, perhaps excluding some better designed interiors such as the girls' rooms and the one inhabited by Larry Lovage. Overall, in short, we are faced with an insufficient result, all the more taking into consideration the importance of the aesthetic factor in a graphic adventure which, as we have said, is largely based on the friendly performances of the fairer sex. Comment Leisure Suit Magna Cum Laude is a title characterized by continuous ups and downs, both in the characterization of the characters and in that of the situations. The same sensation is felt in the dialogues which sometimes achieve the purpose of entertaining and sometimes are simple backgrounds to the mini-game of the rampant sperm. Yet, as long as you like rough and grotesque comedy, endure hours of sometimes frustrating retrogaming and neglect the graphic aspect, the amount of dialogue and some gags may prove to be sufficient to satisfy some palates and give this new Larry a reason to exist. Pros: 90,000 words of dialogue some funny gags and some spot on sexual stereotypes Cons: terribly simplistic graphically subdued dialogues with girls are short-lived old mini-games are too long", "date": "2004-11-06", "grade": null}
