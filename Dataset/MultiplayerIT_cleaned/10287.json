Just in time for the end-of-year holidays, however, the second chapter of the EA series also made its debut on the App Store, the Shift that was positively received some time ago in its home console version. Towards the finish line If, as already mentioned, Undercover focused more on the accessibility and immediacy of a spectacular but shallow gameplay, on the contrary in Need for Speed: Shift the programmers have chosen to shift the focus slightly more towards simulation. Where the Electronic Arts product is undoubtedly good is in the single player structure, organized with an increasingly demanding career through the 28 events that take place on the 18 available tracks, in turn set in cities such as Chicago, London and Tokyo. We feel we can move a note in this sense regarding the choice to divide the career mode precisely according to the location (except in the last section), forcing you to do 7 races in a row in a single city before moving on to the next; on the contrary, a mix would have helped to increase the visual variety race after race. However, this is obviously a decidedly venial defect. As per tradition, however, there is a fairly deep section dedicated to tuning the performance and aesthetics of one's car, on which to act with dollar blows to improve the characteristics and have easier life on the track; it should be emphasized that the car fleet is made up of real cars, to be purchased within a range of 20 of the most beautiful supercars available on the market. But beyond these all in all side elements and which in any case have often and willingly been an integral part of the ~baggage~ of EA productions, it is in the actual gameplay that Need for Speed: Shift tries to play its cards, succeeding yes to convince but not to excite. First of all, the decision to offer different types of competitions, such as Drift, head-to-head or time trial races, effectively relegates the complete grid challenges to a few occasions. A pity, since it is precisely in the competition with other cars based on doors and overtaking that the game reaches its best moments. Secondly, we weren't totally convinced by the driving model adopted, a sort of middle ground between simulation and somewhat insipid arcade. For example, it is essential to brake during the most demanding bends in order not to end up against the guard rails, yet even the sharpest nailing does not affect the trim of your racing car even if done at 150 km/h and with the steering wheel turned. And even drifting makes little sense in the economy of the race when it proves to be decidedly less effective than simple braking, through which it is possible to get out of corners faster and faster. Consequently the drift is thus confined only to the competitions of this specialty, which among other things are also the least pleasant of the entire lot. Finally, sorry for the presence of a multiplayer mode only locally; online support would certainly have helped to exponentially increase the longevity of the product, even in the face of a decidedly high price of 7.99 euros for the App Store fees. Very little to criticize instead as regards the technical component, above all thanks to one of the best graphics on the iPhone that suffers only from some uncertainty of the frame rate.
