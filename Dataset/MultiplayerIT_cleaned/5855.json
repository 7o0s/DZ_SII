We will spare you the usual introduction with historical hints, so if you are reading this review - and you have read our previous review - you probably already know that, despite the title being practically identical, this new production signed by Monolith Soft does not connect in any way to the previous one, nor to the other ~Xenos~ released on PlayStation and PlayStation 2 many years ago. What you may not know is that Xenoblade Chronicles X is not a JRPG, so if you thought you were facing it as such you are making a huge mistake. That's just the wrong spirit in which to hold the GamePad. Xenoblade Chronicles X is, more than anything else, a free roaming in the style of The Witcher 3, to name a recent video game. In a certain sense, this was Monolith Soft and Nintendo's biggest bet: to offer a real blockbuster on the most underrated console of the last generation, a title of incredible complexity designed above all for a niche of tenacious and enterprising players. In this review we will not explain every mechanic or feature of the game: it would be impossible, and there would not be enough space to do it. Instead, we will examine the key points, trying to explain what we liked and what we didn't like in the more than seventy hours we spent exploring the wonderful world of Mira. Rest assured: Xenoblade Chronicles X is exactly the unforgettable experience you expected It's only the beginning? Xenoblade Chronicles X has been out in Japan for six months and in the meantime they have heard of raw and crushed on its plot. The most widespread opinion among players of the Japanese version was that the story missed the signature of Tetsuya Takahashi, the historic screenwriter of Xenogears, the XenoSaga trilogy and the previous Xenoblade Chronicles obsessed with religious themes, philosophy and biblical mythology . Takahashi, as director, obviously had a lot of influence on the plot of Xenoblade Chronicles X, but the distances that the new Monolith Soft title takes from the previous Xenos are of a different nature: there is a desire to tell something new and different from the usual . Here, therefore, that the plot almost completely abandons any fantasy or mystical element to remain strongly anchored to science fiction between space battles, aliens and pseudo-scientific explanations. There is also room for a reflection on the nature of the human species, but the twelve chapters into which the main storyline is divided rarely linger in abstruse spiritual digressions. Elma, the beautiful BLADE who awakens us from cryogenic sleep, is less of a protagonist than the promotional films let us understand: since our alter-ego is mute, and limits himself to reflecting our decisions when the dialogues allow us, Elma represents the connection point between the player/spectator and the events that unfold on the screen. There aren't really any protagonists in Xenoblade Chronicles X. The large cast of supporting characters - among which the ingenious Lin, the mysterious Lao and the irresistible nopon Tatsu certainly stand out - is explored through the missions of understanding, more or less optional sidequests that tell us about the relationships between the characters and various much less obvious background than the not exactly memorable features of their protagonists might suggest. We said ~more or less optional~ because the main missions always have prerequisites to be met: sometimes you have to complete certain missions in agreement, more often you need to have discovered a certain percentage of the map. Given the nature of the game, between one chapter and another you can spend several hours exploring and completing secondary tasks, which greatly affects the pace of a compelling but, all in all, quite short main storyline. Keep in mind that the ending of Xenoblade Chronicles X is not completely resolved: the game is a perfect self-contained stand-alone, but the various chapters raise puzzles and mysteries that cannot be solved before the epilogue. Why do so many alien species seem destined to reach Mira? Why are the Ganglions so keen on destroying human beings? Who built the immense structures around the planet? Questions that remain unanswered in what actually appears to be the launch pad for a new, very promising franchise. The GamePad In addition to some minor information - such as the status of the Internet connection or the availability of a new main mission - the Wii U joypad/tablet reproduces the FrontierNav interface on its small screen, practically an interactive map of the planet Mira and New Los Angeles.The map can be displayed in three different ways, and the main one divides it into small hexagons each characterized by a goal which, once achieved, unlocks the percentage of completion. The interface also allows you to view the position of the objectives during certain missions, and to teleport from one point of interest to another simply by touching the hexagon in question. Through the map it is also possible to manage the probes, modifying their technology to alter the extraction of miranium and the collection of materials, as a kind of game within the game. Of course it is also possible to play directly on the GamePad without looking at the TV screen, but it is not advisable except for short periods of time, since the shrunken texts are extremely difficult to read. Not to mention that you have to call up the FrontierNav map as if it were a separate menu every time you need it, which happens very often. The real star Needless to go around it, the real protagonist of Xenoblade Chronicles X is the planet Mira. The videos released in recent months don't really do justice to the feeling of taking the first steps into the new world that Monolith Soft has so painstakingly shaped for us. We haven't counted the kilometers and we can't tell you if it's true that the explorable area is more or less extensive than those in competing video games, but we can confirm that the planet Mira is certainly one of the largest, most fascinating and most impressive settings ever created in this medium. The magic isn't in the gigantic creatures that graze the green fields of Primordia, nor in the alien monsters that blend in with the bushes and rocks of Oblivia. It's not in the colossal Noctilium Falls or the towering buildings that dot Sylvanium or Cauldros. And the computing power of Wii U, always underestimated and squeezed here to the last bit, despite the washed-out textures, aliasing and 720p resolution, has something to do with it. The miracle, those of Monolith Soft, did it with the details: the stratified day/night cycle, the various completely random atmospheric effects, the electric discharges that tingle on the sand during storms, the aurora borealis that paints the night sky, the rainbows that cross it in the morning after a heavy rain. Because rain and wind vary in intensity regardless of region; because certain creatures come out of their burrows only at certain hours of the day and the same goes for the inhabitants of Neo Los Angeles, as is normal; because the bigger aliens don't even calculate us when we're on foot but they start to get impatient if we approach them on board our mechs, the Skells. The ecosystem designed by Monolith Soft is of astonishing complexity, but it only works because the planet that hosts it is not a pile of randomly arranged polygonal rocks. The player who explores Mira must think three-dimensionally, because the simple exploration is already gameplay in itself. It is no coincidence that the force of gravity allows us to make inhuman jumps: Xenoblade Chronicles X is also a bit of a platformer. To place the probes - essential for drawing profits and resources from the planet and discovering the map - you have to jump like Super Mario from one hill to another, you have to swim across immense lakes, enter labyrinthine caves, climb over the mountains and perhaps flutter edge of a Skell. Mira is almost entirely explorable right away: level 50 enemies roam among level 10 enemies, for example, but there's nothing to fear, as all you need is a little caution and maybe an ounce of cheek to get around any monster and go as far as our curiosity wants. Should we end up in the field of view of a gigantic ape without being able to escape in time, Xenoblade Chronicles X sends us directly to the nearest checkpoint: we can save at any time and there is no Game Over, nor when we lose against an enemy in which we came across by accident, nor when it gives us too much trouble a mandatory story boss. In the latter case, the game even offers to temporarily lower the difficulty to accommodate us, and this is because Xenoblade Chronicles X is difficult, complicated but never, ever sadistic. Chaos Theory The combat system is perhaps the only true point of contact between the two Xenoblades: anyone who has played the first Xenoblade Chronicles will immediately feel at home since, apart from some differences, the basics have remained unchanged. Therefore, that mix of action and reload times remains that made purists turn up their noses and enchanted those looking for something different, but not too much, in the ~usual Japanese RPGs~. More like that of the old MMORPGsheart, the combat system of Xenoblade Chronicles X takes some time to get going, but it gives enormous satisfaction, especially once you learn how to juggle the various members of the group by giving them the right orders at the right time. Each character belongs to a ~class~ that characterizes their equipment, skills and role in battle. Elma, for example, wields a pair of short swords and two machine guns: her job is to inflict as much damage as possible in battle. Little Lin, for her part, combines a machine gun and a mighty shield to distract the enemy and take his shots instead of the other three team members. Our avatar is instead a kind of joker: starting from a single class, various subclasses branch out that insist on very specific arsenals, roles and tasks, for a total of six classes differentiated by weapons, techniques and passive skills. It's up to the player to choose which class to face the next fight with, since you can change your mind at any time: in short, the only limit is the experience points needed to unlock the various skills. One thing is certain, and that is that there are no healers in Xenoblade Chronicles X. Characters are healed thanks to Warrior Shouts, the ~quick time event~ mechanic that prompts the player to press the B button when certain conditions are met: successfully passed the so-called ~test of the soul~, you gain life points and various benefits, not to mention that the techniques of the same color as the Scream are temporarily enhanced. Even the Shouts are fully customizable: in the appropriate menu, we can choose which benefits to obtain depending on the conditions met. As if that weren't enough, in case it wasn't clear that the combat system is much more complex than it might seem during the first few minutes of the game, other mechanics take over over time such as the tension indicator, the morale indicator, the Turbo and the points weak than enemies. To all this is added the ingenious possibility of hooking on very specific points of the target, in pure Monster Hunter style: each part of the enemy's body has its own vital indicator and, once destroyed, not only increases the chances of obtaining loot rarer, but also debilitates the current monster. By cutting off the tail of an alien lizard, for example, we will prevent it from using it to attack us, and by destroying the armor of an overgrown turtle we will inflict more damage for the rest of the battle. In short, the combat system of Xenoblade Chronicles X is incredibly multifaceted, and it takes quite a few hours to become familiar with all the various parameters: we are not even touching the loot boxes, the random statistics, the enhancers and even the different weapon manufacturers that we can level up to broaden their offerings. To all this chaos are added, of course, the Skells. The anthropomorphic mechs undoubtedly represent one of the most fascinating factors of Xenoblade Chronicles X, but on the other hand it must be said that we have overrated them a bit. Customizing them is fun, mind you: there are dozens and dozens of frames, weapons, components and options, and in the barracks it is even possible to repaint them at will. Unlocking the Skells is not an easy task, given that you have to reach a fairly advanced stage of the game, but once you get on board our transformable mech, the way you approach Mira practically changes. The places that previously seemed unreachable suddenly are no longer so, especially after having equipped the module to fly, and the imposing tonnages of certain enemies no longer scare as before: the bonuses offered by the Skells allow you to face them and stand up to them, but the combat system does not change that much, except for some new mechanics such as the stasis field and the view from inside the cabin, and initially the damage inflicted on board a Skell may appear even lower than what we would inflict on foot . It's just another facet of Xenoblade Chronicles X that needs to be practiced, but some aspects definitely detracted from our enthusiasm. Fuel is the least of the worries, as it auto-replenishes over time and at some point enough miranium is mined to replenish it, but money is a different matter. The game gives us our first Skell, but the others have to be bought, and the more you level up, the more expensive the frames become. Furthermore, enemies can destroy our Skells, forcing us to spend exorbitant amounts of money to restore them once the insurance vouchers have run out: that's why you must always decide carefully who has to fight", "date": "2015-11-30", "grade": "9.6"}
