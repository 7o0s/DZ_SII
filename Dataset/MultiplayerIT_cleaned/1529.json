{"name": "Otogi: Myth of Demons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/otogi-myth-of-demons.html", "text": "Once upon a time... Raikoh, the character that we will use for the entire duration of the game, is the last survivor of a clan that had the purpose of giving the coup de grace to the people destined to die, thus favoring their transition to the world of the dead. Although this task was assigned to his clan for many generations he suffered from it and one day, when he was ordered to kill his father, he rebelled by refusing to obey the Imperial Court that had dominated the world for over a thousand years. Raikoh was saved from the punishment due to traitors only thanks to the breaking of the Seal, the sky became dark and a storm razed civilization to the ground. Raikoh did not die thanks to the timely intervention of the Princess, a fascinating but very mysterious character, who snatched him from the world of the dead, keeping him in a state halfway between life and death. The brave fighter was saved to carry out various missions and thus purify his spirit from the wickedness committed in the past. This is the plot, certainly not very original, which will lead us to face the 29 levels that make up the title developed by From Software and published by Sega. Die Hard - Die Hard! The story is not very deep but which draws heavily from Japanese mythology and imagination, it still appears to be functional for carrying out the missions. The missions are fairly varied and you will go from defeating as many demons as possible to getting out of intricate situations to destroying some artifacts and more. Our status halfway between life and death will allow us to use high powers that will make the fights very spectacular, the real strength of the whole game. Our permanence in life will not depend exclusively on the usual energy bar but also on an indicator of magical power, which will run out as the minutes go by and once finished it will consume our life in a short time. It is therefore mandatory to try to waste as little time as possible and at the same time decimate the enemies, in fact by doing this we will partially restore the two aforementioned indicators as well as being rewarded in terms of experience and earnings. We will see later what these rewards will be used for and what the RPG aspect of Otogi consists of. The title proves to be a very good action game, highlighting all its merits in the fights. We will be able to develop two different types of physical attack plus a magical one, all three of which can be combined together to obtain devastating combos, not only for the demons but also for the surrounding environment. Yes, because the game engine of the From Software title allows us to interact with 99% of the setting, we will be able to bring everything down with a well-aimed blow and the more we destroy the better the evaluation we will receive at the end of each level. Raikoh will never fight with bare hands and will be able to use four types of weapons: the sword, the great sword, the stick and the double swords. Each sword, it is almost useless to remember, has its own characteristics and is more effective against certain opponents than against others. We will be able to equip our demon hunter with only one weapon for each level, possibly changing it between one stage and another. Against the enemies we will be able to use the ~sprint~ technique, which consists of a very fast, almost invisible movement, which allows us to enhance our shot as well as allowing us to move quickly from one part of the play area to another. The duels in the air are truly phenomenal, the ~sprint~ and the successful hits will allow us to remain suspended in the air, in a stalemate, thus allowing us to multiply our attacks, all fortunately facilitated by an excellent lock on system of enemies that can be activated at will. Magically RPG Raikoh being an ~almost demon~ has very developed magical powers that will only enrich our means of destruction. During the adventure we will acquire (or purchase) increasingly powerful spells belonging to one of the four houses: Dragon, Phoenix, Chimera, Butterfly. Each house has an enemy magical order, and monsters also usually, but not always, belong to a house. It will therefore be necessary before the start of the stage to check the types of monsters that we will meet, thanks to a special menu, in order to be able to arm ourselves with the right spell. The Dragon is the most versatile spell, excellent both at a distance and in close combat. The Chimera creates acircle of lightning very good in melee but almost useless at range. The Phoenix is excellent at range even if it has the defect of hitting only in a straight line. Finally, the Butterfly creates a protective net in front of Raikoh, making it the most defensive of the four. Otogi is not just pure action, it is enriched by some rpg elements which definitely make it more interesting and engaging. In the breaks between the different levels we will in fact be able to enhance our hunter. By killing the demons, Raikoh will be rewarded with various luminous spheres, some relating to the increase in experience and others instead of gold that we can use in the Shop to buy new spells, weapons or accessories. Both with advancing the level of our character and by buying ever more expensive weapons and spells, our skills will increase. In addition to buying new offensive tools, we will also be able to repair those already used and damaged by very close contact with the numerous demons. The weapons then do not differ only in their capabilities and therefore, consequently, in how much they affect our abilities, but also in their weight and size. A sword will always be easier to handle and lighter than a two-handed broadsword. Polygons, Polygons, Polygons Despite having been released about a year ago in the land of the rising sun Otogi is still a feast for the eyes. The environments are entirely made in 3d and deformable as a result of our hits. There is even the possibility of saving the stages after our passage and of returning to finish the work of destruction. The fights are always fluid and, except in sporadic cases, are not affected by any slowdown even in the presence of many enemies on the screen. The horizon is very vast even if the levels are not very large and the whole setting is very gloomy, cool at the right point, really successful like the rest of the character design. The polygonal models of both Raikoh and the demons are highly detailed and well animated. The particle effects only enhance the From Software graphics engine equipped with a good antialiasing filter. So everything perfect? The only sore point, in my opinion, is unfortunately given by the camera which, although manually adjustable, often loses sight of the target in the most heated fights. Not negligible problem but that doesn't affect the technically excellent Otogi that much. The surreal atmosphere in certain levels is rendered really well and a very very engaging oriental music takes care of increasing the immersion. Comment Otogi turns out to be a pleasant surprise, although he does not bring any innovation he manages to establish himself as one of the best exponents of ~hack 'n slash~. The not very exciting plot and its excessive linearity are the only defects of a title that was missed in the Xbox lineup. A final flaw to note is the lack of localization of both the dialogues and the subtitles, both in English. Technically it turns out to be superb, after all it could not be otherwise since Edge awarded it with the Grafical Achievement 2003, and we are already trembling waiting to be able to see what From Software will be able to improve in the sequel already announced. A recommended purchase for all Xbox owners, not just fans of the genre. Pros: Action, action, action Technically superb Very cool atmosphere Cons: Insufficient plot and too linear Camera not always functional Not localized The Japanese market immediately proved difficult for the Xbox, the console was viewed with distrust given its non-Japanese origins, with no titles capable of attracting the interest of slant-eyed gamers. However, Microsoft has not let go, despite noting the low sales recorded, and has insisted on titles with a strong appeal capable of slightly improving the conditions of its hardware in the land of the Rising Sun. Otogi is one of these games, released about a year ago for the eastern market and only now arriving on store shelves throughout Italy.", "date": "2003-10-13", "grade": null}
