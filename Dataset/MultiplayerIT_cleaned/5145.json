Even the playing public is getting used to it and, in the midst of the clamor for the various announcements, we begin to perceive a normalization of relations with certain titles, which are no longer able to attract interest only for the source from which they come. This does not mean that they are not quality products, as we will see in the review of Sackboy: A Great Adventure for PC, but only that in some cases they seem unsuitable for the target platform. PC operation Sackboy: A Great Adventure is well done, but it's not exactly one of those games that will make the average PC user pull their hair out Let's not go around too much: at the time of writing this article we were already aware that the port of the Sumo Digital game had some launch problems. Despite the promise of technical improvements, platformers are not as loved as other genres on PC and given the price, many have chosen to simply ignore it. In this case the PlayStation brand was not enough to generate interest. After all, Sony itself hasn't pressed much on marketing, so it's quite clear that it didn't believe very much in the commercial potential of the game. He didn't even believe the PS5 launch, despite Sackboy: A Great Adventure being part of the console's launch lineup. In fact, it is easy to wonder why this game was converted and not, for example, the remake of Demon's Souls, which would have had a much simpler life, also given the driving force behind the success of Elden Ring. Graphics Sackboy: A Great Adventure is graphically beautiful, but it is certainly not the most demanding game in the world for GPUs Opportunity considerations aside, it must be said that Sackboy: A Great Adventure remains a nice platformer even on PC. Unfortunately the greater potential of the platform compared to a console is exploited relatively little, also due to the nature of the game itself. There is talk of a resolution that can reach 4K fixed, 120 frames per second and support for Nvidia's ray tracing and DLSS. On closer inspection, everything is there, but the overall impact of the graphics still remains very close to that of PS5, for a very simple reason: we are talking about a 3D platform in which the character is almost always framed from afar and whose levels are built often seeking more readability than spectacularity. So there's nothing to bring out, for example, ray tracing, and the generally very bland pace of the game doesn't bring out the 120fps. The substance is that the graphic adjustment is certainly welcome, the work done is still excellent, but everything appears to be an obligatory step, which does not change the gaming experience on PS5 and PS4 one iota. The only flaw, if we want to call it that, is that on some Sackboy systems: a great adventure starts at the start of the levels, ie during the preloading of the graphic resources. It doesn't bother much, really, because when you take control of Sackboy the shots are already gone. It's probably the usual DirectX12 problem with shaders. Gameplay Sackboy: A Great Adventure is really very easy Otherwise Sackboy: A Great Adventure is exactly the same game it was on consoles. As already mentioned, we're talking about a 3D platformer starring Sackboy, a character already appreciated in Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet series (which was on another level in terms of creativity, thanks to the excellent integrated editor, completely absent here). Ours has to contend with the terrible Vex, determined to imprison the inhabitants of the DIY kingdom to take control of it. To defeat him, Sackboy will have to travel through five worlds, divided into various levels, in which to collect objects, face monsters and, above all, jump from platform to platform trying to avoid numerous obstacles. From a game mechanics point of view, we are faced with a work that does not change the genre to which it belongs by an iota. Of course, it does everything very well, with an eye always on accessibility, so as to be playable even by the little ones (read: it's very easy, as we will reiterate later), but it never goes out of the way. There are five worlds to overcome in total, all with different biomes, which are explored by the various levels. Sackboy: Big Adventure offers many different costumes for the protagonist The visual style follows that of LittleBigPlanet, with the scenarios created using do-it-yourself objects, therefore with an abundance of hardcovers, fabrics of all kinds, buttons, glue and so on. It must be said that style dominates over everything else,that is, that the variety of individual levels gets lost a bit in this idea of making everything a kind of big patchwork. The result is that the wonder effect produced by some of the early levels tends to dry up as the adventure progresses. In terms of actual design, Sackboy: A Great Adventure takes everything it can from the competition, both in the protagonist's moves, which in addition to jumping can punch and roll. In some levels you get special abilities, like a grappling hook or a bionic arm, but there really isn't anything you haven't seen elsewhere. The enemies themselves follow this philosophy, appearing several times throughout the game in enhanced versions, but never going too far beyond their initial schemes. Sackboy: A grand adventure is graphically well done Fortunately, the implementation is very solid and you get to the end of the game without feeling too much the weight of repetition. Of course, don't expect a high level of challenge, because it is evident that Sumo Digital has designed the latest Sackboy adventure for the whole family to play. Even the final levels are really simple, including the bosses, and never require more than an extra attempt or two to beat. In short, we are faced with a light experience, which flows without too many jolts and which, once concluded, is very quickly forgotten.", "date": "2022-11-01", "grade": "7.5"}
