Among titles such as Resident Evil (at least the first ones), the more recent Dead Island and so on and so forth, productions faithful to George Romero's idea of the living dead have alternated with variations of all kinds. In the middle of a genre that is often able to exploit even large budgets for its games, we find State of Decay, which arrived last June on Xbox 360 and developed by the debuting team Undead Labs. A name for a program, as they say in these cases, given Jeff Strain's passion for cute creatures, but above all the dedication of his studio in realizing the project internally called Class3. In late summer, State of Decay abandoned its exclusivity for the Microsoft console, also landing on PC through the Steam Early Access program, where the final version of the game made its debut on November 5th. We therefore took the opportunity to make our return to Mount Tanner, to see if and what has changed, this time also armed with a mouse and keyboard. Fight for survival Although State of Decay has long since arrived on Xbox 360, we imagine that among PC players there are also those who, not owning the console, have not yet had the opportunity to get direct knowledge of the game. For their benefit, we recall that the effort of Undead Labs fits perfectly within the canons of survival games, perhaps more than any other title belonging to this genre, embodying the true spirit that distinguishes the fight against zombies. The plot that involves the usual government authorities is, on balance, only a side dish: the player must in fact take care of the entire group of characters, without therefore having a real protagonist, even if the whole adventure sees us begin as Marcus. Soon, however, it becomes possible to exchange him with the other playable characters, thus giving them the opportunity to evolve their skills and contribute to the group's resistance in a world populated by the undead. Identifying with the one you control is easy, but be careful not to get too attached, since death is permanent. A further element that contributes to giving the entire gaming experience a constant feeling of danger. Not to be forgotten is also the persistence of the world of State of Decay, which allows it to continue even if the player interrupts the game. Leaving a not exactly rosy situation within one's base could therefore make us find things worse than how we left them, in some cases even the dead will escape us. The zombies of Undead Labs also arrive on PC: here is State of Decay! From Xbox 360 to PC From the content point of view, State of Decay for PC is exactly the same as the game released for Xbox 360, to whose basic edition the patches published by Undead Labs in the time between the releases of the two versions must be added. This translates into an impressive bug fixing work, plus the addition of some elements such as the possibility of asking a CPU-controlled character to accompany us on a mission. In the first case, the list of updates made by the developers in the three patches of the game is almost endless, but we would like to point out the solution to the problem relating to the message of too many infestations, arranged to count the houses in possession of zombies within a radius of 500 meters, instead of all over the map. As for the option to ask someone to accompany us on a mission, the need to invest 100 influence points does not make this addition something attractive, given that the most savvy players will not find it difficult to make someone follow anyway. Moving on to the controls, the mouse and keyboard pairing fails to match the use of the joypad, for which willy-nilly the game was originally designed. We imagine it is still a matter of habit, even if the lack of possibility of remapping the keyboard makes itself felt. Finally, from a technical point of view, there are clear steps forward on the loss of frame rate that afflicted the Xbox 360 version, limited but not completely disappeared, while support for 1080p resolution and the arrival of better textures allows the look to State of Decay for PC to be cleaner than the console game, without upsetting for who knows what graphic revolution.", "date": "2013-11-13", "grade": "8.9"}
