{"name": "The Sims 2: Free Time - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-free-time-recensione.html", "text": "The Sims 2: Free Time is available for PC. When I grow up I want to be a ballerina This new expansion for The Sims 2 focuses on free time, offering the classic pre-built lots and free mode. In the first case there will be six lots with as many situations of common life, such as for example the Mole family, where the protagonist (a Matrix enthusiast judging by his clothing) desperately tries to have a normal life rather than spend his time spying the others. Each of these offers interesting ideas and it will not be uncommon to witness hilarious moments and situations, also given the priceless mimicry that distinguishes the characters. Once the game has started and the starting lot has been selected, there will be the classic objectives (to be achieved) and failures (to be avoided), upon reaching which you will get prizes of various kinds. The novelties are introduced as always in a progressive and balanced way, allowing the player to gradually become familiar with the new activities. These range from sports like football or billiards, through to sewing, sculpting, dance, music, science, astronomy, board games, cooking, model making and more. The goal system allows you to progressively improve your skill in a specific hobby, thus getting better and better and in some cases, even being able to compete in specific competitions (fortunately in the case of dance you won't become showgirls); moreover, it will be possible to unlock aspirations, acquire rewards and access many new discoveries. Every Sim has a certain predisposition to follow the path of a hobby, even if no path is precluded in advance. In this case it will be necessary to further refine one's techniques and spend a greater number of hours. More Sims than ever The longevity of this expansion settles on medium-high levels, given the large number of hobbies and objects present, which make the experience of The Sims 2 even more varied and profound, especially for those who already have several expansions. Graphically, Free Time doesn't offer any noteworthy innovations, but the objects appear well-crafted and above all well-placed in the context of the game. With various expansions installed, the system requirements increase slightly, but given that the graphics engine is now starting its 4 years of life, even with a not exactly recent PC it is possible to play at maximum detail. On the machine used for the test, the game runs very smoothly with all graphics options set to maximum. The characters are as always very colorful and well animated even in the most complex situations. On the audio front, the music is ideal for even an extended gaming session and given the medium-low tone, it is never invasive. Comment The Sims 2: Free Time is an expansion that makes a good impression in the game, thanks to the many paths that can be traveled and the charisma of the protagonists more alive than ever, which probably finds its maximum expression in this episode. If from a technical point of view there are no news worthy of note, the colorful graphics and amusing game situations allow you to turn a blind eye to a rather outdated graphics system. Pros: Unmissable for fans of the series Lots of unpublished activities and objects Colorful graphics... Cons: ...but now outdated No significant news System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Processor: Pentium IV 1.3 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 32 MB Ram Disk Space: 1.2 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce 64 MB memory or ATI equivalent Disk Space: 1.2 GB Windows Vista Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 128 MB memory or ATI equivalent Disk space: 1.2 GB Test configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz processor RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB memory Waiting to find out what The Sims 3 announced over a year ago will offer, Maxis continues to churn out expansions and stuff packs (the latter mostly, collections of useful objects to make the gaming experience more varied).
