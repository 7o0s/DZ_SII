{"name": "Shinobido: Way of the Ninja", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shinobido-way-of-the-ninja.html", "text": "A ninja's code of conduct If a samurai is a warrior who fights following the rules of a code of honor, a ninja is quite another thing: a ruthless assassin, hired by anyone who can afford his services and ready to do anything to complete the mission. task assigned to him. Shinobido is quite clear in exposing this concept, just think that your alter ego will be employed by several lords, even in conflict with each other, in an attempt to recover the memory mysteriously lost during a clash. In the shadows hides a character who knows the truth and who with his advice guides you into action, teaching you the fundamentals of combat, escape and infiltration. After a brief incipit, therefore, you will be ready to evaluate the missions that will be proposed to you and possibly to accept them, with a certain decision-making freedom, taking into consideration their difficulty, the type to which they belong and the cash prize. The nature of each mission varies from simple assassination to the recovery of objects or people, from eliminating all enemies to escorting important characters. Every time you complete one, you will be evaluated numerically and you will earn a certain amount of ~esteem~ from your principal, with a mechanism that naturally sees the difficulty of the internships grow as you prove to be more skilled. [C] The CG sequences are well done. Staying on the rooftops is a must. the norm, of course. The game's graphics offer a good level of detail. [/C] The two fundamental aspects Like any product belonging to this genre, Shinobido has a dual soul: on the one hand there is the exploration phase, with appendages and connections; on the other the fight. The game introduces some purely aesthetic variations to what has already been seen in Tenchu, but does not revolutionize its mechanics: you approach your goal by following the directions of a sort of compass (you have to buy the map...), and the appearance of ~eyes~ at the top of the screen it announces the presence of people in the area. At that point you have to find a safe observation point, identify the enemy and think about what to do: try to get around him silently or eliminate him? Both solutions, in Shinobido, must be tried many times before a perfect result, above all due to a cumbersome and not very intuitive control system, which only supports you in the movements after a little practice but which proves to be completely insufficient in the moment in which the ~silent~ options fail and direct confrontation is reached. In the various tutorials we are often advised to escape when the opponents are numerous. One has to indulge this line, but unfortunately for the wrong reason: it is not possible to effectively conduct a fight with only one enemy, let alone two or three. In this respect, Shinobido badly loses the comparison with the Tenchu series. The control system sees the presence of a back button that ~hooks~ one target at a time, providing at least a minimum of precision to attacks that would otherwise go mostly in vain. And while trying to understand exactly how the (automatic) parries work, the extra enemies can take advantage of them and swing in bulk, moved by an artificial intelligence that is not sparkling but which well understands the concept of numerical superiority, applying it often and willingly. To our detriment. [C] One of the initial sequences. Often the best thing is; observe from above and then act. There are many ways to kill an enemy. [/C] What a ninja sees and hears If the landscape represented by the gameplay of Shinobido: Way of the Ninja appears bleak at times, the same cannot be said of what is offered to our eyes and ears. The engine behind the graphics is efficient enough to move scenery and characters smoothly, probably at 30fps, while showing a good level of detail in the textures that cover the buildings and clothes. There's nothing really spectacular, to be sure, but the job gets done more than satisfactorily. And the sound sector does even better, thanks to very well done and atmospheric music, which changes according to the situation and which well comments on the story that the developers want to tell, also through the numerous well-made animated sequences. Comment Shinobido: Way of the Ninja excels in atmosphere and involvement, above all thanks to the excellent technical realization. Unfortunately, the control of the character forces a long practice session before you can master the movements perfectly, and also shows youKnow its limitations when facing a fight with more than one opponent. From this point of view, the numerous objects that are collected, the original ~purchase and sale~ system and the unoriginal but exciting plot are of little use: the goal of entertaining the player is blatantly missed. And so we find ourselves faced with a niche product, which must be ~understood~ in its strengths and weaknesses, within a toy library that does not abound in titles of the genre and which therefore can prove to be a little more ~understanding ~ than usual. Pros: Interesting game mechanics Good technical realization Various mission types Cons: Cumbersome combat system Camera management can be improved Plenty of useless items The first Tenchu, Metal Gear Solid and Siphon Filter share the credit for having given birth to the ~stealth~ genre, understood as an action game in which the protagonist must move through the levels also considering the eyes and ears of his enemies, perhaps with the It's imperative to complete a mission undetected.
