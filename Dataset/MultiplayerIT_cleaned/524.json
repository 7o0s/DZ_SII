{"name": "Atari Masterpieces Vol. 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atari-masterpieces-vol-2.html", "text": "Atari...Maybe! Strictly following the path already traced by its predecessor, Atari Masterpieces Vol. II offers a series of titles dating back to the 80s in their original arcade versions, without big frills or particular attempts to enrich the scope. The desired game is selected, a key is pressed to simulate the insertion of the token and one goes on until the available lives are used up, highlighted by the inevitable game over screen. Nothing more: Atari Masterpieces Vol. II does not even remotely try to differentiate itself from the prequel, even keeping the same cosmetic choices as regards menus and the like. A tendency towards laxity that can be tolerated without problems in this area, but which becomes extremely annoying when it also extends to the selection of games made available. But let's take a step back: the Backbone Entertainment title includes Asteroids Deluxe, Centipede, Crystal Castles, Liberator, Pong, Space Duel, Tempest and Warlords, as well as four ~old glories~ Atari 2600 to be unlocked with hi-scores (and these are 2600 Air Sea Battle, 2600 Mini Golf, 2600 Canyon Bomber and 2600 Video Checkers). Well, suffice it to say that perhaps just a couple of the games listed so far are worthy of being part of a proper collection. First of all, Asteroids Deluxe and Centipede are nothing more than imperceptibly different versions of titles already offered by the previous Vol. I, and whose presence in this second episode appears really inconsiderate. If we add to this the fact that Space Duel is none other than ~Asteroids with colors~, it becomes evident how the Atari production begins to take on all the characteristics of a good and good mockery... More of the same Removing the three puppet titles listed above, five are missing, which we are now going to illustrate. Crystal Castle is essentially an isometric Pac-Man, certainly impressive for the time but which replayed now loses almost all of its charm, resulting in rather weak. Liberator is structured like a ~reverse~ Missile Command, with the user engaged in directing the fire of four spaceships against the attacks coming from the planet on duty: pleasant, even if all too similar to the aforementioned title (as it happens too present in the previous volume). Pong needs no explanation, being to all intents and purposes the historical progenitor of the video game, but however moving its presence in a collection in 2006 appears extremely risky: we challenge anyone to play it for more than five minutes. Tempest, Jeff Minter's mythical creature, is instead still capable of entertaining thanks to its particular play structure (it is a shoot'em up set in vector tunnels in which you control a ship that moves along the walls of the tunnels themselves) and to his psychedelic style. The Warlords roundup closes, an unmemorable evolution of Pong which sees four rackets arranged in the corners of the screen engaged in throwing a fireball at each other in an attempt to destroy other people's castles. In short, as is evident, Atari Classic Vol. II combines some copy-titles with other non-exciting titles, leaving the burden of supporting everything to two-three actually appreciable games (the 2600 revivals don't even count). Too little to escape the definition of a mere commercial operation and to escape a merciless rejection on our part. Comment Atari Masterpieces Vol. II represents a rather clumsy attempt to ~strike while the iron is hot~: a relatively short distance from the first collection, the release of this title demonstrates all its inadequacy through a selection of games that is truly disappointing in terms of quality and variety of the same. The unlockable bonuses and extras (which are not exciting) are of little use in saving a product that is simply not worth the money it costs. Pleasant Pros Tempest and Liberator Cons Narrow and unconvincing selection Uninteresting extra material Clear commercial operation Strange genre, that of compilations of historical video games: although they certainly do not represent one of the products with the greatest impact within the videogame market, these retrogaming anthologies flock to every platform, in an attempt to attract a young audience and to instill a healthy nostalgia in older users. But too much hurts, as demonstrated by this Atari Masterpieces Vol. II...", "date": "2006-04-25", "grade": null}
