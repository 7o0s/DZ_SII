In this case, however, the choice of name is really high-sounding, leaning on a historic and important brand like this involves a considerable responsibility. Entrusted to the Canadian Bedlam Games, a young company that hosts elements from Rockstar, EA and Ubisoft, Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale aims to leave an indelible mark on the genre, and on digital delivery. Did he succeed? W the respawn! The story puts us in the shoes of four characters, indeed very canonical in the genre, that we can choose at the beginning of the adventure. We go from the swordsman, to the wizard, the elf archer (of the fairer sex) and the typical warrior dwarf. And we will see a lot of dwarves along the main campaign, since our aim is to penetrate the Tower Of Void, an operation that can only be done by going through the mines of Tethyamar. The mine is populated and managed by dwarves, and their help will be practically essential to overcome the entire first part of the game, which is functional in finding the entrance to the tower. In small terms we are faced with a series of missions set in a series of dungeons of increasing difficulty, with a strong presence of backtracking, or the obligation to retrace certain areas several times. The game alternates free zones, used mainly for dialogues, the management of the various quests and the sale, with real labyrinths, where we find ourselves facing numerous hordes of enemies. Here too we range between the canons of the genre, without particular twists. Raging goblins, flaming skeletons, demons and necromancers. Our paraphernalia is mainly composed of ranged and close attacks, plus a series of special shots that can be implemented to a limited extent, in this case we have to wait for a special bar to fill up before we can use them again. The hits are freely mappable on the pad, in order to guarantee dynamism and practicality. However, the characters are certainly not lightning bolts of war, the animations are rather slow and moreover afflicted by a slight delay in response, a detail that can take on worrying dimensions in the most agitated clashes, or which require the need for an energy potion. The adventure lasts Precisely these potions prove to be vital goods, especially in the early stages of the game, which can be surprisingly rigid. In any RPG where the growth and improvement of one's character represent the fulcrum of the game, an initially severe difficulty curve is recognized, as our hero is of a low level and weak to attacks. But Daggerdale risks over-punishing those who don't understand or quickly follow through on the required tasks. The amount of enemies we face is exaggerated, continuous and endless fleets of leathery and lethal creatures, ready to suck up our meager energy bar, never totally satisfied by the few and expensive potions available. The game automatically saves at crucial points, and while manual saving is also allowed, the action always restarts at the start of a quest, meaning you lose valuable items and weapons if you die. Xbox 360 goals 200 Player Points distributed across the canonical dozen of objectives, that's what awaits you with Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale. To get the first half it is enough to complete the main adventure, for the others it will take a little additional dedication. Particular mention for the objective ~The big club~ which requires you to inflict an amount of damage of 75 points. who knows what you thought... I bend over backwards The objects and the gold to buy them are found inside the barrels to be destroyed, an operation to be repeated numerous times to adequately enhance our hero, so much so that it almost represents a basic characteristic of the production. Anyone who is not willing to repetitive and compulsive maneuvers is therefore warned. The game is also plagued by numerous bugs, in our sessions we've seen enemies hanging in the air, or crucial characters mysteriously disappearing. On a technical level Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale testifies to the nature of a low-cost production, characters difficult to distinguish, and a scrolling plagued by heavy tearing that makes the action always very little fluid and with the video often divided in two up to par of the midline. The music is particularly poor, reduced to depressing loops that will put your patience to the test. The game supports online multiplayer up to four gplayers.", "date": "2011-07-01", "grade": "5.0"}
