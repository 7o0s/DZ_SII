At the present Penumbear the identikit just traced fits perfectly, so let's see if in addition to the form the developers have also been able to take care of the substance. Plush in the dark The title of the game by Taco Graveyard is not only a pleasant play on words, but it is also the name of the protagonist, a tender teddy bear who wakes up in total solitude in the dungeons of a mysterious castle: accompanied only by a firefly, our hero will have to face the hundred levels that separate him from freedom, fielding a mixture of gymnastic skills and ability to solve puzzles. Thanks to a graphic that prefers black and white and a melancholic feeling also assisted by a particularly effective soundtrack, Penumbear can in some ways recall Limbo, thanks above all to a gameplay also here focused on solving environmental puzzles. However, the differences are clearly visible, starting with a play structure that favors circumscribed stages, with a very precise beginning and end and often equipped with a theme - which can be deduced from the name of the level itself - which indicates what the keystone is for solve puzzles. The latter are mostly based on the exploitation of the lights strategically placed by the developers within the levels, and which can be turned on or off by the firefly that accompanies the protagonist: an aspect that goes hand in hand with the unique ability of Penumbear, able to walk on the shadow lines generated by the various lighting sources. Beyond the original mechanics just described, the work of Taco Graveyard reveals excellent values also as regards the level design, appreciable above all for how it manages to always add some new element in a sweet and progressive way: it is therefore sufficient to go through the first dozen lack of internship to see the range of varieties in terms of puzzles significantly expand, including flashing lights, buttons to be activated remotely, a greater number of fireflies at one's disposal to perform multiple actions simultaneously and so on. All while the more strictly platform part of Penumbear is certainly not hiding in a corner, on the contrary: while using a few essential commands, the product proves capable of putting even veterans of the genre in difficulty, with its requests for millimeter jumps and with particularly insidious obstacles and enemies, given that a contact with the teddy bear is enough to decree its death. In light of these aspects, it doesn't take much to realize that Taco Graveyard is not a game for young ladies, characterized as it is by a level of difficulty that becomes truly ferocious especially in the more advanced stages: the puzzles become more and more bizarre and the most difficult platforms to reach, with a checkpoint system that moreover does not really put itself at the service of the player. Anyone who is not intimidated by similar prospects will find in Penumbear a very valid product, which to all its aforementioned qualities also adds some good incentives for replayability, considering how each scheme hides a certain amount of soft toys to collect, suitably hidden in the nooks and crannies more recondite and inaccessible. In fact, the only component of Penumbear attributable to the sphere of negativity is the visual one, with certainly functional and all in all also evocative graphics which, however, fail to have a particular impact either from an artistic point of view or from a purely technical one.", "date": "2013-03-14", "grade": "8.4"}
