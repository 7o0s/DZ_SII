As we know, the series has continued and has found, with the fourth chapter, an even more multifaceted connotation, focusing on very vast scenarios and the freedom to manage the missions as you please, choosing the order in which to complete the various objectives and the areas to explore before the others. A step forward that we obviously do not find in the episode for Switch, remaining anchored to the formula already seen in Sniper Elite V2: a sequence of situations that we will have to manage using the trusty sniper rifle or by approaching our victims for a close-range elimination. The third option, that of proceeding with weapons drawn, is difficult to implement: the gunplay in this case reveals a large number of limitations and the experience soon turns into something chaotic, cumbersome and frustrating. So it's better to be patient and enjoy this adventure by Karl Fairburne as the authors imagined it: move silently, identify targets, plan attacks, execute and repeat. Scenarios and gameplay The Sniper Elite III Ultimate Edition campaign takes us to Africa, once again grappling with a high-risk mission: the Nazi army is working on a weapon that could change the fate of the Second World War and we must at all costs find the documents that will allow us to foil the threat. This of course means killing a number of German officers, searching their bodies and obtaining the information we need; all within fairly broad scenarios, which introduce the welcome strategic element of background noise right from the start. The sniper rifle that we can use to kill enemies in fact produces a sound capable of alerting hostile troops, and that is why in the various missions we will have to find the way and the opportunity to cover it in order to proceed with the eliminations without arousing too much suspicion . Sometimes there are planes that fly low, cyclically, and provide the necessary noise to proceed, but often these opportunities have to be created from scratch by tampering with internal combustion engines or other devices. Shooting from distance remains the main maneuver of Sniper Elite 3, the one with which the game is best expressed: you aim, hold your breath for a few moments so as to take advantage of greater precision and press the trigger. The spectacular X-Ray sequences do the rest, showing the dramatic consequences that our bullet produces on the body of the victims, breaking through bones and internal organs. One of our first shots blew up the testicles of the unfortunate German soldier on duty: we felt the pain for him. The protagonist's equipment also includes by default a silenced pistol, a machine gun, medical kits, stones to attract the attention of the guards and a set of grenades and pressure bombs: everything you need to decisively thin the ranks of the Nazi army during our sorties, with the possibility of unlocking further tools as you progress in the countryside. Extra mode Sniper Elite 3 Ultimate Edition includes some extra modes, specifically a wave survival on two different maps and a competitive multiplayer in which two teams of snipers face each other trying to make the most eliminations. There are six possible stipulations: Team Deathmatch, Traditional Deathmatch (all against all), King of Distance for teams (you get more points depending on the shooting distance), King of Distance, Without Contact (the two teams are separated, only precision shots count) and the classic Capture the Flag. The Nintendo Switch version Sniper Elite 3 Ultimate Edition offers the exact same content on Nintendo Switch as the version released in 2015 on other platforms. So let's talk about the basic campaign consisting of eight missions, the Save Churchill DLCs with six extra tasks and the packages with additional weapons. The hybrid console allows you to play in portable mode or connected to the TV, possibly activating the motion detection controls. What do they consist of? This is an option that allows you to use Joy-Con aiming, but only when the character takes aim, to therefore obtain more precise adjustments: a welcome plus but which does not change the approach to the experience that much. Better to adjust the sensitivity of the sticksanalogical, which at the start are complicated to manage during the zoom and which, together with some glitches with the commands (see for example the close-up executions with the dagger, which are sometimes not performed), should be optimized with an update. From a technical point of view, the conversion is well done, however net of a graphic that already in 2014 did not make one cry for a miracle, placed as part of a cross-gen project. Therefore, expect to see very little sophisticated effects, especially as regards the rendering of the smoke and the lighting system, together with the traditional presence of invisible walls that delimit the boundaries of the stages. The sound boasts a good dubbing in Italian, but the volumes are off and this creates some problems when you are hidden, trying to identify enemies: their voices are heard loud and clear even if they are far away, thus preventing you from obtaining any acoustic as well as visual information from the environment.", "date": "2019-09-30", "grade": "6.8"}
