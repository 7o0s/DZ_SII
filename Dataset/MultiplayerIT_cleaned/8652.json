A little ahead of schedule indeed, and it's also a PC exclusive... Something's not quite right. But no, it's Gears of War 4! Exclusive to PC... Not possible. It must be Umberto's joke. Well, when he burns the editors' cars or when he keeps claiming that Diablo III will come out sooner or later it's more believable. Deep Black Reloaded? Never heard of it. But let's not joke, that's Master Chief! No stories! And the cover system is that of Gears of War. Have 343 Industries and Epic made friends? Ah, an independent clone? With so much water? Basically a George Clooney lookalike with a exploded prostate. The plot tells of a routine infiltration of a Halo protagonist cosplayer who ends up unraveling the usual plot to destabilize the global order. Obviously, being part of the most powerful army in the world, we will be completely alone and will have to stop the enemies through five chapters full of shootings. On our side we will have a pistol and a machine gun with little ammunition, as well as a multipurpose grappling hook that can be used to connect to electronic devices and to drag hooked enemies. But we'll talk about the grappling hook later in the review. A superficial glance could recognize similarities in the scenario and gameplay with other titles, already mentioned at the beginning of the text, but looking at it better, we realize instead that it is a shameless copy, especially of the Epic title, with the addition of a lot of H2O. In fact, no one has ever wondered how much the protagonists of video games stink after they have spent hours inside heavy hermetic armor. We propose a GoW spin-off for iOS systems in which Marcus Phoenix has to face the enemies of hygiene in exciting duels to the last stroke of the soap before going to sleep... but that's another story. In water Deep Black Reloaded is a decidedly well done title of Russian origin, despite its derivative nature. The protagonist is a clich that walks, both in appearance and in the speeches he makes over the radio with colleagues who speak like the protagonists of a C-series film crossed with an episode of Big Brother. Fortunately, the gameplay is another matter and, having overcome the annoyance of the lack of originality, there are several elements to be happy about. As you can guess we are dealing with a third-person shooter with covers, however designed for a very hardcore user, so hardcore that even the tutorial can make you spit acid blood and scream at the moon that emerges from the mountain. Obviously in an age where video games end themselves, a little healthy challenge can only be good for the spirit. So get ready for reasoned shootouts in which it is not enough to have the biggest cannon in hand to win, but which require the minimum of skill that makes life beautiful. If you proceed with too much bravado you will inevitably end up riddled with bullets, or embraced by some underwater mine of unprecedented power. The submarine fights are the best part of Deep Black Reloaded, thanks above all to the excellent control system that allows you to move easily in the water: in addition to moving in various directions, as happens in many other titles, here it is possible to activate jets that allow you to overcome the strongest currents and move faster. Even the aforementioned grappling hook plays a central role, because it allows you to drag enemies into the water, to take control of the combat drones to get help against the other robots and to activate otherwise unreachable switches. To the ground Let's talk about the clashes on land after those in the water because they make it much less, both spectacularly and in terms of gameplay. After a few fights you notice some imprecisions in the controls and the lack of some fundamental moves, such as the ability to roll from one cover to another. In other cases, however, you find yourself behind a cover that is not recognized as such and you have to waste time looking for another one, with the real risk of being riddled with bullets. The enemies are very aggressive, both in water and on land and, even if the artificial intelligence does not shine, in many cases we find ourselves having to think carefully about how to act to overcome delicate situations. For example, in the second chapter, giant robotic spiders are unlocked which require numerous shots to be shot down. Facing them directly is the equivalent of committing suicide and one must always try to exploit the elements of the scenario to get out of the way. In short, to get away you can't place yourself behind cover and limit yourself to raising your head from time to time to shoot, but you need to take a look at yourself.or around and understand how best to move in order not to remain at the mercy of enemies. All these elements make Deep Black Reloaded a damn difficult game. The developers have stated that it takes eight hours to finish it, but in reality it takes a lot more to do it, since already playing at a normal level you find yourself loading the game often. Let's say that more realistically we can bring the longevity for the average player well beyond twelve hours, but also something more if you choose to play at the maximum difficulty level. Technically speaking Deep Black Reloaded is a graphically successful game, but rather flat. It has no particular flashes and the levels do not ooze stylistic originality, but they can be admired, especially in open spaces. The best sections are the aquatic ones, where the developers have evidently concentrated most of the work. Something more could have been done on the physics of the water, especially at times when the levels are flooded, but we can't complain too much. On the other hand, the soundtrack is very poor. The sound effects are limited to the sounds of weapons and footsteps, while the music does its dirty work of accompaniment and nothing more. The anonymity of this part is so evident that we have often preferred to lower the volume of the music and put third-party songs in the background. Aside from the external issues, there are also some DRM-related instabilities that have led to the game crashing on several occasions. However, just as we were writing this article a fix patch was released that eliminates all issues. We report them to you all the same, inviting you to install it if you decide to try the game.", "date": "2012-03-22", "grade": "7.8"}
