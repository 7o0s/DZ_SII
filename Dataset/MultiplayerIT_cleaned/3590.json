{"name": "Wild Hearts: la recensione dell'alternativa a Monster Hunter di Omega Force ed EA", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-hearts-recensione.html", "text": "If one abandons oneself without any critical conscience to the constant bickering surrounding video games, it becomes easy to convince oneself of an almost total lack of choice or courage on the part of developers, as well as an unpleasant tendency of large publishers to always focus on products that are easy to understanding to open up as much as possible to the general public. This attitude does indeed exist and it would be naive to ignore it, but its obvious presence on the market does not necessarily imply that in a multicolored universe such as gaming, there is a lack of valuable alternatives. Year after year, in particular, we have witnessed numerous explosive phenomena linked to genres and games that until recently would have been almost impossible to brand as ~commercial successes~: soulslikes, old-fashioned western RPGs, immersive sims... experiences of rare depth (and sometimes even rare difficulty) suddenly topping the charts , or even capable of conquering legions of enduring fans comparable to those so desired by anyone still chasing the increasingly ephemeral chimera of live services. A particularly striking example? The Monster Hunters, which have gone from a reality almost exclusively limited to Japan to a series bordering on the mainstream, able to easily place millions of copies even on the western market. For heaven's sake, the Capcom saga was certainly not unknown in our parts, yet its deliberately convoluted nature and the general cumbersomeness of its primary aspects have always relegated it to a niche of enthusiasts. With Monster Hunter: World, however, things have changed completely, demonstrating once again how the user is perfectly capable of embracing complex realities without too many problems if welcomed by the right qualities. The popularity of the brand has become such that it has even led to an evolution of its rivals, in the past in turn relegated mostly to the Land of the Rising Sun. It is curious, however, that one of these ~new~ imitations belongs to the team we're talking about today, because Omega Force already tried to jump into this battlefield with Toukiden, albeit without being even remotely able to scratch the rival. Today the software house tries again to challenge the supremacy of Monster Hunter thanks to the support of Electronic Arts with what immediately seemed like a production with much more chance of success. We played it non-stop, completing the main campaign and facing several hours of the postgame, and in the Wild Hearts review we will tell you if Omega Force managed to surprise us. Fiction: The Way of Humans The world of Wild Hearts is a more curated fantasy reimagining of feudal Japan than we thought. But don't expect who knows what complex narrative, the basics are the usual For anyone who has dabbled in this kind of title since the very beginning, it might seem like a stretch to even dedicate a paragraph to the narrative element. After all, even if there has been a general effort to broaden this aspect - usually focusing on the characters or the scenic impact of the monsters - both Monster Hunters and their likes practically always tend to revolve around stripped-down plots, strongly secondary to the fulcrum represented by the player. Omega Force must have realized the situation, because Wild Hearts boasts a narrative cure that we really appreciated, in our opinion superior to that of the Capcom saga. We are certainly not faced with a complex story: the player takes on the role of a hunter who has come from distant lands, who suddenly comes into possession of a mysterious power that allows him to materialize powerful machines called karakuri out of nowhere, and finds himself having to save the isolated (and beautiful) town of Minato from the onslaught of huge monsters; only that the characters with whom you interact during the campaign are more human and characterized than expected, to the point of being able to raise the general bar practically alone. Minato is a gallery of unique personalities, outcasts and pariahs with often tormented histories, which are developed through simple but functional hunting missions. Not everything is perfect, of course, and it is not easy to relate to each inhabitant of this atypical mechanical city in the mountains in the same way, but the general care placed in the dialogues and in the delineation of the world has exceeded our initial expectations. Furthermore, the fact that this was successful despite the fact that the game tends to take itself very seriously, given that it is usually with the shortcut of humor that many shortcomings are bypassed, cannot be underestimated. Wild Hearts contributes to the overall quality of the experiencea, instead of representing only a negligible outline; the fulcrum of such a work, however, always remain gameplay and content, and it is precisely on these two elements that it is appropriate to deepen the analysis as much as possible, because what Omega Force has done is really worthy of discussion, albeit flawed in several respects. Gameplay: the way of Kemono Wild Hearts weapons are very diverse, and more technical than anticipated. Do you see this shuriken? It's actually a transformable cane, but it's not recommended for beginners The mechanics of a game of this type are certainly not easy to manage, also because we are talking about action with RPG elements that revolve around the clear diversification of the weapons available to the player, and epic battles against enemies that are practically always comparable to bosses. The uniqueness of the weapons that can be used is not just a matter of moves: each tool has specific systems, which completely change the approach to hunting and action, as well as requiring a long time to be fully mastered. Now, the case of Omega Force is particularly peculiar, because this team has always ~specialized~ in titles with incredibly intuitive and simplified gameplay (the entire Dynasty Warriors series, to say) and, despite having worked on numerous alternative projects over the years - including the Toukiden already mentioned at the beginning of the article - it was impossible not to have some reasonable doubts about their actual ability to tackle a similar job. Evidently, however, there are some big Monster Hunter enthusiasts in the team, as the weapons of Wild Hearts have been carefully calculated to offer an experience so close to those already known concocted by Capcom, but at the same time diversified enough to be completely fresh. The arc in Wild Hearts is pretty over the top. In these games ranged weapons are always very difficult to balance The weapons are eight and, although mechanically simpler than seen in the Monster Hunters (especially in the more recent chapters), they offer a fair amount of maneuvers. To give concrete examples, you will have at your disposal a katana capable of stretching and delivering enormous damage once a specific bar is loaded, as well as equipped with a circular slash with displacement and temporary invulnerability (does this remind you of something?); an umbrella with built-in parry and the ability to fly off heavy attacks; a bow with arrows of two types, one of which explosive if hit with the second, and so on, for a truly enviable general variety. The only problem? Try as they may, the developers of Omega Force clearly don't have Capcom's years of experience in this specific field, and therefore they fell quite badly on the balance. Of course, even the Monster Hunters have never been perfectly calibrated - at high levels there have been weapons since the very beginning that are clearly more effective than the others for the damage inflicted, when not even excessive - yet the many choices available in that series offer the most times comparable means, so much so that in Monster Hunter Rise almost every weapon boasts multiple defensive styles and mechanics that easily adapt to the tendencies of any player. Here things are more basic, and in the initial stages of the campaign it is really easier to use certain weapons than others, with the more technical and slow ones being particularly disadvantaged. To clarify, if to effectively use the huge and heavy nodachi it is mandatory to perfectly manage both positioning and dodging, due to the very slow charged attack of the weapon and its non-negligible consumption of stamina, the same certainly cannot be said for the bow, which can do enormous damage simply by firing arrows in bursts and changing style in an instant after a reposition, or for the knife claw which allows you to literally flutter around the monster without much risk after beating it for a while (besides grant air movement superior to that of any other weapon in the middle of combos). Things get even worse with technical weapons that leave you exposed like the karakuri staff, where the parry of the umbrella can save the life in bursts of anyone with decent timing in defensive maneuvers. In short, in Wild Hearts the distance between ~weapons for experts and beginners~ is abysmal and this is further amplified by two other factors: the aggressiveness of the enemies and the possibility of using karakuri in battle, with the latter in particularly fundamental to the entire combat system. An experienced player will probably find the game easy for a while. Certain difficulty spikes will change your mind, tincluding the wolf cub you see in this image Let's start with the Kemono, because these huge monsters capable of unleashing the forces of nature are much more aggressive and vicious than we anticipated. The average difficulty level of this game, in fact, is almost immediately comparable to the Master Rank (or G Rank, according to your preferences) if you play it alone, given that Omega Force has tried in every way to put field exhilarating fights with variable offensive patterns and difficult to get around. Ok, anyone who gets away with dodging can clearly stem everything, but we are talking about monsters sometimes capable of performing real combinations of moves, with monstrous damage dealt if you don't prepare your equipment properly. For the record, there are some sharp dangerousness imbalances here too, as the ~stars~ that indicate a monster's strength seemed roughly distributed at times, and we found a couple of specific Kemono markedly more brutal and unmanageable than even the final boss. It's a shame that the balance of the experience is so off, because overall it's a real pleasure to play this title, and we found its battles to be largely adrenaline-pumping and entertaining; however, the culprit is not only the team, because these imbalances are largely caused by the biggest distinctive element of this game: the karakuri, in fact. More gameplay: the way of the Karakuri Wild Hearts karakuri have a myriad of different features, but you'll have to unlock them gradually throughout the campaign The machines that the player can materialize during the hunt are not a simple side dish: Omega Force has finely woven them into the mesh of the system, making them practically indispensable to dominate the game. Remember when we told you about monster aggression? Know that every single creature can be contained in some way through the karakuri, and that some of them are literally direct counters to certain special attacks, capable of stunning them for several (and precious) seconds. On the other hand, the cubes and springs that can be equipped at the beginning of the campaign are only the tip of the iceberg, given that by advancing from hunt to hunt the basic karakuri become six - four are those that can be used simultaneously - and that it is possible to combine them to obtain more complex machinery with sometimes devastating effects. Struggling with a giant hedgehog with an unfortunate tendency to roll over on you? There is an elastic karakuri that hurls him and any other ~charge~ away with ease; flying monsters? Fireworks, harpoons or repeating crossbows; beasts too mobile? Presses that lock them to the ground or explosive mines. The options are many, and once mastered they really allow you to manage the hunting times almost at will, constantly stunning the Kemono and responding to their every maneuver. Furthermore, using the karakuri is immediate and easy, due to a very successful construction system with combinations that are always visible on the screen, which guarantees to compose any machine with great speed as soon as you reach a flat area. The beauty is that the Omega Forces have doubly linked these miracles of wooden engineering also to weapons, since practically every blade or mace in the game boasts moves directly related to the use of one of these tools, and using them wisely even bypasses the weaknesses of use that we had described before . Anyone with mobility issues can therefore abuse certain karakuri to move faster while holding charges, while some weapons literally change state and shape if you use their attack after a jump on a cube or a spring press (this is particularly useful with the convertible cane, for example). We believe it is also for this reason that the weapons initially seem so unbalanced: some of them show their maximum potential only once the right combinations have been unlocked; however, the fact remains that the karakuri must be obtained by advancing in the campaign, therefore the basic progression was in our opinion calculated a little better. The maps are deliberately extended, because thanks to the karakuri you can navigate them much faster than normal. Place them wisely however, or you'll have to make long walks to the targets Obviously, when the number of factors at play increases to this level, balancing things becomes even more complicated, and we honestly believe that some karakuri are far too efficient and abusable. At the very least, Omega Force has attempted to smooth things over by putting in some clever limitations. In fact, most of the karakuri are destructible if they are not used in direct conjunction with the attack for which they are pe", "date": "2023-02-16", "grade": "8.0"}
