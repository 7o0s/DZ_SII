{"name": "Nascar 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nascar-08-recensione.html", "text": "Juan Plablo Montoya, an old acquaintance of Formula 1 enthusiasts, heads smiling on the Italian cover of Nascar 08, the latest racing game produced by the Electronic Arts sports division. The Colombian driver, although gifted with great talent, decided to leave the circus because things with his new team (McLaren) weren't going well at all. And so he returned to the Nascar championship, completely different from Formula 1 in every respect: the cars are covered, almost fifty competitors participate in each race and the circuits are mostly simple ovals, because what matters in Nascar is not set the corners well, but go faster than the others. Game mode After selecting the 50 or 60 Hz display mode (the game also supports wide screen, fortunately), the starting screen of Nascar 08 allows us to choose whether to make a quick race, access the career mode (called in this case ~Earn Your Stripes~) or to the other game possibilities. The latter also include an entire Nascar championship: you choose the driver from those available (all real) with the relative team, then you face all the races of the year in sequence with the aim of being crowned champions. There are four different car categories to choose from, and in career mode this division will be clear to us from the start, as we'll start in the least popular league and then acquire the necessary licenses to move up to a higher category. In the meantime, we will be busy with all the races on the calendar and our virtual agent will take care (via email...) of encouraging us or letting us know when it's time to try a license test. The game includes a racing simulation system, in the sense that it is possible to skip an event and let the software determine the final order of arrival, based on the statistics valid up to that moment: a way like any other to ~save time~ when we are eager to get back on top, perhaps. There is also the possibility of buying upgrades for the car, spending the money earned with victories, and thus improve the characteristics of the engine, steering wheel, brakes and so on. These changes are absolutely necessary in order to pass the really difficult licensing tests. On the track! Before participating in any race, we will be able to adjust various aspects of it: duration, level of realism, presence or absence of driving aids, fuel and tire consumption, etc. When we're ready, we'll be able to do some test laps on the track (to understand more about how to set the length of the gears), adjust the last things on the car and finally leave for the qualifying session or directly with the race. The control system adopted by Nascar 08 is similar to that seen in racing games for next gen consoles, in the sense that the default setting sees the accelerator on the R2 back button and the brake on L2, while the gears are changed with the R1 and L1 keys. The main buttons of the Dual Shock 2 are used to operate the brake to hand, engage reverse gear and change the view (the ones available are the usual ones: from behind near and far, inside the car or in absolute first person). The left stick obviously controls the steering, while the right one serves to control the opponents and allows us to quickly wade back or to the sides of our vehicle. At the bottom of the screen are the usual indicators: tachometer, speedometer (only in miles per hour, absurd), gear engaged and a strange rewind symbol. What is it for? Well, similar to what we've seen in other racing games, Nascar 08 includes a kind of ~second chance~, in the sense that you can go back in time a few seconds to recover from an event that could compromise the race, such as a huge accident. This is an element that helps make the experience less frustrating, especially when you end up in a collision through no fault of your own. Technical realization On a technical level, Nascar 08 is made up of ups and downs. It's certainly not the most aesthetically beautiful racing game seen on PS2, but on its side it has a graphics engine that manages to keep the frame rate stable despite the fact that there are almost fifty cars on the track at the same time. The thing is made easier by several factors, in truth: the ring circuits allow to avoid pop-up effects, there are very few elements outside the track to move and the level of detail in general is very low. The cars are the best thing to see, with the dozens and dozens of advertisements applied to every inch of the bodywork, and there's a nice ~speed~ effect that distorts, with tedge of blur, the edges of our car and those of the opponents (the thing is adjustable, however). It's a pity that speed, the real one, is not the prerogative of Nascar 08, which never manages to make sense of the 300-plus km/h that graze on the long straights with an adequate response on the screen. The sound sector is the usual of EA Sports titles, with a series of rock songs placed there to soundtrack the races, where the effects do not shine for realism or variety. Comment Nascar 08 is a decent racing game, which absolutely does not hold a candle to the best exponents of the genre on PS2 but which represents a sensible second choice in many ways. Almost identical to the 2007 version (but this is not new at EA), the game has a large number of modes on its side and a rather full-bodied and engaging career, capable of entertaining even those who have never watched it for a while. a Nascar race in his life (and it is supposed that in Italy the thing is quite widespread). Unfortunately, a localization in Italian is completely missing except in the packaging and in the manual (it is even not possible to set the display of the speedometer in km/h...), while the technical aspect is functional to the action and nothing more. Pros: Lots of game modes Almost all real circuits and almost all real drivers Linear but quite fun races Cons: Slow and fast graphics After a while it gets repetitive Almost identical to the previous edition", "date": "2007-10-08", "grade": null}
