Six months that have also given the members of the Critical Thought Games team the opportunity to develop what stands as an extra episode of the series rather than a real sequel. We are precisely talking about geoDefense Swarm, which in no way distorts the mechanics of the original game but enriches them with new important elements. First of all we can adjust the degree of global difficulty between the two available, which basically make the opponents more resistant to our attacks, then try our hand at thirty different stages divided between the three levels easy, medium and hard. Each stage has its own story and presents a different map, with entry and exit points for the enemies we have to block. The number of towers has been increased by one (therefore there are now a total of seven) and their capabilities immediately appear very different: there are simple cannons, lasers, missile launchers, turrets that emit d shock or electric shock, etc. Each of them can be upgraded up to a certain point, improving in effectiveness and range, through the usual simple and immediate interface, which allows us to place the towers, select them, upgrade them and possibly ~sell~ them with just the pressure of a finger on the touch screen. It doesn't go through here If you've played geoDefense before, you know what the game is all about: the goal in each stage is to eliminate all enemies trying to move from entry points to exit points. Our turrets are a bit like the extreme defense line, beyond which there is nothing left, so if ten hostile units manage to leave the stage, you incur game over. Losing a game with geoDefense Swarm is not something unusual, indeed it is part of an essential learning process to understand how to move to complete missions; even the level of difficulty, calibrated upwards, makes the product basically aimed at experts of the genre. We can't place an infinite number of towers in the first place: their cost varies according to the characteristics and you also have to pay to upgrade them, but the money is earned only by destroying enemies. A circular procedure that during the action allows us to make changes on the fly to our deployment, perhaps taking advantage of the seconds that divide each opposing wave. The stages are mainly open and without real obstacles, so it's up to us to try to ~channel~ the flow of enemy units in order to better manage their advance. The graphical interface is extremely clear and shows us at all times how many waves are left at the end of the stage, how much money we have and what our current score is. Speaking of scoring, the game integrates an OpenFeint player which takes care of inserting our records in the online rankings, manages our possible friends list and adds, in short, that pinch of ~social networking~ to the product... while waiting for the developers think about how to introduce a possible online multiplayer. Nice looking strategy geoDefense Warm is the classic video game that would conquer even with very simple graphics, but this is not the case. The game boasts a high quality technical realization, dominated by wireframe polygons that move fluidly on the screen and project spectacular rays of light: our projectiles intertwine, hit the target and cause really well done particle explosions. The scenarios are clearly bare, mostly empty spaces marked by hexagonal boxes in which some detachment element appears only occasionally. The use of colors is the best possible, characterized by a clear psychedelic edge; the final effect is therefore not dissimilar to that of Geometry Wars for Xbox 360. As far as the sound is concerned, the atmosphere created is typically ~spatial~, with long silences that are broken by highly reverberated effects, voices included. Thinking about it, a ~weighty~ musical accompaniment could represent the icing on the cake for the Critical Thought Games product: we hope that this will be considered for the next episodes.
