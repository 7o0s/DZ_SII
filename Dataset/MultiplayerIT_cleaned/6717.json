In short, not exactly what can be defined as a rocket start for the new adventure of the blue hedgehog from SEGA, which already did not enjoy the favor of the predictions due to a development entrusted to the newcomer BigRedButton instead of the historic Sonic Team. As if all this were not enough, the game was released to the press with a mysterious delay, well after its release date in stores, a factor that has cast further shadows on its actual value. Has Sonic Boom managed to be stronger than the difficulties that marked its birth? Let's start badly The answer, unfortunately, is a categorical, unappealable and disconsolate no. Sonic Boom looks like a bad project across the board, a failure that has its roots in a cumbersome design and finds its full fulfillment in an almost depressing technical realization. It would be unfair to put all the blame on the developers of BigRedButton - it is clear that they were not put in the best conditions to work on the title they had in mind - but it hurts to admit that even without all the gross flaws that afflict it, Sonic Boom probably would not have been still a good game. In fact, there are many, too many structural deficiencies that emerge when playing the SEGA product, such as to lead one to think that the first fatal mistakes were made precisely during the creative phases that gave birth to the project. Beyond the look of the characters (which you may or may not like and which is in any case linked to the homonymous television series to which the title is combined), Sonic Boom appears as a foreign body compared to the tradition of the series especially for the setting of the gameplay : totally abandoned the intuitions of the imperfect but coherent Sonic Lost World, the work of BigRedButton has concentrated on the creation of a classic 3D action / platform, conceptually closer to Jak & Daxter than to the past of the blue hedgehog. The focus has therefore been shifted from pure speed to exploration, for an adventure that offers even rather extensive scenarios in which the user is encouraged to roam freely in search of rings and various collectibles, alternately controlling the four protagonists Sonic, Knuckles, Amy and Tails, fighting enemies that stand in their way and occasionally solving some simple environmental puzzles. A setting that is already questionable in itself, especially for the most intransigent Sonic fans, which however definitively collapses under the weight of a devastating series of macroscopic design errors. It takes a certain skill to create a fun and varied world to explore, a feature that the developers of BigRedButton evidently lacked: the settings are as extensive as they are poor in content, and the few things they offer to do soon turn out to be completely useless in the game economy. Why waste time collecting the many rings scattered around (which here act as an indicator of the protagonist's vital energy) if once the maximum value is reached, the counter stops and there is no further reason to justify the accumulation? Why go looking for gear to spend on character upgrades or scenario modifications when the impact on gameplay is practically zero? Why engage in boring side quests when the rewards are completely insignificant? Why have four characters on the screen at the same time selectable at will when the game very rarely offers real opportunities to exploit the specific characteristics of each of them? These and many others are the questions that arise when playing Sonic Boom and which unfortunately all find an answer in the bitter observation of a play structure that leaks from all sides. Sonic Boom unfortunately turns out to be one of the worst games in the history of the blue hedgehog Few ideas but confused It must be said that not all the ideas put in place by BigRedButton were wrong from the start, but it is sad to note that even those that are valid on paper have found such a poor realization or afflicted by technical problems. The combat phases, which in theory should have given variety to the title, stand out in particular as the least successful element of Sonic Boom: the enemies - already afflicted by an extremely repetitive look - require too many hits to be knocked down, and the aggravating of the very modest set of offensive moves available to the protagonists causes chand the battles soon become a real nuisance to be avoided as much as possible. The energy beams that can be used by the four characters (always praised as one of the key elements of the game) play an absolutely marginal role in the playful economy, serving only to hang themselves from special hooks, to attract opponents to themselves or to pull the levers, without that not an ounce of creative effort has been expended to make their presence more interesting. Finally, the commendable intuition of interspersing the game action with sections that make an alternative use of the protagonists' abilities or that involve the use of vehicles collides with a palpable inability on the part of the developers to manage ways and times: most of the sometimes these situations prove to be totally devoid of bite or worse, they stretch out of proportion, even becoming nauseating. In the context of an already decidedly disheartening picture, BigRedButton has even managed to ruin what has always been Sonic's ABC, or the expression of speed on linear paths. While favoring the exploratory component, in fact, Sonic Boom often offers moments in which the protagonists (framed from a view from behind or in a side-scrolling scenario reminiscent of the 2D debuts of the series) slip into tracks to be covered at full speed between loops, jumps, obstacles to avoid and so on: a pity that in such situations the - bad - implementation of the CryEngine by the developers literally gives the worst of itself, with a frame rate that falls well below the threshold of acceptability making the whole thing a confusing mess that hurts the eyes as much as the heart. The long list of gameplay defects from which the SEGA product suffers is finally completed by a level of challenge that borders on absolute zero: it is not clear whether it was a deliberate move to approach the very young target for which the game is intended or if it is yet another error of evaluation, the fact is that in Sonic Boom defeat does not exist, given that once the rings are exhausted, you start again exactly from the point where you fell, without any disadvantages. Even moving to the audiovisual sector, it is still difficult to find something to save in the disastrous BigRedButton project: despite not having encountered the bugs highlighted by the videos that have appeared on the internet in recent weeks, it must be said that Sonic Boom is as lacking from a technical point of view as the it is from a purely playful point of view. The camera is never where it should be, the polygonal models are modest, the VFX looks raw beyond belief and the general definition of the textures seems that of a product of a couple of generations old. Not that the sound is better, with trivial, repetitive and completely devoid of bite music, very poor effects and an even annoying dubbing in Italian, with the characters who don't stay silent for a second and punctuate every action they perform with useless comments.", "date": "2014-12-01", "grade": "4.0"}
