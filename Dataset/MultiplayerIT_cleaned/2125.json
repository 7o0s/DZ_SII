{"name": "Crusader Kings 3: Northern Lords", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crusader-kings-3-northern-lords-recensione.html", "text": "Crusader Kings 3: Northern Lords is the first paid DLC of the Paradox strategy. This is perhaps the most relevant information of the entire review, given that in fact we are dealing with a minor addition, what the developers themselves define as a simple ~Flavor pack~, i.e. a package of contents that rely on the base game by introducing only a new culture, in this case that of the Norse civilization. If we want the same price of  6.99 already suggests that it is not a revolutionary content, but an addition designed for those who love a certain type of scenario. So, in fact, if you don't like the idea of playing a Nordic ruler, you can avoid reading further and go directly to something else, because in terms of game mechanics you will find absolutely nothing new. Contents After the installation of Crusader Kings 3: Northern Lords the map of the selection of the rulers is enriched by a new territory: that of the current Norway. The Norse rulers have their own peculiar appearance: in general they appear as rougher than the rulers of the southern lands, dressed in skins, however refined and worked, and often accompanied by long beards. Let's say that for the most part they respect the iconography of the classic Nordic king, not only in appearance, but also in character. What makes this DLC interesting, despite its limitations, is precisely the ability it shows to be able to tell and make people understand the differences that could exist in reigning in areas that are often so inhospitable, compared to doing so in more friendly territories from the point of view of resources and connections, difficulties that made it vital to demonstrate an iron fist to keep the situation under control. In this sense Paradox has managed to make the new rulers and their specific problems convincing, also demonstrating how versatile the Crusader Kings 3 game system is. Also interesting is the work of cultural reconstruction done through historical texts, which makes the games truly engaging, between specific dynastic legacies, characteristic events such as judicial duels, or unique units such as berserkers. In general we have noticed a greater focus on the war side than what happens with other rulers and other territories, precisely to respect some precepts of Nordic culture, but otherwise the game is exactly what we have come to know and love in its basic version , so much so that after installing the DLC you have no problem experimenting with the new contents, beyond having to understand the slightly different logic that governs the new territories compared to all the others. The new music deserves a separate note, all inspired by Norse folk songs, which help a lot to enter the atmosphere sought by the developers with Northern Lords. Nothing vital, but definitely an extra package that doesn't make you regret the money spent, unless you viscerally hate Vikings and the like.", "date": "2021-03-16", "grade": "7.0"}
