On the one hand those who appreciated it as a satisfactory recovery of the Banjo-Kazooie tradition, on the other those who invariably highlighted its shortcomings and less brilliance than the illustrious progenitors to whom reference was made. As we will explain in our review, with Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair the development team has preferred to partially change course, translating gameplay mechanics and the game world from the original 3D structure to a traditional two-dimensional approach, combined with a peculiar map management which essentially serves as from an interactive central hub. If the previous episode was clearly a tribute to one of the most iconic series born from RARE, this new chapter is evidently influenced above all by brilliant two-dimensional platformers such as Rayman Origin/Legends and Donkey Kong Country Returns/Tropical Freeze. While waiting for its debut on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, let's try to understand how Playtonic Games' new adventure behaves. Yooka and Laylee grappling with Capital B's Impossible Lair As it is logical to expect from a platformer equipped with the aforementioned characteristics, the narrative premises of Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair are quite generic. After having survived the previous clash with the two heroes, the evil Capital B intends to use the Hive Mind to put the kingdom in check; it will be up to the two unlikely heroes to do their utmost to recover the entire battalion of bees in the service of Queen Phoebee, so that they can overcome the Impossible Lair and put an end to the threat once and for all. The unsuccessful initial clash is resolved with the user landing on a map with an interactive structure, from which it is possible to unlock and access the individual levels that make up the game, but not only. The ultimate goal is precisely to release the members of the militia who have remained imprisoned in each of these stages, which can be accessed by activating luminous books positioned in various places in the central hub. The Impossible Lair can be played over and over again at any point in the campaign, however retrieving the Beettalions is the only way to progressively increase your chances of success. The greater the amount of militias rescued and housed near the decisive battlefield, the longer the shield that is able to preserve the two nice protagonists after crossing the threshold of the most impervious terrain of the whole game will last. Alternate gameplay While once again sinking its roots in the tradition of the platform genre, the particularity of Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair refers more than anything else to the presence of a hybrid structure. From the point of view of the gameplay we have in fact available a multitude of pleasant and well thought out 2.5D levels, full of obstacles, enemies to juggle and collectibles to identify, in turn contextualized within an interactive map with three dimensions that the player can freely explore using an overhead view with a fixed shot. In this case the interactions are mainly entrusted to the resolution of puzzles and other small interactions capable of influencing the morphology and appearance of the places in various ways. By doing so it is therefore possible to access new sections, unlocking levels to which access was initially denied. One of these criteria, for example, involves completing some challenges, more specifically individual two-dimensional screens, in which Yooka and her partner Laylee must do their utmost to clean up the screen from the enemies present on site without being overwhelmed. The completion of these tasks thus determines multiple alterations to the structure of the hub, admitting the activation of those new elements that prove to be fundamental in order to proceed on one's path. In other cases, real puzzle sections are available which provide for the arrangement and movement of crates or other objects, as well as the use of some fruits with variable properties - for example explosives or water-based ones - which allow you to actively intervene on the surrounding environment, precisely expanding the range of exploration. Exploration which, moreover, is also interspersed with a sort of toll to be paid on several occasions in order to be able to cross some gates that prevent entry to the subsequent areas of the map. To do this, all you have to do is invest the collected coins, sweating thereand proverbial seven shirts, while completing the traditional side-scrolling levels. Yooka and Laylee can also rely on a range of Tonics - which can also be progressively unlocked during the exploration phases - which, after being purchased in exchange for feathers, must be equipped in order to obtain specific advantages. At first, up to a maximum of three slots are available, which can be modified to your liking before entering each level. The new 3D structure used by Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair therefore has the advantage to exclude some of the problems that afflicted the previous chapter, in this case the difficulties in managing the animations and the camera. Predictably, the presence of a rather negligible writing of the texts remains: the dialogues that can be undertaken with the characters encountered on the map - entirely in English - do not prove to be particularly stimulating or memorable. It is true that the latter remains a point of modest importance in relation to what is expected of a product of this nature. In our opinion, however, the most successful portion of the game remains the side-scrolling one, characterized by a good level design and a more than satisfactory variety both in the composition and in the exquisitely aesthetic aspect of the levels that you have the pleasure of crossing to bring back to free Phoebee's army. The structure is very classic, so all you have to do is go through each stage from an entry point to an exit point, taking care to recover as many feathers and coins as possible that you can then invest once you return to the hub. Laylee basically acts as a support, since when she is on Yooka's head she preserves her health in case a mistake is made. Once hit, he will start fluttering like a maniac and you will have to try to catch him again to enjoy the lost advantage again. In this sense, the peculiarity of the game is inherent in the changing structure of the levels, variable precisely by virtue of the interactions and modifications that the player can make on the interactive map. Once activated, these alternative situations involve a range of alterations, mostly based on environmental factors - for example the activation of the wind, the introduction of ice or water - or on other variables as in the case of the Wilder level, where enemies grow considerably in number and are noticeably more aggressive.", "date": "2019-10-03", "grade": "8.5"}
