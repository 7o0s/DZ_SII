{"name": "Viva le ruote grasse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130873-trials-fusion-viva-le-ruote-grasse.html", "text": "Trials Fusion represents a fundamental moment for the developer RedLynx, called to try his hand at the so-called next-gen for the first time and at the same time to demonstrate how the series now in its third chapter (five, considering the first two for PC) still actually has more of something to say. Not a small effort, because if it is true that the landing on the new consoles is mainly a source of enthusiasm both for the developers and for the public, on the other hand the re-proposition of yet another episode of a franchise exploited quite intensely (precisely with three episodes in less than five years) may cause some concern. Really, how much more can you get out of the concept of a racing game with trial bikes on ever more absurd and complex courses? Legitimate question, to which the Finnish boys try to give an answer... Trials Fusion is an excellent new chapter in the series without big news. Is that enough for you? Soaring Perhaps the simplest and most effective way to give a luster and a patina of freshness to a new exponent of a series is to change the setting and the environment. Following this path, RedLynx has consequently thrown Trials into the time capsule by moving the hands to an earlier future, thus abandoning the contemporaneity of the previous episodes in favor of a science fiction key. A choice destined, apparently, to act as a watershed with the past, to therefore clearly represent a new phase of life for the franchise. Therefore, the tracks are no longer amidst mud, car wrecks and dust, but pass through aseptic metal walkways, shiny steel platforms, glass, lights, LEDs and everything needed to compose the most classic and recognized idea of what will await us in a few decades. A predominance of clean lines, stylized structures, with the color palette tending towards cold colors on the scale of blue, green and purple: the result is pleasant, intriguing, even if the impression is that some of the personality of the game has been lost in favor of slightly more banal and stereotyped solutions. Fortunately, the probable awareness of this prompted RedLynx to try to find a compromise, a point of contact between the past and the future, placing some tracks in decidedly not ~spatial~ locations: between canyons, cities, caves, lakes and woods, Trials Fusion can count again on a remarkable aesthetic variety, which helps to support progression by fueling the player's curiosity to see ~what's next~. From a purely technical point of view, however, the PlayStation 4 version we tested is undoubtedly the reference in the console field, thanks to the native 1080p; on the contrary, on Xbox One the resolution stops at 800p (which became 900p thanks to the day one patch) while on Xbox 360 we are satisfied with 720p. Fortunately, 60 frames per second should instead be guaranteed on all platforms, which is essential to offer the same gaming experience regardless of the hardware used. The polygonal engine of the Finnish team, in this next gen guise, proves to be all in all discreet without surprising; the points of connection with the previous generation are more than evident, for a title that is undoubtedly more than pleasant if understood as a digital delivery game, a little less instead looking at it in its unprecedented retail guise. Therefore, if the good complexity of the settings, the appreciable level of detail and the discreet (albeit fluctuating) lighting management contribute positively to the glance, conversely unpleasant and recurring texture loading phenomena leave some perplexity regarding the optimization of the code on the new consoles, which certainly don't lack the skills to avoid such flaws. What a hurry but where are you running? But the gameplay? Well, there's little to discuss here: it's Trials. If with the previous releases you think you have reached the saturation level, you can safely move on. But if instead the idea of repeating dozens, if not hundreds of times the same track in order to improve your time and maybe overtake a friend in the standings still excites you, then in Trials Fusion you will undoubtedly find bread for your teeth. The trial & error formula and the physical model have remained substantially intact, guaranteeing an absolutely familiar experience to fans of the series: perfect dosage of accelerator and brake and optimal management of the shifting of the rider's weight are the key points to be assimilated in the best possible way reduce (but certainly not eliminate) repeated close encounters with the ground. Despite the years and episodes have passed, essentially always playing at the stit game, nevertheless the gameplay of RedLynx continues to prove to be intriguing, interesting and challenging like few others, albeit with a track design that seemed slightly less inspired than in the past. Sure, you need to have an aptitude for perfectionism and a certain masochistic taste, but with these requisites the hours spent shaving off pennies are guaranteed. Also because Trials Fusion is certainly not a game poor in content: although the total number of tracks in the career is not sensational (but obviously the ~interests~ of the Season Pass take over here), the variety of modes can easily make up for this lack. The skill challenges, the mini-games, the customization of motorcycles and avatars but above all the track editor significantly extend the longevity. As usual, the community will hopefully become an almost inexhaustible source of new tracks, while multiplayer - this time only locally - can offer more than a few satisfactions. Among the novelties, it should be noted the inclusion of the quads as an unprecedented means available: the differences when driving are perceived considerably, both for their weight and for the four-wheel drive which makes their use rather accessible. On the other hand, the inclusion of tricks, or the evolutions in flight to be performed with the right stick, was less successful: a certain general imprecision and the questionable amalgam with the main gameplay makes the levels based on them probably the least successful and fun. Finally, a note regarding the sales channel, where RedLynx (or more likely Ubisoft) has chosen to change something compared to the past: in addition to the distribution through the online stores of Sony and Microsoft, Trials Fusion this time is also sold in a retail version , therefore a physical copy, at a higher price which however also includes the Season Pass, through which you can download the additional packages destined to be released in the future. All in all, an understandable and positive decision, which in any case leaves the user with the possibility of choosing and in the meantime acts as a test bed to verify the success of the franchise on the shelves of traditional shops.", "date": "2014-04-18", "grade": "8.4"}
