In this case the source of inspiration is World of Warcraft whose winning formula, reinterpreted in a free-to-play mobile key, has guaranteed Gameloft a substantial success that has brought us up to this sequel. It is not surprising that the formula is faithful to that of the first chapter but the news is there and could prove to be quite important. First of all, you can also play with a mobile connection, without the need for Wi-Fi, and the developers have worked on the interface to make it more usable and intuitive. But let's start calmly. Once the title has started, a simple introduction underlined by an epic fanfare takes us back to the world of Haradon, 600 years after the events of the first title, and precedes a short tutorial that also shows us a charismatic boss. Having overcome what is little more than a formality, we finally arrive at the creation of the character that allows us to choose the race between humans, mendels, orcs, kratans and elves who can pursue the career of warrior, ranger, Bloody knight, monk and wizard. Finally, to close it all, there is a minimum customization which unfortunately is limited to hair, colors and some details of the face. Having created an ogre ranger, we then launched into the action alongside other fearless heroes who have begun to take their first steps in the same situation. But we haven't seen the crush of players like many MMOs do and it's likely that, given Order & Chaos' high player count, it's down to how the world is divided into instances. In any case, despite having to face a perceptible latency, we managed to complete the entire first string of quests without incurring too many setbacks. At this point our ranger has started to take shape: until recently we were forced to shoot volleys of arrows a few millimeters from the monsters' muzzles and now thanks to the possibility of slowing them down we can finally avoid a few too many blows. After a very successful first chapter Gameloft returns to the field with Order & Chaos II: Redemption Full featured mobile MMO The interface has improved significantly and goes very well with the classic and decidedly simple gameplay based on automatic aiming and various skills based on a cooldown system. At the bottom right are the main skills, including attack and jump, while below is the classic bar with four sliding tables that can house actions and skills. In addition, the screen is literally full of icons that allow instant access to all the necessary functions, prizes, the auction and all the extras of the monetization system. Fortunately, visibility remains good even on a small smartphone and where the screen is too full of objects to allow us to use the point and click movement, it is possible to resort to the dynamic directional cross that appears in the left half of the screen. To interact with other players there is a convenient radial menu that can be purchased by clicking on them and a line of blue dots clearly indicates the direction to take to follow a quest. Finally, in case of geographical doubts, there is a simple and understandable map that gradually expands and guides us towards missions ranging from the simple collection of resources to slightly more complex but never too long chains. Usability, on the other hand, is the soul of Order & Chaos II: Redemption. In a few tens of minutes it is possible to reach the fifth level and access the dungeons alone with a simple click on an icon that appears on the right side of the screen, while reaching the sixth level allows you to build equipment or upgrade the hereditary weapon obtained at the fifth level . Instead at the tenth level it is possible to launch into PvP tournaments to lead hands at will and once you reach the fifteenth level it is possible to access the classic dungeons to be faced in groups. Solo dungeons are specifically created for those with little time to spare as well as access to the auction without needing to reach out to the auctioneer which is only required to put something up for sale. Also there are instant missions that are activated by simply arriving in the area, cutting the dialogue. A dark cloud Despite the inopportune and often substantial frame drops, Order & Chaos II: Redemption can still count on a more than valid graphic rendering while running on a large number of not too modern devices. Furthermore the bosses, which represent the artistic peak of the production, are quite complex and show, like the character models, signs of a professional identityfirst detaching itself, at least in part, from the imagery of World of Warcraft. The inspiration, as in the case of the gameplay, remains evident and there are many who do not find this way of working of Gameloft pleasant but this type of approach often gives us mobile experiences with an above-average thickness even if still intended for an audience more casual like Order & Chaos II: Redemption which does not aim to innovate, does not dwell too much on the narrative dimension and does not offer a particularly complicated experience. But it is a well-made, enjoyable MMORPG, structured to be accessible and fully usable from a mobile device. And this is the strong point of a game that still does not give up on crafting, world bosses, mounts, full support for guilds, group dungeons and farming. With the Gameloft title you can lose an entire night's sleep turning over in the blankets to avoid back pain just as you can face a dungeon in the space of a train journey or you can complete a quest while waiting for the dentist. In short, the overall judgment should be positive even if by raising one's gaze to the sky the classic cloud full of rain appears. Putting aside slowdowns, some latency problems and the originality disputes, let's talk about what for many is the only real problem of Order & Chaos 2. Let's talk about the free-to-play mechanics that can prove to be binding to say the least . In fact, having reached level 20, the vigor that is necessary to complete a mission begins to decrease and this dynamic risks castrating the gameplay of those quest enthusiasts who have no intention of shelling out money to access the VIP system. Fortunately, the dungeons still allow us to gain experience, allowing us to continue playing, but this is an important limitation that has also triggered several complaints on the official forums. The same goes for voice chat which in an MMO is a lack that should not be underestimated even if the ears can still count on a powerful and well-made soundtrack.", "date": "2015-09-24", "grade": "8.0"}
