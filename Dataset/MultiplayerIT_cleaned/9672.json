{"name": "For those about to rock!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82157-rock-band-3-for-those-about-to-rock.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360 The crisis of musical genres has been talked about for months now. Too many titles marketed every year, too many different versions, but all too similar in content, which made someone think that the unstoppable diffusion had stopped. The response of the two giants on the field this year is diametrically opposite with Guitar Hero which aims to reinvigorate playability and the single player mode, sinking its teeth into the customs of the genre, and with this Rock Band 3 which, after the interlude dedicated to the Beatles , try to blur the lines between real and simulated playing with an innovative game mode and brand new set of instruments. Entering the rehearsal room requires a large investment in terms of time and money, but the intelligence and creativity with which Harmonix has tackled this task is astounding. Watch out for the expense The structure of Rock Band 3 has been refined rather than changed. You enter a virtual group and play a series of concerts scattered across the United States, trying to gather an ever-increasing number of fans and the status of international music stars, thanks to a repertoire of 83 songs ranging from pop, in homage to the new 25-key keyboard, to classic and avant-garde Rock, for a solid and diversified selection of songs (also fun to play, for those wondering). The idea that works is that of having shifted the attention from the series of concerts to be ringed, which also exist in the form of challenges that can be accessed by different steps of accumulated fans, on a plethora of objectives to be achieved, each for the different instruments, which keep the interest high and which divide the songs by difficulty, style and, even tutorials. In this way, every single step taken leads to the growth of the band's glory and one feels stimulated to try every song proposed on multiple levels, feeling a constant growth in the game, even if all the trappings surrounding the ~life~ of the group are really been cut to the bone. Having said that, those who want a new episode of Rock Band and have already bought the 2, eager only for new songs to play, should know that the songs to download from the endless queue of those available online are more than enough, given that this third chapter, essentially, it adds nothing to the series. The real novelty are the Pro modes, the keyboard and the six-string guitar (plastic, but which can be easily, and better, played with a plectrum) developed by MadCatz and sold separately for around 79 euros and 150 euros. respectively. Looking forward to the metal string Fender which will probably go around 300 and can also be played plugged into a real amp. We're talking a lot of money, no doubt, but what you get in return remakes the genre from the ground up and puts a new perspective, that of a soft approach to music and the dexterity necessary to play it with a couple of the most popular, albeit with a series of due clarifications. As if it were true! The keyboard, for which 63 of the 83 songs provide the necessary parts to play, in basic mode, constitutes the easiest version of the classic Rock Band gameplay, since there are 5 keys of the 25 deputies to the usual colors to press at the right time and which, therefore, does not even require the use of two hands as for the guitar (the left for the keys to be pressed and the right for the picking). In this mode, therefore, it is almost a step backwards, rather than a novelty. By nature, however, and for how Harmonix has managed to solve the ~reading~ of the keys and notes to be pressed during a song, with the keys to be struck that light up at the right moment, in Pro mode, the keyboard is placed there with the battery in the first place of the likelihood with the real counterpart. The tutorials are well structured and introduce anyone to the fundamentals of the instrument in just a few steps, and the different levels of difficulty available for each song allow anyone to try their hand at feeling even more like a true musician. Each individual song can be played in practice mode, with the game highlighting the hand position and keys to press for each note, and pausing, waiting for the player to become familiar with the required key combination. An approach for everyone, therefore, emphasizing that, even at the beginner level, it is a more complex playability than the one we have come to know in the series of musical games of recent years. However, the satisfaction you feel is much greater. Where by now, the more experienced were able to play any song in classical mode, even ai limore difficult levels, here the challenge moves to the field known to those who really play, given that even the simplest piece must be learned, especially at the beginning. Each song has patterns of notes to press, which ask the hands to move across the keyboard and the challenge now is to learn these sequences and to acquire the necessary agility with a sense of progressive learning that gives the whole a new texture and a always different charm. Among other things, this also helps to overcome the barriers due to one's musical tastes, given that each song represents a challenge towards one's own improvement, untying it from the degree of appreciation one has for the genre, or not. In short, it's not that you learn to play the keyboard, but that's the manual approach and you can seriously get into the mentality necessary to deal with ~real~ music. From a logical point of view, the work done for the guitar is even more incredible, since the neck and strings have been decomposed into a series of 102 frets, each of which represents a different note on the six strings. Going up in the level of difficulty, you go from playing single notes to power chords to more complex chords with bars and arpeggios, with the difficulty of having to repeat exactly the positions and accents of the originals, whereas by playing on a real instrument the musician can take interpretative liberties not possible here, of course. In short, it is a potentially infinite challenge. Xbox 360 goals Rock Band 3 boasts 62 goals for 1250 points, more than usual then. Like all titles of this genre, it requires a lot of dedication and time, to download songs from the store and try your hand at all the tools. It takes patience, but it's the game itself and its setting that pushes the player to play it for a while or not even try. No middle ground. A world to unlock Playing and accumulating fans leads to unlocking a plethora of customizations for your virtual musician, including clothes, venues in which to play, instruments and accessories. The graphic style has remained the same and continues to do its duty with, a few, effects placed to underline the key moments of the most choreographed songs. As mentioned, however, we see that the bulk of the work has been dedicated to the Pro modes, which also involve the drums with new cymbals, also sold separately. The guitar can also be used to play the Bass, but, precisely due to the likelihood of the real counterpart, when you go up a level of difficulty, the fact that the neck is narrower than that of an electric bass, leads to a little ' of problems in the most difficult passages. With all that the experience is damn rewarding even then. The audio video calibration system which, with the peripheral sensors, is perfect, allows after a first practice to play chords and notes without even looking at the screen and to concentrate on the changes of position. The differences, obviously, are those of a different sensitivity to the touch, if we speak of the guitar, and of a numerical reference which, for each note, indicates the position in which to place the left hand on the neck, also because a wrong note does not produce any sound , of course, but the usual error noise. The differences, at least for a neophyte, stop here and one can only take his hat off in front of a job which, above all, in terms of game design, must have required years of study and planning.", "date": "2010-11-08", "grade": "9.3"}
