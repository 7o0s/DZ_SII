Let's see why. LET'S START FROM THE PRINCIPLE Grandia is originally a title developed for consoles, which has known great success with the Playstation audience. The first title in the saga didn't appear on PC, while fortunately its sequel, after being embodied in the various versions for the latest generation consoles, can find a place in our nice gray boxes. The game, as well as the various Final Fantasy games, does not require knowledge of the plot of the previous episodes to be played, and it is therefore possible to face it without fear of missing out on any particular connection. Entering the plot of the game is a natural and non-traumatic process, in fact the events and the story are gradually revealed to us as the game progresses, while we learn the rudiments of the control system and the regulation. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] LET'S START FROM THE PRINCIPLE The hero and protagonist of the situation is Ryudo, a young man with the somatic traits of the standard manga hero (to be clear: Pegasus in the knights, Tetsuya in Mazinga, Rubber in Nepiege etc). Tousled hair, a lot of irony, embarrassment with women and religion but above all a lot of determination in completing his mercenary assignments. A series of very interesting characters begin to orbit around him, from the pious and devoted girl to the provocative possessed ~leggerina~ (plus dressed in a succinct and provocative way, she is obviously our favorite regardless of her ethics). Each protagonist of the game has the advantage of having a deep psychological characterization obtained through seemingly trivial but actually very well constructed dialogues. Emblematic are the moments in which the game party meets for dinner and the player can decide who to talk and who to answer. In the window where the dialogues appear there are also drawn close-ups of the characters, thanks to which we can see their expression otherwise unfathomable by the three-dimensional models of the graphics engine. The plot, full of twists and turns, flashbacks and revelations is soon brought back to the eternal struggle between good and evil, a theme that is often abused but which, re-read through Ryudo's sarcastic eyes, appears much tastier. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Grandia II, however, is not an animated film, and we must consider its interactive part, the game to be precise. Everything takes place in a completely three-dimensional and colorful world where Ryudo and his party move freely in the various locations. With a key you can activate the various pre-calculated actions available in a given point, or access the rich game menu where it is possible, as in any Japanese RPG, to check the status of the characters, the inventory, manage the upgrades and the growth of the party, equipment, and spells. All those who do not like the ~random encounters~ of monsters, often unnerving and useless (even masterpieces of the caliber of Final Fantasy 7 were sadly afflicted by them), will be happy to know that the monsters in Grandia II are displayed on the map and are therefore avoidable running or hiding. Only by colliding with these directly can you access the battles, the true beating heart of the game. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] These too are graphically represented in 3 dimensions, but here the camera is independent of our will and much more spectacular. Those who know the system of any Japanese RPG shouldn't have great difficulty in assimilating that of Grandia 2. You wait your turn and decide what to do. However, there are a couple of gimmicks that add spice to the whole, in fact from the moment the order is given to the moment it is executed (both for the monsters and for the player characters) a little time passes, displayed by the handy bottom right bar. If you are hit (or are hit) during this short period of time with a hit of the ~critical~ type (usable at theinstead of the basic one which does a little more damage, the ~combo~) the imparted action is not performed. In addition to the normal moves, there are also the magical ones and the special ones. The former can be used by equipping the various characters with ~seeds~ containing spells of a certain type, which can be updated by spending the ~enchanted coins~ earned at the end of each battle. The special moves, often the most spectacular and devastating, are instead specific to each character and associated only with him and can similarly be improved by spending the ~special coins~. All these things are resolved in a fair amount of choices to make that give the game a certain tactical depth. If a note can be moved to battles it is perhaps their relative ease, in fact only rarely do we find ourselves facing enemies of a certain thickness. Precisely on those occasions the game gives its best and makes us feel involved in the challenge. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Grandia II respects the Japanese tradition which provides for a mixture of moments of action and others of pure dialogue, plot and various animations. Thankfully the game's story and characters are entertaining, so one never gets too frustrated with the interruptions to the actual game's pacing imposed by the skits. The battles flow pleasantly thanks to particularly pyrotechnic animations which, however, do not last whole minutes like those of the various Final Fantasy (does anyone remember Sephirot's secret shot in FF7?). In short, the game is fun and these days it is not a detail to be underestimated. The graphics are excellent and decidedly superior to that of the console game (especially the comparison with the PS2 version is merciless for the Sony home system, which mainly lacks on the colors, which in this conversion are spectacular). The sound, on the other hand, knows its ups and downs, in fact if on the one hand the voices of the characters and the sound effects of the fights are superlative, on the other hand the music often appears out of place and inappropriate. A cheerful techno ditty isn't the best way to punctuate a visit to a village where entire families are starving, you'll agree. As for the control system, it is possible to throw the mouse out of the window, in fact the use of the plastic mouse is not even included in the game. By deriving all the commands from those for consoles, the game is especially enjoyable using a nice joypad. Using the keyboard removes a good 50% from the overall enjoyment, also because, for once, it's really pleasant to face a role-playing game sprawled out on some soft surface (the undersigned has opted for the bed) rather than hunched over in front to the monitor. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] All RPG purists obviously still won't be convinced of the goodness of Grandia II, but think about it: there are the statistics, there is the party, there is a nice plot (superior to almost all those of western RPGs, but not is new), there are spells and swords, there are many monsters and there are also tactics to use to be successful. What more do you want? I don't even care about the answer, you will like Grandia II, and if I tell you, good shirt everyone. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] PRESENTATION: 8 As always, no note is possible for the Japanese ~sense of wonder~. Everything is cute, everything is spectacular, everything is cinematic. The presentation of the game, as well as all the cutscenes, is excellent. GRAPHICS: 8 As colorful as a bag of candy, Grandia II is not the best game to test your new graphics card on, presenting no revolutionary effects. However, everything seems to have been done with conscience and the locations have been designed really well and in an imaginative way, which is not always obvious when dealing with a three-dimensional engine. SOUND: 6 On the one hand, the appropriate sound effects for each situation and on the other the sometimes detestable music. In between the voices of the characters, present a few times but well. GAMEPLAY: 9 Provided you have a joypad, the game is commendable. More tactical than any Final Fantasy (apart from the unattainable Final Fantasy Tactics) and at the same time more enjoyable to play. The system is roughly the usual of any RPGJapanese, but with some extra gear. The removal of random encounters and the refined combat system are the icing that makes this cake tasty. FINAL VERDICT: 85 It won't go down in history and it won't even create huge communities of fans, but whoever plays it will always have a pleasant memory. The only glaring shortcomings in Grandia II are the glitches. It will appeal to gamers in general, as well as any good game should. Long and exciting, despite its relative ease, it will make you spend a lot of time hunched over the keyboard (or lying on the bed ^_^).

A round of applause to whoever converted it.Flavio ~Flx~ Muci USEFUL LINKS: Publisher Official Site Italian Distributor The world of computer role-playing games is, as you well know, divided into many sectors, each of which delves into an aspect of the experience. However, there is a particularly sharp division within this microcosm, represented geographically by the Pacific Ocean which separates America and Japan and their respective schools of thought. There are traditionally few points in common between these two ways of understanding RPGs, which differ in the way of developing the plot, in the characterization of the characters, in the fights and in the interface. One could almost say that the only thing ubiquitous is the growth process of the protagonists which is the foundation of any RPG. The different approach to the matter often leads Western-style RPG purists to completely snub all the titles churned out from the land of the rising sun, or worse, to label them superficially as ~children's stuff~ or ~console game~. Reading some reviews that appeared on American (and Italian) sites of Grandia II (which is, as you may have guessed, a high exponent of the Japanese school of role-playing games) I was able to re-read all the sampling of clichs on the subject. More than one put a phantom ~product not suitable for personal computers~ among the defects of the game, others, even less imaginative, wrote the most obvious sentence that can be encountered in video game magazines: the terrible ~only fans of the genre will like it ~.", "date": "2002-04-23", "grade": null}
