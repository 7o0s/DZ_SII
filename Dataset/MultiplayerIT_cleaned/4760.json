The migration of part of the user to smart devices and the contemporary (and directly connected) crisis of handhelds from video games in the strict sense have inevitably prompted Level-5 to reflect on the future of the franchise, thus expanding its presence on smartphones and tablets. After a first and not fully convincing step in 2013 with the spin-off Layton Brothers: Mystery Room, the Japanese company has therefore decided to proceed at full speed on the roadmap, giving life to an episode of the main series released these days on iOS and Android, and also coming to Nintendo 3DS in October. How beautiful is youth Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy takes advantage of the occasion of the tenth anniversary to retire the previous protagonist, Professor Layton, leaving the scene to his daughter Katrielle. A notable change of course as regards the characterization, since the phlegmatic calm of the parent is contrasted by the exuberant youth of Kat, a crackling and enthusiastic girl although already directed to follow in her father's footsteps as regards her career. The opening of a detective agency in the heart of London is in fact the starting point of the new story made up of numerous cases to be solved one puzzle after another. Certainly not alone, since Katrielle's adventure companions are also unpublished: the first to appear is Sherl, a talking dog who soon goes from being the first client of the studio (in fact, he remembers nothing of his past) to becoming an ally , while shortly after you also get to know Ben Greegy, a little clumsy assistant and - not too secretly - in love with the protagonist. The development of the game is based, as the fans will well know, mainly on the resolution of more or less complicated puzzles that allow you to continue the investigation of the cases that Kat and his companions will try to solve: we are talking about cases, in the plural, because one of the most substantial of Layton's Mystery Journey is precisely the abandonment of the development of a single macro-case in favor of 12 smaller and smaller investigations, however connected to each other by the common thread of the main plot. This is an interesting choice, since it offers the player stories that are certainly less epic but capable of offering more frequent goals, thus maintaining a certain appreciable pace in progression. On the other hand, it is the whole atmosphere of Layton's Mystery Journey that turns out to be more sparkling and ~youthful~, probably also in an attempt to be more attractive to a wider audience. From the narrative side, however, this has led to a certain simplification of the themes which translates into very (too?) verbose and rarely engaging dialogues, if not sometimes silly, which seem to want to extend the overall longevity in an artificial and a little clever way of the product. Even the depth of the characters struggles to outline particularly interesting personalities, leaving behind often easily forgettable situations and faces. Resolution what a passion Instead, what has changed little or nothing is the gameplay, which remains extremely familiar to anyone who has had experience with the previous chapters: the settings can be explored with a pointer in search of elements to interact with, which can be characters to talk to or even objects from which to obtain not only puzzles but also coins, to be spent if necessary to receive clues and suggestions in case one gets stuck on a particularly difficult puzzle. The puzzles are then divided between the fundamental ones to continue in the story and the secondary ones, to be discovered precisely in the manner just described, thus providing a certain incentive to return to the locations already crossed to recover them all. Each of them is then associated with a precise number of Picarats, a value that determines its difficulty and which, once resolved, increases the player's score. The general quality of the puzzles is on average good, obviously with ups and downs, even if there are some situations in which the incomplete explanation or imperfect translation makes the task more challenging than it actually is. As for the transition from the dual screen of Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS to the smartphone display, the result can undoubtedly be defined as convincing: in practice, the playing area is divided into 2 boxes of equaldimensions, mimicking the functioning of the ~original~ versions, without creating any kind of problems in practice. Even the method of control through the finger instead of the stylus is almost always smooth, with the exception of rare and negligible situations in which particular precision is perhaps needed. Undoubtedly a great advantage of these versions is linked to the screen resolution, extremely superior to that of the Nintendo consoles, which translates into an image quality and a markedly superior level of detail from every point of view, thus allowing you to appreciate the very pleasant work done by Japanese artists is optimal, which finds its peak in the anime-style intermission films. The latter can be viewed both with the phone vertically and horizontally, depending on whether you prefer a greater visual area or avoid the inconvenience of rotating the device. Obviously the whole game is translated into excellent Italian, including the very high quality dubbing. The list of extras is extensive, including content such as ~the riddle of the day~, i.e. a free puzzle offered every day (for a total of 365), the ability to change the office furniture and paid DLC that translate into set of new dresses for Katrielle (2.29 each). Finally, a note on the sale price, set at 17.99: a very high figure by the standards of the App Store and Google Play, and for this reason the subject of criticism from those users accustomed to not spending even a cent to play , but then very ready to complain in front of various paywalls and freemium mechanisms. It is clear that in this case we are talking about a game supported by a classic sales model, as well as characterized by production values unknown to the vast majority of catalog products on smartphones: finding yourself discussing these eighteen euros, which among other things they are almost a third of those that will be needed to buy the same game on Nintendo 3DS, it simply means understanding little about video games.", "date": "2017-07-26", "grade": "8.0"}
