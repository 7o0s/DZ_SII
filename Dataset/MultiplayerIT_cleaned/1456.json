{"name": "Eye Toy Groove", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eye-toy-groove.html", "text": "In the wake of the success of the first release, Eye Toy: Groove arrives on Playstation 2, a title that abandons the multipurpose nature of Play to devote itself entirely to the musical genre: positioned in the center of the screen we will in fact have to hit some luminous discs when they cross the points positioned at the corners of the screen, all according to a precise timing, which will be in relation to the background music. In some moments of the game we will have to hit these discs several times consecutively, in others we will have to wave our arms according to a particular orientation, which will be indicated on the screen. The more veterans, videogame speaking, will be able to understand the game mechanics even better if they think of Samba de Amigo, released for the Dreamcast about four years ago: the game scheme is very similar, only that instead of the maracas you will use your upper joints . Said in words it seems complicated, but we assure you that on balance the game is immediate and at the same time very fun, thanks to the game system and the backing tracks from which it will be possible to choose, ranging from current compositions such as Move Your Feet by Junior Senior and Superstylin' by Groove Armada to some less recent ones, but which in many cases have marked our childhood or that of the previous generation, such as Let's Groove by Earth Wind and Fire or the goliardic YMCA by the Village People. The choice of pieces should therefore be able to satisfy a large number of people, but precisely because of the many genres that are touched upon, a higher number of songs would not have spoiled, some perhaps unlockable over time. Eye Toy Groove can be played both in single player and in double mode, in turn divided into challenges, where players will face each other sequentially to determine who has the best score, and simultaneously, in which players will have to ~perform~ together to complete the level. There are three difficulty levels (the classic easy, medium and difficult) plus a third mode, which dynamically adapts to the player's skill. The higher the difficulty level, the more difficult the sequences to complete, up to rapid and very complicated evolutions at the highest level of difficulty. During the course of the performance, it will also be possible to take some photos and even record a ten-second video (when the word freestyle appears), which can be reviewed at the end of the song and saved on your memory card, to be viewed later. A further option lies in the possibility of creating your own personalized sequence of movements, which can then be used for subsequent games and will therefore extend the possibilities offered by the main game mode. Comment Eye Toy Groove is one of those products that shouldn't be missing under the Christmas tree of any multiplayer lover, as it is a real fun catalyst for many people, thanks to a very varied choice of songs, the possibility of playing couple, and in general to the fun procured by moving like damned in front of the screen. Groove is also not suitable for ~solitary~ players, as the number of songs is not very high but above all there are no real methods that can make the game last over time. If you have quite a few friends, whether they are gamers or not, Groove could be one of your favorite pastimes. Pros: Fun and frenetic with more than one person Good choice of songs Cons: Few incentives for the single player Number of songs not very high Many of you have already had to deal with a USB camera, the kind that are very often seen on a personal computer, and which are used to record movies or to add video to conversations via chat. A peripheral of this kind has also existed for Playstation 2 for some months, but thanks to the power of the software it has the particular characteristic of detecting the movements of the person in the frame, and transporting them on video to allow the interlocutor to interact with what is happening on the screen. Eye Toy does not come from a Japanese Software House expert in new technologies, but from our continent, precisely from the English studios of Sony, which for over three years have experimented with the characteristics of this camera, before putting it on the market. So think about the potential of such a peripheral: being able to interact with what moves on the screen leaves spaceio to many ideas, ranging from games that test one's reflexes to musical games, passing through tests of ability or pure entertainment. With this in mind, a few months ago Sony published Eye Toy Play, a package containing the Eye Toy and the DVD Play, a collection of skill mini-games that highlighted the first possibilities of this camera and which met with considerable success in Europe, to then also appear in the rest of the world.", "date": "2003-12-11", "grade": null}
