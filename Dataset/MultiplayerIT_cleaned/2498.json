{"name": "The Watchmaker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-watchmaker.html", "text": "15 hours of time.. Imagine staying in your comfortable bed enjoying a bit of healthy morning relaxation, it's not for nothing that you are Darrel Boone, an expert on paranormal phenomena and a former consultant on the subject at Scotland Yard, not, chess, Latin Lover ^_^!!! You are woken up with a start by a phone call and 15 minutes later you find yourself, accompanied by a lot of cars, in an office where a man entrusts you with a very important mission, otherwise goodbye green and lush planet Earth. It seems that a machine similar in shape to a pendulum clock has been stolen (built by an enigmatic figure like his nickname, the watchmaker) capable of collecting the energy emitted by invisible lines which, running along the surface of the Earth, connect very ancient places, dating back even to prehistoric times, custodians of ancient and powerful powers. As if all this were not enough, the prolonged use of this mechanism will upset the earth's balance, a risk that must be prevented and immediately. Your task will be to immediately reach an old and fascinating Austrian manor house built in the fourteenth century where the ~ley lines~ are the most powerful in the world (a clear clue as to where the object in question is located) and find the machinery and stop it. The ~bonus~, in addition to the reasonable compensation, is represented by the partner who has been given to you for this very delicate task: the charming Victoria Conroy, a lawyer by profession, albeit at the beginning of her mandate. 9am, Austria, mission begins, remaining time: 15 hours 9 hours... The real game begins inside the castle, after your arrival and subsequent presentation in the hall as welcome guests. Let's get our hands on right away, analyzing the two strengths of The Watchmaker's game mechanics: the possibility of using 2 decidedly different characters from each other to your liking, ~switching~ them using the ~f8~ key whenever you will want it (does day of tentacle remind you of something?) and a freedom of exploration that your memory struggles to remember in recent and older games (forget, just to give an illustrious example, the task of the first Resident Evil that gradually let him explore). 9 hours... The fact that you can switch from one protagonist to another when it is deemed most appropriate, will certainly have taken away from the little head the idea that the Trecision game presented a character adventure, perhaps changing a few puzzles here and part of the storyline (Resident Evil 2 doctets); imagine controlling Darrel and looking for some clues from the gardener (one of the 18 uncontrollable characters present in the mansion), who obviously will be very private: perhaps it would not be better than asking him a few questions about the castle, the housekeeper, the supervisor is the beautiful Victoria and her non-negligible charm? Naturally this interesting peculiarity is essential for solving the various puzzles as quickly as possible; time, in fact, is not simulated, therefore an hour elapsed from your arrival at the old manor will correspond to an actual hour of play. Honestly, the undersigned initially spent a whole hour just to visit the villa and do some interaction experiments with the various funny guys you'll have to deal with, and, if, as already mentioned, the correct management of our 2 alter egos is vital , it is also interesting to see the different reactions that people have seeing a man enter the women's toilet or if it is a gentle lady who takes a stroll in the men's bathroom (I feel that the majority of you will want to do sooooo many experiments on the subject, right? ^_^) or, again, the difference that exists in the use of the 2 in wanting to open a rather suspicious wooden door: in the case of Darrel, the old hag will scold us with a decidedly hostile tone, the same housekeeper who neither he will film Victoria trying to open said room and neither will he escape our curiosity about it. 6 hours... We spoke a few lines higher up of great exploratory freedom: let's say that the closed doors or initially inaccessible places are really small, given that, as already mentioned, you will be able to visit the Austrian castle far and wide already from the beginning. Surely you will be brooding that at the beginning you will have a certain disadvantage in solving the first puzzles, given that the immediately available game area, made up of 80 locations, is decidedly large but in the Trecision press release released some time ago there were 2 sympathiesthose little words that left no doubt: non-linearity; did you find a key? It is said that the next move to make is to find the obligatory door that will open up new locations for you or that will allow you to put your furry hands on a key object. Well, this is truly freedom of play... Before concluding the sector concerning game mechanics, it is good to spend a few words on the interface at your disposal: the 2 mouse buttons are dedicated to movement, examining objects, switchboards or the use of lifts, keys and so on. In addition to the canonical keys for saving and loading, we also have the possibility of changing the view, switching to a subjective view that is very first person shooter, with the difference that you can only observe what is in front of you and on your sides, without be able to move. Definitely thumbs up for playability and longevity (although like all adventures you will hardly pick it up again), now let's analyze the graphics and sound! 3 hours... The graphics of The Watchmaker are certainly not comparable to blockbusters such as Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament but taking into account the genre of game under analysis and the system requirements required to play the title Trecision (P2, 64 mb, accelerated card), one cannot don't be complacent with the end result. The test was conducted on the following machines: P3 500, 256 mb of ram, GeForce DDR with 32 mb of ram (driver 11.01); P3 933, 256 mb ram and GeForce 2 Gts with 32 mb ram (driver 12.40). On both machines, no problems of any kind were reported (sixty frames per second very stable, as if there were any 128-bit console) even with the classic 1024x768x32 with all the details at maximum, except for some flickering on the magnificent backdrops on the second PC , at least until the replacement with the 11.01 beta drivers and the 6.50, the last official ones, has been done. The number of polygons used for the backdrops is decidedly adequate and certainly represent the best side of the visual realization of this adventure (take a look at the various screenshots, malfidels!) while a different fate befell the characters, where few textures and, in certain cases, a small number of polygons, leave a bitter taste in the mouth. To slightly compensate for the situation, there is a good realization of the faces, decidedly expressive thanks to some really spot-on facial animations and our legendary Italian language everywhere, not for nothing Trecision is an Italian software house. The end It had really been a long time since such an intriguing adventure appeared on the market!!! The possibility of using two characters so distinct (and at the beginning as cold to each other as their team-up will later prove to be much more close-knit) and use them differently depending on the circumstance is brilliant, as well as it was the idea of making the castle almost entirely searchable right away, without restrictions of any kind. The story is about as gripping as a good Agatha Christie book, so forget about your social life until you've cracked it and scoured the entire building in all its locations... You won't get bored with The Watchmaker until you have it solved and then you will most likely want to replay it to beat your completion record. Sorry for the creation of the characters that should have benefited from some extra tweaks but the suggestive backdrops put a piece on it. A great product, but even more so considering that it is a local product. Well done, Trecision! 15 hours of time.. Announced for a long time, the very Italian The Watchmaker has finally arrived in stores, ready to undermine the legend according to which only Milestone is able to make Italian talent shine in the art of creating video games. Is the Dracula bilogy of Microids now beautiful and resolved? Are you among those who see Monkey Island 4 as an offense to its predecessors, in the same way as the Phantom Menace against the first 3 episodes of Star Wars? It is therefore time to welcome a new exponent in the increasingly small category of ~old style~ adventures: ladies and gentlemen, here is The Watchmaker, leading the dance is Trecision Software, an Italian team that has already made 15 games (Pc , Playstation) distributed, among others, by Infogrames and Sony.", "date": "2001-06-01", "grade": null}
