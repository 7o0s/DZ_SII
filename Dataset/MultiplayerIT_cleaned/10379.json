This time it is possible for us to define all the contents, express a comment and put a vote. The Sims series has always accustomed us to be enriched by a good number of expansions aimed at renewing the gaming experience thanks to new environments and situations to add to the simulation dish. This time the undertaking was rather difficult: it was a question of adding to an already rather rich and complete product something that could give new challenges to the player who was by now certainly savvy to the genre. Electronic Arts takes a formula tested in the second chapter out of the hat, with the World Adventures expansion, which even then offered three different locations in which to send our Sims on vacation. However, at the time, these were traditional trips with tropical, mountainous destinations, or for the most sought-after in the fascinating East. The parallelism stops this time only at the choice of the three destinations added as a destination for our sim-holidays. In fact, the ones that The Sims 3: Travel Adventures offers us are not ordinary holidays, or at least the type of travel that we are allowed to undertake is not traditional. We've tried a taste of the game and traveled to two of the available locations, now we're ready to present you our travel postcards. To the east He said Lao-Tz well when he spoke of small steps. And it was with his words well present in our minds that we faced the beginning of our adventure and made our Sim pick up the phone to show him the chosen destination for his first trip: China. Ready to follow the Silk Road, we soon discover that our journey is marked by an adventure rather than a tourist one. It's not the clothes of the Sunday traveler that Travel Adventures makes us wear, but living up to its name, this expansion rather leads us to become young archaeologists, ready to face a real adventure. Our landing place is a base camp equipped to meet all of our Sim's needs: we have a kitchen, bathroom and dormitory that welcome all travelers who, like us, have decided to go and discover the hidden secrets of Shang-Sim-La. We immediately discover that the duration of the trip is limited by the visa permit granted to us by only three days. However, it will be possible to obtain longer residence permits by completing a series of missions and thus earning the necessary visa points. At the entrance to the base camp, the first thing we notice is a bulletin board from which we can accept the first of a series of missions to be carried out. This is the real novelty of the game, which introduces action/adventure elements unpublished in the series that enrich it with variety, challenge and long hours of play thanks to the many objectives inserted between collection and exploration. The missions lead us to talk to a series of characters who will send us to explore tombs, collect treasures, collect stones and materials and learn more and more about the inhabitants and traditions of this same corner of China. The exploration of ancient tombs and locations is certainly the focal point of this expansion, the one that makes us feel like real adventurers. It is a system of real labyrinthine dungeons in which we will have to solve small puzzles, defuse dangerous traps and explore tunnels and cisterns in search of secret passages or to be able to unlock locked doors. We find the prize at the end of the labyrinth, hidden in chests or display cases to open. Along the way, however, there is no shortage of ancient coins to collect that we can exchange from the rarity merchant to obtain precious objects. There is no shortage, in Shang-Sim-La, even a gym where to learn martial arts in which we can then train just like we do for the other usual Sims skills. The environment is characterized in detail, as well as the characters who wear traditional clothes and are even able to teach us the typical songs of the place. From dragon temples to pyramids Once back from the trip to China, still laden with all the mystery and the relics collected, and after the adjustment period necessary to recover from the hardships and emotions experienced, we are ready to visit the second location that Travel Adventures allows us to explore : Egypt. As in the case of China, we are leaving with only three days of visa, which for the moment will have to be enough. A more spartan base camp, with tents and arranged showers, it is clear that the Egyptian adventure will be much less full of comforts for our Sim who will have to prove what he's made of. The exploration scheme is re-proposedion of tombs and various locations, with traps and secrets to discover - the reproductions of the three pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx are inevitable. But we will also face missions with plots and conspiracies, we will have to infiltrate the den of seditious brigands and foil trafficking by hacking computers. It is clear that the development of the Sims' skills becomes important in order to be able to complete their missions and no longer just to maximize their careers. The settings are Arabic-style, such as furnishings, clothes and features of the local populations and, last but not least, the songs that we can learn. There is no shortage of the usual merchants of books and local objects and we must always keep the little adventurer's luggage stocked with tents, portable showers and freeze-dried food in case our stay away from the base camp proves to be long enough to have to satisfy the needs of our Sim, whose bars do not stop being present. It is clear that in a single trip it is impossible to achieve all the objectives, solve the collecting and above all carry out all the missions that are assigned to us, especially with such short visas, and therefore it becomes imperative to return several times to the vacation spots to be able to continue in the growth of the character and find out what are the directions in which the stories unfold. The friendships made with the locals that we can then invite to visit us in Sunset Valley is not a negligible detail. In short, the game is strongly based on cultural exchanges and the deepening of knowledge of places so distant from our habits and lifestyles but so present in the imagination of anyone who is even minimally fascinated by adventure and mystery. Nectar for my palate The third and final destination of our wandering vacationers is the European France, rich in all the charm of its vineyards and the nectar that is produced from them. Nectar that will keep us engaged in several of the available missions, made by our holy feet by pounding fruit harvested in a machine that will then draw the best ambrosia we've been able to produce from the juice. Again, it will be a big help to have developed previous skills, such as gardening, which will help us in the collection of the best fruits and in their masterful pressing. But even in France there is no shortage of underground corridors to explore, tombs to open and above all treasures to find. Without forgetting the photographs to be taken that will enrich the various albums at our disposal and will allow us not only to increase our shooting skills but also to conquer new goals and earn money that really are the salt of this game. In fact, without earnings there is no vacation, and it is something to always keep in mind if we do not want to risk ending up begging for some Simoleons on street corners, perhaps enchanting snakes from a basket. Our adventures end here and considerations crowd the explorer's backpack. Travel Adventures really adds a large number of hours of play to a title that already knew how to commit the player for endless sessions but which, above all, is able to rejuvenate the experience, thanks to its mildly role-playing components made up of missions in which we can even decide which choices to make and which side to take between two opposite and adverse groups of characters. All the additional elements are perfectly integrated into the original game, exploiting the previous skills and to which, in turn, they know how to add new elements of interaction. Even mixed marriages will produce children with blended heritable traits in homage to the game's blatant imprint of multicultural exchanges and interactions. The graphics sector, on the other hand, remains more or less unchanged, even if we seemed to recognize a certain upward curve in the requests to the hardware system, especially in the overviews of the maps and for moving outdoors from one location to another. Nothing extraordinary, but still a slight fatigue which in any case does not preclude playability, except in some moments of loading heavier than others. The audio sector is rather rich and pleasant and always characterizing the places visited. Replayability is guaranteed by the impossibility of exploring and achieving all the objectives in the virtual life of a single Sim, leading us to give birth to generations of travellers. The only real flaw, which is also not particularly significant, lies in the indications on how to complete some missions, which are not always immediately understandable. This manifests itself on some occasions, in the need to retrace one's steps several times to understand how to find the required materialsor carry out assigned tasks. Generally, however, unless you are particularly distracted, the solution is at hand and with a little exploration you can pick up the thread of the quest. Ultimately, it is a product that manages to gain further quality and playability for a title that had already reached high levels of entertainment on its own, above all thanks to its innovative features in a genre that, after all, had by now said almost everything he could already. An attempt at revitalization, The Sims 3: Travel Adventures, perfectly successful, which should not be missing in the PC of fans of the series. Interview with Lyndsay Pearson Multiplayer.it: First of all, introduce yourself to our readers. Lyndsay Pearson: My name is Lyndsay Pearson and I'm the lead producer of The Sims 3: Travel Adventures. I've been working on the series for about eight years. M.it: Unlike the usual premises behind expansions for the Sims, Travel Adventures modifies some mechanics at the base of the gameplay. How did you arrive at this choice? Can players expect any more similar changes in the future? LP: The Sims 3 is such a big and different game from the past that we felt the need to push even the first expansion to the limits. This means that we wanted to offer an experience unlike any other Sims game. We're always looking for new ways to give users the experience they want and create experiences that are challenging and fun. M.it: In Travel Adventures there are China, France and Egypt: what does each of these represent in terms of introductions within the gameplay? L.P.: The focus in Al Simhara, in Egypt, is related to the exploration of the tombs and adventure. You can charm snakes, collect rare insects and gems, discover ancient relics, but it always comes down to a series of exotic introverts and an element of danger. In Sham SimLa, China, we put our focus on self-improvement. Learn martial arts, meditate in beautiful gardens, admire magnificent landscapes, and truly immerse your Sim in the local culture. Finally France: Champs Les Sims allows Sims to discover an exciting world made mostly by the people who live in it with tons of new opportunities to offer. It's a great place to watch other Sims and work on Nectar Making.M.it: The store for new online downloadable content is becoming increasingly important to The Sims series and Electronic Arts itself. How will you expand it further with this release? L.P.: We've noticed how the online store has played a big part in the economy of the experience offered by The Sims 3, giving players access to a stream of new exclusive content. You can visit the online store every month to find new, unreleased clothes, haircuts, objects, furniture and other architectural elements, to further customize your Sims and their homes. We also listen to our community and pay attention to develop great content and update existing ones based on user feedback.M.it: In Travel Adventures we will have an editor for adventures. What kind of creations will we be able to complete? LP: Players will be able to create their own dungeons. You will be able to place traps and puzzles and secret rooms, just like our designers did, it's exactly the same - including debugging and scripting. Everything related to this content can be reached on the official site, www.thesims3.com, if you haven't already. M.it: Regarding development, can you introduce us to the team and tell us how you approach the development of new content? I suppose you have several ideas, how do you decide which ones are the best? L.P.: When we start any new project we ask ourselves about the points covered by it. For The Sims 3: Travel Adventures we knew it was about focusing on experiences grounded in the different cultural elements and adventures of each location. As we decided on the locations, we adjusted to choose which activities to insert. We've had a lot of feedback from our players and we always do our best to integrate what suits our goals at the same time. M.it: Thank you very much!", "date": "2009-11-17", "grade": "9.0"}
