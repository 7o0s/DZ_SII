It is useless to get around it: what happened last June is something sensational and will inevitably mark the fate of triple A productions for the Windows platform, which will hardly be able to afford to debut on the market with that type of limitation. Limitations due in all likelihood to the limited time available to Iron Galaxy Studios, whose work on the franchise had previously not disappointed, however. In short, from now on we will be able to forget about simultaneous releases on consoles and PC, given that the latter version inevitably requires additional work in terms of optimization. The problems that afflicted the game were in fact mainly related to performance, with very evident drops in the frame rate even in ~quiet~ situations, various glitches and the lack of traditional advanced graphics settings, the ones that Batman: Arkham episodes never lacked. as they are often used to showcase the features of new NVIDIA video cards. After months of revision work, let's see what this ~grand finale~ looks like for the Dark Knight. Even with four months of delay, Batman: Arkham Knight confirms its extraordinary quality on PC Finally, fluid and detailed Let's start necessarily from the technical sector. The second patch released by the developers while the game was still under review is the one that basically fixed everything, going both to solve the unexplained blunders of the Unreal Engine and to add the advanced settings, on all the possibilities of unlocking the frame rate (or adjust it to be capped at 30, 60, or 90 frames per second), enable high-resolution textures and NVIDIA effects such as volumetric fog, particles, rain rendering, and the physics of certain objects that are within the scenario. If previously the most complicated phases were those in which the Batmobile was filmed, now in this situation the same problems are not recorded and the frame rate remains constant, clearly depending on the hardware configuration in our possession. Very interesting is the presence of an indicator in the settings screen that highlights the impact of each individual option on video memory, allowing us to make fine adjustments to obtain the best possible results. We therefore have an ever so impressive Batman, also thanks to the new armor, who roams the streets and roofs of a tremendously inspired and detailed Gotham, rigorously at night (a night for over forty hours, in truth), who around every corner hides a new possibility to launch an attack on a gang of criminals, chase a suspicious car, interrogate a minion of the Riddler or follow the traces of one of the many ~categories~ of missions available during the adventure. The art of the bat Beyond the performance-related speech, it must be said that the graphics of Batman: Arkham Knight are extraordinary in how they manage to present the scenarios, without ever a drop in style or a texture out of place (this too has been fixed, yes). Likewise, the characters are splendid, starting with Batman and continuing with his most famous nemeses, all perfectly portrayed. The direction plays a leading role, with a few jumps from the chair (well yes!) and a narrative that uses the background of the Bat Man as best as possible, even taking important liberties regarding the use of supporting actors and their history. The whole main story, with the Scarecrow's assault on the city and the advent of the Knight of Arkham, is told in a masterly way and the Italian dubbing supports everything in an exemplary way, with Marco Balzarotti always in great form, an excellent Riccardo Peroni to counter him and excellent rehearsals also for all the other actors who participated in the localization process, with only very few uncertainties in the relationship between interpretation and scene, certainly due to the limits these professionals often have to deal with when try their hand at dubbing a video game, perhaps unable to see what happens on the screen during a dialogue. The amazing soundtrack accompanies the excellent voices and the equally excellent effects in a superlative way, drawing the picture of a sectorsound of excellence, in which it was rightly decided to invest and which has returned results of absolute prestige. Come and take a tour There is a great atmosphere in Batman: Arkham Knight, and the introduction of the Batmobile into the gameplay economy has only substantially multiplied the variety of experience, now open to many new applications, both in terms of pure action (fights with armored vehicles, chases) and in terms of puzzle solving thanks to tools such as the winch, which allows you to pull or bend walls and steel so as to create ramps, operate devices or open gates. In short, imagine the normal mechanics of the series, optimized for the occasion (see the introduction of new KOs, ~pair combat~ and new types of enemies, such as doctors, soldiers armed with electric batons or brawny minions with Gatling gun), plus an avalanche of new situations and particular challenges that make their debut thanks to the Batmobile. At first, controlling the car during the braking phases is not particularly intuitive, but just do a little practice to understand that assigning combat mode to the left trigger was the best choice to make this as fluid and fast as possible. transition. Compared to the previous episodes there are also missions that intelligently exploit the detective skills of the DC superhero, on all those in which it is necessary to identify and identify the victims of a mysterious serial killer. Finally, there is the whole part relating to the Riddler's challenges, which are something like two hundred and fifty trophies, puzzles, objects ready to be destroyed, criminals to be saved (and already!) and speed challenges, not to mention the role of Catwoman in the affair. We can say, without fear of revealing anything important, that you will have to complete all these missions in order to defeat the villain in question and access the complete ending of the game, so if you are faced with a trophy or the traditional question mark, get busy or you'll have to come back later.", "date": "2015-10-28", "grade": "9.2"}
