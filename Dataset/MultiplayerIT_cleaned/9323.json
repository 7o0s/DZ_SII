A product which, after being reborn against all odds like the proverbial Arabian phoenix, has managed to even become a victim of its own success: by now you will all know about the tardy, but well-deserved visibility it achieved last summer due to a peculiar set of circumstances - if on the contrary, we advise you to read our recent study on the subject - which brought the work of director Naoki Yoshida, for friends Yoshi-P, to everyone's lips. For a long time the uncomfortable alternative to its direct competitor World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV is today an MMORPG that has forced Square Enix to interrupt digital sales and the free trial to loosen the grip on servers, congested by an impressive number of players. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the city of Old Sharlayan To aggravate the situation was the release of the Endwalker expansion, perhaps the most ambitious the Yoshi-P team has worked on in all these years. If for the curious and last-minute players it is an add-on full of content, for the veterans of Final Fantasy XIV it represents the closing of the circle and the conclusion of a story that began many years ago, even before the reboot. Realm Reborn. Our Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review comes only now for this reason. We wanted to complete the campaign, also known as the Main Scenario Quest, and try the Extreme-level Trials that are unlocked at the maximum level, which we reached with three Jobs, one of which was completely new, added precisely in this expansion. Main Scenario Quest Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Scion reunion Unlike many other MMORPGs where the narrative is subordinated to the progression of the character and the gameplay, Final Fantasy XIV is a game that has always focused on the story. Endwalker, in this sense, represents the most important creative effort of Naoki Yoshida's team. We have said it many times: Final Fantasy XIV is played above all for its Main Scenario Quest, the main campaign that can be tackled like in a single player role-playing game, except for some clashes that require the participation of eight players. We won't tell you anything about the plot, it is so full of twists and unpredictable turns. Suffice it to say that it begins exactly where the previous expansion, Shadowbringers, ended, with the Scions looking for new allies to face the apocalypse promised by Fandaniel, last worshiper of the evil Zodiark. Endwalker effectively closes the game between Hydaelin, that is the personification of our planet, and its antithesis Zodiark: a clash with very ancient roots in which we, the Warriors of Light chosen to save the world and its ~reflections~, got entangled. The story of Final Fantasy XIV, however, has never been that of the Warrior of Light. Although indicated as the absolute protagonist, guide and point of reference for a large cast of characters, it has always been the latter, and in particular the so-called Scion of the Seventh Dawn, who have occupied the stage. Endwalker dwells on them, leading to a natural epilogue all the subplots concocted over the years. Their superfine characterization, and the paths taken over time, mark the development of the story, which reserves the right space for each of them, between memorable twists, touching introspective dialogues and moments of relaxing everyday life. Unlike other MMORPGs in which supporting actors are literally this, and therefore subordinated to the great deeds of the player, Final Fantasy XIV has dedicated years to the growth and evolution of the various protagonists - in particular Alphinaud and Alisaie - who constitute a sort of extended family: the script often plays on the bond that the player has established with these imaginary friends, yes, yet so well characterized. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Zenos continues to haunt us even in this expansion The narrative draws heavily in the previous expansions and the player who has followed the story up to this point cannot help but feel a strong sense of nostalgia and fulfillment as the credits roll at the end of the Main Scenario Quest, aware that a story is over and a new one is about to begin. Let's be clear: the story of Endwalker reaches very high peaks. It is the best in terms of detachment in the field of MMORPGs and easily sees it on equal terms with the most famous chapters of the Square Enix franchise. The merit is not only of an even more cinematographic staging than in the past, but also and above all of a cultured, intelligent and never banal. The texts completely in English could be difficult for those with a barely scholastic mastery of the Albion language, but there are dialogues so solemn that it is impossible not to be enchanted by the localization headed by Michael-Christopher Koji Fox. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the twins Alisaie and Alphinaud Leveilleur in a CG intro scene It must be said, however, that the new Main Scenario Quest is not exactly perfect. There are unforgettable moments that would not have had the same impact if the game had relied only on dialogue and direction: Masayoshi Soken's extraordinary music contributes decisively to the success of the narrative, and Naoki Yoshida has a real knack for placing them . It almost seems to hear him gloating while we are witnessing an already particularly engaging scene of his own, when he also places a significant song or musical track that puts the load from one hundred to the whole experience. Were it not for these very high quality peaks, that of Endwalker would have been a Main Scenario Quest all in all inferior to that of the last expansion, Shadowbringers. The flaw is all in the balancing of the narrative. Endwalker's Main Scenario Quest tended to appear longer to us due to the fillers, literally the ~fillers~ capable of artificially prolonging it. They are certainly not new, but we had the impression that Yoshida and his people structured them in a less careful way than in the past: partly due to the power of the narrative, partly due to the sense of urgency that characterizes the main storyline, these fillers often clash with the rhythm of the story, diluting it and slowing it down forcefully at the wrong moments. The initial part of the adventure, in particular, is extremely slow and measured, but after a few hours the situation clears up and the progression becomes smoother, except for trudging here and there before some new breathtaking descent. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the expansion also takes us to the Moon All in all, the matter could be summed up like this: in its best moments, Endwalker significantly surpasses those of Shadowbringers, which has thus far been the benchmark for the expansions of Final Fantasy XIV, but in its worst moments, Shadowbringers is a more fluid story and cohesive. Thanks to an unexpected, courageous and important turn about a third of the Main Scenario Quest, Endwalker veers in an unusual direction that reserves many surprises. It's just a pity that the narrative suffers from the weight of a graphics engine that is now more than obsolete: the artistic direction is superlative, but it cannot hide the ugly low-resolution textures or the rigidity of the animations in the kinematics. The general glance is always satisfied, but we can't help but think that a more sophisticated Endwalker, from a purely technical point of view, would have been an absolute masterpiece. Gameplay progression and variety Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the Vanaspati dungeon Endwalker is a set so committed to telling a story, it sometimes forgets that we should even be playing. Most of the missions are resolved by interacting with an NPC or a point of interest and it can happen that hours of dialogue are faced before entering one of the six dungeons that punctuate the campaign. Sometimes it happens that you have to defeat one or more enemies, but more often you find yourself leading an NPC to its destination: a new routine allows some NPCs to follow us as in a traditional JRPG; the idea is very interesting, but the Main Scenario Quest abuses it, as well as abuses a new type of assignment to be completed by sneaking around without our target noticing us. Fortunately, Square Enix has made some changes to the structure of the side missions, which are many and, while paying much less experience points than the more important ones, have been extremely simplified: now they can be resolved in a few steps and are distributed more organically on the map. The maximum level is easily reached without resorting to these optional missions, which however often reward with pieces of equipment or other useful consumables. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Smileton is a spectacular level 90 dungeon However, the progression remains linear and there are no choices that can deviate from the pre-established route in the Main Scenario Quest, although some multiple choice dialogues change the immediately following lines, guaranteeing the player a marginal level of customization in the representation of his alter ego. Some Duty deserves an honorable mention, i.e. the instanced missions in which we will often find ourselves controlling another character for a short period oftime, and the maps themselves, but for a slightly more complicated reason. On the one hand, we really appreciated the new maps, which are vast but not dispersive, full of details and sufficiently diversified not so much in the obvious geometry, but also and above all in navigability: thanks to a series of narrative or logistical tricks, it is impossible explore them completely right away, and you have to progress through the story to be able to discover the whole map. The problem, however, is that there is no reason to. Now that even the Aether Currents are distributed more organically and closer to the objectives of the main missions, unless you want to draw on the collection points there is no reason to explore the maps, which continue to suffer from the absence of collectibles, points of interest and the like. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, some choices may show alternate scenes The introduction of special FATEs in remote points, to be reached only by flying, is not enough to personalize the maps, which are truly splendid and scenographic, but in concrete terms they offer nothing more than a few panoramas to photograph. It is an angularity that Final Fantasy XIV has always dragged along and that we hope will be filed down in the future. The same could be said for the dungeons, which tend to be even more linear and short than usual, but also extremely well-finished both from a point of both scenic and content. We really appreciated the tweaks made to the Trust system, which allows you to tackle these challenges together with three Scions without resorting to the Duty Finder and therefore the other players. Already present in Shadowbringers, the Trust has been revised to ensure a more fulfilling experience. Scions deal more damage, which greatly speeds up the completion of Duties, and chat with each other, making dungeon navigation more engaging. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the bosses are designed with great care The bosses are, as usual, the flagship of the combat system. The ones we faced in the dungeons were quite simple, if only because they use visual or sound signals that we are now perfectly familiar with and that Square Enix designers have learned to recombine or reinvent in a creative way: faced blindly, without any preparation, these encounters turned out to be so well designed that we rarely lost on the first engagement for not having understood a mechanic or a strategy on the fly. The same concept can be extended to the eight-player bosses in Trials, but in this case the team of Yoshi-P has definitely outdone themselves. The bosses we faced in these arenas were not only among the most visually impressive, but also among the most challenging, albeit never frustrating. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the Sage is a new Job specializing in healing We tackled the expansion by playing two Jobs at the same time. We have chosen the Summoner, a revised and corrected class for the expansion: perhaps trivialized and simplified in its rotations, the new Summoner is nevertheless very fun and spectacular, especially once the new Enkindles have been unlocked which guarantee specific spells for the three basic evocations. While we had access to the Scholar, the only class that levels up alongside the Summoner, we played healers as the Sage, one of two new classes added to Endwalker. It is a Job that has given us great satisfaction, but which perhaps would require some adjustment in terms of output: while being able to heal a chosen target by inflicting moderate damage to enemies, it lacks direct spells powerful enough to save a companion in difficulty. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, the Summoner has been streamlined More or less, each Job has gained or lost something in the transition from Shadowbringers, and as is normal, Square Enix will make the appropriate changes in the next updates. The first is scheduled for December 21st: despite the critical issues faced since the launch to date, which have forced the company to give away twenty-one days of subscription to all players so far, Yoshida's team intends to follow the roadmap to not leave players who have already completed the Main Scenario Quest with their hands. The first wing (Asphodelos) of the new eight-player raid, Pandaemonium, will also be added to the two level 90 dungeons to be repeated to improve the equipment, and to the two Trials on Extreme difficulty that guarantee rare weapons, accessories and mounts. The Savage difficulty of the same wing will then be introduced on January 4th. Yoshida has promised a stream of regular and constant updates: whatever anyone says, the story isn't really over, and Final Fantasy XI fans", "date": "2021-12-20", "grade": "9.0"}
