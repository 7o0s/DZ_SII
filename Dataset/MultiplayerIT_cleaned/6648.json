They have not died out, nor have they completely abandoned the video game market. They have simply moved elsewhere, for the most part towards the mobile market: an environment by now sewn around their needs and requirements, where one can binge on games without spending a euro, enjoying them superficially for the time necessary to overcome a few moments of boredom, at home or in the office. Often these are experiences of little depth, in which it is essential to hook the user's attention in the very first minutes of the game, possibly keeping him engaged in repetitive tasks that guarantee gratifications that are always at hand. For this reason, the dislike of expert players towards mobile gaming, although not fully acceptable (the Monument Valley and the Threes, just to name a few, were born in this world), is at least understandable. Even more so if big labels like Electronic Arts get involved, taking a historic brand like SimCity and literally raping it to send it straight to the top positions of the Apple and Google store rankings. Simcity BuildIt is a huge, endless wait interspersed with a few minutes of play SimCity BuildIt is a freemium title that can enjoy, at the time of writing, a flattering average rating of 4 out of 5 stars on both the App Store and Google Play. This should already give the pulse of the fracture and the distance between the tastes of the two types of users described above, because SimCity BuildIt could simply never be judged on the margins of excellence by any player who has known the roots of the Maxis series created by the genius of Will Wright. Let me be clear, we are among the staunchest supporters that nostalgia is an ugly beast, and that progress should always be considered by adapting and modifying experiences to the current times. A classic SimCity nowadays would be like a fish out of water on a mobile device, whether it's a smartphone or a tablet: simplicity and immediacy (elements very different from trivialization) are the fixed points on which similar products must be built both to the timing of the duration of the average game session on portable devices, and to the touch interface which must be managed intelligently, understanding its virtues and limits. For this reason, the in many ways naive choices made by the programmers in the context of the SimCity BuildIt gameplay should not be condemned regardless, because they fit into this correct vision of things. For example, the population is rather tolerant and patient in the face of lack of services, buildings can be moved and relocated at will at no cost, it is not possible to go bankrupt, taxes and issues related to fires or natural disasters never leave unduly severe aftermath. Among the positive aspects of EA's production must also undoubtedly be included the technical component, which is truly excellent: the variety of structures and buildings present is commendable as is their level of detail, the transition from day to night offers fascinating views, and the teeming activity of citizens who fill the streets with cars gives the impression of being in front of a metropolis that is actually alive and in constant motion. But, as we have already been forced to note on other occasions, the freemium element has literally devastated the good things done by the team, imposing irritating choices capable of affecting the entire gaming experience. In summary, in SimCity BuildIt the mayor - or rather the player - is actually nothing more than a builder, a sort of building contractor constantly looking for resources to use in his business. Primary resources are mainly produced in factories, but there are also secondary resources that are created in shops. If initially it is only a handful of products (metal, wood and nails), as time passes and the progress in the game many more are added, together with several new categories of shops which obviously produce the respective objects. The materials are essentially used to make urban areas ~evolve~, thus allowing them to gradually transform themselves from camps to huge and populous skyscrapers; this is also the main way by which to earn money, in addition to the taxation that comesdetermined automatically on the basis of citizens' happiness. The main problem with this system, besides completely transforming the philosophy of SimCity, is that the creation of each material takes time to complete. It is certainly not a novelty in the field of freemium, mind you, but in this case this practice practically represents the gist of the whole experience. It therefore ranges from the minute of waiting for the metal up to whole half hours, which are multiplied by the productions of the shops since - unlike the factories - the latter cannot be present in more than one unit per type. It is a model destined to exasperate the player very soon, forced to concentrate his efforts simply in the continuous, repetitive and exhausting process of creating materials, suffering unsustainable waiting times. For example, to complete the commercial port, in addition to a considerable economic outlay, it is necessary to wait one day and 7 hours (obviously real). To reduce expectations there is also, as almost standard in freemium games, a second precious currency, SimCash: very rarely given for free, it can be bought with real money through in-app purchases at prices that are anything but cheap. ranging from 4.49 for 250 banknotes to 89.99 to get 8500. And obviously spending your own money doesn't solve the problem, it simply moves it a little further.", "date": "2014-12-30", "grade": "4.5"}
