{"name": "X2 - La Minaccia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x2-la-minaccia.html", "text": "Very steep learning curve After the partial disappointment with the recent Freelancer, X2 seems to be, at first glance, everything aspiring space adventurers want. There is really a lot to do and, initially, it is difficult to decide the approach to take to conquer the space. Unfortunately, however, the first big problems start right from the unexplanatory and unclear tutorial. Nothing tragic really at least until you get to know the game's terrifying menus. Imagine an interface where with a few simple clicks you get what you want. Have you imagined? Well, now forget everything. X2 has an extremely awkward menu navigation system: not only is it unknown why the use of the mouse is limited but, unfortunately, you also need to spend a lot of time learning the structure of all the submenus by heart if you don't want to lose fatal weather in the most delicate moments. And let's face it, X2 is really fun. Very steep learning curve It's hard to describe the frustration you feel in the early stages of the game when you can't quite figure out what to do. Although the effort of the Italian distributor in wanting to offer us a packaging well above the normal Italian standards (an elegant cardboard box) is commendable, we regret the fact that the game documentation does not include a precise and complete summary card of the keys , as instead the genre would require: unfortunately the attached manual, even if translated like the rest of the game, is not enough. To the difficulty of learning the menus we also add that, when you are a captain who has just been catapulted into space (at the beginning of the game, in short), the difficulty is very high and every mistake is paid for heavily in terms of money and time. The only solution is to memorize all the keyboard shortcuts so as to be able to avoid pressing the right mouse button (the one that lets you enter the menus) as much as possible. Unsustainable costs Yet X2 is a game with a lot of interesting elements and well done. Starting from the graphics engine full of remarkable effects such as bump mapping and dynamic lights and shadows, arriving at the variety and vastness of the universe in which dozens of different and well-characterized races meet. Let's not talk about the equipment and, above all, the purchasable and customizable spaceships. In this regard, we talked before about the difficulty of the beginnings. Here, in X2 it is possible to create a real economic empire made up of space stations and mining bases equipped with carriers with planets where there is greater demand than what you produce. Too bad that all this costs real fortunes and that, to get to have the money necessary to do something serious, you will have to play for a few days in an extremely thrifty and precarious way (in the sense that when you are weak and poor, every risk you running can be fatal). Then when you start to accumulate enough capital you will see your money rise dramatically, perhaps even too much. Suddenly it is as if you cross a watershed and the initial slowness becomes a distant memory. When you are rich you can accumulate, with an hour of play, more than what was accumulated in the entire previous week! The ideal would have been to better balance costs and revenues in the various phases of the game without the player having to get exhausted to buy every slightest improvement for his fleet and then find himself able to buy entire pieces of the universe without firing a shot. Layering View the whole gallery! Yet a lot of effort has gone into trying to help the player. For example, there is the possibility of using auto docking which, at least initially, eliminates the problem of being able to enter space stations without crashing. There is also the possibility of speeding up the game time so as not to get too bored with some maneuvers that are repeated several times (such as the aforementioned docking). And let's face it, X2 is really fun. Once you get into the mechanics that regulate it, it's impossible not to love it and be completely enraptured. Leaving aside the campaign complete with narration and cutscenes (which can be tackled at any time by exploiting the means available at the moment chosen to take part in it) it is impossible not to be fascinated by the work done by the developers. When you find yourself managing a real economic empire, you will realize the ~stratification~ of the game structure, which allows you to painlessly experience the transition from the most spectacular space battles to the management of mines and trades.play as if you were in a management game set in space. Once you enter the mechanics that regulate it, it is impossible not to love it and be completely enraptured. Layering However in the midst of all this are the inevitable missions. These are mainly used to raise money. The precious credits you need to buy any. Some problems arose from this point of view as well. The missions are assigned randomly. Unfortunately it often happens that these are designed for levels higher than the one we are with our character. Couldn't a hierarchical system have been created that avoided tasks that were too difficult for those with only a space cart? Nothing irremediable but this too could have been avoided. Visual technique I have already mentioned the goodness of the visual rendering of the graphics engine. As I said, the final result is very good. Except that the X2 has one of the heaviest engines I've ever tested lately. If you don't have a high-end computer, you will hardly be able to keep all the fantastic visual trappings active. Not bad, with a little optimization everything runs smoothly and you soon forget the need to submit to some compromises. Final comment X2: The Menace proved to be a great game. So beautiful that we had the presumption of seeing it made perfectly. If more attention had been paid to simplifying the management of the menus and care had been taken to create less difficulty for the user in the initial stages of the game, then perhaps the judgment would have been much higher and almost perfect. In short, a little more consideration of the gameplay would have done wonders by creating a new point of reference in the genre of space simulators. To make matters worse, let's also add the heaviness, in some cases inexplicable, of the graphics engine and we can consider the filed file. On balance, the title seems to be more aimed at an audience of veteran players, perhaps willing to turn a blind eye to some too many cumbersomeness, by virtue of a rich, varied and extremely deep gameplay. I really regret having to point out the obvious flaws of a game that remains, despite everything, an excellent title that we recommend to all those who love the genre of space simulations. Pros: Spectacular graphics Deep and immersive Virtually unique and unrivaled in its genre Cons: Not suitable for newbies, especially at the beginning Game interface can be improved Requires a powerful system The eye of the enthusiast Truly stunning graphics! Elite came to light now many years ago. David Braben and Ian Bell began working on it in 1982 and finished it in 1984, creating one of the most important titles in the history of video games. In a few kilobytes they managed to compress an entire universe allowing players from all over the world to feel like true space pioneers in search of fame and fortune. In very simple terms, the two created a new very ~elitist~ genre (what a very sad pun) in the sense that it doesn't count many titles but all of them are of quite high quality. Such a high level of competitors makes it difficult to be able to stand out for new titles and, above all, makes the expectation and needs of fans decidedly above other more commercial genres.", "date": "2004-06-01", "grade": null}
