It is in fact a very original project, created by a Polish team (11 bit studios), which in practice reverses the classic dynamics of ~tower defense~, the strategic sub-genre which has achieved incredible success in recent years (the most obvious is that of Plants vs. Zombies, but there are many famous tower defenses). If normally the gameplay of this kind of product sees us place some defensive units within a map, with the aim of countering the advance of the enemy towards our base as effectively as possible, in this specific case the exact opposite: we are the ones who control the advancing units, while the fixed positions that we must try to destroy to make our way through the scenario belong to the enemy. The narrative incipit is essential but undoubtedly fascinating: in the not too distant future, a mysterious ~anomaly~ occurs in the cities of Baghdad and Tokyo, that is, a sort of ~negative zone~ is created which decimates the population and to which inside are hidden numerous alien devices. The British army sends some vehicles to the site, coordinated by a commander who proceeds on foot and to whom we can give RTS-style orders using the mouse pointer. The task of the team is to breach the anomaly, explore its interior and eliminate any threat that lurks there. On my signal, unleash hell As mentioned above, the control system adopted for Anomaly: Warzone Earth is basically that of real-time strategy, with the ~on foot~ commander moving in the direction indicated by the mouse pointer while the vehicles under his management advance and attack targets automatically. Their route, however, can and must be studied in the best possible way, depending on the needs: by using the mouse wheel, we can switch from the in-game action to displaying the map and the itinerary of our convoy, which can be changed at any time. its hub on the basis of the threats present and their characteristics. In fact, the enemy positions are not all the same: some of them identify the target and fire quickly but relatively weakly, others cannot direct the attacks but are devastating if approached head-on, still others are powerful but slow in aiming, and etc. Among the vehicles at our disposal initially there are armored vehicles (resistant but equipped with limited firepower) and exoskeletons armed with missiles (lightly armored but rather effective in offensive terms), and later extra units will be added such as shield generators, modified tanks, and so on. By pressing the space bar we can manage the convoy based on the money in our possession, therefore buy new vehicles or upgrade those present, as well as determine their position within the group. New resources are acquired not only by destroying enemy positions, but also and above all by collecting precious objects along the way (which must be planned accordingly, and which in any case we can modify at any time). However, the role of the commander is not passive, on the contrary: he must promptly collect the upgrades left by the aviation every time we eliminate a threat, and then use them at the right time. The supplied equipment consists of a regenerating field, a smoke screen and some useful ~baits~ capable of attracting enemy fire. To use them just click with the right mouse button in the point of the map where we want to act, then select the desired object. In the more advanced stages, it will be essential to be able to use the equipment quickly and precisely, especially when time limits require us to take risks and venture into very dangerous areas. The excellence of execution The idea behind Anomaly: Warzone Earth is solid and flawless right from the start, thus offering us an innovative but at the same time well-made product. The diversification of the objects that we can use to facilitate the maneuvers of our convoy, the very intuitive and accessible interface, the graphic style in general are all points in favor of the title developed by 11 bit studios, which for only 8.99 euros gives us offers a rather demanding single player campaign and some interesting extra modes. The only perplexities concern precisely the longevity, which we believe in any case perfectly adequate for the sale price, and the impossibility of moving the view using the keys instead of usingthe mouse: already having to use the pointer to place objects, this becomes quite difficult during the most agitated phases. The scenarios are rich in detail and very well designed, as are the enemy units, while our convoy is absurdly a bit anonymous. On the test configuration we were able to play at a resolution of 1600x900 pixels with all the effects at their maximum and stay quietly on 25-30 frames per second, undoubtedly an indication of a good optimization of the graphics engine. The sound effects are average, the dialogues (with an incredibly strong English accent) appear well recited but the musical accompaniment is a bit lacking and it's a shame.", "date": "2011-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
