{"name": "Ys IX: Monstrum Nox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-recensione.html", "text": "Ys is a little known but very old series: the first episode dates back to 1987, when it was released for PC-88. Since then developer Nihon Falcom has made eight mainline episodes and a couple of spin-offs for a multitude of platforms. Despite its diffusion, the franchise has never had the pretensions of triple A and has never dreamed of challenging the much more famous Japanese RPG giants, but over time it has carved out a hard core of fans thanks to a colorful universe, beautiful soundtracks and old-school gameplay that offer something new with every chapter. In this review of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox you will discover that Falcom has taken another step forward in modernizing the series, but unfortunately everything else is starting to be technologically too old to attract the attention of a new and savvy audience. The Story: Escape from Balduq Adol Christin, the absolute protagonist of the series since the very first title, has the unfortunate habit of always being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and usually drags even his irreducible adventure companion Dogi into trouble. This time, the two arrive at the gates of Balduq, a city famed for its immense, labyrinthine prison... into which Adol ends up within minutes, blamed for a crime he didn't commit. During the prologue, while Adol tries to escape, a mysterious young woman called Aprilis enters the scene and transforms Adol into a Monstrum, practically a superhero with the power to face the monsters of the Grimwald Nox, a dimension superimposed on ours that is giving a lot of trouble for Balduq. In an attempt to uncover the mysteries of this eerie city, Adol will have to join forces with a team of eccentric anti-heroes and fight enemies inside and outside the Grimwald Nox. In short, a protagonist with a double identity, a team of anti-heroes with the most disparate personalities, two overlapping dimensions, an intrigue in the real world that is reflected in the parallel one, bizarre combat costumes... we can say that the Falcom guys have quite inspired by Persona 5 or is anyone offended? Joking aside, it must be said that Ys IX shares several ideas with Atlus' masterpiece, while not reaching the same narrative heights. Indeed, the story of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox is rather bland in and of itself, more interested in outlining the various protagonists - who respect all the clichs of Japanese anime - than their nemeses or the mystery that surrounds the city of Balduq. Fortunately, the cast is decidedly large and counts not only the playable characters, but also all the supporting actors who contribute to making the story more interesting: most of them only marginally affect the main plot, but make Balduq appear more interesting and bizarre than it already is. Explore and fight The city and the surrounding area are in fact the real protagonists of this appointment with Ys, perhaps even more than Adol: the synthesis between action and exploration that Falcom has found is very reminiscent of another title very played in this period, namely Genshin Impact. Balduq is in fact a huge location which, if it weren't for the uploads that separate some macrosections, would almost seem like the map of an open world title, and there is no doubt that Ys IX winks at that formula. Designed to be full of hideouts, secret passages and points of interest, the city is presented to the player as a gigantic amusement park where exploration and gambling always reward some collectible or secret. At times reminding us of the freedom of a title like Gravity Rush 2, Ys IX grants more and more variety as Adol recruits his battlemates: each Monstrum, in fact, has a very specific power that often serves more to explore than to fight. Adol, for example, can use a gift called Crimson Line to move quickly from one point to another: it is in fact a sort of grappling hook that allows you to reach elevated places or shorten distances, perhaps even in combat. Once a new Monstrum is recruited, its power is shared by all the protagonists, and in this way the player is not forced to select a different character to use it: for example, after White Cat joins the team, Adol and the others also they will be able to use its Heaven's Run power to run over vertical walls, while the glide called Hunter's Descent will enter our repertoire only after gaining Hawk's trust and will allow us to move by air or pounce on the enemy from above. Each Monstrum brings something new to your exploration, but once you unlock these first powers, you leave the others behinda little to be desired since their use turns out to be much more detailed. Exploration is perhaps the funniest part of the experience, despite some vaguely platform passages being made under a somewhat clumsy profile, but so is the combat system that had already accustomed us well in Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and that in this sequel works even better. The basic mechanics remain the same: you can control up to three characters in combat and you can switch them on the fly to use the appropriate weapon against the enemy you are facing. The clashes take place in real time, almost like in an action game that rewards aggression more than strategy: in addition to normal shots to be ringed in combos, Adol and the others can use various special attacks that discharge the points accumulated by hitting enemies . Resource management becomes increasingly important, especially against bosses who are often huge, tough and particularly insidious if you don't follow the right strategy, taking advantage of every aspect of the combat system such as the intuitive Flash Dodge and Flash Guard mechanics that grant temporary bonuses to players who manage to dodge or parry in time. Playstation 4 trophies Ys IX: Monstrum Nox unlocks 54 trophies. In addition to the platinum trophy, there are two gold, seven silver and 44 bronze. You will unlock several simply by following the story and exploring Balduq, while others will engage you mainly in combat in the different difficulty levels. A jump into the past The variety of enemies and the dynamism of the fights are the best calling card of a title that manages to entertain from start to finish with simple but well blended mechanics. Even the special battles that need to be tackled from time to time and that mimic ~tower defense~ add that extra something that makes Ys IX never boring. Falcom's latest effort manages to be just long, without overdoing it: even the most intricate and challenging dungeons keep the player's interest high with a balanced combination of clashes and puzzles, but if you really want to squeeze Ys IX up to last straw probably takes about fifty hours tops. In short, it is a pity that such a sober and refined game design is trapped in such an ancient frame. The Ys series would really need an increased budget to fully express the potential that can be glimpsed in Monstrum Nox: we are not those who look for the perfect frame rate and count the polygons in our free time, but we must admit that we found ourselves playing a produced closer to the PlayStation 3 era than PlayStation 4. The too rigid animations, the clumsy direction and the awkward shots impoverish the narration, which, moreover, lacks - strangely - the usual animated interlude cinematics. The situation is resolved in the fights, thanks to the good fluidity of the action, the lively effects and the inspired design of the protagonists and enemies, but as soon as you climb to the top of a building and look down on Balduq you realizes the poverty of the visual field despite the fact that the scenario is decidedly empty compared to many other games of the same genre. In short, Ys IX represents that technological boundary that Falcom must now override and leave behind at all costs, if it does not want to address only its fans but also a new and wider audience. Some progress has been made in the search for more serious atmospheres and styles than in the previous episodes, but that is not enough. The music, on the other hand, remains over the top like every time: the soundtrack is memorable, but it must also be said that Falcom's composers have been a guarantee for years.", "date": "2021-01-29", "grade": "7.5"}
