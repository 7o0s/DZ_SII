The immensity of the motherships, the quick skirmishes between the starfighters, the incredible minuteness placed in the smallest details alternating with the unsettling vastness of the spatial abysses, which made the player feel small and insignificant. It was a great game that knew how to alternate large-scale strategies with very accurate micromanagement and that allowed us to understand what was happening at all times and how to intervene to remedy it. Taking all this and transporting it from space to the desert may seem trivial, but luckily Homeworld: Desert of Kharak manages to maintain its own identity, without looking too much like a photocopy of its illustrious predecessor or an ordinary RTS. Indeed, we tell you more, it is probably at the moment the best choice to get out of the hegemony of StarCraft II. We have reviewed Homeworld: Desert of Kharak, will it be at the level of its predecessors? Burning desert Blackbird Interactive is a new name in the sector, but don't be fooled: veterans of the first Homeworld and another small strategy masterpiece, Company of Heroes, have found their place in its offices. In short, we are faced with a respectable team that absolutely knows how to deal with the subject. The story is as simple as it is effective: a hundred years before the events of Homeworld the Kushans live on Kharak, an increasingly desert planet that is slowly dying where the few remaining outposts fight each other for supremacy. Suddenly one day the satellites pick up an anomaly and the Kushans send an expedition to investigate. Four years later still no one has returned and it will be up to Rachel S'Jet, scientific officer of the North Kiithid Coalition to investigate the disappearance and solve the mystery of the mysterious object. Unfortunately, the Gaalsien will take care of making the situation complicated, a group of technologically advanced religious fanatics who have already almost completely exterminated the northern tribes and can't wait to put Rachel's head on a pike. In short, it's a bit like being on Dune, but without the giant worms and a spice that allows you to bend space-time. Being a game strongly linked to a story, albeit not always very clear, the Homeworld: The Desert of Kharak events are narrated by some really well done cutscenes that mix 3D and drawings, a real pleasure for the eyes that will allow you to catch your breath between skirmishes. Carrier sweet carrier The centerpiece of our adventure will be the Kapisi, a massive land-based aircraft carrier that serves as the main research and development unit, as well as the departure and arrival point for our aircraft. Obviously this means that it must be protected at all costs, however it is not a helpless beast, on the contrary, in certain moments it can represent the ace takes all to resolve the situation, but it must be used with a little brain, above all to understand where to allocate the energy at its disposal. There are four choices: defense, self-repair, missiles, and range. During the missions we will find artifacts that can be collected and brought back home to increase the available energy. As for the other units, the game offers a wide range of reconnaissance vehicles, heavy rocket launchers, hovercrafts and aircraft, so rich in detail that if you can push the graphics to the maximum you will stand for a few minutes staring at them in all their minuteness , especially if you love model making. We are undoubtedly dealing with a collection of science fiction vehicles of the highest quality; we were such a draftsman we would spend our time copying them and taking notes. Obviously, as the custom of RTS titles dictates, even in Homeworld: The Desert of Kharak each enemy unit has at least one of its own nemesis and an opponent against which it is particularly suitable. So fast units will be ideal for taking out artillery pieces, anti-aircraft will make flying vehicles useless and heavier tanks will be perfect for breaking through enemy defense lines, but they could suffer against units capable of firing barrage. It will be up to us to understand when and how to manage means and resources because, as is tradition here too, both the first and second courses are handed down from mission to mission and, given that we are in a desert, thrift is a fundamental skill. Desert, the last frontier The main doubt that gripped us before the test concerned the scenario, but a few games are enough to understand that the terrestrial setting has absolutely nothing taken away from the charm of the game, which indeed has gained from it in strategy. Even if we are onland, the desert is able to give us in all respects the sense of desolation and estrangement of deep space, plus the strategic component of the terrain which is absolutely essential to understand and learn in a very short time. Basically everything we can see is within reach of our weapons and vice versa, so it is essential to always try to stay in an elevated position in order to maximize the damage, but we will also have to know when it's time to disappear into the dunes to try to surround the enemy . Fortunately, in this respect the tactical map helps us, clearly highlighting the highest areas and the depressions. Always being in the right place at the right time helps to preserve one's units and transform them over time into veterans capable of hitting harder than the opponent and sustaining his broadsides for longer. We are faced with a game in which the number of average units is very low and you have to be more careful about tactics than production. In some moments we will be able to afford to act with brute force, but in 90% of cases this will involve losses that we will drag along in the following chapters and which will force us to a more cautious approach. Otherwise the game is exactly like its predecessors both in the way you build units and in the way they move. Commanding them gives an extremely exhilarating sensation, made even stronger by the excellent sound sector, capable of returning all the sounds of the clash, including the excited dialogues on the radio. In short, everything is as it should be, even if unfortunately there are some details that prevent the game from reaching excellence. Artificial intelligence covered up Homeworld: The Desert of Kharak is a game that makes the ability to tell a story full of emotion and dramatic moments one of its strengths. To make some moments of the 13 missions even more important, the artificial intelligence makes extensive use of scripting, the problem is that this brings with it some bugs that could undermine the sense of strategy and beauty of the game. There are moments - not many, actually - where enemies are blatantly visible but they don't move or go off their intended path until you get close, like in an MMO. In these cases it is even possible to calmly eliminate all threats using aerial bombardments and staying at a safe distance, without anyone bothering to attack us or react. This is a real bummer as the pace and tone of the campaign is really very well managed and it's a shame to see it marred by a bunch of enemies just sitting in their corner, waiting to step in to do their part. We want to say that it doesn't happen very often and that the most impetuous players may not even notice it, but it is undoubtedly a mole to consider that could disappear with a patch. Another annoying bug concerns the camera, which positions itself in particularly awkward shots after each cutscene and must be reset by hand. Also, know that it is currently not possible to manage the key binding at will. Deserts online As far as multiplayer is concerned, the desert setting doesn't help much in the variety of maps and in general it is undoubtedly a very simple mode, given the purely single player nature of the game. Basically all you have to do is protect your carrier, lost that there is no longer any chance to straighten the game. However, we will also have to explore the map and find artifacts that must be recovered and taken to an extraction point. The first one to collect five artifacts or more wins. This type of setting allows a certain degree of strategy that must be divided between looking for artifacts and teasing the enemy base to make the opponent focus more on defense than on exploration. The two factions we will be able to choose from, the Coalition and the Gaalsien, do not offer a great variety in units, but in general the means of the first are more generic, while those of the second tend to be more specialized and efficient in a single thing. The only big difference is that the Gaalsien can produce units and place a base camp wherever they like, while the Coalition is totally carrier dependent. This radically modifies the strategy based on the chosen faction: the player who chooses Gaalsien will immediately try to control the territory and establish scout routes so as not to be caught unprepared by an attack by the Coalition, which instead will have to exploit the greater mobility to create a real guerrilla strategy that does not give r pointsreference to the opponent.", "date": "2016-01-22", "grade": "8.8"}
