Capcom 3 finally arrives on the digital shelves of PC and Xbox One. This is probably the last chance for the Japanese software house to take advantage of the proverbial golden hen which, despite the years that have passed since its launch in 2011, continues to be very popular in fighting game tournaments around the world. Unbalanced and excessive, Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is still an exciting title capable of captivating players and spectators thanks to the intellectual properties involved in a great clash between parallel universes. We tested the PC version: did it perform well? Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 also arrives on PC to the delight of those who have not yet beaten Deadpool New resolutions, old problems In the event that some telepath has induced temporary amnesia - a fairly common scenario in Marvel comics, just to stay on topic - it is worth spending a few lines on the gameplay: Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 pits the two universes in a roster consisting of more than fifty characters. There is no real plot to justify this monumental clash, but an exaggerated dose of fanservice for all those who have always wondered who would win in a duel to the death between Dante from Devil May Cry and the X- Man Wolverine: the Capcom fighting game tries to answer, but in reality it is the players who decide the outcome, often even within a few seconds. Defined as ~easy to learn, hard to master~ (that is, easy to learn, but difficult to master thoroughly) Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 has the defect of relying too much on very long and relentless sequences of shots which on the one hand are absolutely spectacular, on the other excessively frustrating, especially if we are the ones to suffer them without being able to free ourselves before the opponent has exhausted our wrestler's energy. Despite this, it is a title designed also and above all for beginners thanks to easy-to-memorize movements that translate into lightning-fast actions capable of giving a lot of satisfaction. Too bad that the PC conversion of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 adds nothing in terms of single player to what is already offered on old-gen consoles and then PlayStation 4: apart from a simple Arcade mode, the usual Training and a series of challenges that they teach some combos, the maximum that solitaires can aspire to even on PC is the Heroes and Heralds mode which however adds very little to the offer. On the multiplayer front, however, it is obviously possible to compete online with other opponents ... if you find them: perhaps because it is now starting to go out of fashion or perhaps because it has been out for too little time, we have struggled to find players to fight against online . When we did, we found a fairly stable netcode but some minor issues like the apparent inability to mute the microphone. In this sense, Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 appeared to us to be a more than discreet conversion that also allows a certain level of customization in terms of graphics. The new screen dedicated to the PC settings allows, among other things, to configure the resolution even at 4k, the level of antialiasing and the quality of the textures. For obvious reasons, the frame rate is locked at 60 frames per second; the game ran smoothly and without hesitation on our test configuration, guaranteeing an optimal experience even at maximum graphic detail. If the visual optimization passes the test very well, the same cannot be said for the rest. We encountered some problems in the configuration of the controllers: we didn't take even for a second into consideration the default control system via the keyboard, but we had to struggle a bit before being able to play with a very common joypad. It seems that this is a problem shared by many users, albeit a rather random one, and this should push Capcom to publish a corrective update as soon as possible. Once solved, however, everything runs smoothly, and hands, claws and tentacles are thrown at each other until boredom sets in.", "date": "2017-03-12", "grade": "7.5"}
