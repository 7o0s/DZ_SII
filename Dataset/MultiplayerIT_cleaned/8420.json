If the answer is no, you should do it immediately by catching one of the best shooters on the App Store, a kind of twin stick shooter which, however, is controlled entirely via an accelerometer. The fact is that the game in question was (so far) the only production of the One Man Left team, behind whose name two talented American game designers from Alabama are hidden; a couple of years later, and several months after the presentation of the project, One Man Left has decided to return to the scene with Outwitters, a diametrically different title compared to the aforementioned Tilt to Live. Forget the arcade shooters, now it's time for turn-based strategy with a hexagonal grid... One hex at a time Outwitters is a purely multiplayer game, with the formula of asynchronous turns that is so fashionable lately on the App Store. In summary, this means that one's moves are transmitted to the opponent without the latter having to be actively ~in~ the game; a convenient notification is enough to warn that it's time to respond, within the time limit of 4 days before automatically losing the game. It is obvious that the rhythm and duration of the clashes is therefore destined to last even for a long time, but considering this characteristic as a problem or a defect means not understanding the formula of asynchronous multiplayer, nor that of the game; Indeed, Outwitters allows you to have up to 20 active games at the same time, thus effectively reducing downtime to almost zero. And the structure of the leaderboards, which we will discuss in more detail later, encourages you to play as many matches as possible. But Outwitters, concretely, what is it? We have mentioned that it is a turn-based strategy on a hexagonal grid, in which it is necessary to control and manage your troops with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy base, while remembering to protect your own. There are six types of units in all, each with different attack, defense and movement capabilities; any action you decide to perform in Outwitters has a cost in ~Wit~, which are nothing but points to spend during the turn and destined to be recharged in the next. If moving or attacking one's own ~pawn~ costs a single Wit, on the contrary, creating a new one using the appropriate tiles has a variable price depending on the type of unit. The foundations of the gameplay of the One Man Left title are roughly these, but despite this basic simplicity and the very nice and captivating graphic design, the development can guarantee a decidedly wide and demanding variety of situations and tactics to be adopted. Choosing whether to adopt a defensive strategy, an outflanking or a frontal attack, just to name a few, are decisions that must be carefully considered, trying to grasp the opponent's weak points. Although the maps are decidedly small, so as to favor the speed of the games, the element of the ~fog of war~ (i.e. the impossibility of seeing the opponent's actions if out of the field of vision of one's own troops) adds a further aspect of possible surprise. We were talking about the rankings, which in Outwitters are managed through leagues in which the player is placed based on the results obtained in the first 5 matches completed, so as to be able to group users with similar skills. Each victory or defeat allows you to gain or lose points in the standings, possibly up to the option of being promoted to the next league. Alongside what can be defined as the main mode, however, there is also the option to fight in unranked matches not only one against one, but also two against two, even against Game Center friends or locally in pass and play mode . All this for the price of zero euros, and without advertising banners; those wishing to reward the work of One Man Left, and expand the contents of the game, can buy packages that include new maps and new teams, the latter differentiated from each other only in terms of aesthetics and for the capabilities of a single unit (the most expensive). An expense that in fact the most interested users could concretely consider to give greater variety to the games; the repetition of the (few) maps and the general underlying repetitiveness are in fact the only limits of a game that absolutely deserves to be tried.", "date": "2012-07-18", "grade": "8.5"}
