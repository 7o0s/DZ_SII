When exactly SEGA lost control of its mascot, which in the 90s contested the title of king of platformers with none other than Super Mario, is a matter of debate. Some argue that the first Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast is the last great game in the series, others even save a little later, still others go so far as to say that the latest 2D episodes were already struggling to keep up with their predecessors, all more or less agree that the last years of Mr. The Hedgehog's career are more or less comparable to a via crucis, even with something successful here and there but absolutely nothing comparable to the glories of the past. And all this at various levels, starting from the gameplay: objectively it was more difficult for the unbridled Sonic to adapt to the third dimension than his more thoughtful plumber colleague. Yet Sonic Adventure the third dimension already mastered it (almost) perfectly, what happened next? But there are other issues as well. What exactly is SEGA's policy when it comes to entrusting someone with a new episode of the series? It's not that the Sonic Team has to do them all, but why entrust them often and willingly to illustrious strangers not even able to work properly? What happens in terms of design and construction and coherence of a universe, always aimed at recovering a sort of aura of ~coolness~ - which ours actually had in the 90s - but each time starting over, without a precise direction , eventually becoming fragmented at best, ridiculous at worst? Here, far from becoming a springboard to bring the saga back to at least decent heights, the two Sonic Boom Wii U and Nintendo 3DS exclusives seem to be the definitive bignami of what ruined it. In this sense, they could be very useful for the future. Although for different reasons, the portable version of Sonic Boom doesn't do much better than the Wii U version. I Knuckles, you Jane On closer inspection Sonic Boom is not a canonical episode, being taken from the homonymous animated series. So we will not attribute the aesthetic choices to Sanzaru Games, which at least leave us perplexed. Far be it from us to make a trial of intentions in a field that more than others is affected by the personal taste factor: if someone thought that to make Sonic more attractive to an audience of Western pre-adolescents it was absolutely necessary to put a scarf on him, so be it. It's a bit strange, however, to see, for example, Knuckles transformed into a big, fat and completely brainless thug, Amy into a very annoying know-it-all not able to look after herself, or the very unattractive new entry Sticks. In fact, as we were saying, everyone's tastes come into play here. Where we can be more objective is in the analysis of the structure of the game. Sonic Boom: Shards of Crystal looks like a platformer with 3D graphics but performance purely in 2D, a good thing at first, given that the last 2D episodes (mind goes to the excellent Sonic Rush) are the ones that worked the most. However, the emphasis, rather than on the historic speed and frenzy, was placed on exploration, the collection of gadgets and various objects and puzzle solving. For someone it could already be lese majesty, not for us who strip ourselves of all prejudice and discover that, in the first few minutes, Frammenti di Cristallo is even funny. On a map  la Donkey Kong Country we choose the only playable level at the beginning, the classic umpteenth version of the Green Hill Zone complete with a self-referential soundtrack, and we launch ourselves, immediately discovering that Sonic is much slower than usual. Not bad though, you can sprint, there is the Homing Attack, and you can also take advantage of an energy ray which serves both to deprive some enemies of their protection shield, and to cling to some foundation elements. The exploration, aided by the map viewable on the lower screen, proceeds pleasantly, despite some problems with colliding with the edges of the platforms and the fact that to lock onto an enemy and use the Homing Attack you have to be perhaps a little too close, fact which sometimes leads to unwanted loss of rings; every now and then we also launch into the classic sequences, very little interactive but spectacular, of extreme speed, with buffers, loops and everything a Sonic fan could wish for. Thus we arrive at the end of the first level in about twenty minutes, where one of the objectives was to finish it in 6 and 40; but it's normal, we tried to explore everything carefully by collecting all the collectibles, it will certainly be fun to do a second round with the aim of beating the time limitAnd. Sonic collecting things After the first level, several possibilities open up. First of all, new areas of the map are unlocked, but only one of which is a real game level, the other being special places such as Tails' laboratory or the toy shop where it is possible to exchange the accumulated tokens by responding to particular objectives with nice collectible gadgets. However, Miles ~Tails~ Prower, the historical shoulder of the porcupine, is also unlocked as a playable character, and it is immediately understood that some areas of the first level that were inaccessible in the first round will now be available with the abilities of the two-tailed fox, thus allowing us to recover even more projects (which Tails himself will transform into aids in his laboratory) and even more Fragments of the Crystal, which would then be the main objective of the game. And so we relaunch ourselves in the first level with this particular purpose, but immediately there is something that goes less well than before. The characters are interchangeable in real time, and that's a good thing, but there's less pleasure than before in exploring a level that suddenly seems much larger, labyrinthine until it becomes needlessly convulsive, with the map not being so much meeting signaling, at least at the beginning, very little beyond the structure of the internship. In any case we come to the last phase: there is immediately an area that can only be explored by Tails, which probably hides one of the gadgets to be found, but we decide to tackle Sonic's part first, trusting that we can then go back. Error: there is no going back, and if you want to recover those objects you have to redo the whole labyrinthine map from the beginning. And then you decide to go ahead, that there is the jungle level. Very little different from the first, even more extensive, even more labyrinthine, only that in the end Sticks is unlocked with his new abilities that allow you to reach even new areas, and the thing is repeated again and again until you have all four (l last is Knuckles) the playable characters and therefore all the secrets theoretically available. In the meantime, a particular level was also tackled, a speed race between Sonic and Sticks which almost completely eliminates the exploratory component and will result, on balance, together with similar levels, the phases with a view from behind and the boss fights, the funniest part of all. The 3D effect The dispassionate advice is not to use it. It is not rendered badly, and can be spectacular in the fastest interludes, but it is totally useless for the gameplay and negatively affects the frame rate which visibly drops, losing that fluidity which instead graces a technical component that is not bad at all, perhaps the greatest value ( the only one?) of Sonic Boom for Nintendo 3DS. Compulsion to repeat You will have understood that what we are telling you are, broadly speaking, the first hours of testing of Crystal Shards. And so far things were going well too: sure, some things less successful than others, but in general the experience flowed smooth, playable and fun, with a clear division apparently offered between a fast, frantic and carefree approach to the game, and one more devoted to exploration, slower and more tedious, less successful, but rewarded by the large amount of collectibles. So imagine the discomfort when you unlock a level... but it remains locked. To actually play it, you need to have collected a certain amount of stuff in the previous levels. Panic, boredom, almost a feeling of disgust at the thought of having to redo stages that have already been widely replayed only for small areas not addressed, and of having to go and look for these areas in complicated stages without any help whatsoever. Here at Multiplayer we have always exalted replayability as a much appreciated quality; to be such, however, replayability must meet two requirements. First of all, the phases to be replayed must be fun, and we have seen how in Sonic Boom they are not already after the first time: redoing a level, even a good one, over and over again is already not pleasant in general, and further along the Over the course of the game the level design doesn't evolve one iota, on the contrary it just becomes more and more extensive and intricate. But above all, replayability shouldn't be forced. Sanzaru Games has adopted a very incorrect trick to lengthen the stock and increase longevity, in a title that would not be short on its own, but the trick has turned against its creators. In the testing phase, one has the duty to carry on the work as much as possible, but we really can't imagine a player who doesn't get discouraged at the idea of always facing the same phases over and over again, or alternatively trying to collect all the various ifsgreti (however this is only possible after having unlocked all four characters) in a single order when the world to be faced is so sterilely intricate and does not give any reference points that are not in the memory of those who face it. From this point of view, the pleasure of those parts is also less, more faithful to the original spirit of Sonic, which in itself would also be more than decent. In this desolate landscape, the analysis of the plot, in itself very feeble, arrives almost expected, told through static cutscenes (well dubbed in Italian), which would like to be funny but which are only ridiculous, and which can never be skipped, not even after seeing them for the first time. Not only are you forced to redo an internship ad libitum, but you also have to put up with, always, the interludes that accompany it. Finally, the technical analysis also comes in useless, which would also be positive: rich, colorful, detailed graphics, with a constant and even fluid frame rate if you don't want to take advantage of the 3D effect, very referential music and effects of the old games, not up to the highest peaks of the saga but always enjoyable.", "date": "2014-12-02", "grade": "4.5"}
