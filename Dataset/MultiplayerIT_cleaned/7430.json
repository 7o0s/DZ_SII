Assassin's Creed Pirates, in fact, has nothing to do with the game mechanics that recently saw us control the pirate Edward Kenway, or at least the similarities between the two products are limited to the maritime phases, that is, when you explore the ocean looking for ships to plunder. It is understandable that the French house wanted to push further on this front, after all half of the Black Flag campaign takes place precisely on the water and this theme certainly does not appear as inflated as other aspects of the experience. However, what this mobile spin-off lacks is a plot worthy of the franchise, considering that the protagonist, Alonzo Batilla, finds himself going from slave to pirate captain within five minutes, in a very simplistic way, and the his figure therefore appears devoid of the necessary construction for one to identify with. Indeed, his shots in certain situations are also a bit 'on the boxes. Alonzo is freed by the famous pirate La Buse (really existed) and follows him on his missions until he gains some independence, as well as his respect. As mentioned at the beginning, however, everything takes place at sea, on board the ship that we manage to conquer first and that we will be able to replace once we have raised enough money. What to do to earn it? Looting anyone who comes within range, successfully completing speed races and, in general, thoroughly explore each location in search of missions to complete. Finding a map finds treasure The control of the ship in Assassin's Creed Pirates is clearly based on the same feature of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and works in more or less the same way: by acting on the rudder (via touch or - better - by enabling control via accelerometer) we can change direction to the vehicle, while by pressing the icons on the right side of the screen you can change the speed and adapt it to the conditions and the specific situation in which we find ourselves. It is possible at any time to touch the screen to move the view freely, even if the presence of the main mast and sails often makes it difficult to understand where you are going, especially if there are obstacles to avoid (for example mines). In any case, navigation is pleasant and the technical context is absolutely up to the situation, with some really very beautiful panoramas that contrast with others in which the polygonal count unfortunately reminds us that we are playing on a smartphone or tablet however powerful. However, the rendering of the waves is really good, there is a convincing day / night alternation and there is just a little physics missing to give weight to the ship and the water, which is well implemented in Black Flag. You can explore the map in this way, heading towards the objectives that are reported in any case, or - and here the donkey falls - use the ~tactical~ view. In practice, you touch the map and you are able to move the ship even in this situation, but in a much faster and simpler way, which degrades the experience quite a bit, while making it systematically faster and more expeditious. A need in pure mobile style, which however sinks the good done to make the most of the ship's controls and ~direct~ exploration. Assassin's Creed Pirates is a mobile spin-off with many valid elements and some questionable choices Maracaibo There are icons on the map that represent various mission types. Those of ~assassination~ take place in two phases, with a sort of minigame in which we must avoid being seen by enemy ships, using the ~tactical~ view, to then approach the target in the second phase and fight. Then there are the speed races based on the checkpoints, the missions in which you have to recover objects and bring them back to those who commissioned the shipment, and finally the unlocking of the ~towers~, which consists of a simple battle in the water for control of the area and activating a fast travel point. Maybe a minigame in which Alonzo climbs the lighthouse on duty would have been nice at this juncture, but oh well. Then we come to the combat system, also based on the gameplay of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Approached an enemy ship, it is possible to hit it with the standard cannons, with a ~machine gun~ and a sniper cannon useful for blowing up the enemy's weak pointsor. The action is regulated by various ~cool down~ indicators which also determine the enemy's counterattack, and here we really did not appreciate the solution put in place by Ubisoft, which sees our ship ~dodging~ the cannon fire in an absolutely ridiculous way. It could be managed in many different ways, for example using the same controls and the same dynamics but making sure that the pirates were to get out of the way (as happens in Black Flag). Fortunately, the critical points we have mentioned do not tarnish the good things offered by Assassin's Creed Pirates, i.e. a great substance (without in-app purchase!), an excellent technical realization (also as regards the sound, with the songs of the pirates and the music of the ~major~ version) and a good and fun gameplay, even if it tends to repeat itself.", "date": "2013-12-05", "grade": "7.8"}
