{"name": "Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX Maximum Remix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dave-mirra-freestyle-bmx-maximum-remix.html", "text": "Deja Vu After the fun opening movies, the first thing that catches the eye is the incredible similarity of the graphical interface with that of the most illustrious representative of this genre of games: Tony Hawk's Pro Skate. Upon closer inspection, even the initial movie brings to mind the aforementioned game, presenting the evolution of each of the characters present through short film clips. Those who have tried the Activision title will therefore not have much difficulty navigating through the various menus, which are really too similar, even for the graphics used in the writings. And it is not difficult to recognize the corresponding versions present in T.H.'s P.S. in the manner provided; thus the ~career~ mode becomes ~Pro quest~ without however changing the content since it re-proposes the tested game formula of the skate simulator, albeit with some variations. If you want to go ahead, unlocking new scenarios and pedal vehicles, you will therefore have to pass the proposed tests. However, unlike T. H., Dave Mirra offers a better and gradual approach to the challenges since it provides different levels of difficulty: once the first four required tests have been passed (we are at the ~amateur~ level), you move on to another four, but more difficult (~pro~ ), to finally arrive at a level that requires a really high skill (~hardcore~). The other modes include the canonical ~freeride~, in which to roam freely through the various levels without any time limit, ~session~, as above but over time and the two-player mode which includes several mini-games just like in the Activision title: you can challenge a friend to see who scores the most points, who manages to jump the farthest, or who can fall in the most spectacular way, and so on. The control system is simple and effective: with the x key you jump, triangle to ~grind~ and square and back keys for evolutions. And the circle? This button opens up endless possibilities as, by pressing it at the right time, it allows you to link the various ~tricks~ together, creating new ones as you please. Really nice! The number of basic tricks is in itself very vast (it certainly exceeds that of T.H. !) but, taking into account the various possible combinations, we arrive at the ~modest~ figure of over 1300 possible evolutions! Are you wondering if the whole thing is also fun to do? Don't worry because even the most complicated maneuvers don't require any particular effort on your part and then there's the trick list that shows you all the key combinations! End of a dream? Unfortunately there are also the known mourners, consisting largely of the technical side of the game. In short, they copied everything from his majesty T.H. except the graphics! It's not that it's really bad, but the PSone has certainly seen better: the game engine is quite fluid but there aren't many polygons on the screen; furthermore the textures are a bit subdued and it is possible to notice the sudden appearance / disappearance of some elements of the backdrop which make the use of the title annoying at times. The animations are generally well done (with the spectacular sequences of falls always different from each other thanks to an animation technique of the skeleton that takes into account the different points of impact) but in some cases difficult to digest: this is the case, for example, of when you ~grind~ on a tube or a handrail in which you witness an unnatural position of the bike, perhaps accentuated by a camera that sometimes has a hard time following the actions. If you like punk-rock music, however, this is the title for you, given the presence of songs sung by rather well-known groups in the environment including Cypress Hill, Rancid, Pennywise, etc. Not bad really! The effects are instead limited to the usual ouch! of falls. Longevity is ensured by the presence of twenty tracks (eight plus the twelve of the previous version) and by the desire to unlock all the bikes and costumes available. Let's sum up All in all this Dave Mirra defends itself well, being a discreet but fun and lasting title. If you like Tony Hawk's and want another similar game this could be the right purchase; if, on the other hand, you don't even know what it is, I suggest you try them both: T. H. will captivate you immediately, D. M. will take a little more time due to the technical realization but, once you get over the obstacle of the graphics, I'm sure you will appreciate it a lot (especially the various ~quests~ of the main mode, really well thought out). P.S.: an audio CD containing the songs of the game (13 in all) should be included in the package. Pros: Over 1300 tricks! Fun main modemain Soundtrack Cons: The graphics are not the best Camera a bit iffy Some animations After various games dedicated to skateboarding, mountain biking, surfing and even scootering, it's time to move on to another title dedicated to one of the most popular ~pastimes~ in the States: the Bmx! The rule requires that for each specialty simulated on the console there is an illustrious testimonial and Acclaim does not want to escape the rules, placing a game dedicated to the award-winning world champion (and we are talking about ten world championships!), Dave Mirra, in the reader of the trusted PSone . Actually this is not the first time and the wording ~Maximum Remix~ on the packaging proves it. In this case it is not a totally new game but a revised and corrected version of the previous version.", "date": "2001-07-01", "grade": null}
