{"name": "Unlimited SaGa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unlimited-saga-2.html", "text": "Secret of the Seven Wonders The plot of Unlimited SaGa isn't actually particularly inspired, and it certainly doesn't rival the scripts prepared by the famous software house in the past, but it plays on a factor that made the series famous starting from SaGa Frontier, or the Multiple Scenario System , a mechanic that allows you to follow a common and general narrative line from the point of view of different characters, who sometimes even end up meeting and interacting with each other. This common thread is represented by the mystery of the Seven Wonders of the World, around which the seven main characters and their numerous supporting characters will move. It must be said immediately that from a purely narrative point of view, Unlimited SaGa already has some minor defects: in particular, not all the protagonists enjoy particularly accurate scripts and in general there is a strange apathy during the experience, which is sometimes forced and without thickness. Even the characterization of the characters, despite the splendid character design, does not touch the standard levels normally achieved by SquareEnix, being more than acceptable in a few cases (Laura, Armic, Ruby) and just discreet in others. Fortunately, after about ten hours of gameplay, the narrative barely sets sail, aided by some not exactly epochal twists, and the events become a little more excited, but the problem remains of getting to the tenth hour enduring the previous monotony ...and the game itself. Unlimited SaGa or Limited SaGa? The title is an interesting question, and it will be the first thing the player will ask himself after having grabbed the joypad and entered the various menus of the game. The fundamental premise is urgent: Unlimited SaGa is the bearer of shocking changes in the classic structure of the Japanese Role Playing Game, sometimes not even pleasant, sometimes incredibly interesting, but in any case involuntarily directing towards one and only mental state: the most gloomy and disheartening confusion. In essence, Unlimited SaGa takes the form of a bizarre attempt to merge two profoundly different conceptions of role-playing, the Japanese and the Western one, from a purely playful point of view, with results that are even difficult to explain. From the outset, the usual player of the genre finds himself displaced: the interface is proposed, in fact, as a succession of menus through which it is possible to carry out the most disparate operations, even exploration. Even in cities and villages, this occurs by virtually moving from one location to another and interacting with other characters, shopkeepers, etc., through their graphic representations only and exclusively. No sprites, no three-dimensional models, no digital alter-ego to move in 3D environments or pseudo-such: only admirable artwork upon artwork and dozens of complicated menus. Once you become familiar with the incredible variety of options, you are deluded into finding yourself in front of an exceptional play mechanic, which allows you to apparently do everything: you can recover materials to forge weapons and armor, which will guarantee the use of new and effective spells and combat skills that can also be upgraded and so on. In reality, everything is not so pink and flowers, and we realize this by tackling the various dungeons: these, in fact, cannot actually be explored, as they are represented on the screen as a sort of map, divided into sequential sectors in which from time to time the player will move an icon representing the party by moving the analog stick in the direction of the desired sector, trying to reach the exit, sometimes before a precise limit of turns expires. When this happens, various conditions may occur: one may find oneself in front of a treasure chest (whose lock, if any, can be broken open by a character with the necessary skill), one may be the victim of a trap (and at that point a questionable slot -machine with the speed of a shinkansen will be stopped on the right square to escape the danger...) or run into an enemy. In the latter case, the opponent can be aggressive and deliberately attack the party, or he can ignore it completely and at that point the player will have to decide whether to attack himself or whether to try a so-called diplomatic way to avoid the threat. If the fight begins, you find yourself even more displaced than you were in front of such an abstruse game system: to begin with, each character has a numerical indicator of hit points or HP butthese do not indicate the actual damage as much as the resistance, as once the HP is finished (recoverable on the map by pressing the R3 key, under penalty of losing a few turns) the subsequent damage inflicted by the enemy will affect another indicator, that of the Life Points or LP , which if brought to zero determine the KO of the character; moreover, the player can assign his party five actions, it doesn't matter to which characters, even to himself, but five actions and no more than one. These will be performed respecting a (little logical) scan in turns based on the movement statistics (speed, dexterity, etc.) and before launching them the user will be called to act on a slot machine (another?!) to try to combine various attacks into devastating combos. Also in this case the mach speed of the wheel does not help in an accurate selection, rather postponing the execution to the will of luck. Although apparently simple to explain, it would not be right to criticize the Unlimited SaGa game system for these revolutionary choices by the creative team because, beyond the actual questionability of some of them, once mastered properly (and it takes a long time) allows you to fully enjoy a title that is profound and intriguing, markedly devoted to customizing your own style of play. Art Academy Also from a technical point of view Unlimited SaGa presents many surprises, not all of them positive. As already pointed out, the entire progression in the game unfolds through an infinite series of artworks and paintings with an impressive visual impact to say the least. The scenarios and backdrops (in combat and not), in particular, are made with a wealth of detail, a variety of details and such a high level of attention from an aesthetic and chromatic point of view as to project Unlimited SaGa into the Olympus of the best two-dimensional graphics ever. However, during the fights, one remains perplexed by some choices that certainly do not do justice to the work done from a graphic point of view for the rest of the game: in particular, we refer to the inconstancy of the animations (ranging from well-groomed and spectacular and obscenely in need of frames) and to the abrupt movements of the camera, which zooms without interruption and leaves no respite to the player, also providing him with not particularly pleasant visions, when the rotation of the same around the party shows the complete two-dimensionality of the sprites which incredibly lack frames (precisely) of passage from one side of the shot to the other. Incredible. The graphic effects of the contour, such as lens-flare, transparency and distortions, fortunately configure themselves at the top, presenting a truly commendable sharpness and care in the realization. And speaking of commendations... The strong point of Unlimited SaGa, the aspect that on the technical side really makes it a massive title, is the inevitable soundtrack (in Dolby Pro Logic II), which in this case can be qualified simply as magnificent or divine, the choice is yours. Masashi Hamauzu's musical tracks, numerous and particularly varied, are adequately presented for every situation, accompanying the player with finely crafted motifs, masterfully orchestrated and with an exhilarating rhythm in the most agitated situations or more calm in the most dramatic moments. Even the dubbing, although not reaching the levels of magnificence achieved by the music, is of excellent quality, despite some uncertain actors who do not give some characters the charisma they deserve to captivate the player to the right extent. Comment Also this time the SaGa series is presented in dazzling form, with its load of innovations and revolutions and the inevitable and by now classic defects of the case, caused by this ~daring too much~ which, as always, is not dosed in the right way. The ideas behind Unlimited SaGa distance fans of the JRPG genre in a certain way but, although apparently strange and difficult to understand, they reveal themselves after long game sessions full of surprises and with an enviable depth. Unfortunately, everything is badly balanced due to a poorly calibrated difficulty, a slow and at times monotonous pace and a script that gives little incentive to continue, reserving the twists and stimulating events for the final sequences of the various characters' scenarios. However, Unlimited SaGa also presents a visual realization of incredible quality that allows you to turn a blind eye even to the animations not alwaysup to the well-kept static images and an extraordinary acoustic sector. In short, SquareEnix presents this title to all the detractors who accuse the famous Japanese company of becoming stuck in a genre that is now too lucrative by always making money on the same ideas, demonstrating how sometimes the many coveted innovations can coexist with the care of the technical but also present feedback that is not exactly positive, but for which it is worth the risk, at least to acknowledge that the revolution in the world of video games by really smart software houses is underway, always and in any case, even if perhaps with a superficial eye he doesn't notice it. And also in the next generation, we are sure, there will be SaGa to remind us. Pros A graphic/sound work of art Innovative Intriguing and deep game system Cons Mediocre plot, struggles to mesh Difficulty largely unbalanced The management of the whole is too complex and cumbersome Every time a video game from the SaGa series makes its appearance in the release lists, the good self-respecting JRPG lover is shaken by a tremor. An electrical impulse starts from the brain and spreads throughout the body, causing paralysis, cold sweat, shortness of breath and automatically formulates a question: what the hell will it be this time? In fact, the vocabulary for the word ~inconstant~ should include the covers of this infamous series that has been raging since 1989, when the first episode arrived on Gameboy with the title of Final Fantasy Legend. Until 1991, the series was a contract for the small Nintendo laptop, to then reappear almost by magic on the SNES, with a new title but the same desire to always offer something new: Romancing SaGa reached its third episode, in 1995, meeting acclaim but also fierce protests. With Squaresoft's abandonment of Nintendo platforms, the series was ported to PlayStation, where SaGa Frontier was born, a game that, despite the powerful innovative forces behind it, is still branded one of the worst swindlers in history of video games. The sequel (although we shouldn't really talk about sequels, since all the SaGa are separate from each other, a bit like Final Fantasy), SaGa Frontier 2, desperately tried to fix all the mistakes of the previous and unfortunate episode, but he proposed together with a series of revolutionary concepts (including a new, wonderful way of creating two-dimensional graphics) also an abundant series of serious defects, borrowed moreover from the prequel. SaGa Frontier 2, however, received more praise than criticism and with it ended the path of the SaGa ... at least until last spring, when SquareEnix launched this Unlimited SaGa on the market. The watchword is always the same: renew. But if on the one hand every innovation, in the apparently increasingly stale world of videogames, is more than welcome, on the other it leads in certain cases, like this one, to reflect on its own meaning and on a horrible dilemma: does innovating mean necessarily improve?", "date": "2003-10-01", "grade": null}
