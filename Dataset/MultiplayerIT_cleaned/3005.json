Furthermore, the remastering is excellent and does the original justice perfectly, while improving it in every possible way. Of course, he has a few years behind him and the impact is no longer that of 2007, as is normal, but the epic nature of some moments remains intact. Vote... no, for this you still have to scroll through the whole article. Go in peace. Halo 3, the myth Review of Halo 3 for PC, long, boring and nostalgic version: Halo 3 was one of the games with which Xbox 360 really flexed its muscles. It was the year 2007 and the Microsoft console was making a name for itself in a market where PS3 was struggling, particularly in the United States. Already on the square for two years, he was only missing a Halo to become even more the object of desire of millions of gamers. When it was released, the last chapter of the original trilogy of the saga born in Bungie's forges presented itself as a blockbuster with exceptional production values, with varied and articulated gameplay and filmed sequences that many still remember with admiration. We're talking about what for years has been considered the best first-person shooter for consoles, despite not having revolutionary features like those of Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2. After all, his goal was another: to make the series the coveted technological leap required by what was then still a budding generation. And so it was. Few had anything to complain about. For Xbox console owners that was an exceptional period: just the year before they had been able to play that brutal and disruptive masterpiece which was the first Gears of War by Epic Games, the firstborn of another illustrious series recently enriched by a new chapter , and now they could enjoy a new Master Chief adventure. Moreover, at the time Microsoft commissioned some really wonderful trailers. Who remembers GoW's Mad World? And Belive own of Halo 3? Creepy. Let's go look at them and then come back to close the article. Don't go away. We know we're getting a little too carried away by the memories, but there's the short review that has already said it all, so why not? The plot Halo 3 picks up right where Halo 2 left off. A few days have passed since the final events of the second episode and, after a not exactly textbook landing, the Master Chief is recovered on Earth by a group of soldiers led by Sergeant Johnson, which also includes the Arbiter, now permanently to the anti-Covenant forces. Without getting too lost in pleasantries, weapons in hand, the group immediately sets off. The game begins deep in a forest where you almost immediately come into contact with enemy forces, who are looking for a mysterious and powerful artifact. This object will be the fulcrum of the adventure, which will lead the Master Chief and the Arbiter to work together to stop the Supreme Mind, free the trusted artificial intelligence Cortana, famous for weighing down every PC and being a plague to deactivate (just joking), and put an end to the alien invasion once and for all. Between saying and doing there is a single player campaign playable at four levels of difficulty, made up of exploding bases, large-scale space battles, escapes aboard the Warthogs, continuous shootings and a dramatic and epic ending that still today he manages to be incisive. The remastering Speaking of more purely technical issues, which are the most important in the case of a remastering, as already mentioned, 343 Industries has done a great job of rejuvenation. The PC port is effectively the Xbox One X version, but still has some interesting extra features. In addition to the possibility of playing at very high resolutions, such as 4K UHD, support for ultrawide monitors, impeccable fluidity which remains stable at 60 fps even on not very recent systems, optimization of mouse and keyboard controls and the presence some extra configuration options, there is a perfectly usable multiplayer side with its many modes and twenty-four completely remastered maps, as well as the presence of the Forge, which as in the original allows you to create your own maps and share them with the community. It's not an advanced editor like the Forge of Halo 5: Guardians (or many other PC games), but it's nice that it hasn't been completely cut, if only for sentimental reasons. After all, Halo 3 was one of the first console games to open up to maps made by gamers, albeit in a very timid way, so it's only right thatand this aspect of hers should not be lost like tears in the rain. Speaking of defects, we really struggle to find important ones, all things considered. Of course, a few more graphic configuration options would not have hurt and some players are reporting difficulties in accessing multiplayer. We have not had any problems in this sense, so we limit ourselves to reporting what is readable around, hoping that everything will be resolved as soon as possible. Bottom line, if you have a PC and haven't played Halo 3, do yourself a favor.", "date": "2020-07-15", "grade": "9.0"}
