The idea behind Tom Clancy's HAWX was presented well prepared by Ubisoft, driven moreover by a certain lack of direct competitors in the console sector. In the end, the result proved to be a bit uncertain, leading to fluctuating evaluations from critics, divided between the unconditional appreciation of the impressive graphics sector and a certain lack of bite in terms of gameplay, although the public has probably received the I play better than the specialized press did. On the other hand the defects present in HAWX, which largely recur also in the second chapter, are then the intrinsic ones of the genre itself, in turn a hybrid between simulation and arcade born from the fusion of simulation characteristics with the need for immediacy and limited interface of consoles, a sort of video game chimera that has never managed to achieve truly excellent results so far. The conceptual defects can then be remedied by increasing the spectacularity of the graphics sector and trying to add interest in the progression of the game by studying missions that are as moving and varied as possible, and on both aspects it cannot be denied that Ubisoft and the award-winning company Tom Clancy they didn't work well. After all, Tom Clancy's HAWX 2 despite the mainstream product approach remains in all respects a game that appeals above all to a niche audience, the one that has already appreciated the first one and that will not fail to receive this sequel positively, but an excellent packaging like this can certainly attract and maybe even conquer anyone. A realistic fantasy war Obviously the Tom Clancy signature means a certain certainty in terms of narrative substratum, which also in this case presents itself with a good plot and the usual, rather credible political-fantasy constructions that characterize the author's productions, although here less complex and deeper than what has been seen in other games belonging to the brand (not to mention obviously the book production). Another characteristic element of Clancy is the passion for technology, especially in its ~futuristic but not too much~ declination that we have already seen in the Advanced Warfighter series and in the first episode of this same aerial series, which obviously appears punctually in this second chapter. In essence, we find ourselves here too projected a few years into the future, at a time when various elements particularly prominent in the international terrorist scene are gathered in the Middle East, presumably to try to do something evil. The HAWX squadron (~High Altitude Warfare eXperimental squadron~) is therefore sent again to investigate and possibly act on the site, with the story that in this case alternately follows various fighters belonging to the mixed task force of US, British and Russian pilots . The ingredients are therefore those typical of Clancy's military-political fiction: terrorism, imminent threat, advanced technology and, obviously, Russians (in addition to the positive presence of the pilots, they are also noted for having lost the usual nuclear weapons), all elements presented in a somewhat rhetorical and stereotyped way, however, with a less accurate and convincing construction than seen in other Clancy titles. From this point of view, perhaps the undoubtedly more imaginative epic of Ace Combat may be more appropriate for a game of this kind, but the authorial touch clearly returns in the rhythm imposed on the succession of events and in the variety of actions to be completed, as well as direct references to the Clancy video game universe such as some characters taken directly from the Advanced Warfighter series. Xbox 360 goals 32 achievements, which is an oddly low number for a current game, make up the total of 1000 points available to players. The achievements are spread evenly between the Campaign and other game modes, making it easy to conquer those related to progression in the story but in some cases quite daring to achieve those that require more gaming experience. Lock and destroy The initial impression is actually excellent, between take-off and landing phases, refuelingi in flight, radical changes of scenery and missions driving drones or turret of C-130 to break the normal hunting routine. The controls, while simplified compared to a pure simulator, are still quite complex compared to the norm of console games and require some experience to master properly, but the options inserted for support and the ability to change the level of difficulty at all times they come to the aid of any user. The problem, if anything, is given by the game's own mechanics, also common to other exponents of the same genre: beyond the superstructures, the variations in the scenario, aircraft and armament, it is always a question of framing the usual tiny objectives until turn red, then fire. To spice up the action Ubisoft has seen fit to insert an absurd amount of these objectives, literally filling the HUD with circles, squares and so on on the one hand making everything more lively but on the other hand making the limit of the frustration, even considering the high level of artificial intelligence that makes enemies incredibly precise as well as having infinite resources, as evidenced by the industrial amount of flare they are able to unload if we only try to shoot them down with missiles. It is an exaltation of the dogfight driven to paroxysm, which hardly translates into real fun, although the quality of the graphics does everything to make the action as pleasant and spectacular as possible. Everything takes on another thickness if faced in cooperative multiplayer, at which point the human flight companions become a support on which to actually count (as opposed to the rather uncertain management of the wingmen guided by the CPU) and allow a certainly more pleasant approach even to the more complex missions, although little changes however at the level of the petty mechanics of the combat, which remains affected by the spasmodic pursuit syndrome. This obviously does not represent a problem for fans of the genre, in any case. It looks real Like the first chapter, Tom Clancy's HAWX 2 uses advanced GeoEye technology to reproduce the scenarios of the various missions. These are data and images supplied directly by satellites, reported in high definition and applied directly to the backgrounds as textures. The effect is excellent, although it should be noted that this is extremely pleasant from a distance but as you get closer to the ground the effect vanishes due to a certain scarcity of real polygonal models as well as a considerable loss of definition, at least in the most flat. However, at the normal altitudes in which we will find ourselves flying, the graphics sector works great, which can also be appreciated appropriately in the ~free flight~ mode. If this is combined with the excellent polygonal models of the planes, and a decidedly pressing audio support in pure ~Top Gun~ style, the general framework of the technical infrastructure underlying the game probably represents the element of greatest strength of the entire production. You can't even complain about the amount of options and modes inserted by Ubisoft, since there really are some for all tastes. It starts with the normal Campaign, playable both in single and in cooperative multiplayer, with the additional possibility of returning to the various missions with new aircraft of your choice, unlocked throughout the story (weapons and aircraft are added to a sort of personal ~garage~ which expands as the pilot's experience level increases, which increases based on the amount of objectives completed in the missions). For those who want to jump into the action without too many preambles, the Arcade and Survival modes are available, which can also be played in multiplayer, a mode in which the game seems to demonstrate its best from the point of view of entertainment.", "date": "2010-09-09", "grade": "7.0"}
