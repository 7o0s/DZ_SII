The courtesans to be used to bribe public officials are never enough and when you don't have large economic resources it is difficult to buy the consent of the people. And if you have the misfortune of being a princess with a name suitable only for a film by the Dardenne brothers, you are in really bad shape and you must at least protest with your parents for such a rash choice. Indeed ~Princess Zoe~ sounds dodgy compared to say ~Isabella of Castile~ or ~Queen Victoria~, but you can't help it. Fortunately, you immediately find the help of a shrewd, short and plump adviser who knows much more than you, a sign that the years spent modeling have been completely wasted, at least in a serious realm (perhaps in Italy you could find a niche right away ). Your purpose? Restart the economy, restore prestige to the militia to reconquer the occupied territories. Said like this, it seems like an unlikely undertaking. Indeed it is, since you will have to master the principles of the economy that govern the game world and you will have to build competitive armies with often very few resources available. Easy is it? And we are only at the beginning. Gradual access The single player campaign of The Settlers 7 - Road to the Kingdom looks like a long and detailed tutorial that gradually introduces you to the many facets of the game. Each map is designed to give the player the knowledge of a handful of aspects that will serve to expand and upgrade, up to the final missions in which you have to put into practice what you have learned previously. There are basically three plans on which to win: the construction of buildings to extract and process raw materials, the management of the resources available on a commercial level and, finally, the creation of the army to conquer the neighboring territories. All three aspects are quite complex and require a certain mental plasticity to be perfected, especially when you are left to yourself and you have to start making autonomous decisions. Curiosity With the first update, released before the game was released in stores, The Settlers 7 intertwined with Facebook allowing you to post progress on your personal profile. In short, in addition to the FarmVille sheep, would we now also be inundated with those from the Blue Byte game? But that's not all, because The Settlers 7 also allows you to start using Ubisoft's new online service, Uplay. The advantages? Free extra maps and other more or less interesting material. The Uplay account is the same account used to register for the famous DRM that made so much talk with the release of the PC version of Assassin's Creed II. Build and mine Building is quite simple on paper: you have to select a building and position it in order to make the most of the courtyards, i.e. the spaces adjacent to the main building that direct its function. For example, if there is a pond in the territory with a fish icon (which obviously indicates a fishing area), we will build a hut with at least one courtyard, in which we will in turn build a fisherman's hut. What if there are two resources to extract? Remaining on the previous example, if there is a grove near the lake, we will have to position the hut so as to have at least two courtyards, so as to be able to create one for a lumberjack, as well as one for a fisherman. Obviously the resource extraction buildings must be positioned near them, otherwise they are just wasted space. However, the need to connect each building to the road network must be considered. By not doing this, we will prevent it from working. Certainly the raw materials must be processed and to do so it is necessary to exploit the courtyards of the houses, which can usually be transformed into shops of various types (tailor, baker, butcher and so on). Work requires workers and to get them you need to grow the population, creating housing. Combat and dead spots Once you have the resources, it's time to use them. Some will be used to construct buildings, others to forge coins, still others to cook more refined food. In case of lack of resources, excess goods can be exchanged for more useful ones, creating trade routes. Obviously, the army also has costs and to create an average army you will have to invest a lot (also in terms of time). As already mentioned, the maps are divided into territories which must be conquered to win (in some maps you don't need to conquer them all, but only those that allow you to reach the set goal). To do this you have to send troops, continuessome rather basic principles: whoever attacks must have more than the opponent (or at least they must be better troops) and, if there are fortifications, the latter must be faced with the right troops. Once the defending army is defeated, you simply have to wait a few seconds for the definitive occupation and that's it. The biggest problem of The Settlers 7, which for the rest is a solid and well done management system also from a technical point of view, with well-defined buildings and human models and with generally very colorful and cartoon-style graphics, is the presence of a few dead moments too many, which occurs when everything has been planned well and you have to wait for the accumulation of resources. The artificial intelligence does not behave badly thanks to a series of behavioral profiles studied during development, although obviously playing The Settlers 7 online - Road to the kingdom offers a significantly superior experience, also being able to count on the possibility to mix the presence of human players and AI-controlled forces. Perhaps the lack of originality can also be attributed to him, but pointing the finger too much at this last aspect would be like wanting to condemn the entire videogame industry, given that very little originality can be seen elsewhere too. On closer inspection, the new Ubisoft DRM gave us too many problems which in some situations did not load the profile and forced us to exit and re-enter the game. In general, however, it worked sufficiently, even if it certainly needs to be made less of a dancer in order not to penalize paying players.", "date": "2010-04-02", "grade": "8.0"}
