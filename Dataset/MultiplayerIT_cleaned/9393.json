And quite a lot as well. Thus, although some members had already worked in MotoGP under the historic Climax, it is not at all surprising that, with MotoGP 09/10, Monumental Games has committed various naiveties from the first time, giving life to a technically poor product which has been trivialized in an attempt to take refuge in an unashamedly arcade approach. The intention of making the new chapter of the series more prone to simulation seemed to suggest greater confidence on the part of the developers, and the hope was that, having finished their apprenticeship period, they could now give birth to a worthy rival for the SBK series, satisfying the old enthusiasts of motorcycle simulations and taking advantage of all the criticisms received last year. Where is the DesmoVale? Unfortunately, the new chapter of the Capcom-branded series already starts old, with a roster of riders and bikes that refers to the past championship. Impersonating a Valentino Rossi astride his historic Yamaha YZR-M1, while in a few days he will make his debut with Ducati in the 2011 world championship, makes one's nose turn up a bit. It's true, the name itself refers to last year, and in any case it is a fairly endemic problem in sports games with official licenses, which often struggle to keep up with the latest sales. Yet at present there remains the feeling of being faced with an obsolete title right from the introduction movie, although it is probable that, in the coming months, Capcom will publish an update that renews the database for the 2011 championship. However, a few laps are enough to clearly notice the attempts that the developers have done to improve the gaming experience in all respects, and it is in bends and on the straights that, handlebar in hand, you can appreciate the most evident steps forward. An immoderate camera shake allows you to have an excellent sense of speed without necessarily resorting to a disengaged exaggeration of the blur effect, an all too comfortable expedient used by many driving games in a not always successful way. Compared to the past, the physics on the curbs has also been revised which, although it still has room for improvement, has finally ceased to be as insignificant as before. The behavior of the bike on the grass at the edge of the track is also decidedly more credible, but the same cannot be said for collisions with other riders, botched and leading to surreal head-to-head, while everything is encouraged by a poor AI of the opponents who, despite now tending to follow in the player's footsteps more frequently, on certain occasions behave in an all too intrepid way. Fortunately, the promises to make the new MotoGP more simulative have been kept, even if only in part: before any race it is in fact possible to choose which driving aids to activate or deactivate, customizing the approach to the handlebar according to one's abilities or needs of the player. In an instant you find yourself faced with a much more complex and less accessible game, which requires you to manage and take into consideration various characteristics of the bike and the rider. The introduction of the two brakes is certainly the most successful and most needed part: as in SBK, now you can freely decide whether to lock the front wheel or make small corrections on the trajectory using the rear brake, thus having greater control in the detached. The possibility of managing the rider's weight and deciding when to crouch down to assume an aerodynamic position is also very welcome, gaining advantage on the straights but clearly sacrificing a large part of the bike's handling. Unfortunately, the management of the pitch is less convincing: following sudden braking, in fact, the tail of the racing car often struggles to lift, while in the acceleration phase the bike tends to wheelie sharply even when it shouldn't, and it was of little use for us to vary manually the stiffness of the suspension. The feeling, especially at the beginning, is thus that of being in the saddle of a wild bull, more difficult to tame but which is still far from the simulation that one would expect. Playstation 3 trophies MotoGP 10/11 allows the player to unlock 43 trophies, but like last year they remain quite simple to unlock. Most can be obtained simply by progressing in Career and gaining a good reputation, by winning a race or by covering a certain amount of kilometers. Obviously there are some slightly more complex challenges, such as completing the modChampionship action without ever losing. Damage and accidents Also for this year Monumental Games hasn't made the slightest effort to propose a serious damage system and, despite the collisions and falls, the player will never see even a scratch on his bike; the only change is represented by the wear of the tyres, which however is almost irrelevant on the maneuverability of the bike if the braking support is not deactivated. Obviously, newbies and lovers of more arcade experiences can leave all the aids active and enjoy a guide that is as carefree as it is unreal. Curious is the possibility of pausing the game at any time and rewinding time up to several seconds earlier, allowing you to remedy a sensational mistake and try again until a tricky curve or reckless overtaking is performed correctly. It is a gimmick that pushes the player to cheat, but which also allows him to understand his mistakes and the best way to overcome a given situation, becoming less and less relevant as you improve. Nothing new, however, as regards the game modes: in addition to the classic Time Trial and the possibility of tackling the last season of the world championship in the Championship mode, MotoGP 10/11 offers a full-bodied Career which, after creating a rider -hoc, it allows you to start from the 125 class, go through the 250 and get to the coveted MotoGP. This part of the game is made much more interesting by the editing and management options for your team, ranging from signing agreements with sponsors to buying new bikes, passing through the aesthetic and performance improvements of your two-wheeler. There is also a multiplayer mode, which online supports races of 20 players and locally gives the possibility of challenging each other in split-screen, where a friend can enter and exit Career mode at will to join the player's team. Yet it is almost depressing that these premises have not been accompanied by a better presentation, and each race opens with a short cut-scene that is always the same and always lackluster. And it is precisely on an aesthetic level that the new chapter in the series slips, tumbles off the track and crashes into a concrete wall: the graphic improvements compared to last year are there, mind you, but they are so insignificant that the game appears even more old and far from today's standards. The models of the riders and motorbikes still border on the worst, but the bottom line is reached with circuits that are absolutely bare and devoid of details. To be commended is at least the fact of making the colors less saturated than last year, giving the bikes a less toy and more realistic look.", "date": "2011-03-25", "grade": "7.0"}
