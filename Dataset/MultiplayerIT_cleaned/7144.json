China Rising consists of four maps, a new (but not new) game mode, five weapons for almost all classes, namely two L-85 and MTAR-21 assault rifles, the MP7 compact machine gun, the rifle bolt action sniper rifle and a timeless classic like the Russian-made RPK-74 machine gun. In short, a good mix of welcome returns and new tools of the trade. Alongside all this there are the means, to be understood as new gadgets, the two SUAV and UCAV drones and real means, i.e. the motocross bikes and strategic bombers, one for each faction: the Americans sweep the battlefield with the B -1B Lancer, while the Chinese do it with an old but effective license-built Cold War holdover, the Xian H-6. It goes without saying that to ~board~ vehicles the player must capture a control station and then drop JDAMs on enemy emplacements at will. And since we're talking about planes, the new game mode is Air Superiority, a sort of aerial Conquest, present in Battlefield 3 and obviously in Battlefield 1943. Great duels around airships to conquer and little else. Sin. But the biggest disappointment of this package is the maps. Their quality is unquestioned, but they don't have any Levolution events. In practice, visual boost aside, they may have been taken by force from the previous chapter. A strange choice by Swedish developers, and we honestly don't understand why. We played the first expansion of Battlefield 4: here's our review Playstation 4 trophies China Rising rewards the player with five trophies: three bronze and two silver. The most difficult commits us to obtaining all the assignments, but even killing an opponent with the SUAV drone is not that easy. Killing enemies with the bike and bomber is much less challenging, as is taking home a bronze for playing a game of Air Superiority. Exotic China... Levolution aside, the new maps maintain the usual high quality that has always distinguished DICE. Without a doubt, the battlefield that we most appreciated is that of Silk Road, set in the Gobi desert. Huge and vast, characterized by dunes and small canyons, it is the perfect map to show skeptics what the typical Battlefield gameplay is, capable of uniting the clashes between infantry, land and air vehicles into one, in an alchemy from real ~total war~. A layout that from above sees the control points looking at each other, arranged in two parallel rows, fortified shelters and bunkers in the middle, everything you need in short to go from a large-scale armored assault made very difficult by the ups and downs dunes and excellent close quarter combat where tanks can be easy prey for enemy rocket launchers. From the wide spaces of the Silk Road we move on to the decidedly narrower ones of Guilin Peak, so narrow that Air Superiority is done aboard helicopters and not jets. A map therefore decidedly focused on the clash between infantry, but which can still be played with great pleasure, thanks to the usual superfine level design, centered on a central area inside a cave, on the sides of which there is a very dense jungle and dangerous, which makes it perfect for bloody ambushes. Heavy vehicles, apart from helicopters, are not present, an even clearer sign that the infantry, or all those who want a break from racing at breakneck speed on the sand of the Silk Road, are at home here. A more than good map, but one that struggles to be a real plus of the package. Altai Range is much larger than Guilin Peak, and revolves around a sort of plateau that dominates the whole map and which consequently must be conquered and strenuously defended to avoid ending up like fish in a barrel, given that from above even armored personnel carriers are particularly vulnerable. Altai Range is therefore ideally divided in two, with the battle for control of the mountain mirroring that which takes place further down, where those forced to attack must fight twice to get the better of the enemy. This thing that enhances team play and does not admit tactical errors. At first glance it could be branded as trivial, but by playing it you realize its great potential. All in all, a nice map. Rounding out the list of new maps is Dragon Pass, which is a revised and corrected version of the old and much loved Dragon Valley, present in Battlefield 2 and Battlefield Play4Free. Dragon Pass presents all the ~assets~ of the game and puts them to the whip between rivers, gorges, narrow streets, small villages, high mountains and all kinds of natural obstacles that, if taken lightly, make you lose a game in the blink of an eye. This is why we are in the presence of a decidedly demanding map for everyone, soldiers and land, air and water vehicles. And that is why it is tremendously fun and decidedly rewarding. In practice, the exact opposite of the endless spaces of the Silk Road. A first DLC, this one, that we liked: the lack of Levolution is not a small flaw, of course, but the level design is spot on as usual and is also functional when changing game modes. An expansion, therefore, which effectively broadens the horizons of the ~smooth~ DICE product and which we feel comfortable recommending for this reason.", "date": "2014-05-04", "grade": null}
