{"name": "Mirror's Edge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78581-mirrors-edge-la-fiducia-dellipad.html", "text": "Although iPad has largely been able to demonstrate its uniqueness and personality compared to iPhone and iPod Touch in most areas of use, where it has left something to be desired so far is in the aspect more properly related to gaming; although in fact there are already dozens, if not hundreds of games for the Apple tablet on the App Store, the vast majority of these are nothing more than HD versions of the iPhone equivalents, perhaps with a few more features and options. To find exclusives worthy of the name, with titles available only on the iPad, you really need to engage in research; among the very few noteworthy examples there is undoubtedly Mirror's Edge by Electronic Arts, present on the online store since the system's American debut. It is an ad hoc version created exclusively for this occasion, therefore far from the original DICE released at the end of 2008 on consoles and PCs. Faith no more If the gameplay has been adapted, on the contrary the settings, protagonist, style and themes have been reproduced in a completely faithful way; a completely negligible plot narrated in a textual way (and with an inexplicably grainy font for the characters) between one level and another only acts as a glue to make sense of Faith's run, which again constitutes the cornerstone of the gameplay . The substantial difference therefore lies in the change of angle, which passes from the first person of the aforementioned first Mirror's Edge to a third with a side view of this iPad edition. Although some movement of the camera tends to underline the spectacular nature of the action and the discreet goodness of the polygonal modeling, the transition from a 3D to a 2D mechanic has in fact profoundly transformed the final product. Those who have had the pleasure of playing the beautiful Canabalt, a successful browser game also transported to the App Store, will easily find many similarities with the gameplay adopted on this occasion; in a nutshell, it's about running from one part of the level to another avoiding obstacles, jumping on platforms and eliminating enemies. The ~flow~, i.e. the ability to proceed without interruptions, certainly represents the main and most gratifying objective of the product. Where the programmers have certainly hit the mark is in the control scheme, fortunately not delegated to pads or virtual keys; on the contrary, everything is based on touches and swipes, with a fairly intuitive and satisfying system. For example, to run, simply swipe your finger in the desired direction, while a tap makes the protagonist Faith stop; to jump instead you have to crawl up, or down to slide or land after a particularly large leap. Similar speeches also for all the other commands. A valid solution, even if not perfect; in the most complicated and agitated situations it is not uncommon to get confused or - worse - to see the system interpreting one's inputs incorrectly, with easily understandable consequences. Fortunately there are checkpoints generously scattered along the way, so as to reduce frustration. However, such a simplification of the gameplay struggles to find a satisfactory balance, with a middle ground that leaves a little perplexed; in fact, we are neither at the level of the extreme, synthetic and clean rarefaction of Canabalt, nor in the face of something more complex and robust. The result is that the surprise effect soon tends to run out, thus finding oneself faced with rather repetitive and cyclical situations that do little to sustain the product in the long run; the same goes for the level design, just sufficient and never capable of surprising with refined or elegant solutions, despite crossroads and bifurcations that are quite fine in themselves. The speech improves significantly thanks to the split-screen multiplayer, in which you can challenge a friend to a speedrun on the levels already completed in story mode. The aesthetic component is good, which although during the close-up shots denounces a certain poverty of details, overall it is pleasant and well done above all thanks to the very original stylistic figure for the use of colors. Finally, a point against it is the price, set at a good 10.49 euros; a little too much considering the average on the App Store and in the face of a very low longevity.
