{"name": "FIFA 14", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123519-fifa-14-il-calcio-totale.html", "text": "Despite the daily diatribes over TV rights, the scandals and the controversies over a penalty given or not given, football remains the favorite sport of most Italians. On the other hand, to confirm this passion, it would be enough to take a ball, bounce it near a group of people - it doesn't matter what age or social background - to see the latter pounce on the ball and pass it to each other. Perhaps by making simple evolutions to emulate the plays of their favorite, between a joke and a laugh, as if that simple spherical object had freed who knows what from their soul. Because, let's face it, the true essence of football is precisely this, regardless of everything: the pure, almost childish fun of running after a ball. It is therefore no coincidence that even in terms of video games among the best-selling titles, and therefore the most sought after, there is always at least one dedicated to this sport. The choice in this sense takes place in this period, when the two eternal rivals of the electronic football scene arrive in the shops. Indeed, in these days, with the release of FIFA 14 about a week after that of the eternal rival, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014, what has become almost a sort of ritual is being fulfilled. At the market the arduous sentence on who will be the public's favorite, we have the honor and the burden of telling you about this fourteenth chapter of the football saga signed by Electronic Arts. FIFA 14 takes the series one step further towards total simulation The challenge begins The first thing that catches your eye once you start the game are the new menus, completely redesigned from scratch to offer a better visual result, but also greater functionality. They come with a window structure very similar to that of Windows 8, which allows the user to access any section of the title in a flash, and to always keep everything he needs in full view. With a quick movement you can therefore select one of the many modes present in FIFA 14, which are broadly the same as in 2013. For this reason we quickly liquidate the classic ones, such as friendlies, cups and official or customized championships, and limit ourselves to hint at the presence of one's virtual footballer with the relative challenges to increase its characteristics, the creation center integrated with the official site for players, the season and so on. On the other hand, the situation for the Seasons session is different, which alongside the traditional features related to matchmaking, the trophy cabinet and division titles, in its online counterpart also supports the unprecedented Co-Op option. This allows a couple of friends to compete against two other human users in ranked 2vs2 matches. Both options are in turn also contained within the Match Day, therefore everything that happens in real football leagues will no longer affect only a single challenge (the matches of the week and those of the month) but also the entire tournament that is currently taking place in the game. In fact, if you remain permanently connected to the EA servers, updates are downloaded relating to real matches, teams, the form of individual players, but also the list of injured and disqualified players, changes in form made by the coach and so on. Sensible innovations are also registered for EA Sports Football Club, a product area that represents the culmination of production in terms of statistics and data collection across all game modes, renewed this year with the addition of the possibility of immediately accessing the status of friends, quickly send them messages, and gift unlockables from the catalog. Today I train Also new for what remains the most important section of the single player component, namely the Career, which this year has undergone changes in the part in which the user plays the coach. This, in fact, has been enriched by a system of scouts to be sent around the world in search of talent. Behind the so-called global transfer network there is actually nothing new, if not the reworking of a function that already existed in the past. Simply if before the observers limited themselves to following young offshoots invented from scratch from the whole game, to eventually grow in the nursery, now they can monitor the performance of really existing athletes and provide a series of reports on specific request from the manager more and more complete on their characteristics and potential. Just set a series of search criteria and they'll take care of the rest. Still on the subject of the market, there is the poAbility to disable first transfer window transfers, so you can have teams with their original rosters until at least January. Then we have the option to automatically decide to refuse new offers in the future for a specific athlete who has already decided not to sell, avoiding that requests continue to flood in on him. A couple of changes also regarding team management, since now you can change the scheme on the fly without wasting time wandering around in the secondary menus of the modules, and the fatigue of the players, who will take a little more time to get back in full shape. For the rest, the gamer will have to work well on and off the field in order not to be exonerated, trying to juggle the pitfalls of a transfer market characterized by different variables both in the buying and selling phase, in relations with the staff, with the players (communication with them no longer takes place by e-mail but quickly) and with the press. Also in this FIFA 14 the developers have tried to give more prominence to the identification aspect, increasing the amount of news related to the teams and tournaments, the expectations of the fans and those of the management. In short, even if the Career section remains a mode without any simulation ambitions at a managerial level, in our opinion it is always an interesting experience to live. At least as much as that of Ultimate Team, the mode that allows you to create your own ideal team by basing the purchases and exchanges of players, represented by a sticker that indicates their global value, on an auction system. For details on the subject, we invite you to read our article available at this address. Here, for reasons of space, we limit ourselves only to highlighting what are probably the two most interesting innovations included in the 2014 edition, namely the Entente function, which gives more weight to the harmony between the various players, and the possibility of transfer game progress from the current to the next generation of consoles. In other words, if some user decides to switch to Xbox One or PlayStation 4 in the future and play this mode, they will be able to do so without having to start all over again, given that it will be possible to import all their data, the results achieved and the team managed on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, even maintaining classification within the division. Faces from FIFA 14 As with its predecessors, FIFA 14 also offers full coverage for many leagues, with official licenses for both the tournament and the teams that participate in it. Our Serie A, while not showing the logo, is still present with the shirts and royal crest of the various clubs of the season that has just begun. For Serie B however, only Pescara and Palermo enjoy this coverage. It is a different matter for the faces of the athletes and here once again EA proves to be inattentive towards the Italian fans: in fact, if we exclude those already present, plus a couple of ~new entries~, such as for example Vidal or Nagatomo, and practically the entire Milan roster, including players like Nocerino or Silvestre, who present their real faces, the vast majority of players in the Italian league have generic faces. Seeing in 2014 Vucinic, Pogba, Milito, Palacio or Maggio with inauthentic and little resemblance faces, or Pirlo and Marchisio without a beard is annoying to say the least. Especially if we consider that entire foreign teams, even not very prestigious ones, can boast a better treatment regarding the faces of their players. In any case, we point out the presence of sixty stadiums including Everton's Goodison Park and the Donbass Arena, Shakhtar Donetsk's temple; then we have the update of the rosters of the teams but not on the last day of the transfer market, with Higuain in Naples but Kak not yet in Milan for example, in addition to the official licenses of the Argentine, Chilean, Colombian and Polish championships, plus that of all Brazilian and Shakhtar clubs. A better FIFA? After having largely dissected the FIFA 14 game options, let's go into the analysis of the actual gameplay. The precision of the movements on the field and that of the behavior of the ball are to be considered the real dogma of this new edition, strongly concentrated on what appears to have been a sort of watchword of Electronic Arts: ~physicality~. Of the athletes, of the contrasts, of the ball. The result, pad in hand, is initially unsettling, a bit like when users had to get used to tactical defense in 2012. The ball remains less attached to the player, it's not possible to play phenomena in midfield, but rather you have to defend thereball (the protection of the ball with the body is enhanced by the pressure of the left trigger for greater effectiveness) and knowing how to spin it appropriately with the help of teammates. Who, thanks to renewed routines, move intelligently to suggest passage or to create gaps: the overlaps have been improved and it often happens that these not only serve to dictate the assist, but also to create spaces for colleagues , opening the defenses with deadly diagonals useful to offer a greater range of options to the ball carrier. In the light of what has been described, a slower and more reasoned pace of play emerges, but not for this static or boring, with a moderate increase in the level of difficulty that goes hand in hand with the increased realism. We are certainly closer to what actually happens on a football field, where in the face of a certain schematic there is the crazy variable made up of the talent of great champions such as Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. The latter can use their skills to jump the man and try to fly towards the opponent's area, but they certainly have to work much harder than in the past to succeed in the enterprise. Also because an improvised shot, followed by a wrong movement can easily lead to losing the ball. In some ways, this is beneficial to the gameplay, because the inherent difficulty in building an action in midfield, and in avoiding the opponent's pressing, actually forces a more careful approach. Also under cover. The defenders mark better, they move with that typical attention that a sentient human being should have occupying that role and if necessary they play in advance or patiently wait for the opponent's movement, not sparing to use the physique, when needed, to assert themselves . Each contrast becomes, in fact, an experience in itself, as demanding as unpredictable in the results. The engine that determines the disputes and that generally controls the physics of the game makes itself felt by giving the virtual athletes their own weight, which is also felt visually, with the players who, when they run and walk, seem more anchored to the ground, in the sense that they really give the idea of touching the grass rather than ~sliding~ on it. The rewrite of the animation system also contributes to this. Called Realistic Movements, this change was dictated by the developers' desire to make the players' movements more correlated to the dynamics related to running and body gestures during acceleration and deceleration, dribbling or changes of direction. The latter, in particular, are less immediate than the last edition, because as in reality, an athlete needs the right amount of time to regain control of his balance and try to regain possession of the ball or to continue the action. Still on the subject of physics, evident changes are also recorded on the ball front, which has become heavier than seen in the past and therefore more credible in its way of ~behaving~, especially in rebounds. The consequence is that the shots on goal and the passes are more unpredictable, also thanks to the need not to press the button of the relative control too much in advance, and it is easy to miss the ball if you get long on it, especially in headers. Which every now and then generates some comical situations. On the other hand, when you do everything right, decidedly satisfying conclusions of rebound, full back or full neck come out. The improvements are clearer precisely in the trajectories that the shots take in relation to the position of the attacker with respect to the ball or the obstacles constituted by the body of some opposing defender. There are many solutions to beat the excellent goalkeepers of FIFA 14, and it's up to the user to decide practically in full where and how to kick the ball, whether with the inside or outside foot, with the toe or with the neck. For the rest in FIFA 14 we have an excellent response to commands, the ability to choose manual controls and that certain feeling that has distinguished the series for some time. Xbox 360 goals There are 43 goals offered by FIFA 14 for a total value of 1,000 points. To get them you need to be able to win certain challenges in the different modes present in the game, such as being able to make complex feints, make a perfect hat-trick by scoring each goal with a different foot and header, or win the most important competitions in which you participate both online and offline. An almost flawless direction Proceeding in our analysis of the EA Sports title, let's take a look at its technical part, where we point out that from a graphic point of view there are no great", "date": "2013-09-23", "grade": "9.2"}
