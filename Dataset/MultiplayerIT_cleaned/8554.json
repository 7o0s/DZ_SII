Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Is it more strange that a cat lets itself be shot from a cannon of its own accord or that it is engaged in the rescue of a particular species of flying fish? Because this is precisely our mission in Cannon Cat, a nice completely free action game, available for a few days on the App Store in a universal format and therefore compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. The protagonist of the game is precisely Cannon Cat, an acrobat cat (complete with overalls and helmet) specialized in getting shot from one cannon to another and capable of covering long distances and hitting difficult targets thanks to his... feline reflexes. There are two scenarios currently available: Kapalua Islands and Cedaria Reef, for a total of eighty stages to which others will be added shortly, thanks to the arrival of a new location (Stratos) via update. The gameplay of the title developed by Loqheart is extremely immediate and works through a simple touch of the touch screen, a touch that activates the cannon in which the cat is at that particular moment. The first levels act a bit as a tutorial, in the sense that they offer a low-level challenge and can be completed in a matter of moments, but things gradually become more complex and at a certain point you will need to have good reflexes and calculate well the timing to be able to bring home the result. To make life easier there will be a whole series of bonuses and upgrades that we can buy by spending the virtual money earned during the stages (or by using real money to buy some packs of coins), and which allow us to complete one more mission leave without starting over at game over, increase the size of flying fish and so on. Purrrrrrfect! Cannon Cat uses a hybrid system for unlocking new levels, i.e. you can access them provided you have completed the immediately previous ones, even with a not exactly brilliant evaluation. The stages can in fact also be completed by collecting only part of the flying fish that ~gravitate~ between one cannon and another, moving to make contact on the fly more difficult and further push the accelerator on the importance of timing. The ~mediocre~ results, however, remain visible in the list of missions and the idea is therefore to push the player to try them again to get the perfect score. Probably a ~coin~ style solution, the one that is most popular on the App Store, would have made access to the new scenarios less trivial and given a little more depth to the experience, which however is always very fun and engaging. The whole first ~zone~, Kapalua Islands, sees us simply engaged in switching from one cannon to another, with the devices moving jerkily or continuously to make it more difficult to switch from one part of the screen to another. In the second area, Cedaria Reef, however, things get even more difficult and creatures are introduced with a soft ~belly~ and a back full of spines, which rotate continuously and which we must use as ~banks~ to reach our goal from time to time. In short, the action remains quite varied and the arrival of a third scenario can only further improve the quality of the product, which also boasts very nice graphics, with pleasant colors.", "date": "2012-05-05", "grade": "8.0"}
