The hope is always to create the best possible party, which must not only celebrate the birthday boy in the best possible way but must also please all the participants. This is somewhat the essence of Sonic Mania, a game that pays homage to SEGA's blue hedgehog by combining the old glories of the past belonging to Sonic The Hedgeohog, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles and Sonic CD with specially created extras for the occasion. The result is a fun and complete title, which has its roots in the blue hedgehog fan base: in fact, the project was brought to life by a group of developers led by Christian Whitehead, a particularly active personality in the Sonic community, so much so that he was noticed and collaborate with SEGA on the mobile porting of the old chapters of the saga. Without forgetting the careful supervision of Sega's Sonic Team, we can say that Sonic Mania is a game that was born ~by fans for fans~ and we would like to underline this aspect not only for the purposes of the review but above all because Sonic Team itself has defined the work done with Mania as crucial for the future of the franchise. Everything transforms Once we have chosen one of the three selectable heroes (Sonic, Tails or Knuckles) we will be ready to start our game and after a short introductory film where Doctor Eggman's new robo-villains are presented we will find ourselves where it all began, in Green Hill Zones. Including the iconic first level, the rest of the game follows one another through eleven other zones following the division between the first and second act. The gameplay is exactly the same as the old chapters for SEGA Mega Drive: the aim of the game is to complete the schemes in the shortest possible time, collecting rings, saving the path made at the check points and collecting the seven Chaos Emeralds through bonus stages. As in the past, each character has his own set of special skills at his disposal, so Knuckles glides by climbing walls, Tails flies and swims while Sonic, in addition to being able to use all the skills provided by the shields, will be able to use a quick spin dash. The individual skills of the protagonists will slightly vary the path possibilities, thus leading us to explore different areas from time to time depending on the chosen character. The classic TVs are scattered within the levels which will offer the player extra speed, invulnerability, rings, shields, lives and power-ups, essential considering the dense group of enemies present, which once destroyed will increase our score... and they will free the pet trapped inside. This important part of the game is the only one left unchanged because everything else has seen heavy changes. One of the very first things that catches the eye during the game is the presence of all the power ups in all levels, even outside their ~temporal~ context; for this reason in the levels belonging to the first and second chapter we will find, for example, bubble, electric and fire shields belonging to the following chapters. Another important difference is visible in the two bonus stages that will provide Chaos Emeralds and gold and silver coins as a reward upon completion; the former can be recovered by completing a bonus stage similar to that of Sonic CD, where we will have to chase a ship and can be accessed through the giant rings scattered throughout the levels. By passing a check point with at least 25 rings we will instead have access to the stage of the blue spheres of Sonic Yhe Hedgehog 3 and based on our performance we will be able to earn a silver or gold coin. To close the bonus parenthesis, it is essential to specify that the review was written by completing a game without collecting either the Chaos Emeralds or the 32 gold coins: we are sure that these collectibles unlock special content, after all owning all the Emeralds of Chaos in the past allowed characters to transform into their ~Super version~, but today we cannot tell you precisely what the unlockable extras are. The extra item is then one of the five menu items available on the home screen, where we will view our coin collection; in addition to the classic options and adventure, there is also the Chrono mode, or the classic time attack, and the competition mode. The first is a simple time trial where we should finish the level in the shortest possible time without facing the bosses while in competition we will be able to challenge another player locally with split-screen in a speed race. If you don't want to compete, you can always be joined in the adventure in a cooperative respecting what happened in the past: from this point of view it is whereroso to address a thought to the Switch version of Sonic Mania where the portable and ~convivial~ nature of the Nintendo console certainly makes better use of the multi-player modes. Playstation 4 trophies There are fewer than twenty PlayStation trophies and only three silver ones, all dedicated to the game's collectibles. The rest are bronze trophies that are not so simple to take home: it will take a good deal of patience and skill to collect them all! Too much love The modernization work carried out touches various aspects of the title as seen and as you can guess the most significant concerns the level design, a reflection that we have deliberately kept as last because it is more complex to deal with. The levels belonging to the past are eight in total combined with four completely new ones (Studiopolis, Press Garden, Mirage Saloon and Titanic Monarch) and those we already know are not exactly as we remembered them because The Taxman (it's the nickname of Whitehead) and the his team have not only created new levels but completely revolutionized the original ones: we will therefore find the zip lines of Angel Island in Green Hill or we will have to sweep away the fumes of the Ocean Oil plant in the same way in which the light was turned on in the pyramid of Sandopolis. Even the new areas borrow something from the past while maintaining a unique identity and a keen eye will surely enjoy looking for all the references and references to the classics. The changes made are clearly aimed at considerably increasing the speed of navigation of the levels, even if finding the fastest way won't always be so simple given that all levels have been given a marked vertical dimension that was somewhat lacking in the previous chapters. Arriving at the important twenty-fifth anniversary, we had the opportunity to play the Sonic classics in all sauces and on practically all platforms, so a different twist from the usual was not only welcome but almost a must. The levels are therefore different, faster and more intricate but unfortunately this is not always pleasant to experience during the game: in fact, navigating the levels (especially the new ones) sometimes you get the feeling that these are too dense and sometimes all these roads, enemies and interactions such as springs and buffer balls are a bit disorienting, not to mention that losing speed in some points means getting quite ~bogged down~ and having a bit of an effort to get out of it. This sensation is not easily identifiable in a single element but varies a lot, becoming more overpowering only in some acts or even single outlines of an act; instead the work done on the bosses is impeccable, even these full of references to the past but still well calibrated in difficulty and above all variety. If the great mix of areas, bonuses and power-ups could make some fundamentalist fans turn up their noses without however affecting the gaming experience, the lack of general cleanliness in the level design is sometimes felt and disorienting. The team that worked on Sonic Mania certainly knows its stuff and if SEGA hadn't been satisfied with the result in the first place we certainly wouldn't have had a title to play in this very hot August but this microscopic stumbling block could demonstrate that sometimes loving something madly doesn't allows you to have a completely objective eye on the work done.", "date": "2017-08-14", "grade": "8.0"}
