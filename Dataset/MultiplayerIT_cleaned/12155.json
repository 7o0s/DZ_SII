{"name": "Chernobylite", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chernobylite-recensione.html", "text": "April 26, 1986. The day when the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe changed the lives of 350,000 people forever: among them also Igor, a young and passionate physicist who worked in the facility. The disaster has taken away something precious from him too, his girlfriend Tatyana, and after being tormented by ghosts of the past for thirty years, he decides that the time has come to silence them by seeking those answers they seem to want. Our journey into the Zone of Alienation opens with these premises, which will become the heart of the entire Chernobylite experience: it is not pure horror, on the contrary, after hours and hours spent wandering non-stop through the desolate territories around Chernobyl, the the impression we got was that of a Fallout raised to the power of its most disturbing moments. The soul of the game is more of a RPG with a very strong survival component, which is accompanied by the horrors that the nuclear disaster has caused (and many other physical/scientific explanations that we would not be able to report even if we wanted to, given the complexity). Chernobyl is certainly not a new element in the imaginary, videogame or otherwise, but the experience proved to be very engaging in this case thanks to an incredibly faithful and immersive reconstruction, in its desolating terror. Between nightmarish creatures and government soldiers, Igor's search for the truth will prove to be much more complex than it might seem. Let's find out about Chernobylite in the review of the PC version. Adapt, fight, survive The bleak landscapes of Chernobylite. As anticipated, Chernobylite is above all a RPG with a strong emphasis on survival: we will have to learn to move with caution within the Alienation Zone, looking for resources that can come in handy, evaluating if and when to enter combat, how to do it if we are forced and above all thinking about how to grow, to return to the field stronger than before. In fact, every action by Igor, whether it is the collection of resources, the resolution of events, the killing of enemies or the completion of the main mission, allows us to earn experience points which in turn converge into skill points to be spent by speaking with teammates. The protagonist's objective is in fact very precise: to save Tatyana, who, despite having been missing for thirty years, he is sure to find in the hands of the government. To do this we need to meet the requirements of the action plan, among which we need to put together a team of five elements: each of them will be able to teach us precise techniques related to their background and their life following the Chernobyl disaster, through a short field training. It's up to us, based on the style of play that we will adopt, to choose how to grow and which aspects to focus on, bearing in mind however that Igor is not a soldier: although he knows how to kill, doing so could have repercussions on his psyche, a fundamental element to keep in mind. an eye together with health. Having a plan of action and companions means, by extension, also having an operational base from which to direct operations. This is essentially the Chernobylite hub, to which we return after each mission, and which from a simple disused warehouse is transformed into a real refuge where not only us, but also our companions feel they belong: we take care of them so much what about Igor is essential to avoid animosity but, above all, that they leave the group in case they find themselves in too much disagreement with us. We have to admit that we haven't ruined relationships to such an extent, but precisely because you are free to make the decisions you want, there is the possibility that something will go wrong. Improving the base is among the most engaging elements of the game, as it is closely linked to the collection of resources, which in turn can however be obtained more effectively by building machinery suitable for the creation of useful objects in the field. In short, one influences the other, and finding the right balance, especially in terms of priorities, is a big part of the fun. The sense of progression is perceived, to the point that towards the end it feels strong enough to use less caution than we would have used at the beginning: we would have preferred the game to keep us more tense, but overall it makes sense that, the closer we get to our main goal, Igor will get stronger. On the other hand, it is equally true that if we don't take some risks at the beginning, exploring more than we should or putting ourselves in dangerous situations but in the face of a big reward, progression is slow and difficult, also having to think about the well-being of our companions. Chernobylite, our almost complete team As you may have understood, Chernobylite is notan open world RPG to which we are all too accustomed by now, but an experience sipped in more or less short missions within the Zone of Alienation. The areas are discovered as you progress with the main plot but, in the long run, they end up being always the same in a repetitive circle where little changes: each map has with it, in addition to the mission objective, also some events random ones that can earn us experience points and additional resources, when not objects strictly related to the progression of the story. Obviously, everything we do during a mission, even if it's just discovering an area we can't access because, for example, we lack the lock picks to pick open the entrance, remains in memory and if we have to return we'll find the icon marked on the map . This means that sooner or later there will be very little to do in the area in question, beyond the obvious gathering of resources, and future main missions set there will be tackled by going from point A to point B, without getting lost anywhere else since we have already solved this before. The fact that there are markers on the map, however, does not oblige us to follow only those: by analyzing it, one can also guess where there could be potential resources based on the position or size of some buildings. The icons only serve to indicate important events, or where we are sure to find something, but the exploration and how to manage it is totally up to us. The plot proceeds through a series of main missions, to which we may want to assign companions (who can, indeed must, be employed by secondary schools) but these are delicate assignments to be handled personally; not only for the low chances of success that other characters would usually have but also to personally check the area and make sure we find any clues that might be useful to us. Having to follow the needs of the plan to the letter, we will be called upon to find specific clues that will help us in our investigations without however having an idea of where they are and how many: following the icons of the events it is probable that we will run into one of these, therefore often the completion of a map is needed so you don't have to go back to it later. Although free, exploration cannot exactly be conducted with our times: since Igor is a physicist who is looking for uncomfortable answers, the government has put a Stalker on his trail and apparently not one of the mutual. The more time we spend inside a mission, the more probable its appearance will become and we will be able to understand it from the slow manifestation of an anomalous storm: it is our countdown without numbers, when we see the sky darken and flashes and thunder take over, the best solution would be to return to base via wormholes, which we can activate at any time. However, if the Stalker should manifest itself, the only choice will be to try to escape or fight it. The art of survival Chernobylite, base management is essential to our survival As for the fights, or more generally the dangers to face, we can choose three ways: stealth, face-to-face or traps - even mixing them together, with the necessary restrictions. For example, it is not possible to build anything during a fight, so we have to rely only on ourselves and our equipment. Chernobylite is versatile enough to make any approach possible, each with its associated risks. We went for the stealth option most of the time, alternating it with direct combat when we felt safe enough and rarely using traps, often more as a diversion than offensively. Needless to say, resources are needed to build and this must be kept absolutely in mind: not only traps, we are also able to assemble makeshift objects such as ointments and decoctions for health, radiation and the psyche. We must be prepared for anything, because danger is always lurking and often takes the form of nightmarish creatures. We haven't talked about it so far but the horror is very present in Chernobylite, not only in terms of hallucinations and scares, but of real enemies, more sneaky than humans since they are able to create portals and move through them, reappearing even under our feet. Generally more resistant than government soldiers, they also have better perception and must only be faced with the certainty of not letting them get close, because their influence on our psyche will be heavier, not to mention that they can poison us with radiation. Fortunately, it is also easy to notice their presence both for the change of music and because whenor they move very heavily: by listening, our only ally for a long time in the game, we can guess where they are and act accordingly. Adapt, fight, survive. These are the three key elements of Chernobylite, which however adds an interesting variable to the equation: death. Dying is part of the circle of life, it is normal and in this game it is an integral part of the experience since in being reborn it will be possible to modify the lived timeline to correct any errors - moreover in a narrative universe that speaks of wormholes, singularities and multiple universes, what do you want to retouch history and be reborn in another line? The power of the titular Chernobylite is immense and can also be exploited in this way: it is not exactly an incentive to die, also because the past can only be changed if you have enough material, but rather to take it into consideration if our choices lead to undesirable outcomes. Knowing what a decision has led us to, it is possible to take the leap in the dark and try the other way, bearing in mind that it could be better but also worse. A very particular mechanic, which although it allows you to cheat is not without consequences: with each death we will lose a considerable quantity of objects, randomly chosen from the game, therefore if we want to die it is better to do it with a certain knowledge otherwise it risks turning out to be only a very useless waste of resources. Repetitiveness Chernobylite, the Shadows are not creatures to be taken lightly Overall, Chernobylite is a balanced and pleasant experience, which however falls a bit into redundancy both due to the few maps present and the need to collect certain elements and therefore return to the same place over and over again. Once strengthened enough, although government soldiers, for example, are strengthened in terms of units and equipment, the sense of challenge and survival becomes more tepid, often leaving us to go from point A to point B without particular effort. We have no doubts that played on higher difficulties it could prove to be a challenge, especially as regards the management of the base and the companions, but the basic repetitiveness would still be perceived. The combat left us with mixed feelings: the artificial intelligence is discreet, easily circumvented or predictable in many cases, and the recoil of the weapons is average. Indicators of sorts, from our health to that of enemies to alertness, can be managed in the settings, so if you want a more challenging and immersive experience, you can easily build it. Graphically we were struck by the reconstruction of the Zone of Alienation, which returns the perfect, disturbing feeling of desolation and danger that grips the area; the models of the enemies, be they soldiers or creatures of any kind, are a little less impactful. Where Chernobylite really shines a lot is in the atmosphere, which owes everything to its soundtrack: we know that, especially in a horror game or in general aimed at conveying tension, the music has a large part of the weight on their shoulders and in this case that's all professionally managed. A seamless change of pace accompanies us in exploration, giving more or less emphasis to a situation and helping us to understand when we really need to start worrying. Absolutely excellent work in this sense and, more generally, in the sound design which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish between reality and hallucination. Chernobylite, the reconstruction of the Area of Alienation is really successful Technically, the game runs very smooth at 60fps but you're free to play with the settings however you like and run a benchmark to check that everything is working properly. From this point of view, you can test your computer in different ways and the possibilities offered by the developers are excellent. If you're a fan of simple RPGs (the progression system isn't demanding anyway) but above all of survival experience with a pinch of horror, there's no reason why you shouldn't throw yourself into Chernobylite.", "date": "2021-07-28", "grade": "8.0"}
