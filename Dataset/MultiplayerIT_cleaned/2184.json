{"name": "Operation Flashpoint: Red Hammer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/operation-flashpoint-red-hammer.html", "text": "Introduction It's 8:10, it's already half an hour since we lost contact with the cargo that was supposed to precede us. My group trembles to carry out the mission, perhaps they have not yet seen enough blood on their uniforms .. We leave .. the time to climb the Ural and we are already in the hell of an aerial bombardment. I reassure my comrades, but I already know that if we manage to get near the enemy installation it will be a miracle. The bombardment continues, we pass alongside the URAL of the group that preceded us. I just hope my men don't see it, their friends were in that freighter too. We continue for a couple of kilometres, where I park the vehicle under some trees, hoping to find it intact on our return. The men get out and I start planning what to do with them. They strengthen each other, trying not to show that deep down we are all afraid. The mission is very tough and for a couple of them it's their first real war experience. Sergei Chernovol, Vladimir Speseniev and Dimitri Drygin will be in their early twenties. They have their whole life ahead of them and just the thought that someone can't make it makes me be even more careful in planning the mission. A really cold war! Ahead of us, about two kilometers away, is the first Vulcan to be destroyed. No enemies in sight, I suggest we rush towards a group of bushes halfway between us and the Vulcan. I give the go and we start running towards the bushes. It will be the silence after the sound of the bombings, it will be that no enemies are seen, it will be that I have been running on a beach for a long time, but I feel good, I feel strong, invincible. We arrive. We stop and stand on the sand. I take out my binoculars and look at the horizon. Still no enemies. Strange. We decide to advance slowly staying covered to try to take the enemy by surprise. After a few meters I begin to hear the sound of bullets hitting the sand. I panic, I don't understand where the shots are coming from. I hear screams of pain from behind me. I barely have time to turn around and see the wounded Vladimir calling for help, when my companions signal the presence of a Mark II approaching from the right. A really cold war! Maksim Bychovskay has already loaded the LAW and we see the boat hit by his missile blow up. Bullets keep flying from both sides. We eliminate a couple of Americans and advance, unhurriedly and with great care. Leaving behind the now lifeless body of Vladimir. During the mission there is no time to stop and mourn the death. The accounts are only done at the end, now it's much more important to get out of here alive. I reload my ak74 and keep swiping. Now only instinct moves me, adrenaline flows inside me and I realize I'm shaking. I keep going. The situation seems calm, but I'm sure that the enemies, hearing the shots, have taken up positions and are waiting for us. Maybe we'd better leave, but I don't want my partner's life to be in vain. Go on. A few more meters. Three more Americans.. I aim, I shoot.. I reload my ak again. We are now near the Vulcan. We come to a group of tents, with supports inside. I take this opportunity to take a LAW and some ammunition. With the cover of my companions I crawl for a few meters and a Vulcan appears on the horizon. I take the LAW and shoot.. the movement of the air created by the explosion gives me a blow, as if a ghost had punched me in the stomach.. I reload the weapon and aim at a second Vulcan on the right. This time I'm further away and I don't feel the shock wave. Ready to strike! The mission is halfway through and I would like to return to base. I take a breath, while the other comrades reload their weapons. I study the map and decide that the next move will be by means of an American truck (this should avoid enemy bombing and go unnoticed). We go up. We retrace much of the road on which we crawled and arrive up to a hill. According to my map behind this rise there should be two more Vulcans (defended by an American installation). We get off the Truck and, hidden, we look at the situation on the other side of the hill. The situation is really critical. There are at least thirty Americans, two Vulcans (one of which is partially hidden by a house) and at least 200 meters completely uncovered (we certainly cannot advance in these conditionsthe). Ready to strike! So here's the plan: destroy the two Vulcans from afar, hoping to cause enough damage to be able to escape undisturbed. I lean out again, shouldering my Law. I take aim and shoot. The missile hovers in the air towards the target, causing it to explode. The enemy soldiers around the volcano lie in a bloodbath, while I reload the law. I aim for the other vulcan, but the accuracy of the first shot is not replicated. The time to notice the missed target and I hear the enemy bullets whistling towards me. The plan sadly failed and now we will have to prepare to defend ourselves against a really massive American attack. I order the men to line up in a defensive position, leaning over the promontory, in order to stop the enemy advance. I line up more laterally to the right to cover a possible area of enemy advance. The situation continues to worsen: the Americans, after understanding where we attacked from, arranged themselves in such a way as to be covered and difficult targets. Beyond that a patrol group is approaching from the left. I hit a couple of enemies but hear some of my guys screaming in pain. After a few minutes, I suddenly hear total silence again. My teammates are not answering the call. The enemies on the horizon are all dead and I'm out of ammo for my rifle. More and more difficult... About ten meters down there is an enemy soldier. I approach to take his rifle, so that I can defend myself in the advance towards the last volcano to be destroyed. A couple of meters from the American, I hear a loud sound that comes from far away. From my right leg starts bleeding. I didn't even feel the bullet go in, but now the muscles in my leg are contracted in pain and I can't stand. I fall behind the body of the enemy (and perhaps this was my salvation). Now I'm close enough to him to hold his rifle. Reload. And I'm trying to figure out where the sniper who just shot me might be. I see it about a hundred meters to the north, hidden (not too well) behind a bush. I aim and start shooting. The sniper makes his second big mistake (the first was missing me and hitting me ~only~ in the leg): he gets up and tries to run away. At this point the target is much easier and with a precise burst I neutralize it. I crawl for about ten minutes, until I get in sight of the volcano. From some nearby crates I take three radio-controlled explosives which I place with some care near the armored vehicle. I move away to a safe distance and detonate the explosives. The volcano literally flies into the sky and then crashes several meters ahead. By radio I signal to the command that the vulcans have been destroyed and that therefore the schukas can take off to bomb the target. What is this Red Hammer? Take this tale and multiply it by 20. That's what Red Hammer is. It's a mission pack that contains a new campaign (made up of 20 missions) that will make you relive the guerrilla warfare of Operation Flashpoint on the side of the Russians. You will play as Dmitri Lurkin, a former Spetsnaz agent. But Red Hammer is not only this: in the Gold Upgrade version (which requires the Operation Flashpoint cd to be played) you will find an updated version of the game engine (red hammer includes patch 1.30) (the biggest improvements concern the online game ), you will find new vehicles, new weapons and about twenty missions created for the multiplayer game. Everything a fan of the original game could want from a mission pack. The sad notes In reality there are no big flaws in this Soviet campaign (I point out that the price is really very interesting when compared to the number of hours of game it offers you). The only report I want to make concerns the difficulty of the missions. In addition to being very long (and this is certainly a great advantage), the missions are on average more demanding than the ones you played in Operation Flashpoint. This is also understandable if we take into account that RH's target audience is made up of fans who loved the original game (and I know there are many of you). Often you will find yourself having to face a considerable number of enemies alone or you will have to carry out tasks that will require several attempts (save and load) (but this will give more incentives to advance in the campaign). I go back to play: the gwar is not over yet and Russia trusts in me. Introduction This war has been bloody poorly planned. We are being pushed into the enemy too fast. The Americans have had time to settle down and get to know these areas. Our attacks are slowly being stopped and even today is a bad day: in an attempt to sabotage enemy Vulcans, one of our squad was completely destroyed. It's up to me to avenge the killed comrades and destroy the two American anti-aircraft stationed along the coast. I know perfectly well that it is a suicide mission, but I prefer not to think about it; I'm still too shaken up by the death of my best friends. I am one among many, but even today my life is at stake and this scares me.", "date": "2002-03-26", "grade": null}
