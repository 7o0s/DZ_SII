Interesting because it has seen a name that has always been associated with ultra-violent and over the top shooters like that of Adrian Chmielarz, known for Painkiller and Bulletstorm, successfully venture into territories practically at the antipodes. Interesting for the technical-artistic method, which has turned the Unreal Engine 3.0 like a sock, molding it around the creative needs of the team founded by the ex-boss of People Can Fly, transfiguring the Epic Games engine to the point of making it practically unrecognizable, also thanks to the adoption of an innovative technique for the videogame field such as photogrammetry. And interesting, last but not least, also for its substance, with an approach in terms of playability and storytelling that has allowed The Astronauts' first work to have its say in an increasingly crowded, difficult and at risk of homologation panorama such as that of ~ titles where to walk~, managing to keep faith with the declaration of intent expressed in the short preface that welcomes us at the beginning of the adventure (~This game is a narrative experience that does not lead you by the hand~). One can therefore only welcome the landing of a similar production on PlayStation 4, especially following a transposition work also characterized by some interesting implications. The review of the PlayStation 4 version of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Playstation 4 trophies The Astronauts has prepared 14 Trophies. Most of them are related to puzzle solving, but to avoid dangerous anticipations about the plot and the very nature of the challenges to be faced, which is an integral part of the game's charm, it was wisely decided to keep them secret. One rather difficult to obtain, linked to a couple of rather eccentric easter eggs, and another really easy one, which requires you to do something very obvious, as long as you bring it to mind... At full lungs We had already talked about it extensively on the occasion of a quick field test that took place a few months ago, when we were also given the opportunity to chat with Chmielarz himself: the conversion of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is the result of a procedure that is anything but trivial , which forced his studio to redo a large amount of work from scratch, switching to Unreal Engine 4. It sounds strange to us to be the first to repeat it, especially a few weeks after the show offered by Batman: Arkham Knight and the arrival of Battleborn in a few months, which will run on the same technological foundations as Borderlands, but according to the Polish creative, the Sony console is not supported by Unreal Engine 3. And if you don't believe the first-hand testimonies we have collected, even in the unequivocalness of an audio recording, try clicking on this link, where the thing was reiterated shortly after also by another member of The Astronauts. Whatever the technical and design reality, in any case, basically it doesn't matter to us, what is our interest and competence to judge is the goodness of the result. And Adrian and company have managed to bring the bewitching Red Creek Valley, one of the most immersive and believable naturalistic (and not only) landscapes in which it is possible to venture into a video game, in a substantially integral way on the PlayStation 4 hardware. protagonist of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in fact returns in all its luxuriant abundance and variety of vegetation, its harmonic and probable territorial construction and its richness and diversity of details, without the slightest hint of clipping or pop-in, nor geometries, nor of shadows, coatings or anything else. A trick that many other multiplatform developers resort to when they have to take and package their work to fit it inside a console. Commendable, especially when in the face of direct comparisons with the PC version it is found that not even a tuft of grass seems to be missing, that the level of definition (often commendable) of the many textures recreated thanks to the photogrammetry and that the visual distance appears almost the same, allowing you to enjoy views which, thanks to painstaking polygonal modeling, appear all the more plausible in their irregularity, concreteness and imperfect coherence. Not only that: on some occasions bloom and godray are used in a more persuasive and scenographic way. But the compromises are not lacking and they have remained unchanged even after a very first patch of 4.8 GB, which we hoped would bring some refinements in this sense. The first concerns the cleaning of the image, entrusted to an anti-aliasing algorithm (probably that of Unreal Engine 4.8)decidedly less effective than the original MSAA in fighting the ladders and which returns a less harmonious glance, especially on medium and long distances. Always when the gaze tends to fall into the distance it is possible to note that the reflections on the water have undergone an evident degradation, resulting decidedly less defined than the practically mirrored ones appreciable on PC, while on the shore a similar simplification of the ripples can be seen. And to partially dirty the landscape contemplation there is also the fluidity, which generally oscillates between 30 and 60 frames per second, with often evident fluctuations, which even lead to actual stuttering. Finally, a little more subtle and specific but still perceptible are the cuts made to the movement of the vegetation, which is barely hinted at on some fronds, giving the impression of being in a slightly less vivid and organic environment. However, the audiovisual profile of the game on PlayStation 4 remains valuable, mind you, and it is probably difficult to ask for more from a small independent team at its first test on console hardware, with a new engine and a title that originally had its own some performance issues. Except perhaps a selector to lock the frame rate at 30 frames and potentially enjoy more stable and smooth performance. On the other hand, the commitment of Chmielarz and his companions is evident in other aspects, no less important, such as the revision of the save system, which on PC could force you to redo long sections of the game, while here it includes some very welcome ~invisible checkpoints~ which make it more comfortable to get lost freely in Red Creek. And then the shrewdness of those who have always made first-person games and know very well where to put their hands. We are referring to the appreciable and far from obvious maintenance of a couple of options already seen on Windows systems, such as the one for adjusting the Field of View (although limited to a maximum of 95 instead of 120) and the Passivity of the Camera, through which to establish the reactivity of one's gaze. Two characteristics thanks to which to try to find an optimum that is as close as possible to your personal needs in terms of field of visual perception and movement, avoiding the emergence of the real enemy number one for any first-person title: motion sickness.", "date": "2015-07-17", "grade": "8.4"}
