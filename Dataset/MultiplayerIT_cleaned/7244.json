Is there the possibility of telling something new and unedited? The developers of WickyWare try to give their answer with Mines of Mars, a title that brings with it those elements that for some years have represented the strength of multiplatform indie production, but which in the case of mobile devices enjoy relative freshness. The protagonist of the game is a space miner who decides to accept a job on Mars, but arrives there only after a troubled journey to say the least, being the only survivor of the crew. Landed on the red planet, he is contacted by his new ~boss~, who shows him the stations available on the surface and their functions: the device for cutting precious stones, the one for consolidating minerals, the factory with which to use the ~ so determined for the creation of items and the units for the recharge of life energy, fuel for the jetpack and ammunition. To this is added an extra cabin dedicated to leisure, with a series of ~vintage~ video games that however leave the time they find. The area that interests us most, however, is placed in the center of the outdoor scenario: it is the teleportation device, which projects us into new mines as we unlock portals. Whatever the location, our goal doesn't change: we have to take up the pickaxe and dig, dig, dig in search of the treasures hidden in the rock. Mines of Mars is a great mining adventure, rich in atmosphere and strong in engaging mechanisms Red at night... The technical realization of Mines of Mars screams ~indie~ loudly, giving us a mix that contrasts ingenuity and touches of class, limits and appreciable intuitions, all accompanied by music that is not very varied but certainly capable of creating atmosphere. Certain visual solutions, see for example the ~dim light~ device (which fortunately can be expanded by collecting the elements useful for building a better lighting device), help to make the exploratory phase full of surprises, sometimes welcome (l locating a rare mineral that we need) and sometimes less. In fact, if the touch control system adopted by WickyWare proves to be effective as regards the movement, the management of the jetpack and the excavation operations (which are activated automatically by pressing against a rocky block that is placed under or next to the character), shoot with the weapon equipped via the virtual stick it proves to be an operation that leaves much to be desired. Whether or not it was a precise choice, in the ~survival horror~ style, to make encounters with the unfriendly fauna of Mars more uncertain, it is not known; in the end, however, with a little experience, this aspect of production is overlooked. What disappoints instead are the limits of the procedural nature of the game, which randomly generates the locations but without significantly changing their appearance and characteristics. This factor ends up leaving a bad taste in the mouth when, after so many efforts and various expeditions, we manage to scrape together the materials needed to build a new portal but we find ourselves dealing with a scenario that is completely similar to the previous one , only ~scrambled~ into its elements. Whether or not this could constitute an important brake on the enjoyment of the experience depends on everyone's sensitivity and the propensity to indulge in the advances of an adventure which, while not perfect, knows how to play its cards well and manages to create a certain addictive due to the simple alternation of mining and crafting.", "date": "2014-03-19", "grade": "8.0"}
