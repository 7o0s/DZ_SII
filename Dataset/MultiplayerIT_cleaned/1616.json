{"name": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-crime-scene-investigation.html", "text": "The virtual world of CSI. Therefore, there are no shootings or special teams to command, in this playful transposition of the television series. The graphics engine, which from the images seen on the web seems cutting edge, is none other than the classic Quicktime VR reworked to keep up with the times. So no 3D for the boys of the anti-crime investigation team, but a series of pre-rendered scenarios and 360 photos to interact with. The interaction is all within reach of the mouse and therefore will be resolved simply with the identification of the hot-spots necessary to collect the clues or to talk to the characters present. The graphics are well made and some areas are particularly detailed. The feeling of the series is recreated in a very faithful way thanks to the presence of the protagonists but also thanks to the possibility of finally becoming one of them. Given the very lightweight nature of the graphics engine, there won't be much of a problem running it on just about every machine, including older ones. The only downside is that the resolution is fixed at 800x600. The animations are well done, but sometimes it happens to notice a certain gestural repetitiveness and other times, however, the animations are slightly jerky, but only because they are composed of a low number of frames. Be one of them. The game revolves around us as a new recruit to the team. Despite our lack of experience, we will immediately be catapulted into increasingly hot and difficult cases, but luckily we will find one of the team members alongside us, ready at any time to give us valuable suggestions. The game action will move between two main poles: the headquarters and the various places where the investigations will take place. As we go forward, we will find (and it will be up to our skill to identify them) more and more clues and we will have a wide range of tools available to use to locate and collect evidence. They range from the UV lamp to highlight particular signs, otherwise normally invisible, to the cast for wounds, to Luminol to highlight traces of blood, up to the classic brush for fingerprints. Each of these items will be described well in the related information screen. The interface is very intuitive and simple, but for the less practical, the few minutes of tutorials present directly in the first case will be enough to dispel any doubts. Be one of them. The main part of the screen is occupied by the game scenario, while the lower part contains the controls for moving, exploring and interacting with the world. Like any adventure, we will have to explore starting locations in search of those clues from which to start our investigation. Sometimes they will be almost obvious, while other times we will have to think a little more. The novelty compared to other adventures, such as Myst or Riven, lies in the fact that we have a whole series of resources to study the clues, examine the evidence and, above all, find the right correlations between them, which manage to refresh a genre that could begin to show signs of tiredness. In the headquarters we will find the study of the coroner, who will always explain to us the dynamics of death and the state of the corpse, when necessary. We will also find the boss's office, from which we can obtain useful information about places and suspects, not to mention that when we have the right papers in hand, we will be able to request warrants for searches, requests for interrogations, DNA tests and, finally , including arrest warrants. But the heart of the whole game is the laboratory, where we will be able to have fun composing the evidence together, also making use of the invaluable help of Greg Sanders, the technician in charge of the equipment, and we will be able to use the powerful research database of the criminal police. A very useful tool, the database can be consulted via a computer connected to the network and will allow us to trace the criminal record of the person involved from fingerprints and more than once it will allow us to compare different data. As the investigation progresses, the Case File will automatically be compiled, in which all the information on the victims, suspects and the various reconstructions that we will be able to make as we progress in the adventure will be noted. And yes, because, as in the TV series, even in the game we will be able to witness the spectacular reconstructions of the events, based on the clues collected. We will therefore see bullets pierce vital organs, rigorously taken from inside the human body, or the reconstruction of the last minutes of the victim's life, all with the tipiche shots of the series. The evolution of cases. The game will provide us with five distinct cases (but who said there can't be a common thread?), after each of which we will be able to access the next. Upon completion of a case we will assist to our evaluation, in which the clues collected will come into play but also the help requested and based on the final result we will be rewarded with bonuses, which will mostly be images of artwork relating to the case that has just been concluded. For the more perfectionist and for score maniacs, there will always be the possibility to replay the individual cases, trying to collect as many clues as possible and get a higher score. Being able to get 100% in all cases should unlock some final super bonuses, but for now your trusty editor still hasn't succeeded. This limited semblance of replay value should actually be a small palliative to the short length of the game. Well, you will realize very soon that advancing in cases is much faster than you can hope and the risk of being at the end of the last one is very high. In short, this game is good but too short. Final verdict. What, then, of a well-packaged, intuitive, captivating and engaging game, with an intriguing plot like that of the show, but which is too short? And how stimulating will it be to be able to replay the individual cases once we have finished the game? And won't the bonuses be too few, to make us repeat the missions in search of that damned clue that always escapes us? The game is certainly fun and adventure lovers will perhaps find it a little easy, but the feeling you get is undoubtedly very intriguing and manages to recreate the impression of being one of the members of the team seen many times on TV. Furthermore, for the fanatics, the added value of being able to play with their favorites, agents Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle, Dr. Robbins, Captain Brass or the charismatic Gil Grissom, head of the CSI department, must be considered. The others, on the other hand, will simply be able to enjoy the presence of characters with a solid background and a marked behavioral characterization. Ah, I forgot an important detail: the game is spoken in English but subtitled in Italian, just a pity that the subtitles are small and scroll too quickly. Pros: fun and engaging adventure, with a pinch of elegance comfortable and fast interface a laboratory full of many tools available to examine the evidence Cons: obsolete graphics engine, even if well reworked too fast subtitles too short and not very replayable Cathodic transmutation. Those used to following the TV series of the same name will certainly find themselves more at ease with the settings and the ~cast~ of this latest Ubisoft title. In fact, making a video game from a TV series is a very rare and most often risky operation. What will this game be like? What kind? action? fps? A turn-based strategy, a la Jagged Alliance? Or a tactical shooter, a la Project IGI? This time the authors wanted to create something that went against the tide, proposing one of those genres that have become less fashionable: adventures with a strong puzzle connotation.", "date": "2003-06-20", "grade": null}
