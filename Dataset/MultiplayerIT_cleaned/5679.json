{"name": "Heavy Rain", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164337-heavy-rain-piove-sul-bagnato.html", "text": "To remember it today, the moment of the release of Heavy Rain seems almost yesterday. Yet six years have passed since in 2010 the Quantic Dream production appeared on PlayStation 3, bringing with it a huge following from critics and the public. Strengthened by the trademark guaranteed by David Cage, characterized by a narrative component placed before anything else, the adventure promised to redefine the way in which the videogame medium could be able to tell stories. He did it bluntly, arriving with a plot with strong and mature themes, at a time when the industry was seriously starting to question how far it could go in this direction. But Heavy Rain was not only this: the game was also talked about for the achievement of peaks of excellence in animation, without however being free from some technical defects to which the title dated 2010 can now remedy. Just like Beyond: Two Souls a few months ago, Heavy Rain was also subjected to a high definition make-up treatment: let's find out the result together! The unstoppable series of remasters brings Heavy Rain to PlayStation 4: ready to hunt down the killer? Playstation 4 trophies To avoid any unwelcome story surprises in Heavy Rain, most of the trophies in this game are secret. In total there are 57: to collect them all you will necessarily have to complete the adventure more than once, since most of them are linked to the various paths that the story can travel. To get to Platinum, for example, it will be necessary to attend all the endings proposed by the game, thus reviewing the choices made previously: by facing Heavy Rain only once, it will be difficult to exceed 50% of trophies collected. The origami killer In terms of story and gameplay, Heavy Rain of 2016 remains completely the same as that of 2010, scrupulously put under the magnifying glass at the time in the review written by Pierpaolo Greco. Most of the considerations made then are therefore also valid today, but since there are six years in between we still remember in broad terms what this adventure tells us, built on the threat of a serial killer who kidnaps and kills children. Even if in fact the protagonists are more than just one, the figure in which the player finds himself empathizing is Ethan Mars, father of the seventh child kidnapped by the Origami Killer, so named for the objects he leaves on his victims. With a previous family tragedy behind him, Ethan will push himself to do everything to try to save little Shaun, alternating in the story with Scott, a private investigator hired by the families of the victims; Norman, an FBI agent called to officially investigate the series of crimes; and finally Madison, a journalist involved in the affair by coincidence. Without going further for reasons of space, we limit ourselves to stating that the story with adult tones appreciated at the time is fully enjoyable even after all these years, thanks to a coherent and well-interwoven story, built on the same atmospheres as some of the masterpieces of the genre cinematic thriller seen in the last twenty years. If movies like Saw and Se7en have remained in your heart, you're in the right place. The considerations made in 2010 also apply to the gameplay: compared to Beyond: Two Souls, there is a combination of movement of the analog stick plus the R2 key, never completely satisfactory also due to the woodiness shown by the characters in some phases. After getting a little carried away, this system still proves to be an excellent ploy to increase involvement in the desperate race against time proposed by Heavy Rain. Before moving on, we certainly cannot forget the ~quick time events~, a game dynamic to which this title makes extensive use. Despite the numerous uses (and abuses) of this mechanic made in the meantime, Heavy Rain's QTEs appear to have aged quite well, indeed they are more interesting than what has been seen even in recent titles. The merit belongs primarily to the choice to avoid the ~trial and error~: there is no game over and in the event of an incorrect sequence, one goes on anyway, accessing different elements of the plot. Secondly, the representation of the various situations in which we are called in the QTE sequences is still appreciable, dictated by the emotional state of the character through different graphic elements. New lights and old shadows If Heavy Rain's plot and gameplay do not change on PlayStation 4, the same obviously cannot be said of its graphics sector. Although it originally looked good on PlayStation 3, the visual aspect was at the heart of the work carried out by Quantic Dream, to adaptand the game engine of Heavy Rain to the generation leap. The list of changes made therefore opens with the obligatory step of moving from 720p to 1080p resolution, a standard for remasters of old generation titles. The number of frames per second instead remains equal to 30, allowing the images to maintain the cinematic cut pursued by David Cage. On the other hand, the drop in frame rate that occurs on some occasions, as also recorded at the time on PlayStation 3, leaves us somewhat perplexed. For the rest, particular attention was paid to the lighting of scenes and objects, made more realistic thanks to the enhancement of shadow rendering technology and support for HDAO ambient occlusion technology linked to the PlayStation 4 GPU. In terms of post-processing, we also note the addition of antialiasing. Beyond the technicalities, the final result appears appreciable especially on Ethan and the other main characters, improving the general visual performance in closed and dimly lit environments. On the other hand, fluctuating results are recorded on the more marginal elements: also in this case it is a legacy from the PlayStation 3 version, where the models of the four protagonists appeared much more refined than the others. For the sound, however, the same applies as six years ago: the audio component of Heavy Rain can in fact count on an excellent soundtrack, the icing on the cake of an extraordinary adventure which in the Italian version is enriched by the voice of Pino Insegno for Ethan . Heavy Rain & Beyond: Two Souls Collection The arrival of Heavy Rain on PlayStation 4 coincides with a Collection sold at a total price of 39.99 euros, within which we also find the remastered version of Beyond: Two Souls. Anyone who has already bought the latter will be entitled to a discount on the purchase of Heavy Rain in the single version, for which the details are missing at the time of writing in case you do not have Beyond: Due Anime per PlayStation 4. As for the adventure with Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe, we refer you to our review written in November by Mattia Comba, on the occasion of his arrival on the latest Sony console: although some defects have become more important over time , Beyond: Due Anime remains a title with a high production level, enriched by the presence of two famous actors and also worth playing if you love the adventures of Quantic Dream.", "date": "2016-03-01", "grade": "9.4"}
