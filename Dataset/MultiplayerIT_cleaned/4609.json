That evaluation, in reality, came from afar: Yuke's production has had a lot of time available to evolve, both in terms of gameplay and structure, and in the face of yet another episode with few changes and the same defects as always could only take note of the situation. We therefore welcomed the release of WWE 2K18 with great curiosity, hoping for a rethink by the developers regarding the presence of the showcase, the single player mode that until 2016 characterized each new edition of the franchise, giving it a precise connotation in narrative terms. Last time we wanted to try a story mode based on the multifaceted and controversial career of Brock Lesnar, the cover athlete, and in the same way it would have been appreciable this year to be able to relive Seth Rollins' debut from the days of NXT to the birth of the Shield, passing through the most important and intense phases of the ~kingslayer~ career; but no, once again the game is divided between simple performances, a long career in which we control a character created from scratch and the inevitable Universe mode. More and more beautiful, but... Let's start with the positive aspects: it has been a long and tortuous journey, in which the transition from the previous generation to the current generation of consoles has weighed heavily (and probably continues to do so in some situations: we'll get there shortly), but at present the roster of WWE 2K18 is not only the richest ever at launch, but also the one with the most refined polygonal models and resembling the real counterparts. There has not yet been the expected qualitative leap in terms of female wrestlers, it is true, but we have never seen such constant and transversal care in the creation of superstars, whether they are the most famous personalities or simple midcarders . John Cena and Randy Orton have been visually excellent for some editions now, but even a Dean Ambrose, who may not be convincing at first glance, at a certain point brings out the typical animations of the wrestler and thus smooths out any ~aesthetic~ lack. The shoulder joints have long since been fixed and the quality of the movements is further refined, although still missing interlude frame sequences capable of providing more realistic and prompt reactions during interruptions, as EA Canada did with the latest FIFA. The aiming system is the same as WWE 2K17 and works very well, eliminating a historical problem in the series, just as there are the ~leaks~ with which to temporarily escape your opponent's offensive, quickly slipping out of the ring to catch your breath. It is possible to lift the enemy and carry him around to carry out unprecedented interactions with the ring or the scenario, for example in backstage brawls, and there are always many maneuvers available, to be performed via combinations of keys and directions of the left and right analog stick. Unfortunately, the counter system based on the instantaneous pressure of the triggers still does not convince us, and inserting a second call in WWE 2K17 was not enough to break down the perplexities surrounding this solution. Fortunately, an alternative mode has been included to the horrible stick rotation for submission holds, but the woodiness that characterizes the gameplay is still present, together with often frustrating episodes, in which one remains glued to the ground for several seconds, seemingly unable to to get up, even during the early stages of the match, when the athletes should be fresh and perky. In short, Yuke's interpretation still seems too static, cumbersome, concentrated on simulation aspects that can arouse interest for one or two editions, but which in the long run show all their limits where the goal of the game is to entertain. We do not doubt it was the absolute lack of alternative productions that determined this situation which has been going on for years now, made up of stale and very little exciting mechanics, especially for those who do not have a huge passion for WWE branded shows; the fact is that a general rethinking should be addressed, perhaps before a clear drop in sales makes this process no longer extendable and perhaps hasty. Playstation 4 trophies WWE 2K18's fifty-two Trophies are almost entirely tied to completing specific actions: first win with a given character, winning a title in Universe mode, achieving career goals, and success in Road to Glory mode. Rich dish From the WWE 2K18 home screen it isI allow you to try your hand at the single exhibition, which includes a lot of different types: the Inferno Match is still missing, but apart from that there is really everything, whether it is one-on-one, two-on-two, triple threat, fatal 4-way, three-on-three, four-on-four, handicap matches, Royal Rumble and tournaments. The stipulations are also almost infinite: ranging from the normal meeting to the Falls Count Anywhere, from the Backstage Brawl to Extreme Rules, passing through Ladder, Table, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Steel Cage, Iron Man, Last Man Standing, No Holds Barred , Submission and with customized rules. As for the Royal Rumble, it is once again possible to select the number of participants among ten, twenty or thirty wrestlers. Also from the main screen you can access the career mode, which will see us control a rookie rookie who starts from the Orlando Performance Center and then moves on to the NXT shows and from there build a career towards the main roster, pay-per-view view and, of course, WrestleMania. The early stages are very interesting, thanks to an editor that has never been so complete, which allows you to shape your character down to the smallest detail and even select the fighting style from a series of options (thumper, technical, brawler, powerful, mighty, giant style , great jumper or exhibitionist), each characterized by different abilities. It is therefore possible to adjust the attributes, skills, techniques and set of moves, accessing very complete and detailed menus in which to determine how our wrestler enters the ring, how he throws punches, what type of moves he performs, what is the its finisher, and so on. The extraordinary completeness of this part of the experience unfortunately clashes with the incredible slowness and cumbersomeness of the early stages of the career, in which one speaks with some characters (only with textual dialogues, which is quite ugly to see given the exaggerated mimicry of polygonal models) and promptly goes to the parking lot to go home at the end of the day, moving with frustratingly slowness inside the locker room. It is precisely at this juncture that some technical limits of the franchise are evident, especially compared to the more famous productions: if in fact there are several open worlds on the market that load huge scenarios in a few seconds, apparently WWE 2K18 is not able to represent a sequence of a few minutes, with two or three characters and a dull location, very small in size, without resorting to a new, exhausting loading every time. The waiting times literally kill the rhythm of the experience, highlighting blatant shortcomings also on the management front, which forces you to carry out the usual operations again and again, making it really complicated to arm yourself with the patience necessary to overcome the NXT phase and project yourself towards the main roster and any satisfactions that will come. The same protagonist character of the career is used in the new Road to Glory mode, a real online championship that uses multiplayer matches to earn us the points necessary to participate in the various pay-per-views, which can also be purchased using microtransactions. The problem in this case lies in relying on a sector, precisely the online multiplayer, which also in this edition damn suffers from the slightest presence of lag, making it almost impossible to execute the counters efficiently and ending up suffering the pin a mid-match because the system does not perceive the input for the pin exit quick time event at the right time. The most solid and consistent part of the package therefore remains the Universe mode, which faithfully reproduces the WWE television shows and allows us to shape them as we wish, using the current roster or the classic ones, creating champions, storylines and rivalries (the latter regulated unprecedented level of intensity), as well as using the new Power Ranking system and specific goals for each superstar. As per tradition, it is possible to play the matches directly, selecting one of the engaged wrestlers, or simply simulate them and move on, thus adopting a managerial approach. Finally, a note on the sound sector: the decision to change the commentators is fine, but the commentary by Michael Cole, Corey Graves and Byron Saxtor is too essential, with long silences. The ~shouts~ of the wrestlers are frankly embarrassing, while the signed soundtrack has all the limits of a jukebox, unable to effectively accompany the various stages of their careers.", "date": "2017-10-17", "grade": "7.0"}
