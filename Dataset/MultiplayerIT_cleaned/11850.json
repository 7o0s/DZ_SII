{"name": "Burnout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout_a.html", "text": "As far as racing games are concerned, on the screens of our mobile phones we have seen an evolution similar to that which the genre has experienced in the last twenty years. Only that it happened in a very short time, in line with the gradual increase in the average technical capabilities of telephones. We have reached the point where it is possible to use quite convincing polygonal graphics on high-end devices, and this automatically translates into the development of titles that exploit this possibility in their favor. This is the case of Burnout, a title in which the spectacular action comes first and that Electronic Arts has decided to redesign for wireless gaming. The start screen of the game allows us to try our hand at a fast run or access the World Tour. The latter is made up of a total of eighteen races distributed within three different locations (Angel Valley, Silver Lake and Eternal City), races in which we will find ourselves facing a single opponent with very special rules. The concept of ~arriving first~, in fact, in this version of Burnout counts for nothing: the three-quarter view from above and the automatic acceleration do not allow us to detach our antagonist, but only to move the car on a straight as it flows. So what needs to be done to win? It's simple, you have to complete the objectives set in each race, or total a certain number of collisions with civilian cars, demolish the opponent a certain number of times in different ways, stay inside a ~hot spot~ longer than ours antagonist and so on. In practice, these applications immediately reveal themselves to be characterized by a frenetic and engaging action, which leaves little room for strategies in favor of pure and continuous confrontation. With each successful impact we will see a bar rise at the bottom of the screen: when it is full, we can press the FIRE button (or the 5 key on the numeric pad) and we will see our car leap forward, which is particularly useful when we need an extra push to crash the opponent's vehicle. As you progress and unlock the events, new racing cars that are different from each other become available (there are three in all) and we must not overlook the presence of numerous upgrades to collect on the track, which have the power to repair our damage but even to make us invulnerable for a few seconds. The technical realization of Burnout deserves two distinct and separate speeches. In fact, the game is available in a 2D and a 3D version, to be chosen according to the characteristics of your mobile phone. In its two-dimensional version, the EA title shows us a top view and an excellent scrolling of the track, dotted with a good number of elements. Since with this type of shot it is impossible to see the approach of obstacles or vehicles, the developers have thought of placing ~warnings~ that appear in the area of the track that will soon be occupied. The polygonal version certainly offers more entertainment, with good models and an environment rich enough in detail, which flows quickly. Of course the effects are also better and the result is convincing. As far as the sound is concerned, in both cases it is characterized by good quality but does not shine in quantity. The control system responds quickly to inputs and allows us to move the car quickly and easily, with a little more precision in the 2D version. Also in the case of Burnout, as usual, the quality of your mobile's joystick can transform the gaming experience from fun to cumbersome, so this factor must also be taken into due consideration.
