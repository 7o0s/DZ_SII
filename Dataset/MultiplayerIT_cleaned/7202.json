More than ten years have passed since the release of the last episode, hence oblivion. Luckily this seems to be a good time to bring back genres that had been left for dead, at least on PC, so here we are talking about a new turn-based strategy mixed with RPG that is apparently doing very well on Steam , given that it has been in the top positions of the best-selling titles for days. An excellent result for Triumph, after the closure of the Overlord series. Heroes are born, and she was born. Once launched, Age of Wonders III allows you to choose between different game options. If you wish, you can tackle one of the two long campaigns, made up of eight maps each, or a single scenario, made up of a single map, or you can still rely on chance and generate a random map by choosing the general elements (difficulty, size, type terrain and style of play). There is also a multiplayer mode, which allows you to measure yourself against other players scattered across the rest of the planet. Obviously the core of the experience, at least for the first, long hours, is represented by the campaigns. We talk about ~long hours~ because they really last a long time. Just think that it took us about eighty hours to finish them both, playing on the third difficulty level out of five available. Obviously, since it is a strategic game, the eighty hours are a very low estimate, given that Age of Wonders III is easily replayable at the highest difficulty levels and that we have not counted the other available options, such as the scenarios. In short, if you are looking for a long-lived title, Age of Wonders III will not disappoint you. A series of strategic games that has been standing still for more than ten years is back: let's find out if it was worth resurrecting. Strategy and Tactics The gameplay of Age of Wonders III is similar to that of the previous chapters. It is divided into two phases: a strategic one in which you move your troops on a global map, managing your cities and available resources (such as spells), and a tactical one, in which you lead your troops on the battlefield. The tactical part can theoretically be skipped, having the CPU manage the fights, but it soon turns out that this is a harmful and often counterproductive choice, especially when the forces on the field are balanced. In the long run, the tendency is to face the most demanding battles directly and leave those against the waste troops, i.e. those with a foregone conclusion, to automatic combat. The most powerful troops must be faced with equally powerful troops The strategic part, on the other hand, must be managed entirely directly. Maps usually start with a handful of troops available, with which you need to find the scattered resources (money, mana or special items for the heroes) and achieve the first objectives, which will lead to having the first cities to manage. Cities can be obtain in different ways: conquering them, building them, through diplomacy, through solving missions or by paying the requested sums. Each city belongs to a certain race, to which the troops produced are related. There are goblins, humans, orcs, dwarves and so on. There is no shortage of unique races such as that of the fairies, which give access to special units such as unicorns and which have a different infrastructural development compared to the others. In general, however, cities grow linearly, both in appearance and management. By entering one of these you can choose whether to train troops, build infrastructure (necessary for the economy and to have the best troops), or whether to raid it, destroy it or, more simply, sell some of the buildings already built. Each city produces a certain amount of mana and money, which goes into the kingdom's overall economy. Compared to the previous The Age of Wonders series consists of four chapters (including Age of Wonders III). Few people know that the first, simply called Age of Wonders, was co-developed by Triumph Studios and Epic Games. Released in 1999 by Gathering of Developers, it was a great success among strategy lovers and obtained two sequels: Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne (2002) and Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic (2003). The latter was a stand-alone expansion of the second chapter, very rich in content. Unfortunately, the turn-based strategy crisis led Triumph to abandon the series and try other ways, at least until last year, when it announced the arrival of Age of Wonders III. In the meantime there have been two collections. The first, called ~Master Collection~, was released simultaneously with Shadow Magic and included the first two chapters. The second, called ~Anthology~, was published in2006 and included the entire collection. If you are interested, the old episodes can be purchased on the major digital delivery sites such as Steam or GoG. Heroes and battles On each map there are generic enemies, usually placed in defense of some resource, and the inevitable opposing kingdoms, which represent the bulk of the problem. The main objective of each mission is the complete destruction of the opponents, with the conquest of the capitals and the killing of the heroes. Speaking of heroes, it should be noted that in each mission you will lead a main hero, to whom the search for spells and the capital are linked, and secondary heroes, who have their own spells to use in combat, but have fewer resources than the main hero . However, whatever type of heroes you have available, the important thing is that they survive: under penalty of immediate defeat (with patch 1.09 the developers fixed some flaws, fortunately, and now, for example, you are not automatically defeated if the hero is mentally manipulated). Speaking briefly of the researchable spells, we explain that there are three types: the passive ones that are always active, which influence the management of the empire, the strategic ones that must be cast and which have effects on the general map and the combat ones that must be used in the section tactics. And finally, we come to talk about the tactical part, in no uncertain terms the best thing about Age of Wonders III. This is the section in which you have to move troops in battle, trying to outclass the opposing army (or to limit the damage, doing as much as possible). Troops are deployed on the field based on their relative position on the strategic map (it is possible to attack enemies from multiple sides, obviously having multiple armies available). Then, after a brief overview of the area, it's time for the real action. There are really many factors to take into consideration on the battlefield and we certainly don't pretend to exhaust them in these few lines. The more cities grow, the more territory they can exploit. What we can tell you is that the units must be moved individually and that each has its own specific characteristics, perhaps with different skills available. For example, there are units versed in melee, others equipped with bows, some with blowguns, others still with slings, there is no shortage of magical units, or those that can do a bit of everything. The battlefield, on the other hand, will have a different morphology depending on the square on which you are fighting. In the case of a city or a fortress, there will be walls to protect the defenders, walls in which the attackers will have to create breaches, or which they will have to evade with attacks from a distance or with flying troops. In each round it will also be possible to use a spell among those available, to obtain different effects (direct attacks, increased movement speed, various power-ups and so on). In short, the fights of Age of Wonders III really offer many facets and are very well done, also thanks to the good artificial intelligence, which knows how to engage the player. In general, we are faced with a very good game overall. Too bad only for some little defects, which we will discuss in the comments.", "date": "2014-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
