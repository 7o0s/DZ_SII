Beyond the 911 GT3 RSR 2017, already announced for a forthcoming free release, we do not however exclude that in the future other Stuttgart racing cars may land on the Italian simulator; after all, the partnership between the two companies went far beyond the simple licensing agreement (it is enough to know that the official Porsche simulators are based on Assetto Corsa). At the moment the biggest ~regrets~ are the legendary 959, historical rival of the Ferrari F-40 already present on Assetto Corsa, and the Carrera GT, a very bad roadster equipped with a 600 horsepower 5.7-litre V10. We don't know if and when we will see these cars on our screens, but 2017 already promises to be crackling for the Italian simulator, with the highly anticipated announcement of the Alfa Romeo Giulia by Kunos Simulazioni. As always, the release of the new DLC was accompanied by a series of updates and code fixes (now at build 1.11), among which we point out the introduction of offline custom championships and interventions on damage, physics and tire models. Two legends and a platoon of 911s (road and racing) in the third Porsche Pack of the Italian simulator Three dream numbers Usually, when we analyze a DLC dedicated to the cars of a simulator or a sim-arcade like Forza Motorsport, we always keep the road models separate from the racing ones, however for the Porsche Pack 3 we will make an exception, since the cars race are significantly higher in number. We will dedicate this paragraph entirely to the 911s, which are present in four different variants; the road-going 911 Turbo S and 911 R and the racing 911 GT3 Cup 2017 and 911 GT3 R 2015, a mix of racing cars that smoothes out the variety of the DLC a little while absolutely not undermining its quality. Let's start with the 911 R, a limited series model (991 units) created by the racing department which bears in its DNA the same chromosomes of the homonymous, legendary 1967 ancestor. Equipped with a powerful 500 horsepower 4.0 liter naturally aspirated boxer (that of the GT3 RS ) and a rigorously manual six-speed gearbox, this Porsche does 0-100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 323 km/h. It is therefore a car with all the trimmings, which in addition to featuring an exclusive livery, i.e. white with two red stripes, is also the lightest 911 in the historic range. On Assetto Corsa it is fast, extremely balanced and reliable, offering all the positive characteristics that we have already listed for the Carrera, naturally with a pinch of spice in terms of performance. Shifting is quicker, the brakes are more effective and cornering precision is superior, also thanks to the mechanical self-locking rear differential; the additional power, however, requires more attention in gas management. From an aesthetic point of view, the car could look like a normal Carrera with a custom livery (after all, the real differences are under the bonnet), but there are small details that distinguish them such as the double tailpipes and aerodynamic elements typical of the GT3. The sound is also excellent. The second (and last) road-going Porsche in the package is the 911 Turbo S, a model that needs no introduction and the last descendant of a lineage of ~thoroughbreds~ whose trademarks are power and personality. The numbers speak for themselves: the 3.8-litre twin-turbo 6-cylinder boxer engine, 580 horsepower and 750 Nm of torque allows the 1600-kilogram Stuttgart racing car to go from 0-100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds, 0-100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds, 200 km/h in 9.9 seconds and reaching a maximum speed of 330 km/h. The polygonal model on Assetto Corsa is exceptional (the official ~Miami Blue~ color is particularly recommended), and the engine sound is also amazing, which enhances the work of the oversized turbochargers. Fun to drive, efficient, precise and very fast, the virtual 911 Turbo S fully reflects the qualities of the spectacular real model, sold at the unpopular price of 210,000 euros. From the road cars we pass to the racing 911s, included in the GT3 class. The first of the lot is the 2016 GT3 R, basically a ~customer~ version (ie for private drivers) of the official GT3 and based on the road-going GT3 RS. Of the latter it maintains the same engine, a 500 horsepower 4.0-liter 6-cylinder naturally aspirated boxer, while everything else is designed for racing performance: the longer wheelbase, aerodynamics andjump and the overall weight reduced to 1,220 kilograms make it in all respects a racing car for the track, capable of bewitching even on Assetto Corsa thanks to its superfine behaviour, especially in terms of grip (it seems anchored to the tracks). Very fast and characterized by a wonderful sound, it is very difficult for it to betray the pilot, even the not particularly experienced one. The polygonal model is perfect except for a hint of aliasing in the back; the purely racing interiors are in line with those of the other 911s, but feature two disturbing ~vents~ in the center of the dashboard. From the 2015 GT3 R let's move on to the official GT3 CUP 2017, a racing car quite similar to the one just analyzed but with some different characteristics; for example, it is more difficult to tame and has a higher tendency to oversteer. The power is slightly lower (485 horsepower against 500), while the weight is practically the same; the interiors are also similar, especially for the multifunction steering wheel and the ~Metro~-style digital display, with blue dials and a light bar of the revs that changes from aqua green to red. The CUP is also distinguished by the profusion of carbon. Beautiful and victorious Produced in different versions between 1968 and 1971, the Porsche 908 was a ~sport prototype~ class racing car shaped for endurance competitions, where it managed to win several prestigious races, above all the demanding ~1000 km of the Nurburgring~ won four times in a row. On Assetto Corsa there is the fascinating berlinetta (LH) variant weighing just 650 kilograms, equipped with a 350 horsepower engine (the first versions had less) and 320 Nm of maximum torque, which allows it to reach 320 km/h. h of maximum speed. The model, characterized by the sinuous lines typical of the time, has a futuristic silhouette with yellow windows and a curious modular spoiler with two flaps at the two apexes. The interiors are spartan as is the dashboard, which features a simple central circular indicator for the revs and two smaller ones on the sides. Even the steering wheel is minimalistic. On Assetto Corsa the polygonal model is spectacular, but what is most surprising is the behavior on the track, particularly reliable for a sports prototype of that period. Easy to push, it offers efficient brakes and a slight tendency to understeer which make the car very pleasant to drive. Powertrain sampling is good but not exhilarating. Another icon of the German company in the sports prototype class is the 917, which between the 70s and 80s, also developed in various variants, was able to conquer some historic competitions, such as the famous 24H of Le Mans. On Assetto Corsa there is precisely the version that won the French race twice, in 1970 and 1971, namely the 917K, whose name refers to the term ~kurzheck~ (short tail, in our idiom) in honor of the particular design , reworked by engineers to improve the inefficient aerodynamics of previous versions. The dragster silhouette, with its strongly ascending profile, promises sparks just by looking at it, and on Assetto Corsa it absolutely does not disappoint once you take the wheel. Driven by an engine of almost 5.0 liters and 580 horsepower, the 917K is very fast and rather easy to tame, even if the brakes, while efficient, are very sensitive and you risk blocking the tires prematurely if you don't carefully evaluate the distances . Driving pleasure is enhanced by the slight loss of grip when entering the trajectory, which is answered with corrections that are always soft and precise. The interior is spartan and the dashboard, curiously, has some indicators with handwritten characters. The polygonal model and the sound of the engine are superb, accompanied by squeaks and mechanical noises that accentuate the realism. We close our analysis with the 2016 919 Hybrid, heir to the spectacular and victorious 2015 919 Hybrid, which we were able to admire live at the event held in Vallelunga in November. The new model fits perfectly into the groove created by the previous one, further exaggerating the concept of technology and efficiency applied to a sports prototype. Capable of detaching 0-100 km/h in just 2.2 seconds, the new 919 weighing 875 kilograms and 900 horsepower reaches 300 km/h in the blink of an eye with unparalleled fluidity and elegance , placing it at the top of the LMP1 class: it is no coincidence that this model too won the 24H of Le Mans and the Porsche team is leading the WEC championship. Gorgeous to drive, see and hear.", "date": "2016-12-26", "grade": null}
