A partnership that has led to a special version of his Dungeon Fighter Online designed specifically for Xbox 360. It is a title that manages to mix the dynamics of the scrolling fighting game/hack'n slash with those of the online role-playing game. However, interest quickly left room for doubt: how can F2P mechanics be reconciled with the world of consoles? Dungeon Fighter Live: Fall Of Hendon Myre was born to give an answer to this age-old dilemma, let's see if he succeeded. Fighting or RPG? It is good to specify that there are differences with the version released for PC three years ago, first of all the classes have been cut, limiting the choice to only three types: assassin, fighter and gunslinger. The first is the classic warrior capable of wielding different types of swords, the second fights with only the aid of punches and kicks, the last presents an interesting combination of ranged weapons. Obviously each one has its own offensive style which must marry the player's tastes, even if the clearly multiplayer nature of the game suggests turning to friends to compose a heterogeneous team. The purpose has remained the same, that is to clean up a series of dungeons made up of a pre-established number of rooms, or areas, divided by portals that we can only cross after having cleared them of enemies. At the end of each dungeon, an increasingly dangerous boss awaits us, which once knocked down offers us the possibility to choose a particular prize. The game features an impressive amount of recoverable items, freely usable in villages to upgrade your character. Also in this case some difference with the original is perceptible, if in the Online version the players lived in a universe structured like an MMO, in Dungeon Fighter Live: Fall Of Hendon Myre the party is composed at the beginning of each level, while the cities have been simplified, substantially reduced to a series of static screens functional to the acquisition of the various quests and upgrades. The mechanics remain unchanged, it is always a scrolling fighting game with a two-dimensional setting, but with strong role-playing features represented not only by the aforementioned objects, but the numerous special moves that can be freely mapped on the back keys, which use a certain amount of energy magical recoverable only with special potions. As already mentioned, the character is able to level up, wear ever better equipment and upgrade their weapons. The correct use of these resources is practically necessary to progress in the game. Xbox 360 goals Dungeon Fighter Live: Fall Of Hendon Myre features a total of 20 achievements for 400 player points, which is the new standard set by Microsoft for Live Arcade titles. Half of the points require sessions to be tackled in the company of online friends, but in the meantime you can take the whim of winning 20 points for killing 100 goblins, an operation that is far from onerous considering how many times the game forces us to repeat the dungeons. 3 is a magic number Unfortunately, the problems of such a title from a Live Arcade perspective quickly come to a head. Leaving aside the cuts made with regard to villages and classes, the lack of attention paid to level design has left us dumbfounded, which is truly unthinkable today. All dungeons must be repeated three times, each based on a different level of difficulty before you can move forward, and all are subject to the acquisition of the specific quest in the cities, which can be done by talking to the characters with a golden scroll above their head. Less attentive players could overlook this not very intuitive operation, risking repeating the levels further. This system would be questionable even if enriched by a random structure, but since we find ourselves facing the same maps, with the same enemies in the same positions, it is easy to get discouraged. The situation is not at all facilitated by the technical realization, characterized by a manga-inspired style that is all in all pleasant, but lacking and approximate for everything that surrounds the three protagonists. Above all, the static nature of the monsters and the lack of animation frames are perplexing, all details that denounce low production levels. We didn't particularly like the menus either, excessively small and confusing, which we demonstratenote the lack of attention paid to the transition to the console. Among other things, there are microtransactions for important items, therefore to be paid in real money, which in some way justify the not excessive price of the base game but which are forced in this context. The music follows the same unexciting standards, proposing songs that are not particularly inspired, but which range pleasantly between symphonic and rock. In short, nothing to jump on the chair, but they let themselves be listened to.", "date": "2012-07-27", "grade": "5.0"}
