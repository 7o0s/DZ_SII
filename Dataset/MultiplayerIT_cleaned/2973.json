{"name": "Merge Dungeon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/merge-dungeon-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Merge Dungeon, the new freemium title from Nanoo Company for iOS and Android devices, presents us with a rather original mobile experience, in this case a curious mix between a dungeon crawler and a merge game, i.e. those puzzle games in which you have to quickly pair objects that are the same. How is this mechanic implemented? By dividing the screen into two parts and keeping it strictly in portrait mode: in the upper area we see the progression of our trio of characters (a warrior, a hunter and a witch), who enter dungeons full of increasingly dangerous enemies; while in the lower part we can take advantage of the mana points to recall objects, pair them and possibly assign them to equipment. Gameplay Starting from a visual style clearly inspired by that of Darkest Dungeon, Merge Dungeon can certainly count on a certain atmosphere, although the gameplay is actually very distant from that of the Red Hook Studios title. The action is in fact endless and you are involved in a progression that goes on indefinitely, until the group is defeated and at which point you have to go back a few dungeons. While in the lower part of the screen we continue to recall and pair objects, including special ones (in this case bags and stars), in the upper part our characters proceed in their expedition, automatically attacking the opponents who appear in front of them. This happens with only a minimal intervention on our part: by observing the progress of the clashes, we can activate the special moves of the warrior, the hunter and the witch, or consume potions as needed. The problem with this setting is represented by the general repetitiveness of the action, as well as precisely by the very limited mechanics: the interaction is reduced to the bone but the initial strategic element typical, for example, of autobattlers is missing. As for the merge game-style experience part, it is also quite trivial and the unlocking of new skills and upgrades goes on slowly, necessarily focusing on microtransactions. Fortunately, it is possible to escape from the routine of simple progression between dungeons and devote oneself, at least for a while, to extra challenges that include interesting boss fights and scenarios designed specifically to get us a good loot, with which we can resume the shipping. As long as you feel like it. Technical realization As mentioned, the graphic style of Merge Dungeon clearly refers to that of Darkest Dungeon, with its ~dirty~ features that undoubtedly contribute to the creation of a dark and disturbing atmosphere as we enter the dungeons and face all sorts of threat, from zombies to monsters, from wizards to wild animals. The interface is well readable, but the lower part of the screen, with its ~flying~ objects, appears a bit sad and simplistic in its execution; while the upper part, which should guarantee greater liveliness, finds it difficult to propose different scenarios: the dungeons look too similar, which unfortunately is completely normal considering their quantity and the endless setting.", "date": "2020-08-06", "grade": "6.0"}
