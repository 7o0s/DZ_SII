{"name": "Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-3-hoodlum-havoc-5.html", "text": "Intestinal problems? The plot of Rayman 3 is more of an excuse to make sense of the pilgrimage of the protagonist, but an undoubtedly original and incredibly hilarious excuse: Globox, Rayman's dumb friend, accidentally ingested a dark Lum that could have harmful effects on his body. At least, so thinks Rayman: in reality the dark Lum is Andr, the leader of the Hoodlums, corrupt, wicked lums intent on conquering the world. And now everyone is on Globox's trail: Rayman to save him and his old enemies (like Razorbeard) to exploit him, all pawns of the evil black Lum who plots treacherous plans of conquest in the shadows of his new base, Globox's gut. .. As you can guess, the plot of Rayman 3 desecrates the most canonical platformers and brings a breath of fresh air to a genre in which the more complex plot usually sees a diabolical enemy locked up in the impregnable fortress that is promptly demolished by the good on duty. And this is certainly a good premise... Let's play a game! Rayman 3 recalls the glories of the prequels, presenting the same structure, almost like the summary of the previous installments of a TV series: the player must go through a long series of typically platform levels, using the skills in his possession to overcome certain obstacles and recovering the imprisoned lums , which will grant him access to the next levels. At the beginning, Rayman has two basic abilities: he can throw his fist (remember that Rayman's limbs are ~detached~ from the body) and he can use his hair as helicopter propellers. Proceeding in the game, however, it will be possible to use new powers, some already seen, others decidedly new: for example, once you learn the ability to ~hook~ on special handholds, Rayman will be able to swing in mid-air to overcome any ravines bottomless; or, the new entry represented by the double punch, will make it possible to knock down large obstacles and land any opponents more easily, as well as another new ability, that of climbing walls, will allow us to reach impossible heights... The progression in the game related to the skills that are learned slowly is nothing new: the first Rayman already presented this play structure, but since then a lot of water has passed under the bridge... However, to compensate for the real lack of innovation, Ubisoft has well thought of inserting bonuses that allow Rayman to transform and obtain additional abilities, as well as a series of extra levels that break the linear rhythm of the platform sequences, such as for example a sort of water ski (directly from Rayman 2) or a kind of go -kart that monstrously recalls, in the graphic engine, Mario Kart and Konami Racers. In short, there is no shortage of variety, not even fun, and if you manage to overcome the first levels (actually a bit monotonous) Rayman 3 takes off dragging the player into a whirlwind of pure playful enjoyment that is not too innovative but certainly of great quality , thanks also to controls that are always precise and reactive. A little gem Technically, Rayman 3 on Gameboy Advance borders on visual brilliance. Even if at times the old Rayman has a higher general quality (especially thanks to the greater number of colors), Rayman 3 is characterized by truly exceptional touches of class. To begin with, the sprites are large and divinely animated: Rayman himself, with a more modern and ~cool~ design, moves with impressive fluidity and naturalness; no less are his enemies, crazy to the right point (sometimes reminiscent of those of the evergreen Earthworm Jim) and each characterized by very specific design and movements, especially the huge and always spectacular bosses. As far as the settings are concerned, there's no denying that one will be taken aback: the multiplicity of parallax levels, special effects such as lightning that illuminates the entire screen, little butterflies that flutter serenely on the grass, sunbeams that they filter through the branches of the forest... all characterized by a variety of colors that are not always spot on (as in the case of the ~purple~ sky of the first stages) but wide and pleasant. The bonus stages, then, make heavy use of mode7 to guarantee the sensation of three-dimensionality with fluid and precise rotations. We can complain, perhaps, of some sporadic slowdowns and the structural monotony that afflicts some levels, but these are not too serious shortcomings. From the sound point of view, however, we are faced with an excellent job: mostly the music tracks are remixesof those already heard in the previous Rayman, while the totally unreleased ones are catchy and pleasant. There are also some exclamations, squeals or digitized verses, especially from Rayman: nothing transcendental but, given the quality, this particular detail must also be mentioned. In essence, Rayman 3 is a technically well-made product, which on the Gameboy Advance does not reach the qualitative peaks of Yoshi's Island but which still makes a great impression. And this is no small thing... Comment Rayman 3 has one goal: to be, in 2003, one of the best two-dimensional platformers available on the market. And it succeeds, surpassed only by the two absolute masterpieces available for GameBoy Advance: Yoshi's Island and Super Mario World. Considering the absolute and undisputed quality of the opponents, Rayman 3 definitely proves to be up to them, but also and above all up to the expectations of its fans. The 32bit version of the third episode of the series dedicated to the nicest aubergine in the gaming world is not a simple porting of the three-dimensional brothers (Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc, we recall, is also available for GameCube and soon for PlayStation 2 and Xbox), but it is actually a kind of summa of the whole series, an episode that compresses the best experienced by players in the prequels, still today splendid experiences that are worth playing. However, this original feature of the GBA version of Rayman 3 is also its most obvious flaw, as this third chapter is all too similar in its exquisitely playful structure to what was already seen years ago in Rayman and Rayman 2: far from being a serious flaw, this similarity weighs heavily on the originality of the concept and the game itself which in the end is simply ... something already seen. In any case, all lovers of the genre should definitely get this made-in-Ubisoft effort, which really deserves to be played, also considering that, by connecting the GBA version of Rayman 3 to the GameCube one, it is possible to download unpublished levels and cute mini-games from one console to another. Thumbs up, therefore, for the return of Rayman, in the hope that the next episode will bring some more innovations. Pros Hilarious and original plot Excellent technical realization Excellent play structure ... Cons ... but not very original Some stages are a bit monotonous Difficulty sometimes not too well calibrated There are characters in the world of video games who either love each other or hate each other, with no in between. Hundreds could be counted, and among these only a few should probably be mentioned: Rayman, for example. The eggplant man, as he was nicknamed six years ago when he made his PlayStation debut, is a controversial character, some find him likeable, others just pleasant if only in appearance, there are players who hate him and others who love him , but on one thing most agree: Rayman was a great game. Not an unforgettable game, nothing new in some ways, a platform like many others; but endowed with a truly incredible technical quality and variety, and with a really well done game and progression system. Rayman 2, if desired, was even better: let's talk about just under two years ago, let's talk about the leap to three dimensions of the man-ray and a small masterpiece of the kind (especially in the Dreamcast version). And now, how will Rayman on the GBA behave towards the players of the new generation, returning to the 2D that gave birth to him?", "date": "2003-02-26", "grade": null}
