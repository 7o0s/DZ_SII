If you grew up in the 80s, the Joe soldiers are burned into your memories and almost certainly recall afternoons lying on the ground simulating incredible battles between the brave American soldiers and the Cobra army. Telling a story that has them as protagonists is not that difficult and the ultra-American spirit makes the task even easier. You take a mega conflict, fill it with betrayals and backstabbing, kidnappings and imprisonment with a nice final redemption that elevates the Joes to saviors of the homeland and sees the Cobras fleeing empty-handed. The classic clich of most of the TV episodes of the series and, partially, also of the comics and related cinematic works. Despite all this, the spirit of Gi.I Joe has survived strong to the present day and the arrival in stores of a new line of action figures made Hasbro think well that launching a themed video game on the market would certainly have amplified the wave media shock. When such agreements are signed, quality control and development funds are usually very tight and it is therefore difficult to expect to find enjoyable and fun titles on the reference platforms. There have certainly been some exceptions in the past, perhaps thinking of that line of licensed games published by Activision and developed by PatinumGames several years ago (including Transformers: Devastation and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan) but this new production, unfortunately, it does not enjoy the same fate as we will explain in the review of G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout. An easily forgettable campaign ~On the one hand we deploy six iconic characters from G.I. Joe and on the other six charismatic opponents of the Cobras, we set up a campaign that unites the two factions, we make them collide by alternating control of the player and we drag him from an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean to oriental temples where Snake Eyes and Stormshadow can give life to a clash as classic as it is obvious. In between we also put in the driving sections on vehicles and the classic shootings from the fixed turrets that we like so much~. The initial pitch to examine the project of this new product must have gone more or less like this, with a basic idea that doesn't even try to try to propose something new and original but which limits itself to treading a road traveled by dozens of others times from titles all very similar to each other. Operation Blackout thus boldly tries to compete with the classic third-person shooters, a genre that goes well with the military philosophy of the G.I. Joe and that makes it hard to fail on a design level. The campaign thus takes us through eighteen levels of pure action where your finger will practically never release the trigger, except to be able to take advantage of the active reload, intent as you will be on breaking through androids of the two factions in the hope of arriving unscathed at the final boss. Yes, you read that right: androids. This is the first great trick designed by GameMill Entertainment to keep the classification rating low and be able to distribute it to a much more heterogeneous audience, an idea that has come in very useful among other things to be able to recycle models and animations for both factions, reducing thus enormously the amount of work and also saving a lot on the available budget. Shrewd move from the point of view of development but which weighs like a boulder on the heads of the players who will find themselves, in spite of themselves, playing for all five hours of the campaign always and only against an extremely limited number of enemies, making each level redundant and soon boring. The same, identical problem can also be observed in the structure of the maps, levels often recycled between one mission and another unable to offer interesting artistic ideas, both in terms of polygonal modeling and textures, which are barely sufficient, and in terms of landscapes and settings, for example perhaps the exclusion of the cherry blossoms in the mission to the Dojo Arashikage, already mentioned above. If the whole setting does not work to further bury the production, an obsolete and redundant game system will take care of it, which forces the player to have to exterminate waves of enemies without interruption by alternating the search for the, few, collectibles with horde sections where to look to resist the onslaught of enemies for a few minutes. The gunplay also leaves something to be desired Not that we expected much from the game system to be honest but it's a shame to see some good ideas being put on the table.tto m then dropped into the abyss of mediocrity along with everything else. The twelve heroes Joe and Cobra present are equipped with a main and a secondary weapon, a few grenades, a special defensive ability that can be trivially a dodge or an energy wall, and a final move called Apotheosis with devastating power. Features that suggest an at least varied combat system but the reality of the facts is that the artificial intelligence is practically not received and the androids will move ignoring any covers and shelters, running towards you like a mass of zombies, transforming everything into a frag trivial and without bite fest. The aiming system is also unsatisfactory with an aim assist that saves the day by allowing you to hit something instead of firing entire magazines into the void. Do not even consider the hand-to-hand combat system with terrible feedback both for the blows received and for those scored. However, there is something that is saved within the production and the cel shading graphics as well as the creation of the characters, most likely supervised and approved by Hasbro itself, are not bad at all with more than discreet movements and particularly successful victory poses . Another important feature, especially for a very young audience, is the possibility of playing the campaign in split screen mode, with four different difficulty levels and dozens of modifiers to better adapt the gaming experience to your needs. And then surprisingly there is also an entire part of the game dedicated to multiplayer. We were quite amazed to see the multiplayer option in the menus with six maps (obviously taken from other areas of the main campaign) and four game modes including of course the classic deathmatch, king of the hill, domination and steal the flag . The huge problem of this whole part is that it does not provide any possibility of playing online but only locally, a choice probably cut off to further reduce costs but which, in fact, leads players to have to challenge each other in team deathmatches or steal the flag in very boring matches in huge maps often in one on one without any sense.", "date": "2020-10-17", "grade": "5.0"}
