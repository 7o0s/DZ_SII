As we will see in this review, Nanoo Company's new action RPG distances itself from the Dark Souls-style setting of its origins to find its own personality, and it does so primarily by revolutionizing the cast of characters: in the game we no longer control a valiant warrior in armor, but a team of very powerful gynoids who stand as the last hope of the human race in a post-apocalyptic scenario, in which armies of robots dominate the world. There is no shortage of religious references even this time, if we consider that the order to which these fighters belong is called Fatima. The introductory sequence clarifies very well how the production value of this mobile game has grown exponentially compared to the beginning, while maintaining the ~noir~ style which leads to representing protagonists and enemies as simple silhouettes that move against the light. Furthermore, when you give life to the spectacular duels that characterize the gameplay of Dark Sword 2, the care placed in the animations is evident, particularly fluid and convincing even when the screen becomes very crowded and the action turns into a sort of bullet hell. only with blows instead of bullets: sequences that sometimes degrade the thickness of a combat system imagined in this way for a matter of visual impact rather than for the actual ability of the characters to counter the opponent's actions and therefore obtain victory for reasons other than a simple superiority of statistics. Gameplay and structure On paper, Dark Sword 2's touch controls provide many possibilities: a fixed virtual stick on the left side of the screen allows you to move, while a set of buttons on the right side operate the attack, special skills and evasive maneuver, this last subject to cooldown but above all not very legible in the two-dimensional context in which the clashes occur, often with enemies both ahead and behind making any defensive ambitions impossible. We therefore launch headlong with the combos and specials, unleashing a real hell made of slashing, rifle shots and explosions: a chaos that is certainly confusing, but which manages to involve and fascinate. The first missions of a campaign made up of over one hundred assignments, with some variations on the theme, serve as a tutorial to understand how the game works and the structure of very short levels, in which you face a handful of opponents before reaching a large and powerful boss, defeat him and then decide to return to the main screen or continue with the next expedition. Although it is a freemium production, downloadable for free, there are no limits to its use: you can play for as long as you want, watching advertising trailers which, however, disappear as soon as you decide to make a single purchase from the in-game shop. game. Monetization revolves around the many elements of a progressive upgrade system, which allows you to increase the level of weapons and special moves, unlock reinforcement items and so on: aspects that after a while become fundamental, given the presence of increasingly more adversaries strong and resistant. Wanting to avoid spending money, it therefore becomes mandatory to do a little grinding, but nothing extraordinarily demanding compared to the average on iOS and Android, also thanks to the brevity of the missions. After unlocking different fighters, each characterized by a different equipment and therefore by a unique approach to the clashes, it is possible to alternate them on the battlefield or use them all together in spectacular group missions, accompanied by an engaging but a little too much rock soundtrack generic. As for the graphics, as mentioned, the improvements compared to the first Dark Sword appear very evident and the expedient of the dark shapes allowed the developers to draw a truly amazing amount of enemies and bosses, emphasizing the impacts with excellent visual effects.", "date": "2019-07-27", "grade": "7.8"}
