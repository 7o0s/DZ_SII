On the other hand, there are valid reasons that prevented the Crytek title from accessing the magical and munificent world of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The original engine was in fact designed for high-end PCs and is still very heavy, with details and distance amazing visuals. But, thanks to the use of CryEngine 3 which is a valid console friend, the developers have finally circumvented the obstacle and have finally delivered the title to us with the promise to amaze us once again. So let's try to understand what has been cut or changed for this conversion which until some time ago seemed downright impossible. One Man Army Launching the game we are faced with the same menus of the original, the last obstacle between the players and an avalanche of angry Koreans who have been waiting for console users on an isolated island for 4 years. Fortunately, Major Strickland is also in the area who is ready to watch over the new recruits comfortably accommodated in the comfortable USS Constitution aircraft carrier. In short, the game is unchanged and once again puts us in the shoes of a one man army who has the aim of saving a group of archaeologists scattered on an island. However, it soon emerges that the incident hides unimaginable secrets, that the Koreans are not there by accident and that something terrible is haunting the jungle. In this new incarnation of Crysis, it is obviously the interface that changes and, as with the console version of Crysis 2, the use of the pad allows quick access to the equipment and functions of the suit. Specifically, on Xbox 360, with the left backbone the armor is activated, with the right one the invisibility and with the pressure of the left stick the super run. To change weapons you need to hold down the ~back~ key while to reload you use the X button. The controls for aiming and shooting are, predictably, the left and right triggers. To select the various weapons, however, you access a classic menu that is opened by holding down the Y key. Finally we come to the directional cross which allows access to all the support tools such as binoculars, night vision and the weapon fire mode selector. Obviously in exchange for the quick selection of skills, mouse precision is lost, but the title can still be played. Same thing for vehicles. Control is great, aiming on the move with the stick is a little less so. Xbox 360 goals Despite the arrival in the budget range Crysis offers full Objectives with 1000 points all unlockable in single player (on the other hand there is no multiplayer). The title rewards the kilometers covered, the killings, the use of weapons and obviously rewards us with 20 points every time we reach a particular point in the campaign. The objectives are quite simple even if to conquer them all you need to spend a lot of time. The transformation of Crysis Despite the marked pop up, the lower resolution, the lack of most of the smoke effects and the fluctuating textures, the final result still manages to surprise thanks to the bump mapping which gives greater depth to the rocks, thanks to the light rays passing through the rich vegetation and thanks to the beautiful details of elements such as torches that produce both direct light and a diffused glow. Furthermore, the level of detail and the shadows of the vegetation are excellent, although they are different from the PC counterpart, again thanks to the help of CryEngine 3. Among other things, as on PC, there is an excellent and marked post- processing on objects and characters when they move quickly. A distinctive element of the original title that gives a cinematic realism to close combat and which fortunately has remained intact. But the 360 version also has something more than the original and that's the colors. New filters, more marked contrast and decidedly more vivid colors help revive the appearance of the title and manage to hide, at least in part, the shortcomings. Obviously it's impossible to expect miracles from this version of the title and even if the general visual richness is not much inferior to the original, the use of the lower resolution takes away some of the wonder that was felt playing Crysis on a powerful PC. But looking closely at the screen it's clear that this Crysis still has its own identity, its merits and its wonderful glimpses achieved through the use of more modern effects. No more jaw-dropping, but almost. On the other hand, even today it is practically impossible to find an FPS on consoles that includes vehicles in quantity, dozens ofobjects splashing everywhere, bustling and rich vegetation destroying itself, huge bodies of water with real-time reflections and destructible structures. And to all this we must add details such as the wheels that get punctured or the weapon that is raised by the character near a wall and also the presence of boats, animals, the extreme visual distance and the splendid animations among which those of the creatures inspired by the sentinels of the Matrix. Sure, there's Battlefield 3 on the way, whose level of destruction is incomparable, but in terms of visuals, the console conversion of the Crytek title stands up to the best high-end productions for 360 and PS3 despite being a scaled down version of a title 4 years old. Furthermore, facing an entire army on foot, immersed in the fabulous setting of the title, remains a unique experience that is still worth trying. Great, but certainly not perfect Unfortunately, in addition to the certainly not exceptional definition, there is another element that hinders the full use of the title. We are talking about the fearsome slowdowns, significant frame drops that afflict the engine during the most agitated situations. Of course, given the size of the maps it is already a miracle that the game, once a level has been loaded, never needs pauses for further loading, but if there is something that affects the gameplay of an FPS this something is the lack of fluency during a shootout. Furthermore, Crysis suffers from another lack that is particularly felt nowadays. This is the multiplayer that is completely absent in this version. Among the changes in this version we also find the saves that are organized by checkpoints and levels and are no longer manual. However, these do not lead to an increase in difficulty as the checkpoints are triggered even when reaching certain areas and therefore in the majority of cases it remains possible to circumvent missions or postpone objectives without our progress going to get fried. And in any case Crysis is not a particularly difficult title precisely because it leaves the player with different ways to face each fight. In fact, the suit is a fundamental resource and if invisibility and running are used carefully, perhaps in combination with hand-to-hand combat, it is possible to carry out massacres in no time. Obviously that of becoming masters in the use of special abilities is the purpose of the whole thing that soon confronts us with enemies that would be out of reach for any human being. In essence, the difficulty remains the same as in the first chapter, or of medium size with some extreme situations such as groups of vehicles or enemies that emerge from the jungle to remind us that we are not immortal. Crysis is available on PSN and on the Marketplace at a price of 19.99 euros. The download is about 4GB and includes the speech of all the languages supported by the original, among which we also find Italian. The title does not have multiplayer and compared to the original version, the flight mission on the vertical take-off aircraft is missing.
