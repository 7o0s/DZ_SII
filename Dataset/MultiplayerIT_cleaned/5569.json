Now that Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest have also landed on mobile systems, it was only a matter of time before Tales did too, only they did it in the strangest way: while even Kingdom Hearts came in a form that very reminiscent of the mother series, Tales of Link for Android and iOS is instead a kind of match-3 crossed with an RPG. It may seem like an absurd idea, but all in all it works and after several hours of playing we have decided to advise you whether to download this app or not. Tales of Link is a fun hybrid between an RPG and a puzzle game for fans of the series of the same name All together eagerly They are the first story missions to teach us how to play Tales of Link, through a series of short tutorials that explain the basic dynamics. In reality, it is so intuitive that there would not even have been a need: having assembled a group of heroes, including the famous protagonists of the series and some anonymous faces, we can embark on missions consisting of three or more fights in which our group, made up of nine characters, face a number of monsters. Our aim, of course, is to defeat them; to do this we have to touch the characters, who will rush at the target to inflict the damage indicated next to their sprite. A random colored symbol appears under each character, for example a star or a red circle: if we connect the heroes characterized by the same symbol by dragging our finger across the screen, we will make them attack simultaneously according to the order we have pre-established and which will increase the damage inflicted on each consecutive attack. For this reason, it makes sense to follow an ascending order and chain as many shots as possible: in this sense, the special powers of the three characters we will choose as leaders come to our aid, which can be activated after having sufficiently charged a special indicator. There are also the famous Arts of the series, special attacks triggered at random during the fight that can inflict much more damage. Tales of Link would basically be all here, if it weren't for an RPG component which initially may seem rather superfluous but which proves to be decidedly more important in the advanced story missions and in the special deadline missions: each hero, in fact, inflicts a certain type of damage and can be equipped with weapons and armor which, in turn, can be upgraded and even evolved. The player must therefore begin to take into account the elemental properties, the weaknesses of the enemies, the special powers and the Guardians which give bonuses of various kinds to the deployed group. In all of this, Tales of Link manages to create addiction in fans of the series with a simple ~gacha~ system that allows you to recruit the most famous heroes, at different levels of power, by consuming the Hero Stones that the various missions bestow as a reward and which you can also buy them for real money. Being a free to play title, the Bandai Namco game relies on a non-intrusive microtransaction system even if, once the story is completed, the prizes that were generous at the beginning start to run out. Fortunately, the nature of the title lends itself to short sessions that don't make the weight of the counter that limits the games feel too much, which recharges perhaps a little slowly (even if you just need to level up to fill it completely). It must be said that the entire RPG structure relies on a decidedly awkward interface, slow and interrupted by continuous uploads, since you need to connect to the Internet to play, and this problem makes the micromanagement of the inventory, the heroes collected and of their equipment. Once you become familiar with the system, however, the games slip away which is a pleasure, thanks also to the colorful graphics and the ~chibi~ representation of the various characters in the series, also proposed in multiple versions and characterized by the Japanese jokes spoken in the games of 'origin.", "date": "2016-04-18", "grade": "7.0"}
