Instead of passively witnessing a pre-packaged scene, the Gilded Skull game places us in front of written text. A large amount of written text, accompanied by rather extravagant, stylized and cryptic illustrations, with a style that closely resembles the pages and paper cards of the classic ~pen and paper~ RPGs. Thus we find ourselves rediscovering the basic but often overlooked activities in videogames, i.e. reading and imagining, starting from an intense written trace and barely sketched graphic suggestions, drawn on the screen like pencil strokes on graph paper. It is evident that Galactic Keep is not a title dedicated to a vast fringe of the enormous potential audience represented by mobile users, but those who allow themselves to be fascinated by original playful solutions, or are perhaps passionate about classic role-playing games, can easily enter resonance with its rarefied sci-fi atmospheres and rigorous combat mechanics focused on the unappealable, albeit uncertain, roll of the dice. In the double direction simultaneously present in the mobile videogame panorama, or rather the ~story-driven~ one that often refers to large-scale productions with the relative narrative solutions and the opposite one, all immediacy and play, Galactic Keep represents an alternative and precious solution. Galactic Keep is a strange and familiar experience at the same time, which deserves to be tried Paper adventure Galactic Keep is therefore a role-playing game in the most classic sense, a direct transposition of the RPG on paper in digital form, complete with accurate reproductions of the typical printing, lettering and drawing effect on the screen. The story sees a group of adventurers in the service of the Coalition investigating some strange happenings in a remote corner of the galaxy, at least for the first part currently available, given that the narrative component also follows the classic modular subdivision of role-playing games. with the next chapters coming soon. After selecting your character, you must distribute the values for the attributes by rolling the dice and select the cards corresponding to the special abilities, all according to the strictest canon. In this spirit, it is not surprising that you find yourself moving a pawn in turns on a map drawn on paper and divided into boxes, with the almighty dice deciding the extent of the movements and the attack turns for the fights. The elements of the scenario are just hinted at on a two-dimensional level, while the accurate textual descriptions make us fit perfectly into the world of the game, also providing vague anticipations on where the various paths to take could lead. The combat system is rigorous and based on attack, block (a defensive maneuver that recharges a certain amount of energy), use of objects and special skills, relying on rolls and modifiers applied based on the attributes of the characters, which makes each single move to be studied carefully because even the apparently less significant clashes can lead to the death of the character if taken lightly. In standard mode, once your fighter has been eliminated, you can return to the map with one of the other available ones, recovering the objects of the previous character and sending the latter back to the Coalition to be able to use it later, but for more uncompromising you can activate the hardcore mode which establishes the dreaded permadeath, making it impossible to recover and reuse deceased characters.", "date": "2015-09-02", "grade": "9.0"}
