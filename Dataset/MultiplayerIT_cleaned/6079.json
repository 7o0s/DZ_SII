{"name": "Metal Hellsinger", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-hellsinger-recensione.html", "text": "Mixing a rhythm game with a first person shooter, why hadn't anyone thought of it before? Probably because they seem to be two worlds at the antipodes, so distant as to be practically irreconcilable. After all, many consider music games with a certain disdain, relegating them to B-series products. Yet this strange mix of genres can work, as you will understand by reading the Metal Hellsinger review. Rhythm gameplay The Unknown does not really want to joke The Unknown, the protagonist of the game, wants to take revenge on Hell for some reason. In particular, he has it in for the Red Judge, with whom he has a pending account and for whom he feels a very deep hatred. Half demon and half human, ours then embarks on a journey through eight regions of hell, to get to destroy his enemy. For Metal Hellsinger, John Carmack's adage applies that ~The plot in a video game is like the plot in a porn movie: you expect it to be there, but it's basically useless,~ which more or less describes the importance which plays into the general economy of the gameplay. Not that it doesn't offer some interesting ideas, but it simply stands there like a cardboard backdrop, justifying the rhythmic massacre of hordes of infernal creatures, who aim to stop us. Just launched, the title developed by The Outsiders begins to scream the love of the authors for metal from every pixel. Blazing music and the protagonist who seems to have come out of the cover of a death metal record on the title screen immediately make it clear where this is going. It's actually just the beginning, as we learned later by playing the tutorial. The Unknown is a killing machine, capable of terrifying his opponents, slaughtering them in rhythmliterally. Basically we are dealing with a first person shooter where you have to learn to shoot to the rhythm of the music. The more you manage to follow him when he strikes, the more he feeds a damage multiplier that makes our attacks more and more lethal (up to 16x). When you miss fire or get hit, the multiplier goes down, weakening you. Timed Attacks still do some damage, but are vastly weaker than Timed Attacks. The bottom line is that shooting wildly won't get you anywhere, so much so that we recommend evaluating the game well, perhaps trying the official demo, to anyone who might have difficulty with such a mechanic (lacking a sense of rhythm is not a crime ). Consider that the entire Metal Hellsinger is built around it, including many graphic elements, both of the interface and of the maps. Music is the core of the experience, as can also be guessed from some details of the game world: for example the torches infernals move to the beat of the level's song, so as to give the player a visual cue as to when to fire. The viewfinder is also built around the music and features pressure indicators. Finally there is the music itself, a different song for each hell, which increases in intensity as the multiplier grows, arriving at having sung parts when level 16X is reached. Fast-paced action Killing to the rhythm of music is essential We confess that after a certain initial disorientation, we found ourselves lost in Metal Hellsinger and its dynamics. While playing we tried to keep the rhythm in mind (1, 2, 1, 2 and so on), to fire only at the right moment, in order to cause massive damage to floating skeletons, armed demons shooting fireballs at us, ruthless behemoths , armored creatures, hell bugs and all the other demonic creatures that populate the game. It must be said that it is not easy to succeed and that often, especially at advanced levels, we end up losing the so-called rhythmic series due to the overwhelming number of enemies. The important thing is to recover immediately, on pain of seeing the multiplier go to zero or, worse, die, thus having to start the level over again (unless you want to sacrifice some of the accumulated points to continue). It is also essential to learn how to use the moves of the Unknown, i.e. the double jump and, above all, the shot, the only one that allows you to dodge certain attacks. Sure, it's not easy to master everything while also following the music, but it's essential if you want to move forward. On balance it is precisely this difficulty that makes shootings particularly rewarding, when approached in the right way. Levels Some levels are very nice, despite being very stiff The levels are very linear and are structured in a very rigid way. Basically they are arenas connected by obligatory passages, in which it is necessary to eliminate all the enemy waves from time to time, and then move on to the next section. Arrived at the end ofa level, be it a frozen wasteland, a ruined cathedral or the very center of Hell, you have to deal with the classic boss, that is a very powerful creature with special attacks. In reality, the appearance of many bosses is practically identical, being the same creature that moves from one region to another, but fortunately the attack patterns change every time, so as to avoid excessive repetitiveness. Once a level is finished, the so-called Torments are unlocked, i.e. tests to be overcome (killing a certain number of enemies within a certain time, maintaining a rhythmic series for a certain number of killings and so on) to obtain bonuses to take into battle, such as for example a protection for the rhythmic streaks or bonuses to damage. Weapons The Unknown has it in for hell and its inhabitants, despite being half-demon There are several tools to help the Unknown. Meanwhile the weapons, which are very different from each other, while all maintaining a strong link with music. For example, there's a crossbow that shoots explosive projectiles, which do immense damage when used in rhythm, or there are two pistols that used rhythmically look almost like drumsticks, at least ideally. You can bring two for each mission, to add to the two fixed ones, one of which is also the narrative voice (it's a skull that you recover at the beginning of the game and which has its own precise function in the story). Each weapon has its own immensely powerful secondary attack which is charged by performing rhythmic series (killings in rhythm) and which is often decisive for getting out of not exactly pleasant situations. Technically Metal Hellsinger is a successful game. Sure, the graphics don't stand out for their details, but the enemies are well done and the levels, despite their underlying simplicity, often manage to offer very beautiful landscapes, while remaining functional to the game system in most cases. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, made up of metal songs that are used in a decidedly creative way, as you will have understood by reading the rest of the article. Problems Hell awaits us By its own Metal: Hellsinger works and, if you get carried away, it works very well too. Shooting to the rhythm can prove to be particularly engaging, even if it significantly increases the general difficulty, especially in the advanced levels. From here emerges one of the problems of the game: having to start the stages from scratch in case of death. The choice is justified by the presence of a score that ends up in a global ranking and is therefore understandable. Having to replay entire levels in case of final death, however, is not very pleasant, especially the final ones which are longish. It is true that performing ever better is one of the reasons that push us to continue playing even after the end, which comes after a handful of hours (it took us about 8 hours to finish all the levels, but the duration of the game varies a lot depending on depending on the player's skill) so while it can be frustrating, it makes sense that there are no checkpoints and that you can't save. The substance is that if you are looking for a fresh first-person shooter with original mechanics, keep it in strong consideration.", "date": "2022-09-12", "grade": "8.0"}
