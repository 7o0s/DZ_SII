{"name": "Sam &amp; Max Episode 6: Bright Side of the Moon - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-episode-6-bright-side-of-the-moon-recensione.html", "text": "A bit of everything' The gameplay is the traditional one but the presence of all the protagonists of the past episodes creates a decidedly spot on mix, in which there is not a single guideline for the puzzles, which on the contrary now make variety their strong point. In particular, two puzzles prove to be extremely amusing and in some way contain the essence of Sam & Max. The first is the one that sees the fake Lincoln return, no longer in the guise of a politician but now in love with the ~knowledgeable~ Sibyl who, after having tried every imaginable job, he found his dimension: hence a series of witty and spicy dialogues concerning the female universe and the bizarre way in which the statue of the former US president conceives him, with Sam forced to indulge him, guided by the player, to get the upper hand and get what you need. Another first-rate passage is the one that sees Bosco and his emporium enter the scene. For the usual exorbitant amount, in fact, he will get the two private investigators nothing less than a machine to produce earthquakes, very useful when a geological disaster is what is needed to change the fate of the planet. Leaving aside the curious reason why the owner of a small shop owns this device, it is interesting how the developers were able to take full advantage of the objects that are collected and placed in the inventory, which will have to be combined and used several times and in the most imaginative ways possible. Also for this sixth episode, as well as for the fifth, it was decided not to leave room for particularly important arcade sessions, keeping the typical graphic adventure structure unchanged. The difficulty stands at rather low levels, so much so that you will hardly have to resort to solutions or particular aids, if it weren't for the usual jargon, at times cryptic to say the least. Three are once again the hours that should be enough to complete the experience: it would have been legitimate to expect something more, at least this time, but that is enough to justify the canonical approximately 7 euros required to download the full version. The moon as you've never seen it before The lunar setting has allowed great freedom in designing articulated and imaginative structures: a playground and gazebos selling souvenirs are just some of the places that can be visited, all perfectly rendered in full cartoon style, as per tradition. The character models are also more than acceptable, while some textures, often belonging to secondary elements, lack detail. The sound is excellent, which now no longer exalts only for the dubbing, but also thanks to a spot-on sound accompaniment and always suitable for highlighting the salient moments. The test code had some minor bugs, which can sometimes lead to slowdowns or certain images not loading, nothing serious anyway.

In reality, the final effect that many expected was missing and some aspects, longevity above all, could be improved. That said, fun is guaranteed for the sixth consecutive time, a fact that ennobles the qualities of Telltale, capable of giving new life to a product that, after a resounding success, seemed to have lost its way forever. At this point, we can only recommend the purchase of all six chapters, for the moment available only on the official website and via GameTap, in the future, perhaps, present in the shops in the boxed version. Pros The lunar setting is perfect... ...and for fans it will have an ancient flavor Beautiful to see and listen to Cons More frivolous topics than usual As a final chapter, more could have been done Finally the time has come when Telltale has to show its cards and give a worthy conclusion to the first episodic series of Sam & Max. With this Bride Sight of the Moon, in fact, the exalogy that has been keeping company since last November closes to thousands of users on an (almost) monthly basis and which has achieved good success, not making us regret the good old days of LucasArts. The narrative responds to a specific need and is the first element that deviates this chapter from the previous ones: the submerged plot, that is the common thread that unites all the adventures faced, emerges and becomes the protagonist, at the discapito of the others, more or less spot on, digression to which one was accustomed. Specifically, one is immediately informed of how the man who wants to hypnotize and enslave all humanity, responds to the name of Roy G. Biv and that the solution to all questions can be found no less than on the moon - already present in the old Sam & Max: Hit the Road; all that remains is to jump aboard the DeSoto and take to the skies. Much of the rhetoric and criticism of some customs of American society have therefore been put into the background, perhaps making the game more attractive even to those who do not want to search and deepen the continuous references and giving a decidedly more relaxed atmosphere, like a video game.", "date": "2007-05-09", "grade": null}
