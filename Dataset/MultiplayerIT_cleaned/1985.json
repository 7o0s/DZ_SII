{"name": "Ferrari F355 Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-f355-challenge.html", "text": "The very real driving simulator.... All this might seem a little, but the real fulcrum of the title is not so much the myriads of cars, tracks and customizations to be done as the trend today dictates, but the aforementioned driving accuracy, which imposes a level of difficulty really high and a learning curve at the same levels. In fact, the f355 doesn't give us immediate satisfaction, you don't go out on the track and you win right away without too many worries: braking to the limit while keeping the car on the track is really difficult without help, i.e. at an absolute simulation level. The driving aids in fact determine the fate of each player: the total activation of them, traction control, stability, ABS and IBS (automatic brake), facilitate driving and offer a challenging enough challenge not to throw the pad from the window in the grip of the blackest despondency. Deactivating them all if you have not been familiar with the title since the coin op times, is equivalent to videogame suicide: only with absolute dedication and perseverance will you learn to brush curves worthy of an at least normal driver, new Shumachers do not exist here, excellence in this title is really for a few. All this leads to initial frustration, but with the arrival of the first results, joy and boldness will become our trusted companions. Still with regard to the aids, it must be added that, with the exception of the IBS which belongs only to the beginners category, we could activate and deactivate them as we wish depending on the parts of the track that are being tackled. To our rescue, in addition to the aforementioned aids, there are also the three modes of the Arcade challenge: race, about which there is very little to say, training and driving. The training mode is the most complete and professional ever seen in a racing game: practically both verbally and visually we are warned about how and where to brake, when to change gear and the trajectory to follow, in short, a real tutorial. The next step is the guide mode, the one that in many other titles is called free ride: you ride without opponents and without a time limit, putting what you have learned into practice. The actual race is the sum of the hours spent with training: contrary to the Dreamcast version, if my memory serves me, we will have the possibility to compete on all the eleven tracks present (Monza, Motegi, Suzuka short and long, Sugo, Long Beach, Atlanta, Nurbungring, Laguna Seca, Sepang and Fiorano, without having to unlock them one by one, also deciding whether to set a time limit within which to finish crossing the finish line. Audio Video Unfortunately, the praise for the porting of the Sega title ends here as audio and video are at decidedly lower levels. Graphically, the game is exactly identical to the two previous incarnations with all that obviously follows: the textures of both the cars and the backdrops are decidedly flat and with a hodgepodge of colors when seen closely. The number of polygons on the screen is reduced and can be clearly seen on the cars which appear to be not very detailed and, as if that weren't enough, afflicted by an unpleasant jagged effect. The color palette is uninspired with decidedly muted tones, which are just a pale reminder of the flamboyant Dreamcast version. A view from the outside has also been added which conceptually betrays the extreme simulation intention of the product, and does nothing but show the graphic defects of the title. The screen update is firmly anchored to 60fps, fluidity and speed are therefore not lacking in the Sega title. The audio sector is a useless succession of metal pieces that have remained a sad inheritance from the DC version; today, as then, after 30 seconds the volume of the music will be lowered to zero, instead raising the volume of the engine to full throttle. pro car simulation perfect arcade almost perfect excellent training system against outdated graphics heavy metal definitely out of place not immediate for newbies Sega vs Polyphony We all know that GranTurismo is ~the real driving simulator~, but at the same time we all agree that it is certainly not a pure simulation, like Geoff Crammond's titles or Gran Prix Legends on PC, so to speak. To remedy this lack, Sega proposes the porting of f355 for Dreamcast, year 2000, in turn arcade perfect conversion of the amazing coin op of the end of 1999. Having made a little history, it is immediately clear what the only underlying problem of the title is Sega: The years go by and what was splendid in 1999 is certainly not so now, especiallyall if we refer to the Poliphony branded products. In fact, f355 is absolutely splendid as a game mechanic and physics that underlies the guide. But conversely it is, from an accessory graphic and sound point of view, poor and afflicted with problems that were not found in the Dreamcast version. But let's go in order and talk about the title, making a more or less detailed lineup. There are three main modes in this version, while in the Dreamcast version there were two: Arcade, Championship and Best Driver Challenge. The latter consists of a sort of prize challenge: the better you drive, the cleaner you drive and the more Ferrari memorabilia will be unlocked, to be viewed later in a special gallery. This is what the Sega title offers, apart from the multiplayer challenge.", "date": "2002-10-10", "grade": null}
