{"name": "Di corsa senza ruote", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76863-orion-racer-di-corsa-senza-ruote.html", "text": "The increasingly large amount of games from the App Store sees the racing genre as one of the most prolific and successful exponents; as a natural consequence, like the ~proper~ consoles, even racing games for the iPhone can now be distinguished between simulations and arcades. Orion Racer, with a decidedly affordable cost of 1.59 euros, fits right into this last category. Orion Racer is in fact basically a futuristic racing title set in circuits in space. As in the most classic characterization of the genre, we will find ourselves driving anti-gravity ships, fighting against 3 other opponents, on increasingly demanding tracks and almost all of which can already be selected from the start. The available game modes also remain largely in the tradition: we will therefore have the Quick Race for immediate action, the Tournament in which to challenge each other to the last corner for 10 races and finally the Time Trial (complete with a ~ghost~) for improve your lap times. Although the game concept certainly does not represent the maximum originality (in fact the references to Wipeout and before that to the legendary F-Zero are discounted), the crazy races without gravity are almost always a guarantee of fun, especially if played together with a friend ( option possible thanks to the multiplayer via bluetooth present). Cosmic flaws Unfortunately, however, the fun in this title is undermined by a serious lack, at least for this kind of game, namely the total absence of any Power Up: not an accelerator, not a weapon or a shield, in short, nothing that could somehow way to vary the gameplay of the title and therefore alter the fate of the race in an ~unconventional~ way. It is true that for racing game purists this could also be an advantage, but it is also true that an adrenaline-pumping space racing title is certainly not aimed at an audience of driving game purists. However, the only lack of upgrades could be overcome if the remaining part of the game, i.e. the strictly racing phase, was at least well cared for and balanced. Unfortunately this does not happen, both because the spacecraft are practically all the same when driving, distinguishing themselves only by the external body or at most (and this is the case of the only unlockable one) by a slightly higher top speed, and because the level of challenge overall remains very low. The only difference between the various degrees of difficulty of the circuits is in fact given by the number of curves present and their angle, if we then add the fact that it is impossible, for example, to get off the track, due to the protections present along all the tracks, or suffer damage of any kind thanks to the invulnerable ships, it is easy to understand how the fun can quickly diminish after just a few races. Precisely the replayability factor, very important to make the game attractive in the classic ~hit and run~ use of mobile platforms, probably has not even been considered by the developers as after finishing the Tournament, at any difficulty, the already mentioned extra spacecraft and the only runway not immediately available. However, where Orion Racer recovers at least a little is certainly in the technical sector: not so much for the graphics themselves, certainly clean but very bare, as for the granite framerate which gives an excellent sensation of speed and fluidity even on a less performing iPhone 3G. The circuits are made in a very simplistic way and the only element that distinguishes them is the background, inspired by planets or parts of the galaxy, with a good glance but certainly not such as to leave a mark; the ships are instead little more than colored triangles, very little detailed. Certainly the maximum effort has been made for the speed yield and, considering the frenetic nature of the game, the goal can easily be said to have been achieved. The good work of general optimization is completed by the precise and punctual response of the commands, with the really useful possibility of adjusting the sensitivity of the accelerometer. Finally, the audio should be forgotten, which due to the usual repetitive pseudo-techno music and the bad sound effects of the spacecraft, closer to the noise of a vacuum cleaner than to that of futuristic jet engines, will soon become very annoying.
