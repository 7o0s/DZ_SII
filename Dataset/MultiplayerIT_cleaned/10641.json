{"name": "Fast Food Panic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68781-fast-food-panic-il-cliente-ha-sempre-ragione.html", "text": "Fast Food Panic is a brand new ~restaurant simulator~ for the Nintendo DS. In the game we take on the role of the owner of a restaurant full of ambition and determination, who, relying on his cooking skills, must be able to increasingly expand his clientele, up to opening new premises around the world. The main mode, which is possible to face even in a free way (by selecting the level among those already completed), consists of fifteen stages characterized by increasing difficulty, in which our character must gradually divide himself between several tasks simultaneously to satisfy the customers. The action takes place quite simply: people enter the restaurant and take their seats, then order a dish from the menu and we don't have to prepare it quickly and accurately, following the directions that appear on the screen from time to time. At the beginning we simply have to pay attention to the timing in the preparation of the individual dishes, but going forward in the stages we will have much more things to do. The strength of ten arms Cooking in Fast Food Panic requires precision, speed and a pinch of attention. At the beginning, our menu basically includes only sushi, which is prepared by collecting boiled rice from a bowl (you draw an arc with the stylus on the touch screen), arranging it according to a shape (~pushing~ the edges with the stylus) and finding the right ingredients to apply on them by choosing them from five hole cards (basically like in a visual memory game). The other recipes such as pizza, curry rice or simple hamburger require complete maneuvering different: each dish makes its own story, in this sense, and must be prepared through a specific minigame. It is interesting to note that the more complex the dishes become, the more things to do simultaneously increase: on the right side of the touch screen, new icons gradually appear to welcome customers who have just entered, order our assistant to clear a table or to chase away a mouse (well yes), or help her with tasks like calculating the bill, cleaning or clearing a table or making a delivery. Similarly, the ever-increasing amount of customers and orders will force us to prepare dishes all together, putting a pizza in the oven while, for example, preparing a sandwich, etc. Panic! At the bottom of the screen there are two bars: the first represents customer satisfaction, the second represents the total time available to complete the level. Our goal is to fill the first bar before time runs out, and to do so we'll have to pay attention to the tasks that can change from time to time. A example, in some cases we will have to do with very special clients (journalists, critics or simply gourmands) to whom we must give precedence over others. Given the crowd that sometimes arises, it is not always possible to please everyone and we will have to get used to the idea that some people at a certain point get up from the table and leave in a rage. From this point of view, free mode is a great way to practice and optimize movements in search of the perfect performance. Fast Food Panic also offers a series of simple side-games, maybe not beautiful but nice. The technical realization in general is really good, the characters are well drawn and each level is interspersed with nice manga-style skits. It's all very colourful, and the audio is enhanced by some sentences in Italian as well as a series of nice effects.
