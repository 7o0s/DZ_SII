The reasons behind the success of the game are many: it is a tremendously solid action RPG, equipped with a combat system capable of rendering impacts very well and gradually unlocking new weapons and special maneuvers, but also of stimulating the desire to explore thanks to a level design full of crossroads, levers to operate, keys to collect and secrets to discover. The story of Grimvalor revolves around a warrior, male or female depending on the initial choice, who is tasked with finding out what happened to the mysteriously disappeared king of Vallaris. A far from simple mission, given that the place where the sovereign should be is a sort of multifaceted underground labyrinth in which physical laws are often broken in favor of strange spells and hordes of dangerous monsters are waiting for nothing more than some inexperienced knight to tear apart. However, we will not be the ones to give him satisfaction: equipped with an arsenal that we will be able to grow over the course of the campaign, consisting of four challenging acts, we will have to make our way through enemies, defeat deadly bosses and finally discover the truth. Gameplay: combat system and enemies The incipit of Grimvalor is very hasty and lives up to the typically mobile need to immediately involve the player, without wasting time. Fortunately, this is only the tutorial, which is followed by a narrated introduction that illustrates the scenario and its protagonists, to then leave us inside the first stage. The initial fights immediately clarify the solidity of the system packaged by the developers, which, as mentioned, renders the impacts in an excellent way and provides us with a range of maneuvers useful for defeating any opponent: the Y key is the deputy for the light attack, the X key for the heavy one, while with B you can perform single jumps or doubles and with A it is possible to shoot or perform an instant dodge, as spectacular as it is useful to avoid taking damage, especially during the boss fights. Unlike the mobile version, which however has also introduced support for Bluetooth controllers, the physical commands on Nintendo Switch guarantee excellent responsiveness and precision, fundamental elements especially in certain situations. The opponents that we will find along the way will in fact give us a hard time, becoming more and more tough and therefore requiring frequent upgrades so that we can keep up with them. The types of enemies are very varied and even in the options there is an item designed for those suffering from Arachnophobia: When activated, replaces spiders with other types of creatures. In terms of design, the bestiary is quite inspired and each unit has a specific behavior that must be memorized in order to dodge its attacks: from tanks armed with machetes to archers, from guards with spears to angels who spit fire, passing through the gruesome black monsters and beasts that look like they came out of a movie with aliens. Structure: settings and outline Grimvalor's settings are rich in atmosphere and different color tones, decidedly inspired by the tradition of the various Castlevanias, structured as watertight compartments that generally follow a bifurcated or trifurcated development, reporting the completion percentage on the map screen and therefore urging us to return often on our steps to find that hidden passage, that treasure that we had not noticed or that portal to activate. Fortunately, the game does not leave us at the mercy of dangers for too long, scattering frequent save points where it is possible to spend the money earned order to buy upgrades for the character and increase his values of vitality (health), brutality (strength), mastery (attack speed) and magic, i.e. the ability to use amulets and generate mystical energy. The latter feeds the use of the powerful blow, with a view to completely free management of the equipment: we can choose whether to use the sword as a primary weapon and the ax as a secondary one or vice versa, use steel gloves and create new and more powerful tools by using the forge and using the most precious currency that can be found in Grimvalor, the black crystals, also to create robust armor. Additional purchasable items include flasks that can be used to restore healtheven in the middle of a fight, but paying attention to the timing: it takes a few moments to drink the potion, and some enemies won't allow it. However, we find ourselves having to choose whether to use the money to obtain some gadgets or level up at the altars, in which case opting for a more or less strong, more or less resistant warrior: decisions that make the difference once in the heart of the battle. battle. Technical realization Grimvalor has stood out since its inception for being a mobile game of great artistic and technical depth, and we expected nothing less than a perfect conversion on Nintendo Switch. The game also runs on the Japanese hybrid console at a stable 60 frames per second, which however yield to some drops in the most excited moments, when multiple opponents are hit simultaneously while also performing special moves: an eventuality that however seems to occur less often in portable mode In this regard, the experience is confirmed to be excellent also and above all in mobility, rediscovering the spirit of the beginnings and lending itself very well to impromptu use where necessary. The transition from a small screen to the TV has been managed surprisingly well by the guys at Direlight Games, who have been able to hide the inevitable shortcomings of a sometimes simplistic polygonal modeling. Beyond these ingenuities, Grimvalor's graphics appear solid and inspired, fluid and captivating, with a great atmosphere and a convincing design in most cases, as well as an excellent set of animations both for the protagonist and for the creatures he will have to face. The sound sector also deserves a few words, which can count not only on functional and effective effects but also and above all on excellent and inspired music.", "date": "2020-04-07", "grade": "8.0"}
