{"name": "Bomberman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bomberman.html", "text": "In single For now, let's put the stylus back, and select single-player mode. After the brief introduction you will be immediately in the center of the action and you will notice that the game develops only in the upper screen of the DS, in the classic Bomberman scheme. The lower screen, on the other hand, contains an interface that summarizes the various types of bonuses that you have available and that you can use by pressing the various icons (large enough to be activated by the touch of a finger) during the course of the game. Contrary to what you have seen in past bomberman games, the bonuses will not be activated immediately after you have collected them from the map, but they will be accumulated in this interface, and will be ready to be used immediately. Whether or not this variation was a pretext to make sense of the touch function of the DS, it still follows that after the death of your bomberman, sadly you will not be at the starting level, but you can immediately add some power-ups to the character in order to restart already nice perky. The 100 levels that you will face (divided into 10 worlds) will be interspersed with bonus levels and boss levels. In these moments the play area will be extended to the second screen and you can move from one screen to another by passing through the tunnels bordering the screens. In short, nothing really interesting or new, both for those who already know bomberman well, and for those who want a ~DS Style~ game. If the game had ended here, while it couldn't have been a disappointing or bad game, there wouldn't have been a really good reason to get a copy of the game... but fortunately the multiplayer mode comes to the rescue. Bombermand is currently one of the best choices when it comes to multiplayer gaming on the DS and in company This mode thanks to the gamesharing function (which we are increasingly convinced will be one of the distinctive points of the console) allows you to play up to 8 players with a single copy of the game. And the fun explodes () on your and our DS. In case you are missing some players to complete the octet, you can activate the bots offered by the game and which have three difficulty levels. Obviously you don't necessarily have to play in 8 but you can organize the game as you like, even in teams (watch out for friendly fire though!). As soon as you finish downloading the game on your friends' DS, you will find yourself faced with so many variables that at first it will seem like too many. In reality they are small options that will be assimilated very quickly. First of all it will be necessary to choose the internship in which to try their hand, and there are really many. We start from the classic level to those with various traps, treadmills, arrows that change the direction of the bomb's progress, and various ~bastarte~. As soon as you take the field you will notice that for this occasion the playing area will develop on both screens, a decidedly apt choice which will allow a whole series of truly infamous situations, such as those of leaving bombs under the border tunnels, or those of kicking bombs from one screen to another, while your opponents are in the dark (until they're good enough to control both play areas at the same time, at least). Since there is no more space for the bonus interface, these will be activated the moment you collect them. In this mode, maluses also appear, which generally produce the opposite effects of bonuses, and some special blocks that generate random situations. The aim of the game is to stay alive, but when choosing the stage you can select some levels whose aim will be to capture a crown, or to color as many tiles as possible thanks to the fire of your bombs. And if you leave the scene prematurely, don't despair too much, you will be able to disturb your opponents by throwing bombs from the lower edge of the second screen, and you will do it using the touch screen. The bombs are at minimum power, but if you are precise in giving the stylus power when launched, you can be lethal. This option that can be activated or not is called ~Revenge~, the name says it all, and it can even allow you to come back to life! Among the various levels of play, there are also some that allow the use of the microphone, to place or detonate bombs and to activate the defense. However, in our test we noticed that the microphones are too sensitive, and the ability to adjust the trigger volume threshold is missing. It happens very often therefore that a player detonates the bombs of all the companions around there making them die from the fire of thethemselves bombs, not to mention that during the game you are practically forbidden to make any comments, and in games like this some word (perhaps not too polite) always escapes you, guaranteed! Bomberman in this DS incarnation makes multiplayer his strong point, as it always has been after all. The game is perfectly usable by everyone, and organizing multiplayer sessions will be very easy: just find DS people equipped, and the game is done. Wifi management is very well organized, and it will be possible to rearrange teams and players at the end of each match. Bombermand is currently one of the best choices when it comes to multiplayer gaming on the DS, both for the care taken by the programmers to make each game different from the others, and for the type of game capable of attracting even beginners. As for the single game instead, unless you are a maniac bomberman, we advise you to direct your purchases towards something more interesting. Maybe something focused on the features of the DS. Pros: Wifi up to 8 players Very fun in multiplayer Cons: Single not too convincing Structure tested and already reproposed The Nintendo DS is definitely a console with great possibilities. The combination of its peculiarities make it a pleasant and interesting machine for both players and developers. But if the former are only interested in turning on the console sitting on the sofa sheltered from the sun, or in the cool of the bench on the porch, the latter have the task of creating new game concepts or reformulating the classic ones that have accompanied us in all these years of game. As stated by some developers, the DS is not only a possibility, but in some cases it is a source of frustration in finding adequate solutions to exploit at least some features of the console, in games born and designed for other hardware. Because it is true that the DS can also be used as a more traditional portable console, but it is equally true that as soon as each of you pushes the start button of the console with your left hand, with your right you are already looking for the nib on the back . With Bomberman, the developers limited themselves to exploiting the possibilities offered by the DS hardware, without changing the classic formula that you all know in the slightest.", "date": "2005-08-26", "grade": null}
