{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2_a.html", "text": "Victory is ours Once again taking advantage of the inflated Renderware graphic tool, Konami was able to concentrate on the substance of the game, polishing and correcting many of the defects that afflicted the first Pro Evolution Soccer, such as a certain slowness in the players' responsiveness to commands given via pad and unrealistic ball physics on several occasions in the game. All that glitters is gold? Obviously not, and despite belonging to two different markets (Pal and Jap) a comparison of Pes 2 with Winning Eleven 6, released six months ago in Japan and a true yardstick for all the football simulations on consoles, is urgently needed. Pes 2 abandons the famous Fevernova ball in favor of a mediocre Umbro sponsored version, but above all it manages a ball physics that is still too light and unreal in some (few) situations. The calibration of the difficulty level is still subject to some improvement, especially with regard to the defenses, which tend to be inserted centrally with some ease by the computer at higher difficulty levels. This inconvenience can be limited by acting on the training setting, but in general it appears more as a defect than as an incentive to improve. Victory is ours Technically, the game has not undergone major improvements or upheavals compared to the prequel, apart from the increased number of animations, which is constant for each new episode of the series. The faces of the players were always faithfully and convincingly reproduced, while during long game sessions no slowdown was noticed (a feature instead of We6). Sore point instead for the game uniforms, often with faded colors and far from the real counterparts. The surrounding stadiums enjoy generally good field textures, while the sore points of the previous versions remain, namely the absence of referees, benches and linesmen, not to mention the poor realization of the public. The sound sector still lacks as regards the commentary, of poor quality and absolutely not comparable to the incomprehensible Kabira of the Japanese version. The situation improves decisively as regards the public, thanks also to the possibility of setting (using a specific option) its inclination, this will be equivalent to loud boos for the opposing team or neutral cheering for both opponents on the pitch. Mode for everyone The improvements introduced by Pes2 are mostly inherited from Winning Eleven 6 and are absolutely new for European users. Among the most welcome additions we point out the possibility of setting the condition of the players who take the field during a friendly match (in order to play perfectly equal matches against an opponent), that of changing the level of difficulty during a competition and the possibility of playing the master league with two players without particular ~tricks~. Just the master league deserves a separate mention. Completely renewed compared to the previous ones, it now makes use of a complex system of signings, loans and management of the transfer market, with the added possibility of playing playoffs, cups and direct matches. The number of teams has been increased to 40, divided into three divisions and with the new difficulty level, called Extreme, which will make even the experts of the series sweat the proverbial seven shirts. We close our review with the training section, enriched in the tutorial phase and integrated by a pleasant section of subgames very similar to the one present in Virtua Tennis: dribbling between the pins and targets to hit are the masters, pushing us to always improve by plus their own records. Mode for everyone The aspect that we absolutely do not feel like forgiving Konami concerns everything that ~surrounds~ the actual game. Starting with the lack of licenses for some players up to the very ugly mangled names of the Master League teams, the Japanese house does not seem to have made the slightest effort to make Pro Evolution Soccer 2 complete in all respects, a further indication in this sense is the fact that the game doesn't make any real improvements or changes to the Japanese version, which has been on the shelves for over 6 months. Definitely.. Pro Evolution Soccer 2 remains the pinnacle of a soccer game on console and a scobligatory for any user who wants to kick a virtual ball. The new master league and the unchanged fun that comes from playing in pairs give added value to the production. However, the lean outline and the use of a graphics engine that has now reached its limit are an indication that Konami can and must do more, We are football tribe, am i right? Pros: The best football simulation around Master League even more intriguing Paired is virtually infinite Cons: Renderware engine has reached its limit Few innovations compared to Winning Eleven 6 We will rock you! What better introduction could we expect from a long-awaited title? A computer graphics movie with Queen's famous hit in the background can only introduce us to Pro Evolution Soccer 2, the second transposition on the European market of the football simulation made in Konami and direct evolution of the Japanese best seller Winning Eleven 6. The result is materializes in an improved version in virtually every respect over the prequel. In fact, a single game is not enough to notice all the small tricks introduced by mother Konami, starting with the increased game speed up to a disproportionate number of animations (especially as regards the goalkeepers). The absence of the option for 60hz once again casts its shadow on the game, not so markedly compared to the previous version, but still perceptible.", "date": "2002-11-15", "grade": null}
