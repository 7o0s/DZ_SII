In fact, one wonders if all this is not a bit anachronistic, considering that the launch of the Just Dance Unlimited subscription service should have made the use of new chapters to be released every year obsolete by now, but it is clear that this series continues to be extremely profitable for Ubisoft, so much so as not to question its distribution through the classic channels of the market even with a now well-established subscription structure. Another sign of this great potential that the game has on the market and of the desire to fully exploit it is the number of platforms on which Just Dance 2018 is available, obviously including the new Switch version and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, as well as the editions for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U and even Wii, the latter a curious but actually valid move considering the user base that still owns the Nintendo console at home and who represent a potentially still active audience for Just Dance, which has long remained one of the best-selling titles on that platform. Despite this plethora of different versions, the game remains essentially the same, only changing the tracking system used to evaluate player movements. In this review we deal specifically with the Switch version, probably considered the main one for Just Dance 2018 and equipped, unlike all the others, also with some peculiar characteristics. Parlor dancers Just Dance has continued to remain substantially constant for the past nine years, starting from the first chapter dated 2009 to get to the current one. Ubisoft's approach for each new chapter is incremental, adding new features to the basic mechanics and rejuvenating the catalog of danceable songs year after year with the latest hits of the moment, always keeping good in the vast carnet of historical singles that they lend themselves particularly well to dance. On the structure of the game itself we can very well take up what was said in the review of Just Dance 2017, therefore: it is a rhythm game that sees us replicate the choreographies represented on the screen based on the use of various movement detection systems, with a constant evaluation of our performance which then determines the final score and the possibility of unlocking and accessing further content or simply winning a multiplayer match, but the purpose of Just Dance is not competition at all. It's about providing a stimulus to dance, and for those who have a minimum predisposition to rhythmic movement of the body it can be an excellent way to get up from the sofa and squirm a bit with music, having fun and maybe even learning a few steps. For these reasons, it is clear that Just Dance is essentially a casual title, a party game that goes beyond any videogame canon to rather approach a sort of board game in which the console acts exclusively as a technological means through which to interface with what is happening on the screen. It was born as a product specifically designed for the Wii Remote but over time it has been able to adapt well to the various motion detection systems, in particular with Kinect (at least before its definitive departure), but then finding a way to untie itself also from the various peripherals with the use of the smartphone app, even if the exploitation of the latter is always a bit doubtful considering the danger of dancing holding your phone in your hand. All this variety of solutions also raises some suspicions about the actual precision of the motion sensing: the Switch Joy-Con themselves do not have a real spatial detection system like the Wii or Kinect, relying rather on the accelerometer, therefore it is not clear how the game establishes the coherence of the player's movements and the doubt is that this happens in a very approximate way. A cornucopia of content The first minutes of the game may suggest a certain limitation of content, but just complete a few sessions to unlock the catalog and fare literally blowing up the menus of modes and songs. Now, the writer of this review is not exactly a fan of dance music or its derivatives, but the catalog of songs presents a great variety of artists and musical influences, just enough to be able to say that it really adapts a little to all tastes. This is also only for what concerns the 40 songs present in the basic tracklist, while the possibilities become practically infinite considering the over 300 songs in the Just Dance Unlimited subscription service, available free for three months with the purchase of the game and then move on to the subscriptions (4.99, 9.99 and 29.99 euros for one month, three months or one year respectively). Needless to get here to make lists, we refer you to the official site for the complete list of tracks in the game and information on the Unlimited catalog and judge for yourself, what we can say is that the assortment is truly remarkable and perfectly adapted to the game through excellent choreography. The main game mode remains Just Dance, which allows you to tackle the songs separately in single or local multiplayer, while online multiplayer is accessible in the World Dance Floor mode. Although the mechanics remain the same, in principle, there are several variations that increase the interest in the game: an absolute novelty is represented by the Kids mode, which simplifies things a bit and presents a repertoire suitable for the youngest, confirming the nature of a title suitable for the whole family. The Machine mode has been replaced by Dance Lab, which confronts us with a series of rather bizarre tests, in which we find ourselves simulating a series of themed gestures and movements within progressive levels. Also present is the Fitness mode which allows you to view the calories burned to the rhythm of the music, thus giving a ~healthy~ element to the whole. Obviously there is no narrative substratum in all this, but a sense of progression is given by the advancement in experience levels and by the collection of ~mojo~, represented by gold coins that can be used in a sort of vending machine to obtain various rewards such as avatars, cosmetic items, songs, Lab levels and more. The fact that the game offers daily quests to be tackled, with particular requests in terms of performance to be completed in order to obtain additional mojo, is also a system to give a sense of evolution to the whole and further revive interest in the game also in the long run. Particular attention has been paid to the Switch version, which emerges from the others as a sort of flagship edition for Just Dance 2018. It is indeed a game particularly suited to the Nintendo console, between the presence of Joy-Con as standard peripherals and its known multiplayer potential. Therefore, the introduction of a couple of extra tracks is not surprising, including one based on Mario as a further demonstration of the link between Ubisoft and Nintendo after the experience of Mario + Rabbids, and above all the presence of a mode called ~Double Rumble~. which is based on the simultaneous use of the two Joy-Con by a single player. This opens the door to more complex and particular choreography and movements, which in this case take on thematic characteristics in the imitation of various works through typical gestures, obviously always to the rhythm of the music. Another distinctive element of the Switch version is the support for the HD Rumble, with the internal vibration of the Joy-Con which is always present and active during the game, giving a further sense of rhythm to the whole. On a technical level, for the rest, there are no marked differences compared to the last chapters of the series, with the usual extremely colorful and contrasting graphic style, in order to focus attention on the silhouettes to better understand the movements to be done but without renouncing a certain spectacularity of the choreographies on video.", "date": "2017-10-29", "grade": "7.5"}
