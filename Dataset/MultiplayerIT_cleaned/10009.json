{"name": "Split/Second: Velocity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77316-splitsecond-velocity-tra-esplosioni-e-catastrofi.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Fun, watchword of the manual of good development of a large part of video games, certainly a must for those of arcade racing, which focus entirely on frenzy, adrenaline and on the possibility of repeating the same track several times without firing a shot and never getting bored, aspects that can elevate them to worthy of entering the Olympus of the best exponents of the genre. Split/Second: Velocity wants to follow this tradition and has several credentials to do so, first of all because it was developed by Black Rock Studios, the same ones that a couple of years ago churned out Pure, another arcadone that is beautiful to look at and also quite fun. This time the setting moves to city circuits and aboard powerful racing cars, but the similarities with other titles of the genre end here, because the video game published by Disney tries to propose various new mechanics for the genre, focusing everything on an environment destructible and therefore on the possibility of taking advantage of different elements of the scenario to (temporarily) eliminate the contenders and grab the first position, always if you are good at not being reduced to thousands of small pieces of sheet metal in turn. Split/Second: Velocity is organized like a real action movie divided into 12 episodes, each of which is made up of 5 different events. In fact, a voice (in Italian) illustrates the specific features, and the initial tutorial that is offered automatically the first time the disc is inserted explains the main features. Even the interface is original in its design, and the music that accompanies the menus has a typical style of what can be heard in a great Hollywood action production, made up of drums, bass and an ever-insistent rhythm, just to underline exactly the game setting. Welcome to Destructywood Beyond the fast race, which offers all the tracks and modes unlocked, and the multiplayer, which we will return to later, Split/Second: Velocity bases its structure on the season, as mentioned, divided into episodes and events. Each event returns credits based on the placement (from first to eighth), which after a certain number accumulated allow you to unlock new cars and elite races, which must be completed at least in third place to unlock the episode following. There is also the presence of bonus events, which instead become accessible by completing certain conditions, which often coincide with the elimination of a certain number of opposing cars. Obviously the main event that happens most frequently is the classic race, which among other things allows you to test most of the salient features of the title. A purely arcade driving model, where tackling the curves is quite simple except being more careful when you have to juggle tunnels or sudden detours, is accompanied by the peculiar feature of the game, the Power Play, which allows you to activate real catastrophic events on the track, in order to temporarily eliminate the unfortunates and make them lose precious seconds and positions. Everything is linked to a bar placed on the back of your car, which together with the position, time and number of laps represents an elegant holographic display that contains all the information in a small space. Whenever you drift, jump or brush yourself against a received Power Play, the gauge fills in two tiers, impacting the grandeur of what's happening on screen. Once the first is filled, it can be used (key A on the pad) in conjunction with the appearance of a special light blue icon at the head of one or more cars preceding the player. At this point the fun begins, with exploding trucks, falling pylons, entire bridges that give way, to get to boulders literally spit out of the mountain or entire structures that collapse, closing some passages. Things get even more complicated and exciting using the second level Power Play (key B), which obviously needs twice as long to be available, but which in this case changes entire pieces of the scenario in a permanent and radical way, overwhelming and destroying everything inside and thus creating new deviations. Among the most striking examples we have the urban center, where a huge tower falls, collapsing numerous buildings and creating a new path inside it, made up of sides in flames and continuous jumps, or the track in the canyon, where the dam can be made blown up causing part of the mountain to collapse, activating alarms and creating a path inside the mountain itself, with a suggestive waterfall on the pown left. The result is incredible from a graphic and scenographic point of view, spectacular especially the first few times, but also interesting for gameplay purposes, because in Split/Second: Velocity you can have as clean a guide as you want, but it is much more important to memorize the points configuration where you can use the Power Play, and keep your bar to hit in the best moments, especially when the race is coming to an end. Where therefore the driving model is quite simple to learn and does not require much skill to be assimilated to perfection, the races become strategic in choosing how to accumulate and when to spend the Power Play, in avoiding as many enemy attacks as possible and exploiting the car that best suits your driving style. Xbox 360 goals Split/Second: Velocity offers 46 objectives, of which 18 are secret. The simpler ones involve the completion of all the episodes or the arrival in first position in the bonus events and in the elite races, the slightly more specific ones instead are linked to the destruction of 1000 opponents thanks to the Power Play, to stay in flight for a total duration of 5 minutes and so on. There are also some related to multiplayer, where you have to beat better ranked opponents or reach number 1 on your body shop with victories. I'll make you a sheet like this In fact, beyond the 12 tracks available, some of which share the same setting but a different section of the scenario, each car among the initial and then unlocked ones is characterized by four different parameters, speed, drift, resistance and acceleration, which precisely determine its speed of filling the Power Play bar, the resistance to shocks and when you are touched by explosions and so on, where one rather than another is indicated for each type of event. The strategic component of knowing the track and using the Power Play is positively reflected in the multiplayer races, which include 3 modes, race, elimination and survival (we'll explain them in a few lines) and the classic open game, by invitation and Xbox Live Party, whose maximum number goes perfectly with the cars on the track. Also interesting is the presence of the split screen, adjustable between vertical and horizontal, which is decidedly not obvious these days and definitely appreciable. To indicate your level, the race number placed on the car takes care of it, which starts from 99 and reaches 1 as you win competitions, while the stickers arranged throughout the bodywork represent the objectives unlocked during the course of the game. The online races therefore materialize in a tussle made up of explosions and continuous reversals in front, in adrenaline-pumping situations in which even when you are first with a good advantage you are never calm, because at any moment a one could fall on your head ship rather than a wave of clanging boulders. There is a but, however, and it is represented by the fact that whoever is in first position, beyond activating some shortcuts with the first level Power Play, has no means of countering the return of the opponents and therefore must be perfect in driving clean and in avoiding all Power Plays that are triggered against him. If, for example, this thing happens near the end of the race, even after leading it entirely to first position, there's no way to take back the lead, leaving everything somewhat to chance. In reality, precisely in multiplayer this problem is mitigated by the extreme variability of one's opponents, but instead becomes quite evident in the single player, where the opposing cars are always calibrated on the basis of the one chosen by the player, and when you are first, even driving perfectly and without ever leaving the track, after a certain amount of time you are inevitably caught up by the drivers who are behind, which sometimes becomes frustrating when you lose the race and are powerless to counter the return of your opponents in any way. Therefore, if the game is based more on using the Power Play correctly rather than on driving perfectly, it is undeniable that in the single player there is some balancing problem, and therefore it is enough to repeat the same race several times to get the better of it. despite perhaps having done the first two laps in the back positions and then having primed some excellent Power Plays in the last one. The structure of the single player also lacks linearity and a not exceptional duration, even if the other types of events that provide for the Elimination will take care of fleshing out the variation, where every few seconds the last ofposition is eliminated, survival, where you have to get a pre-set score by overcoming some trucks that act as temporal checkpoints and that drop explosive barrels or that slow down the player, Air Assault, where instead you have to avoid missiles dropped by a helicopter that follows the player, having three lives available and also in this case with a score to reach, and finally Aerial Revenge, where instead of avoiding the above missiles it is possible to increase the Power Play bar and then perform a counterattack on the helicopter itself, in order to destroy it . We have not forgotten the technical sector, which definitely does justice to everything that happens on the screen, with visually spectacular explosions and deformations of the scenario, a fluidity anchored to 30 frames per second and a generally satisfactory graphic impact, made of bright colors (we like to call them Sega colors) and lots of detail. There is perhaps an excessive use of blur, which does not always make the next corner to be tackled clear (it is no coincidence that there are large yellow signs on the edge of the track) and which mitigates a minimum the sense of speed, in any case higher than what has been seen in the recently released demo.", "date": "2010-05-19", "grade": "8.8"}
