In reality, in this case the two heroes are not alone, but rather are accompanied by a multitude of more or less well-known characters who come from different eras of the universe created by Tolkien: an aspect that will certainly make lore fundamentalists shiver. but which on the other hand is completely functional to an RPG-style gameplay that focuses precisely on recruiting and evolving one's warriors to deploy them against Sauron's armies. The land of meh-zzo Let's immediately clear the field of potential misunderstandings by specifying that Middle-earth: Shadow of War is not a companion app and consequently does not lead to unlocking content or rewards in the title for consoles and PC: instead it is a game in its own right , which with its older brother practically shares only the setting and some nuances of the much praised Nemesis System. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, we are talking about a product that draws elements from the categories of strategic and role-playing games, declining them in a simplified formula that is not exactly new in the mobile sector. The user is therefore called to compose a party of four heroes and then see them cross a scenario linearly, autonomously attacking the hordes of enemies that appear in front of them: the more strictly playful part is limited to eventually deciding which opponent to concentrate forces on and to determine when to use each warrior's special move, but these are such marginal elements that an option allows you to delegate even these few functions to artificial intelligence. From these premises, it is clear that Middle-earth: Shadow of War is one of those titles in which the action proper is almost absent, with the gameplay that is 100% concentrated in party and resource management. In this sense, the Warner Bros. product boasts an amount of content that is impossible to describe in detail in a single review without being boring and didactic. Suffice it to say that most of the time spent with the application ends up being spent in menus related to upgrading the heroes at your disposal or their individual skills, obtaining new team members, unpacking various prizes and rewards and supervision of the territories wrested from Sauron's lieutenants. Nothing excessively complex or deep, but still a good pile of stuff on which to make great taps: this in a nutshell is what Middle-earth: Shadow of War offers, which as it is free to play constantly tries to monetize the needs of the player, given that basically each upgrade requires the disbursement of gems, skill points, runes and many (too many) other resources that can be purchased very easily from the appropriate in-game shop and vice versa, which are very tiring to obtain on the battlefield. A formula that apparently continues to find the approval of the mobile public, given the continuous proliferation of products with these same basic mechanics, but which we can only stigmatize here, considering how little gameplay there is under this enormous blanket of tricks that have little or nothing to do with the original video game concept. In Middle-earth: Shadow of War one can also object to an all too bland revival of the Nemesis System: the hierarchical scale of the orcs is little more than a tinsel to divide the different stages, and the decision to eliminate or subjugate the lieutenants defeated has quite negligible consequences in the continuation of the adventure. Even the technical realization does not excite, with a clear tendency to repetitiveness and recycling of elements that involves both graphics and sound. If all the potentially negative aspects listed so far weren't considered too serious by the reader, Middle-earth: Shadow of War can still represent a valid download thanks above all to the amount of content it is able to offer: in addition to the wide section of purchasing and upgrading the characters we have already mentioned, the game presents a wide range of possibilities in addition to the campaign, including special events, daily and weekly assignments, missions reserved for high-ranking players and so on.", "date": "2017-10-07", "grade": "6.7"}
