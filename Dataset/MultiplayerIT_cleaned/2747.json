{"name": "Cyberpunk 2077", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cyberpunk-2077-recensione.html", "text": "We have to admit it: spending just under a week with the new, desired work of CD Projekt has exhausted us, almost consumed us, as it hasn't happened since the days of working on other mammoth titles to have to dissect with prohibitive times (someone said Rockstar?). But, at the same time, this fatigue generated by the dozens of hours spent in the streets of Night City has left us with great satisfaction: it's a bit like when we are about to fall asleep after a day of intense study or work, perhaps culminating with a night out with friends or partner. Here, the sensations we are experiencing right now, as we jot down the first lines of the article you are reading, are exactly these: tiredness, satisfaction, pleasure, drowsiness. Writing the review of Cyberpunk 2077 is a kind of cathartic moment that one experiences when a cycle of one's life ends. And the guys from CD Projekt probably also experienced this moment of relief when they realized that they had finally completed their life project. A bet, a real all in which, after the success generated by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and related expansions, the entire video game industry expected from this small, great development team which, in the end, still succeeds to consider itself an indie despite the numbers and the economic entity of its productions, are typical of the large software houses controlled and managed by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Bet won, we absolutely feel like saying, not without some mishaps and a few jolts here and there, but what counts is always the result. And as we will see in the review Cyberpunk 2077 is here to stay and amaze and, we already want to say it, to demonstrate how it is easily possible to render the next-gen on TV and monitor with current platforms. History We already say it at the beginning of the paragraph: you will not find any type of spoiler here or in the rest of the review since we will limit ourselves to explaining to you the structure adopted by CD Projekt to tell the story of Cyberpunk 2077, leaving some of our considerations at the bottom . We have come to know the key elements in these years of announcements and trailers: we take on the role of V, a mercenary thief who wants at all costs to make a name for himself in Night City, but who finds himself involved, against his will, in the theft of an experimental biochip whose value is immeasurable. Imprinted on this piece of technology that everyone is eagerly trying to salvage is the afterimage of Johnny Silverhand, bold and ruthless rocker who spent the last few years of his life trying to fight and subvert the order established by the mega -corporations. How these 2 figures will interact and what their fate will be, we will decide during our personal game of Cyberpunk 2077. In fact, as per CD Projekt tradition, this new project also aims to launch the player into a living, pulsating world that goes forward regardless of the player's actions, but which in turn is influenced and shaped according to these actions until it reaches certain results. The goal of the development team has always been to weave a dense network of (invisible) choices to be offered to the player and whose consequences, often complex to imagine or predict, are never immediately perceptible, but have medium and long-term results period. Much of these choices occur through the selection of dialogues with which we will carry out our interpretation of the role. As already abundantly shown by the development team in the various videos, these are contextual multiple choice, sometimes with a time limit within which we will have to make our selection. Depending on our observation point, our skills in the statistics that define V and our historical background chosen from the 3 selectable during the character creation phase, we will have any additional dialogue options that will complement the optional ones to deepen the debate and the mandatory ones that will carry it forward. On many occasions we will be free to move away during the interaction, sometimes generating very serious results. Quests and side activities Cyberpunk 2077 takes a further step forward compared to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt by fracturing the typical dichotomy between main quests and secondary activities which, while always remaining well separated even in the on-screen indications, tend to have very blurred boundaries and generate continuous cross-references between them, so as to stimulate questions and evaluations in the player on how to carry on the story.a is quite linear and provides for a sort of prologue which is then divided into a series of long main strands until they rejoin near the epilogue, it is in the secondary activities that the work of the Polish team literally explodes. Already after a very few hours of play, opening the map will mean being hit by a cloud of yellow exclamation and question marks scattered across the 7 districts of Night City. The player will only be spoiled for choice and a certain disorientation in front of such a mass of content and, as if this weren't enough, the phone implanted in V's brain will be a whirlwind of calls and messages that will serve to offer continuous, new ideas for further quests and will allow us to improve our knowledge with the numerous sidekicks of the game. Taking into account that completing these missions will increase V's reputation level (which is different from the character level) and this will result in both better equipment accessible from vendors, but also more activities and assigned contracts. Next to the usual division between main and secondary quests , there will also be a handful of additional activities represented by the contracts that will be offered to us by the district fixers and which will usually concern the assassination or rescue of non-player characters or the recovery of data, and the random activities represented by the crimes that take place in the city and which are reported by the Night City Police Department. The fixers will always be the point of contact for the purchase of new cars useful for fleshing out our virtual garage and, of course, every single street in the city that never sleeps will be able to offer narrative cues and contemplative moments which, we guarantee, will be able to enrapture you . And then there are the supporting actors that you will get to know during your long adventure. If you are an orphan of Ciri, Triss and Yennefer, you can rest assured: in Cyberpunk 2077 you will fall in love again, cry and laugh, feel personally involved in the events of a handful of characters who will keep you company during your raids in Night City. And clearly we're not just talking about Keanu ~Johnny Silverhand~ Reeves who, paradoxically, while representing the spearhead of the entire production, is not the character that has remained in our heads the most. But don't take this as a penalty, because on the contrary it demonstrates how much the CD Projekt team of writers is able to outline and shape credible, multifaceted and empathetic characters from scratch, even when they don't have a known face. But if we really have to go to highlight the single negative element grafted into the narrative component of the game, the hook with the ~lightness~ of Silverhand can help us. Despite the constant presence and a couple of truly memorable moments, the presence of the character based on Keanu Reeves is struggling to really take flight and this has repercussions in a general consideration of the main quest: it is pleasant and we followed it with participation and gusto, but it sometimes appeared too frayed, in some cases even forced in some twists. Probably the need to close the very long series of plot threads developed in parallel and dependent on the player's choices led to the loss of thickness of the main story and the creation of an epilogue, the one we were able to witness, at times even one-armed. But it is clear that such a judgment must necessarily be suspended according to the style of play that everyone will adopt. We had to rush to write this review and in the 44 hours it took us to finish Cyberpunk 2077 (let's assume about fifteen hours dedicated to main quest), we have only managed to scratch the surface of the secondary activities, often remaining, but unfortunately not enough, entangled in truly splendid and visionary subplots that have often amazed us much more than the main quest. We don't want to go into details, once again, to avoid any form of spoiler and not spoil your taste for surprise, but really the material you'll find yourself seeing and playing will often be amazing. A first-person RPG We have said and reiterated it dozens of times in each of our articles and videos on the title: Cyberpunk 2077 is a completely single player first-person role-playing game; not a shooter nor an action with role-playing elements. It's a pure RPG, without any compromises and if some footage or statement may have made you think of a slightly deeper GTA, you are absolutely wrong. A much more valid reference, albeit with due care, is represented by the 2 most recent chapters of Deus Ex: HumanRevolution and Mankind Divided. However, compared to the games of Eidos Montreal, the work of CD Projekt is enormously more vast, complex, layered and above all it is based on an open world that is certainly closer to the works of Rockstar. Therefore, depending on your taste and your aspirations, you will be very free to choose how to impersonate your V and above all how to use it in battle. Apart from the freedom in managing the dialogues which, as is the tradition of the genre, will sometimes allow you to avoid encounters and fights, once in the heart of the action you can choose whether to behave like new Terminators, or whether to make the most of the shadow and hacking to play stealth. In both cases you will have a frighteningly deep degree of customization that does not disdain even bold compounds. You can therefore choose to specialize in the use of short or long barreled weapons, or in blades or, again, in explosives. Otherwise, you can invest your hard-earned talent points in proficiency in rapid hacking of opponents and environmental elements, perhaps alongside an increase in experience in stealth and keeping a cool head that allows you to be even more infallible in carrying out murders in sequence. Everything is absolutely allowed and everything is available to you without any kind of boundary or limitation imposed by the developer given the complete absence of classes or prerequisites to access certain skills, outside the level of the skill itself. Cyberpunk 2077 demonstrates its complexity practically immediately, as soon as you pass the narrative incipit linked to the selected background and a brief tutorial on combat, and this incredible depth without compromises and without great aids could also be unsettling for those who are not particularly accustomed to role-playing elements. You are not held by the hand or particularly guided and you experiment with statistics and skills at your own risk without very in-depth help or descriptions. Consider for example that there is no automatic assignment procedure for leveling up and the possibility of resetting one's statistics has a very high cost, which you can only afford in the advanced game. As for the feeling of the shootings, in Cyberpunk 2077 CD Projekt has managed to reach an absolutely excellent compromise: shooting is satisfying and the impact of the weapons is very distinct depending on the mouth of the fire we find ourselves holding. All this is combined with a passive cover system that will allow us to lean automatically near an obstacle when we switch to the viewfinder view. Unfortunately, the doubts we had expressed in the preview regarding the melee action have not been dispelled: the fights with white weapons, whether they are blunt, sharp or linked to cyberware grafted on the arms, are very light and often lack feedback shots, as well as highlighting a whole series of problems relating to the reactions of the artificial intelligence and the residual dirt of the animations which, especially at close range and during the most agitated situations, hit the player like punches in the eye, for stay on topic. In addition, despite having really appreciated this total freedom of action, further enhanced by a wide level design, full of verticality and particularly successful in terms of the possibility of approaching the target, we had to deal with some problems relating to the balancing of the difficulty level probably caused precisely by this wide variability. We faced Cyberpunk 2077 on the difficult level, the third of the 4 available and we managed to continue with a correct degree of challenge for most of the journey, except to remain sometimes dazed by very difficult boss fights because perhaps we had not specialized in the best way V. Just as we found ourselves retrying dozens of times some secondary activities classified with the moderate degree (a sort of ~normal~ level of the difficulty of the quests). And the result, in these cases, is annoying frustration. Attributes and skills We could not help but dedicate an entire paragraph to the pure and profound role-playing component of Cyberpunk 2077. The customization of V clearly starts from the definition of his physical appearance. We will be able to create an avatar with a male or female build, but then independently choose the tone of voice and the genitals, but not the size of the breasts which remains a prerogative of the female body. The system allows you to modify, through an enormous series of presets, practically any aspect of the face and of the whole u", "date": "2020-12-07", "grade": "9.4"}
