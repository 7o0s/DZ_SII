{"name": "MicroMachines V4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/micromachines-v4.html", "text": "Oatmeal and pool tables MicroMachines is what can be defined as a decidedly atypical racing game: within miniature courses, a series of machines challenge each other using all sorts of improprieties in order to reach the finish line first. However, the game structure is not as simple as we want to present it, MicroMachines, although it may seem a trivial game where you drive small cars, offers a quantity of decidedly original and fun ideas. The main mode of the game is that represented by the single player, where according to a subdivision that goes from beginner to expert, the player will have to participate and win in a series of competitions with precise objectives that go from scoring points by distancing the opponent by one screen (in moment in which the leading player stands at one end of the game screen, and the other on the opposite side, earns a point), passing the achievement of first place after three laps, up to special time attacks and destruction races . Each difficulty category has a number of four races to be won in order to obtain qualification for the next one, at the end of each path victoriously passed the player will be rewarded with some cars as a gift, which can be used later in the game and in extra modes compared to the single player . Throughout the game, there will be 750 cars to be unlocked, strictly divided by category, whose collection can also be completed through an exchange system between players. In addition to the single player mode, MicroMachines makes use of the classic multiplayer, usable both with the classic 2-4 player mode and in shared control mode (yet another trademark of the series) in which four players can participate in a game playing with only two pads, letting each player hold half of the controller to drive his vehicle (one player steers with the directional cross and the other uses the keys to turn), with decidedly hilarious results. The count of the proposed modes is concluded by an intelligent but extremely limited track editor, in which the player will be given the possibility to choose the setting in which to work and in which he will simply click on a series of junction points to create a closed path ; a whole series of upgrades and weapons can also be added to the track to be scattered along the way, selectable thanks to a convenient drop-down menu. The tracks created will obviously be saved on memory cards, so you can use them for challenges to the death with your friends. Another way to get new tracks is to connect the PSP version of MicroMachines to the Ps2 one via USB and download new tracks (the fact remains that the PSP and Ps2 versions are almost identical). Things that go Boom. Driving a MicroMachines may be a simple job on paper, but in reality it turns into a complex experience when you are transported in the middle of a race with three other cars driving like crazy in a constant attempt to get rid of some opponents . In fact, during the race it will be possible to collect and use a whole series of special objects useful both for healing and for attacking one's opponents, thus making them useless and slow wrecks: it will be possible to collect large hammers that will be mounted right on top of the machine, electric shocks, missiles, plasma guns and dice bombs; everything will be allowed in order to achieve the final victory. One of the distinctive features of MicroMachines has always been the level design: imagine being a child again for a couple of hours and having a house all to yourself and a series of small cars to compete with each other, what better way than build bizarre paths derived from the environment around us? And this is how the MicroMachines courses are born: crazy races between the kitchen stoves in an attempt to avoid the spoons scattered around the track, always keeping an eye on the trail of cereals that marks the exact route; paths built among the bricolage tools, in the home garden among the frogs, in the bathroom on the edge of a tub, at school doing tightrope on not too stable rulers. This is the world of MicroMachines, it can be anywhere, just as children always find space to imagine crazy races with their toy cars wherever they are. Things that go Boom. Although MicroMachinesV4 ideally remains the direct evolution of the chapters developed for 16bit, the world of video games has changed and unfortunately this change also weighs on a title of this kind: the classic view above the machines has disappeared to make way for thissomething more evolved and which dynamically follows the player's car from behind, and with the camera the whole childish vein inspired by cartoons so apt in the first chapters has also disappeared, the sense of the toy has disappeared to make way for something more advanced technically but several miles away from what the MicroMachines represent. Graphically the game is impeccable, the level design is inspired and of excellent workmanship but in stark contrast to the total anonymity of the fleet which, in an attempt to make it huge, has in fact detached itself from the true spirit of the series. This is probably the chapter that at the same time distances itself the most from the series and still manages to represent a good racing game, fun, long-lived and well done. The fact remains that V4 completely distorts the concept of MicroMachines, creating a cross between what it once was and a racing game. In some respects there is therefore to be hoped for a return to the origins, especially as regards the fleet, never so exaggeratedly large and useless as in this chapter. Pros: Long-lived and fun Excellent camera Definitely varied Cons: Has little to do with MicroMachines Very limited editor Too many cars and too much confusion in their management It was the last years of the 1980s when the MicroMachines made their first appearance on the market, toy cars that perfectly replicated their real counterparts and which soon drove an entire generation of children and teenagers crazy. From this lucky brand was born a videogame for 8bit consoles that was almost ignored, the opposite fate was instead reserved for the two sequels on 16bit that with MicroMachines and MicroMachines2: Turbo edition had great success until becoming one of the cult videogames of an era. The cartoonish graphics, the bizarre characters, the absolutely out of the ordinary tracks and the strange game setting made MicroMachines immortal which, ironically, has been fighting with that uncomfortable comparison ever since. Just over ten years have passed since the releases on SNES and MegaDrive, MicroMachines has evolved, it has passed through two generations of gaming platforms and has changed its graphic style, but has remained firm on its main cornerstones such as fun and immediacy. So warm up the engines and place the cereals along the way, MicroMachines V4 is finally here!", "date": "2006-08-09", "grade": null}
