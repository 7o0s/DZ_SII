{"name": "Maths Play: Divertiti con i numeri - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maths-play-divertiti-con-i-numeri-recensione.html", "text": "The ~brain~ puzzle game genre has been enjoying enormous success for some time now, especially among casual players: Brain Training is still in the top ten best-selling titles for the Nintendo DS, so it is logical that many developers have started to do a bit of research in the sector to figure out how to fit into it. Alongside the more classic choices, i.e. clone products, we find titles with their own identity. In the case of Maths Play: Have fun with numbers, the matter is even simpler, given that to date it is the only purely ~mathematical~ video game for the dual-screen portable console. Making its debut in Europe, the title developed by Natsume is already quite well known in Japan. The numbers of Maths Play The numerical quizzes present, for example, in Brain Training were undoubtedly fun and engaging, apart from the small detail of having to write the numbers in a certain way, otherwise the inputs would not be recognized. In Maths Play the problem does not arise since we won't have to use the stylus to write but only to select and drag the numbers to form equations. After creating a profile (there are four slots available), we will be able to access one of the four game modes available: ~Create~, ~Shuffle~, ~Match~ and ~Nine~. The ~Create~ mode consists in composing equations using the numbers supplied from time to time, which appear printed on the cards. Using the stylus we will have to move these cards in the right way, transforming one of them into the ~=~ symbol. The details of the match are decided beforehand: level of difficulty, possible time limit, etc. During the game you have to get a certain number of results right, then you automatically move to the next difficulty level. As you go along, the numbers to work with multiply and therefore it becomes more complicated to ~fit~ them in the right way. Furthermore, in some cases, the game will ask us to modify the equation in an alternative way... in the ~Shuffle~ mode you have to compose equations and ~fit~ them on a board starting from the result already present. If you don't have any useful cards available, you can draw one or you can simply pass the hand to the CPU. After a while we will see textures being drawn on the board, formed precisely by the cards that we have placed on them. It's a challenge, so we'll have to carefully weigh our moves as things get more difficult. Equations galore The ~Coincide~ mode is the one characterized by the most ~open~ rules: starting from a card that is already present, you have to exhaust those in your hand before your opponent. To do this, we will be able to compose an equation with respect to the number already present, put a card of the same color or simply of the same number. Also in this case we will be able to draw a card if we don't have any useful ones, however risking losing since the aim is precisely to finish the deck. If the drawn card does not solve any problems for us, we will be forced to fold and wait for the CPU to move. Unfortunately it is not possible to count cards, as in poker, because simply in Maths Play there is no end of cards. Finally, the ~Nine~ mode is a kind of blackjack in which we have to compose an equation that comes close to nine but does not exceed it. Between us and our opponent, the one who comes closest to that figure wins, but without exceeding it. Succeeding in the enterprise can be more or less difficult depending on the cards we find ourselves at the start, so there is a random element not to be overlooked. All modes can be played via the Nintendo DS wireless multiplayer, up to four participants: if you manage to find three other math enthusiasts, really interesting challenges can emerge, with an atmosphere similar to that of the most famous board games . Technical realization As a rule, products of this genre rely on elements other than graphics or sound to win over the players. Maths Play only confirms this rule, with a technical aspect purely functional to the action: a funny character appears on the upper screen who controls what we do, exulting when we solve the equations, but has neither a phantasmagoric design nor animation . The lower screen is occupied by the cards, which we can move at random and which remain there, without any magnetic function to align them, waiting for the next step. At least they are always legible. The sound sector is also extremely simple, and is based on some sometimes unnerving music and rare effects. The control system sees the use of only the stylus and the touch screen to perform all operations, and neThe complex performs very well, resulting always ready and precise. Comment The idea behind Maths Play: Have Fun with Numbers isn't a bad one, after all the number quizzes featured in various other brain trainers are always fun to play. The problem here is that there are only four modes, none of which feel particularly inspired, and there's never a variation on a theme. You compose equations more and more difficult, that's it. Even the level of difficulty can be adjusted manually, so it's all in the player's hands, in a sort of ~discharge of responsibility~ with a bitter taste. In short, we are faced with a product that could only conquer math enthusiasts, but even they could easily give up in the face of the extreme linearity of the action. Pros: The only title of its kind on the DS Interesting multiplayer mode Four game modes... Cons: ...but boredom reigns supreme Gameplay for its own sake Technically mediocre", "date": "2008-04-15", "grade": null}
