A gigantic group of fans, young and old, who collect old and new toys, for starters. A couple of recent worthy animated series and at least one comic series each that IDW has been successfully publishing for years. Another thing they have in common is the producer of their latest film adaptations: Michael Bay, the maniac of big-screen explosions who brought them with success - of the box office, certainly not of the critics - in all the theaters of the world. We'd like to say that they also share the developer of their latest video game tie-ins, but that wouldn't be entirely accurate: the company that dealt with it is still PlatinumGames, but it was the Metal Gear Rising team who worked on the action game dedicated to the Transformers last year. The fact that the Japanese developer famous for its action titles was dealing with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had put a huge smile on fans, but when it turned out that the team in question was the same team that signed the mediocre The Legend of Korra of 2014, a shadow of apprehension fell like a shroud over the entire project. And as we have seen, the skeptics were absolutely right. The legendary Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles deserved a much better game than Mutants in Manhattan Heroes in a half game In the interview that we published a couple of days ago, the director of Mutants in Manhattan, Eiro Shirahama, admitted that developing the game was not easy and that the story and the code had to be written and rewritten in more than one occasion. Having completed the adventure in barely five hours, we can say that we have noticed it. It is clear that someone who gets his hands on the script is someone who knows the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles well by trade: Tom Waltz, the writer of the popular IDW comic series who has conquered both old and new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans in recent years. The four mutant brothers of the video game are an amalgam of all their cinematic, comic and cartoon counterparts, faithful to the tradition that has made at least three generations fall in love with them. Leonardo is always the calm and wise leader of the quartet, Raphael is a grumpy hothead, Donatello is the nerd of the situation with a soft spot for the beautiful April O'Neal and Michelangelo is the court jester, fortunately less pushy than we feared. As usual, it is thanks to the characterization of the protagonists that the story, very banal and obvious, acquires a minimum of thickness: a wave of crimes is going through New York, and our people have to hunt down their historical enemies to find out what they are plotting. Shredder and General Kraang. In terms of gameplay, this translates into a list of missions which, after the first one and excluding the last three, the player can tackle in the order he prefers. Each stage is presided over by a boss, drawn directly from the mythology of the franchise: in addition to the inevitable Rocksteady and Bebop, the guys from PlatinumGames have lined up lesser-known faces such as Armaggon and Wingnut, as well as Karai, Slash and the aforementioned Clan leaders del Piede, for a total of nine stages set in the streets of Manhattan, in the sewers, on top of skyscrapers or inside the laboratories of the bad guys. Unfortunately their interventions are limited to a handful of jokes, as are those of April and the master Splinter, mere extras in some cinematic that introduces and concludes the various stages of the game. It goes without saying that those who buy a PlatinumGames title certainly don't do it for the story, but for the gameplay: that mix of frenetic action, technicality and spectacularity that has made the Japanese developer extremely popular. Sadly, Mutants in Manhattan fails on that front as well. Chaos reigns supreme It must be said that Eiro Shirahama and his programmers had an important intuition when they decided that it would be senseless to propose an action game under this license in which you can control only one Turtle at a time: therefore the gameplay deploys the four brothers simultaneously , entrusting one to the player and the other three to as many users or artificial intelligence. In this sense, it is clear that Mutants in Manhattan has been thought of as a kind of modern Turtles in Time, a sophisticated but at the same time ~ignorant~ arcade beat'em up, almost a real thought harp. However, it is a concept that clashes quite a bit with the philosophy behind the PlatinumGames titles, in which technicality, timing and reflexes play a significant role. The control system, for example, wants to be intuitive but ends up writhing on itself: at the keys dedicated to the aWeak attacks, powerful ones and jumping are associated with a whole series of combinations with the backbones that allow you to throw the shurikens, to perform the four special moves assigned to each Turtle, to use objects and to change characters on the fly. It takes a few minutes to get used to the controls, but throughout the adventure you get the feeling that they are unintuitive and that they slow down the action, rather than promoting the frenzy. Even the dodge capable of triggering the traditional counterattacks has been rethought in a not exactly ingenious way: first of all, we can only dodge a certain number of times in a row, on pain of a few seconds of annoying stunning; moreover, the initial frame of the animation also acts as a parry and to actually dodge an attack, and inflict the powerful special counterattack, you have to press the key at the right time, a moment before the enemy really hits us. Here the donkey falls, because the action is too confused and chaotic: the camera of its own does not even help in lock-on and the other Turtles obscure the view with their combos and their special moves, preventing us from glimpsing with the right timing enemy animations. It is possible to order our companions to be a little less aggressive, but the general chaos confuses ideas and soon a certain inconsistency in the design of our own opponents also becomes evident: some go down with very few hits, others are too tough, and lethal stealth attacks, implemented with a certain clumsiness, are of little use since it is decidedly difficult to take targets by surprise. The icing on the cake, unfortunately, are the end-of-stage bosses, real sponges for the attacks that have often forced us to lower the difficulty level out of frustration. At times they reminded us of the bosses of the worst MMORPGs; often they remain motionless to shoot or carry out their telegraphed attacks in sequence, while the Turtles doggedly attack them without being able to make them waver. The player is therefore left at the mercy of their blows, especially when they drop below a certain percentage of health and become as lethal as they are unstoppable. If these clashes become a race to see who dies first, it is clear that something is wrong. Shut up, April! After a long, long wait we finally got to play multiplayer with three strangers, and in doing so we were able to see the best of Mutants in Manhattan: when you can coordinate with someone who controls the Turtles properly, without being stunned faced with the blows of the enemy, consuming the objects at the right time and using the support skills in the most appropriate way, the PlatinumGames title takes on a much greater depth. However, it remains a more unique than rare opportunity due to a decidedly limited user base, and this does not surprise us. We talked about the bosses and the combat system, but we left our doubts about the absolutely senseless structure of the stages for last. Each of them, in fact, is set in a restricted location where it is possible to roam within certain limits in search of collectibles to collect to unlock passive skills and upgrades in the Turtle Den. However, the exploration is interrupted several times by April's calls, who will assign us one random mission at a time: we will have to defeat a certain number of enemies, defuse bombs, transport a weapon from one point of the map to another and so on. saying. A few seconds of freedom flow between one mission and another, after which it starts again and, once a certain number of missions have been completed, you can finally face the boss and close the stage. It is a curious solution which, however, works very badly due to the silly repetitiveness of the objectives. Even just carrying an object, making sure that at least two Turtles are close enough to it to keep it suspended in mid-air, is a cumbersome operation, hampered by randomly appearing enemies and abstruse level design to say the least. Some stages, such as the sewers, are a succession of corridors to go through and manholes to open; others, like the rooftops in the Wingnut stage, force us to grapple with barely sketched platforming mechanics. The fifteen minutes or so of each stage never seem to pass and, what's worse, we have three attempts available: if we fail three times, even just the boss, we have to start all over again. At that point it's hard to imagine wanting to replay a stage just to earn a higher rating, but ironically that's all there is to do in Mutants in Manhattan once the stage is complete.na. Before sending you back to the commentary, it is appropriate to spend a few words on the technical sector of the game, which we tested in the PC version in maximum detail: on the granite frame rate but blocked at 30 frames per second there has been a lot of discussion these days, between news and analysis in-depth, and realistically it is a truly incomprehensible compromise if we consider the paucity of details, the bare and repetitive settings and the evidently cross-gen nature of the PlatinumGames title. Fortunately, it is counterbalanced by a good visual representation, ~dirty~ and clean at the right point, which strongly recalls the IDW Ninja Turtles comics both in proportions and in the appearance of the four heroes and their enemies. The Italian dubbing is unconvinced but passable, however we found the repetitive and generic musical tracks that accompany the action and, above all, the fights practically unbearable.", "date": "2016-05-27", "grade": "5.0"}
