Films, novels and TV series have told it many times and from different points of view, but often everything boils down to a simple distinction between the ethically correct jurist, guided by principles, mostly on the side of those who are right, and the The Devil's Advocate. Playing a prosecutor in a game can't help but instantly remember the chapters of Ace Attorney, but Devil's Attorney for iOS has very little to do with the Capcom series. Unlike Phoenix Wright, Max McMann is a lawyer who uses dialectics and his charm to stylishly crush and humiliate his opponents in the courtroom, but he is also one who carefully selects his clientele, agreeing only to help people who are clearly guilty of some crimes: from those who have been seen walking around naked in public to those who have been caught peddling illegal substances, then arriving at more hilarious cases, such as the one who, found in possession of explosives, justified himself by saying that ~they were in self-defense~ . In short, the crme de la crme. Better call Saul! The difference between Ace Attorney and Devil's Attorney is not only in the part where the player is deployed, but in the whole mechanics with which cases are solved. Once you enter your office and choose the case to deal with, you immediately move on to the confrontation between the parties in the presence of the judge, but not before a brief exchange between the prosecution and the defense attorney. Thanks to the enormous humor of the dialogues and Max's ability to embarrass his opponents, these curtains represent one of the most successful elements of the game created by the authors of Dark Nebula, and it is precisely in these moments that the protagonist's personality emerges , snooty, irritating but at the same time hilarious. The unfolding of the process instead takes place not through question and answer, presentation of evidence or with blows of ~Objection!~, but with a simple system of skills and turn-based action that leads it to resemble a mix of RPG and card-game. The player and his opponents begin the battle with a certain number of Credibility points, which are nothing but Health Points to be brought to zero to win the battle, while Action Points can be spent each turn to perform certain actions. These can be divided into several categories, ranging from direct attacks on rival lawyers to skills capable of neutralizing evidence or witnesses. In some cases it happens to find yourself in front of some support characters, able to enhance the characteristics of the other members of the group, perhaps by restoring Credibility points or increasing their attack strength. It is an extremely simple mechanic, but already after the first ~levels~ the challenges begin to become much more interesting, forcing the player to carefully plan his moves and guess what the opponent's response will be. Searching for the right move combination then becomes essential if you aim to beat your opponent within a certain number of rounds, necessary to get a cash bonus at the end of the level. Filling the piggy bank then allows you to buy furniture for your home or elegant clothes, all with the aim of enhancing the moves that can be used in the classroom or obtaining new ones through three different unlockable skill trees. Continuing his career as an defender of the guilty and champion of the corrupt, Max moves into new offices and apartments, while his relationships with the other lawyers continue to be deepened through the amusing dialogues between levels. Unfortunately, in the long run, the pungent jokes of the protagonist and a growth system based on small unlockable rewards are not enough to mask the repetitiveness of the mechanism, although the guys from 1337 Game Design close the curtain on the plot just before the challenge system in turns you become excessively hackneyed. Among the strengths of Devil's Attorney, however, remains its excellent presentation, thanks to a cartoon graphic style full of personality, a funny English dubbing and music that is a bit trite, but which in the end goes well with the goliardic atmosphere that permeates Max's career.", "date": "2012-11-01", "grade": "8.0"}
