Back home, we therefore installed the final version on our PlayStation 4 and set about testing all the modes and classes, studying new strategies and trying to understand how deep the rabbit hole could be. On the other hand, Laser League is certainly not the first game that was born with the idea of being or soon becoming a leading e-sport, also considering the enormous attention that the sector is receiving in these days. However, in order to establish itself, in addition to having a good game, another fundamental component is needed: an active and large community that populates the servers and makes the online experience smooth and without hitches. Laser League, thus immediately removing the tooth, has not yet apparently broken through among players and Steam statistics tell us that from the day of its launch to today, an average of 40 daily players fluctuate on PC servers, with peaks slightly exceeding 300 unit. How much is the fault of the game and how much of communication that is probably not adequate for this type of production? It's the first question we had to ask ourselves before writing this piece, trying to understand how much the quality of Laser League had influenced sales and if the media buzz had been up to the task. So what conclusions can you draw? Much more people play with toy cars We therefore made our memory travel back a few months up to the launch of Rocket League on PlayStation 4 which in terms of innovation and type of experience travels on the same tracks as Laser League. On the other hand, even in the Psyonix production the single-player component is completely missing and online you have to rely on a companion to be able to enjoy yourself to the fullest. However, the day the titles arrived on the virtual shelves, the two productions separated abruptly: Rocket League decided to embrace Sony by offering the public the opportunity to play it completely free, at least via PlayStation Plus, while Laser League arrives in stores at a price of 15 euros, already discounted to nine on Steam these days, perhaps a sign that market penetration has not lived up to expectations. Yet seeing this genre of completely online games fail is no longer such a rare event, so much so that not even Cliffy B's charisma managed to save Lawbreakers from its sad fate. But is such a difficult start and eventual failure really deserved? The answer is as simple as it is banal: no. Laser League is a fun title if played in cooperative, it is a production with an original, sophisticated and extremely stratified gameplay that can attract both novices and those looking for a title with perfectly calibrated mechanics and which also allows you to explode the real pro players. The title developed by Roll7 and produced by 505 Games is one of those games that take a few minutes to be assimilated, the classic ~easy to play hard to master~ in short, thanks above all to a control system based only on movements with the analog stick and a single key to activate special abilities. And that's all you need to know to start playing, so much so that the basic rules of the matches are understood as the futuristic stadiums that host the matches start to come to life. We're basically in 2150, and the future sport is eerily Tron-like, with energy walls frantically scurrying back and forth in an arena that must be avoided to escape a withering death. The objective of the players who make up the teams is obviously to try in any possible way, even with force, to throw the opponents through the energy barriers by resorting to every sneaky trick. Thus started the game we run in search of available nodes, small white pins that as soon as activated become deadly traps for opponents and barriers behind which players on our team can protect themselves. The nodes are then deactivated at regular intervals making the games extremely dynamic and fast, for a gameplay that works more than excellently. Fun, adrenaline-pumping and very strategic, Laser League really has nothing to envy to the other e-sports out there and the matches are not only extremely pleasant to play but also beautiful to see thanks to all these colored lights and substantially action tirelessly. Trophies PlayStation 4 Reaching platinum isn't such a simple feat, especially given that to get it you'll have to compete online in dozens of games. The Laser League Trophies thus reward the best players in the game, as well as obviously continuity by requiring you to participate in 50 online matches and emerge victorious. The experience for the various classes is obviously also contemplated, as well as the need to perform particular class shots during duels. Let's enable ourselves To complicate things a little, then different classes are brought in with their personal skills and two talents for each class that can further change the functionality of the special shots. There is a fair variety in the choice and if the solitary players will prefer to go with Blade to kill enemies instantly or Smash to throw opponents leaving them stunned, when playing in company the tactics can take on different nuances, becoming invulnerable with the class of the Ethereal, very useful for bringing fallen comrades back to life, or even using the Thief to steal the nodes already conquered by the enemy team and turn them into barriers for our team. Thus laser League becomes a game of coordination, where the classes are skilfully mixed to cover each other's weaknesses in a continuous and exciting tug-of-war that brings tempers to heat up in a very short time. In short, everything works really well enough to be able to turn a blind eye to the main problems of the title. For example, stadiums host pre-established teams, without the possibility of being able to choose your favorite team or color before the matches, also the result of the choice of wanting to exclude any single player mode that contemplates some mini-league with pre-existing teams. Laser League therefore throws everything online, essentially only with a game mode for four or six players, leaving the 4 against 4 to a possible future patch. Going online, however, has the biggest shock, due precisely to the scarcity of players currently on the servers. Level differences are often ignored to favor speed in matchmaking, a predictable situation but which still makes the experience unbalanced, frustrating novice players and making access to online competitions almost prohibitive. There is another big point against and that is the presence of bots guided by artificial intelligence in the free slots of ranked matches, which are often a handicap that should not be underestimated for those who find them in the team. Once again we are talking about a choice dictated by the need to make matchmaking work even without players, a fault of the populousness of the servers rather than a real defect of the game.", "date": "2018-05-14", "grade": "8.0"}
