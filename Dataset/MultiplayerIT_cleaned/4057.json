It was more or less 1989 when SimCity reached the Super Nintendo: although it might seem the most distant production possible from the console standards, Will Wright's creature managed to conquer an important space in that strange territory, between Mario and Zelda. On the other hand, it was an era in which the boundaries between PC and console were much clearer than now but there was also a certain ruthlessness, which had allowed even a few years earlier Maniac Mansion to reach the NES and in the conversions also put a certain flair to try to make each version somehow unique. Playing Cities: Skylines precisely that strange but spot-on conversion comes to mind, for reasons of conceptual proximity but also realizing how things are very different today. Also in this case we are dealing with a city builder born in the depths of the PC panorama, as a project designed to offer a reasoned and complex alternative in the context of a genre that currently does not have an enormous amount of valid choices, and which has reached a console, however, rather distant from the original atmospheres of the project, although Nintendo Switch is now demonstrating a truly remarkable versatility. Like SNES at the time, here too it is a question of adapting an interface designed for a completely different type of use, on a console made to be used with analog sticks and a limited amount of keys, but in this case the porting is the son of modern times, in which the game tends to remain substantially the same from one platform to another, running into some inevitable - and unfortunately evident - compromise. The demiurge mayor We've covered Cities: Skylines on several occasions at this point, so you can find more in-depth analysis of it in the PC review and Xbox One Edition review, with more specific descriptions of how it works. The Nintendo Switch version belongs in all respects to that of the Microsoft console, from which the adaptation of the interface also derives entirely, with an obvious change of keys but essentially following the same logic. In terms of content, in this case we also find the first two expansions released integrated with the original elements: After Dark, which proposes the day-night cycle and therefore allows for a more complete representation of the city over 24 hours (virtual ), with urban activities that vary according to the different phases of the day and the Snowfall pack that introduces some winter environments, themed weather events and some variations in terms of public transport such as the management of trams. Therefore, various other packages released later on PC such as Natural Disaster, Mass Transit and Green City remain out, at least for the moment. The basic equipment on Nintendo Switch therefore allows you to build your own city on fifteen different terrains, some of which are of the ~glacial~ type, which lead to very different urban styles and solutions also based on the different resources that we find there, therefore the variety it is however ensured, even if the quantity and complexity of different choices present on PC are not reached, which can count both on a greater number of DLCs and on the fundamental support for mods, absent in the console versions. The basic game is all there, in a conversion that didn't want to leave out practically anything, in defiance of the ideas of differentiation between the supposed tastes of the console audience compared to the PC one: Cities: Skylines on Nintendo Switch is the same city builder which was widely appreciated in the original version, with the same complexity and depth, its great balance and its gradual introduction into the deeper mechanics. Inevitable compromises The main problem in wanting to bring a city builder to the console and in wanting to do so, as in this case, without sacrificing any aspect of the game mechanics and thus proposing the complete experience, is represented by the interface. This was a bit the weak point of the previous Xbox One version and it is identical, if not slightly worse, on Nintendo Switch: the solutions adopted for the controls are the same and in the options there are also numerous possibilities to customize them and modify various aspects such as sensitivity and axes, but it is clear that there is nothing comparable to the mouse for a game of this genre. Cities: Skylines requires quite precise planning in certain cases, in particular per as regards roads, electrical and hydraulic lines or transport systems and these are inevitably awkward to draw with the analog sticks. Strangely, the developers have also completely avoided using the Nintendo Switch touch screen, which instead could have been particularly useful in reproducing a mouse-like experience but evidently the interface reorganization work would have been too complex to deal with. The console's tiny analog sticks can take a toll on gamers' patience, something that partially improves with use of the Pro Controller but never fully resolves. Another problem, this one more specific to the Switch version even compared to the other consoles, is given by the performance of the game. Cities Skylines makes the classic resolution upgrade if played on TV but in any case the frame-rate drops are quite the order of the day, especially when the cities begin to be particularly complex and the zoom is maxed out. It is not a problem that affects the use of the game, also given the genre it belongs to, but it can still disturb the desire to follow one's creation in detail. Paradoxically, the issue seems to be less noticeable with the game in the portable version, given that the reduction in resolution seems to benefit fluidity although the loss of detail is also quite evident. Cities: Skylines is available in various languages but at the moment there is still no support for Italian.", "date": "2018-09-18", "grade": "8.2"}
