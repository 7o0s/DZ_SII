{"name": "Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-bandicoot-nitro-kart.html", "text": "A sequel to the uninspiring Crash Racing, Nitro Kart follows the fundamental dictates of this particular branch of racing games to heart: the Vivendi product therefore offers an exquisitely arcade gameplay, with cars that ignore the common laws of physics and launch themselves on decidedly unconventional tracks full of boosts and bonuses to collect. Nothing new under the sun could be said, and in fact Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart certainly doesn't deserve an award for innovation: but the work done by the developers, although confined within well-known schemes, is still noteworthy. The first striking aspect of the Vivendi Games Mobile production is the good amount of playable material: in addition to a tournament consisting of four cups (in turn containing as many races), the title offers an interesting Challenge mode, which requires you to complete specific objectives in order to get Wumpas to use as a bargaining chip for the purchase of new karts. Even if the unlockable material is not particularly attractive (the extra vehicles do not differ much from the standard ones), Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart is still a racing game that works to keep the user busy. An aspect to which the good workmanship of the action on the track obviously also contributes, first of all facilitated by a control system that is nothing short of friendly: acceleration is automatic, and you only have to worry about steering, braking, using the various power-ups and jump to avoid some obstacle. All of this is decidedly pleasant, also thanks to the good design of the various tracks and the fair level of challenge, demanding but almost never frustrating. Also noteworthy are the upgrades available along the way: ranging from classic elements such as rockets and shields to real transformations of your kart, capable of briefly becoming a jet or a very powerful monster truck as soon as you collect all the letters forming the word CRASH. Certainly the Vivendi Games Mobile production is not without defects, which however we can easily catalog in the list of venal sins: in this sense, a sometimes excessive pop-up should be mentioned, which can cause some difficulty in understanding the orientation of the track. Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart also benefits from a respectable technical realization, starting with the in-game graphics, clean, colorful and with a decidedly fluid frame rate despite the six cars in the race. The variety of settings that host the races is also excellent, which can be held indifferently in a mysterious cave as well as in the depths of the ocean. The roundup ends with the sound, which falls perfectly within the standards of current mobile productions. PRO Technically pleasing Simple and addictive gameplay Satisfactory arrangements AGAINST A few too many pop-ups Similar to many others", "date": "2008-05-07", "grade": "S.V."}
