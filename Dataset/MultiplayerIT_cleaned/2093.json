{"name": "L'Era Glaciale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lera-glaciale.html", "text": "A bit of history... Being based on a film, Ice Age can only have a plot equal to that of Disney's film work. The plot unfolds around four main characters, Manny, Sid, Diego and Scrat, engaged in a somewhat unusual mission for animals like them: to bring back a small boy named Roshan to the human camp through a thousand vicissitudes. In the game you play as Manny the Mammoth and Sid the Sloth. Manny's strength and Sid's speed will be the most effective weapons you will have to try to complete the various levels of the game. Characters! In the Ice Age you will therefore have to deal with a large group of friends made up of four cute animals and a child. It is therefore good to get to know them in order to be able to recognize them during the adventure. Let's start with Manny, a nice, very moody Mammoth who hides a heart of gold behind his grumpy and surly ways, then we have Sid, a dumb sloth who always combines a lot of trouble, then here is Diego, a sinister tiger with a dark face , Scrat a kind of prehistoric squirrel always intent on getting the nuts he is fond of and finally Roshan, a child separated from his family who will immediately become attached to the four nice friends. All together they will live this extravagant adventure that will further strengthen their friendship. A delicate mission! The aim of the game is to bring little Roshan back safely to the human camp. Your task will not be so simple as you will have to complete various missions that will involve the use of all your skills: you will have to solve puzzles, defeat very dangerous tigers and avoid wild prehistoric creatures that will try to hinder your path. In each level you will also have to deal with swarms of mosquitoes and porcupines, as well as bats that you can knock down with giant nuts. Even nature will not always be on your side by placing obstacles such as stalagmites, lava and thorny bushes. In the various game levels, try to collect all the nuts present; if you do so you will receive a golden nut at the end of each level and if you collect all the golden nuts at the end of the game you will receive a surprise. Remember that you can get extra nuts by shaking trees, breaking rocks or if you manage to hit Scrat who will drop them on the ground. Gameplay and Graphics The gameplay is easy and immediate. Depending on the character you will use, Manny or Sid, you will have to use certain keys. However in both cases the control will be precise and you will be able to perfectly execute the movements on the game screen. The graphics are enjoyable from the point of view of colors, with settings typical of Disney films. The colours, the light, the characters are an excellent combination of liveliness that is well suited to the adventurous atmosphere of the game which is aimed above all at pure fun rather than the exhausting search for an object or the spasmodic resolution of a puzzle. Ease and immediacy are the best ingredients for a game that marries action and adventure for a medium-thick videogame experience, but based on fun. You will be able to easily recognize all the protagonists of the film on the Advance screen, thanks also to the excellent work of the graphics who have developed copies of the characters very similar to their cinematic counterparts. Incidentally it is also difficult to mistake an Ice Age mammoth for a contemporary elephant or a saber-tusked tiger for a walrus! :) The adventure has already begun! The ~Ice Age~ film is already being screened in Italian cinemas where it is also having some success among the young and very young who have had the opportunity to see it.
