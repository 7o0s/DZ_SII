{"name": "Flight Simulator 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flight-simulator-2004.html", "text": "Flight school Before getting your hands on the controls of an antique or a million dollar jumbo, however, it is essential to learn to know and master all the controls of an airplane. From this point of view, SF2004 gives its best, and taking a look at the game menu, you are immediately faced with the first surprise: a real flight school, complete with instructors and manuals. Microsoft, in fact, made use of the collaboration of the King School, the most famous flight school in the United States, which boasts the motto: ~more than one pilot out of two comes from the King School~. The founders themselves, spouses John and Martha King, delight us with some introductory flight videos necessary to understand the basic behavior of an aircraft and the main commands. However, I must say that one of the videos annoyed me a bit, in fact at a certain point it stops to allow you to decide which device to drive with (joystick or keyboard) in order to avoid boring the player with double explanations, and so far no problem. However, if you choose joystick (as I think anyone interested in a product like FS2004 will do since airplanes are piloted with the joystick, not with a keyboard) and activate the related movie, John King ~excites~ us with a long and heartfelt description of the merits of the latest joystick produced by Microsoft; as if such advertising were needed... if we have chosen the joystick it means that we already have a joystick, otherwise we would have opted for the keyboard! Apart from this however, the brief introduction is useful for those who have never even tried any flight simulator, while it is little more than a diversion for everyone else. Immediately afterwards it is possible to take part in the actual lessons. The accelerated course that is made available to us consists of a series of test flights during which we will be taught in detail all the maneuvers and procedures necessary to fly first the classic Cessna and then increasingly larger and more important planes up to the mammoth Boeing 747. All this is preceded by a very rich and very detailed briefing and topped off in flight by the instructor's hands-free explanations on the use of the internal indicators and controls, the radio and the interpretation of the messages from the control towers. At this point, however, we are faced with the greatest flaw of FS2004: unfortunately the speech is entirely in English, and there is not even a trace of a subtitle. It therefore becomes necessary to know English really well (I read it effortlessly, but despite this I understood practically nothing) or sooner or later you will end up stuck during a lesson without knowing what to do, or how to do it correctly. The very long initial briefing itself turns out to be completely useless in these cases given that, precisely because it is so long, it is difficult to match what is written there with the little information understood by the instructor. Game or Simulation ? FS2004 manages to express a realism and precision that can only be fully appreciated by trying it. The 25 planes that can be flown represent a selection of the most famous civil aircraft that have flown the skies, and also include two helicopters (but I don't understand why there is no section on how to fly helicopters) and a seaplane that allows experience the thrill of landing in the sea. Each vehicle is reproduced with an almost maniacal precision both as regards the exterior and the cockpits, and this does not only apply to the control panel, given that it is possible to move the pilot's head and get to frame practically every corner of the cabin. The same level of realism can also be found for the reactions to the commands and for all those characteristics that make ~real~ flight very different from that of normal video games, such as GPS, communications with the various control towers, flight, the rules of approach and, to put it briefly, the ~traffic code~ of the air. The impressive number of controls available, however, dramatically increases the number of commands to be memorized and, even if the videos of Mr and Mrs King present in the learning center want us to believe that they are easy and intuitive to learn, it is still a few hundred commands, so much so that for some you get to combinations like Ctrl+Shift+Key because there are no more free ones. The problem worsens even more when in flight, since the summary scheme is far too concise, and to access the learning center again it is first necessary to save and abandon, and then reload, which in FS2004 is not exactly pleasant because long loading times.The world on 4 CDs Among the available options there is also the editor that allows you to create a personalized flight plan, choosing the airline, weather conditions and departure airport. Observing it, one is at least surprised by the figures indicated: 23,760 airports, 219 countries and 15,409 cities. These are numbers that are pure if you think of the immense amount of data that they represent only for what concerns the land. From this point of view, FS2004 is based on a rather tested system (a good way to say antediluvian) already seen in old glories such as the ever-green Strike Commander, which is now 10 years old. The principle is to use panoramic photos taken in flight as textures on the polygonal terrain, and then add three-dimensional buildings to enrich the whole. The effect is very pleasant at high altitudes, while from the ground it presents a very poor mix of blurs and details. It is also possible to choose the type of weather, including storms and blizzards, which has a violent impact on the behavior of the aircraft. However, the fact that the atmospheric events are represented only on a motionless plane is somewhat disconcerting, and that therefore by zooming in one obtains the ~employee cloud~ effect of Fantozzi's memory: that is, one gets the impression that the rain/ snow falls only on the camera, and not on other objects (see photo); likewise, despite a terrifying blizzard, both the ground and the buildings remain as clean as ever. Comment When you are faced with a product like Flight Simulator, the mistake that must be absolutely avoided is the all too natural one of comparing it to other video games. In fact, despite what is written on the first page as soon as it is started, it is a simulator, more than a game, and as such it should be considered, even if only for the large number of hours that must be used to learn all the commands. From this point of view, pure and simple simulation is a product of great value. It is precise, detailed and the flight school allows you to easily learn all the notions needed to fly an airplane, despite the significant language problem. Historical flights then considerably increase its longevity, even if they are often reduced very simply to take-off, to manual stabilization of the aircraft using the joystick calibration wheels in order to obtain an artificial automatic pilot, and to landing; in between you can conveniently turn off the monitor and go do something else, just remember to check the fuel once in a while (I've tried it and it really works, guaranteed!). However, we must remember that flying in reality is just that The same numbers indicated in the editor do not seem to be true. Just on a whim, I did a test to see if I could fly over my city and pass close to the two towers (if you don't understand which city I'm talking about, go back to school!!!). Well, I spent an hour wandering around like a vulture using the map to keep me in the right place, but not even the shadow of a city (and it's not that small...), let alone the towers. Perhaps the research of the details has been done more precisely with regard to the English-speaking countries, and in an approximate way for the others, the fact remains that it is an impressive amount of data. In terms of resources FS2004 is quite demanding. In fact, considering the fact that each flight is preloaded with times that normally exceed 30 seconds, 2.7Gb of installation is definitely too much, and it also tends to slow down even on mid-range machines. In the end, therefore, I would recommend Flight Simulator 2004 only to true enthusiasts of simulations for their own sake, while for those looking for a simple pastime they should probably think before buying. Pros: Realistic controls down to the last detail Extremely comprehensive flight school Historic flights Cons: Instructor language often incomprehensible to non-English speakers and no subtitles Horrible terrain detail at low altitudes Requires too many resources. 100 years of flight history As the title itself says, FS2004 comes out on the occasion of the centenary of the first flight, the historic and well-known one made by the Wright brothers thanks to their prototype made of wood, paper and canvas. In honor of an event of such importance, the player is given the opportunity to experience the same emotions again by retracing about twenty flights step by step which have contributed, each in its own way, to writing the history of aviation. We pass from the aforementioned first flight of the Wright brothers, to the transatlantic flight performed by Charles Lindberg aboard the Spirit of St. Louis, to various flights betweenncontinental cities such as London Cape Town and London Darwin (Australia) to name but a few. All the historical scenarios have been reproduced in minute detail, and this obviously includes the duration, with the result of guaranteeing the pilot hundreds of flight hours (in the truest sense of the word).", "date": "2003-09-23", "grade": null}
