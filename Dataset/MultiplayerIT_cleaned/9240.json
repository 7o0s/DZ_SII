The first Street Fighter and the games of the Versus series revolutionized virtual combat, and their validity is such as to have made them real cults that are still played today. Whether on home consoles or in the old cozy coin-operated arcade environment. However, the Japanese house has a dark side often not appreciated by fans: it goes down hard with DLC and alternative versions of its masterpieces. If on the one hand the fact that developers continuously release new goodies for their creations is undoubtedly a good thing, on the other hand the downloadable content formula is quite controversial and easily unleashes the ire of buyers, unwilling to pay extra money for content that they often perceive as due. Why did we bring up this topic? Simple, because today we are dealing with the umpteenth adaptation of the Capcom mother's title that has hit the most in recent years, namely Street Fighter 4. The eccentric Yoshinori Ono, in charge of the entire project, has in fact finally come out with Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition, his prodigal son's final lick, which is available both as a downloadable add-on from Xbox Live and PSN, and boxed for those who don't own the Super base. The DLC offers a general rebalancing of all fighters, making the game almost identical to that present in the cabinets, and four new characters. Are we in front of the definitive edition of one of the best fighting games ever or would the Arcade Edition have done well to stay in dear Yoshinori's personal cabinet? In Soviet Russia, Hadoken throws you! Let's face it once and for all, the background textures of the various Street Fighters are crap. It's not even the writers' fault, poor things. They desperately try to jot down two sensible lines every time, but it is a type of video game in which usually a bad guy with dark and enormous powers decides to conquer the world ... by organizing a fighting tournament. Objectively, running naked and covered in gazelle blood among a pride of hungry lions is a more sensible idea. For this reason, there are few fighting games with decent stories, and Capcom's titles are not part of this small group. The characters of the series, however, despite the poor quality of the events that see them as protagonists, have always stood out for their charisma and style. It is therefore not surprising that three of the four new levers introduced by the developers with the Arcade Edition are old acquaintances: Yun and Yang are Chinese twins masters of Kung Fu taken directly from Street Fighter 3rd Strike (whose return to HD is also expected soon) , Evil Ryu and Oni are the possessed versions of two of the most beloved characters in the saga. The first has often appeared in the games of the Japanese house and is a fan favorite, the second is in his first appearance, and others is nothing if not a variant of Akuma, now completely dominated and transformed by the evil energy of which before d 'now he had proved himself master. The fact that the ~novelties~ are two shoto (for the uninitiated, for ~shoto~ we indicate the characters who use the style of Ryu and Ken, equipped with Hadoken, Shoryuken and spinning kicks in flight) and two old glories could disappoint the aficionados, but some care has been taken in putting the last brushstrokes, and the newcomers are worth using. Balance is overrated Interviewed about the changes made to the balance, Yoshinori Ono said ~we unbalanced the title on purpose~. Keep in mind that when the brave Japanese producer is interviewed he often makes statements worthy of someone who has caught a powerful sunstroke, and that his speeches often need to be reinterpreted, or need external clarifications. This time the developers have seen fit to give the explanation, who have specified that they have ~unbalanced the gameplay~, but not making it a mess with two unbeatable characters and 30 useless, but by modifying moves and timing to favor the rushdown tactic (assault no holds barred from close range). To be exact, they've eliminated the shoto's ability to use their mid-air roundhouse kick to escape corners, generally weakened often defensively used characters such as E.Honda and Dhalsim, and buffed some of the more mistreated warriors who make melee their main weapon. Let's be clear, a casual player will most likely not notice the difference between trto Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition and its previous incarnation. To really understand the changes, you need to enter the mysterious dimension of hardcore gamers, a world populated by frames, FADCs, cross ups, Kara throws, and many other terminologies that would take a gazillion pages to explain. If you are one of those who eat bread and Tatsumaki for breakfast, the balances will be as clear as the sun for you, and the fact that not all of them have been made with criteria will also appear crystal clear to you. In fact, while the buffs to people like Makoto, T. Hawk and Dudley are sacrosanct and make fighters previously snubbed by everyone more competitive, other changes, such as the nerfs to Ibuki and Rose, don't seem to make much sense. To all this is added the overwhelming power of the three Chinese masters of Kung Fu: Fei Long, Yun and Yang. The triad As we have already said, the goal of the programmers was to push the players to the assault and favor the Rushdown. Staying true to this philosophy, they introduced four guys who are very keen on this type of strategy. Oni is quite brutal up close and his chargeable fireballs that don't cover the entire screen make him hard to annoy for long distances. Evil Ryu is a wicked Ryu in every sense, with the atrocious resistance of Akuma, but a couple of extra moves that transform him into a terrible danger once he gets close. Finally, the twins are human tornadoes capable of performing brutal combinations of blows, and have already been elected by the pros as the new rulers of the game, as they have incredibly useful special moves and attacks that put them at the edge against almost any challenger. We are not at the level of Sagat Vanilla (or, even worse, of Chun Li of 3rd Strike), but if we consider that even Fei Long, who was already an excellent warrior, is now a war machine in the right hands, it is clear that the balance is worse than the Super. These three ~real baddies~ however don't spoil the experience that much, their advantages are marginal, they require a certain skill to be used properly, and they add variety and spice to competitive multiplayer. But expect to find an army in ranked matches, the people of Capcom does not take long to throw themselves on the most ~lucky~ characters. Another problem of the DLC is the scarcity of content: apart from the four of the Ave Maria there is practically no addition, not even additional challenges. The only changes reside in the Replay Mode, which for purchasers of the Arcade Edition now features an Elite Room where it is possible to watch the greatest champions in the world compete against each other, and in the division between the Battle Points of the old and new version. For 15 euros, the price of the DLC version, it's very little.", "date": "2011-06-15", "grade": "7.0"}
