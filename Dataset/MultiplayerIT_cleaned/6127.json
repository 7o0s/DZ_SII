Released in Korea last year and localized for a few months also in Italian, the title developed by FLINT for Gamevil immediately stands out from all the others for its enchanting graphic design, which recalls Vanillaware's works such as Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere. The sprites and scenarios are detailed and colorful, animated just fine, and move fluidly between lightning bolts, explosions, tornadoes and other offensive and healing spells. Dragon Blaze, after all, is an RPG in which the protagonist - that is us, needless to say - is in charge of stopping Diademorte and his army before they invade and destroy the kingdom of King Gram. The story is quite simple, even if it tries some awkward twists, and told through quite boring dialogues but, for once, completely in Italian. The translation leaves something to be desired, but it is far from incomprehensible and it is an effort that certainly deserves more praise than criticism. Dragon Blaze is a free RPG and beautiful to look at, but also very superficial and repetitive Grind, and never stop Chosen our alter ego among five different classes that respect the classic canons of role-playing games (warrior, wizard, priest, archer and bandit), Dragon Blaze catapults us into a very long tutorial that explains practically every feature of the game and every subtlety of the gameplay . The difference between the classes is marginal, essentially changing the gender and shape of the sprite, as well as the three main skills that the player can only use in combat when they are not on cooldown. The progression is rather linear, divided into ~dungeons~ accessible from the main map, which in turn are divided into various stages that our group will explore automatically, facing the three or four groups of enemies that block our way. Each exploration consumes ~shoes~, the currency which basically determines the time we can dedicate to the game, but which Dragon Blaze generously gives out every day, simply when we connect or complete small daily missions: it is very rare to run out of shoes, so as tickets abound to participate in the ~raids~, gigantic bosses that it is possible to face over and over again, perhaps together with three other friends, in the hope of winning some nice weapon or piece of equipment. The only currencies distributed less generously are coins and rubies: the former are used to pay for some mechanics, such as the fusion of objects and characters that we will explain shortly, while the rubies represent the currency around which the microtransactions revolve. The latter are absolutely not invasive, except for the pop-ups that advertise them at each access, and are used mostly to buy temporary bonuses, some costumes, potions and ~allied tickets~. The composition of the group, in fact, is in a certain sense the heart of Dragon Blaze's gameplay, as well as the only real strategic component of the game. There are dozens and dozens of characters that the player can recruit at the end of the stages or that he can unlock, with a bit of luck, when he receives or buys random tickets. Each potential ally has specific attack and defense skills, and its effectiveness is based on the rank that distinguishes it, which ranges from C to SSS. Once the campaign has been completed on normal difficulty, and then on higher difficulty levels, and thus reached the level cap, Dragon Blaze becomes an almost endless search for the perfect party: the player can merge two allies of the same rank to obtain a new one of rank superior, and further enhance his favorite allies, perhaps by consuming the allies and weapons he no longer uses. It is a layered and vertical process that at a certain point requires an exorbitant amount of virtual money, even if you just need to be patient and proceed little by little. Meanwhile, the game offers quite a few extra contents, in the form of PvP arenas, labyrinths in which to tackle missions in a ~survival~ mode and social activities built around an interesting ecosystem of guilds and channels of chat. From this point of view, Dragon Blaze is undoubtedly the most complete and layered ~gacha~ RPG we've ever played, a pity that it relies on substantially automatic gameplay in which it is rarely necessary to intervene in the first person: most of the stages , even those of a higher level than ours, can be played without even looking at the display, with our group mowing down the enemies automatically, using the aability as soon as they are charged. The most attentive players will find that during certain fights, for example against the gigantic raid bosses, actively intervening on skills or potion consumption - perhaps to stun the enemy before he heals himself - can make a difference, but this is rarely the case. occurs in the normal game levels, which sooner or later get bored and are no longer able to stimulate the player even with the promise of new loots.", "date": "2015-08-18", "grade": "7.2"}
