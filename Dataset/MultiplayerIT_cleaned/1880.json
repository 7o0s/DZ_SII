The first sequence takes place in fact in a bar in Onomichi, a town in the Hiroshima prefecture where the former Dragon of Dojima has decided to settle for some time. History Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, the protagonist Kazuma Kiryu with one of his famous looks. What brought the protagonist of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life to Hiroshima? The long, traditional cinematic cutscenes that have always characterized the SEGA series explain this to us. Having miraculously survived the final battle of the fifth chapter, Kazuma decides to turn himself in and free himself once and for all of his ties to the Japanese mafia, but after three years in prison he discovers that his young protg, Haruka, has long since disappeared. .The girl reappears in Kamurocho, Tokyo, only to end up hit by an apparently out of control car. In a coma, suspended between life and death, Haruka suffered serious injuries to protect what she held most dear: the little son she was carrying. To prevent it from ending up in the hands of social services, Kazuma decides to take little Haruto with him and find out who his father is. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, little Haruto. The search leads the man to Hiroshima, in fact, where he meets a charming bartender named Kiyomi and the ramshackle Hirose family: once again very well outlined characters, who hide exciting stories and many surprises that we will be able to discover in the course of the thirteen chapters that make up the long campaign of the game, the duration of which is around thirty hours by also completing the subquests. The formula is the one that fans of the series know well, with a thick narrative sector that acts as a glue for exploratory sequences set within two large sandboxes, the aforementioned Kamurocho and Onomichi, where we will be able to try our hand at many side activities and with exciting action combat based on combos, spectacular finishers, blunt objects and special moves. Gameplay Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, the charming Kiyomi. Anyone who knows Yakuza knows it: the gameplay carried out for years by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio starts from the now distant tradition of scrolling fighting games, offering us an extremely immediate but also solid and satisfying action brawler combat system, able to offer an excellent yield of impacts. While we explore the two large maps of the game, we will often run into gangs of hooligans, stragglers or real criminals who will glower at us looking for a fight. We will have to resolve these contrasts by throwing our hands, pulling off more and more elaborate combos (thanks to the release of many additional moves) and performing the very painful finishers to KO our opponents more quickly. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, a spectacular fight sequence. Here, wherever you look at it, the combat system of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life appears convincing and pleasant but inevitably less multifaceted than the experiments introduced starting from Yakuza 0, with the different styles that gave Kazuma a repertoire not only richer but also dynamic, adaptable to situations and enemies. In this case the protagonist remains bound to the traditional Dragon Style, albeit in an enhanced version: he can exploit the fury bar to deliver devastating series of punches and the result is undoubtedly spectacular, but also in terms of finishers the possibilities appear reduced compared to what we have seen in the past. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, a small crowd of enemies to face in Onomichi. To put a bit of a patch we find the strategic battles against JUSTIS, the group of corrupt ex-vigilantes that we will be able to challenge on various occasions after creating our team of fighters, as well as the usual and inevitable side dish of extra activities with which to grapple mainly in Kamurocho, for example the SEGA Clubs where you can try your hand at the coin-ops of OutRun, Super Hang-On, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Puyo Puyo and Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown. After that there are the usual minigames: from mahjong to darts, from karaoke to the battling center, plus baseball games and spear fishing in Onomichi. Two more full-bodied and strat new items also stand outified, in this case the Hostess Club in which to show off our skills as a seducer by selecting the right phrases with which to conquer our interlocutor, and the live chat, where by guessing a series of choices we will be able to witness a real striptease. Scenarios Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, a first look at Onomichi by day. Curiously Kazuma suffers from a glitch related to the suitcase in this sequence. With the obvious exception of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, we are faced with the most graphically complex and interesting episode of the series, and it is therefore a pity that these qualities have not also been put at the service of the numbers. Compared to the five different scenarios of Yakuza 5, in fact, the two maps of The Song of Life are not entirely convincing. If on the one hand we know Kamurocho very well and here he appears in one of his richest and most interactive versions ever, Onomichi has the typical features of the tourist resort and some suggestive panoramas, but it does not offer much to its visitors: the activities are few and not particularly interesting, the dimensions of the map are small and there are plenty of invisible walls to delimit its borders. Technical realization In terms of technical realization, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life can count on the inevitable set of extremely convincing cutscenes, on rather detailed and well-animated polygonal models as well as, in general, on a great atmosphere that is expressed in particular during the sequences evening, when Kazuma strolls through the streets illuminated by the signs of the premises. Net of the variety of settings, which as mentioned is one of the weak points of this chapter, the concept of virtual tourism can be well applied to the game and the many activities available in around they only confirm it, involving us when in a nice minigame with distinctly Japanese features, when in a subquest with completely crazy implications. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, the graphics adjustments of the PC version. How does the title behave on PC? The original version for PS4 moved at 1080p and 30 fps and the same happens on Xbox Series S, while here depending on the configuration it is possible to reach 2160p and 60 fps, activating more sophisticated effects. In addition to the ability to unlock the frame rate and change the resolution, adjustments include textures, shadows, geometry, reflections, motion blur, advanced ambient occlusion and antialiasing. In short, there are many options, but put it to the test with an RTX 3070 Yakuza 6 : The Song of Life turns out to be a bit heavy on the GPU: setting everything to the maximum at 4K the card struggles to keep 50-55 fps and you have to use the scaler to decrease the resolution by 10% in order to get the 60 stable frames. Going down to 1440p or 1080p instead travels on 100 fps, obviously once the v-sync is deactivated.", "date": "2021-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
