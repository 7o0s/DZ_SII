{"name": "Rogue Legacy 2: la recensione del brillante roguelike di Cellar Door Games", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rogue-legacy-2-recensione.html", "text": "While they are a tiny minority in the huge ocean of indie development houses, one hears of success stories from one or another small team all the time. On the other hand, in a sector where creativity is almost as important as concreteness in development, it is almost mandatory to have great ideas or great talents available in order to emerge from the crowd (except for very rare fortuitous cases at unnatural levels). Once you get it right, however , one has to deal with a task that is sometimes almost as complicated as the initial one: reconfirming itself on the market with a second production up to the level of the previous work. On the other hand, it's not exactly a walk in the park to create a new intellectual property from scratch and even the seemingly solid plan of creating a sequel is practically always fraught with difficulties. However, the Cellar Door Games were not (rightly) discouraged and, after the considerable success of their Rogue Legacy, they decided to create a second chapter, initially released in early access. The move was nothing short of brilliant, because over the months, starting from a skin and bones base, these skilled developers have listened carefully to fan feedback, adding a myriad of content and often brilliantly tweaking many of the elements of the game. With the final version of Rogue Legacy 2 released a few days ago, we therefore decided to get our hands on it again to evaluate everything. The result was able to surprise us too, despite having been following the title for a long time. We explain why in the Rogue Legacy 2 review. Structure: genealogical loop Rogue Legacy 2: don't underestimate the bosses, they won't give you a break If you go to analyze Rogue Legacy 2 structurally, it immediately appears crystal clear how the gameplay loop of its predecessor is still present with all the basics still in place. The choice is more than obvious, because we are talking about an objectively brilliant loop, which sees the player grappling with a large procedural map divided into biomes and full of bosses and dangers. The gem, once again, lies in not having a single protagonist, but an entire lineage of warriors available: once your first character dies, in fact, you can take control of one of three descendants with genetic characteristics and classes different, and so on at each departure. Since the game is a roguelike, as it is obvious, everything revolves around the exploration of the aforementioned map (and an inevitable reset of resources at each restart), with the ultimate goal of eliminating all the main bosses of each area and thus unlocking a large golden door that divides the player from the final stages. So far, outside of the family tree issues, everything is normal, but we have not called this skeleton ~brilliant~ at random. In fact, the Rogue Legacy 2 loop adapts wonderfully to the player and to the contents of the campaign, due to a high level of difficulty whose progression is optimally managed from area to area, an extreme variety of classes available, a development system gradual and elaborate, and of the general organization of advancement. In the Cellar Door Games game, the recovery of resources to enhance one's warriors or unlock the following classes is in fact fundamental and this kicks off - especially during the first few bars - real ~farming runs~ where the primary objective is to survive as long as possible to get tons of gold and unlock the necessary upgrades. These improvements are permanent and make the first biomes trivial after a few hours, however the most skilled players can safely neglect them, advancing quickly even at low levels (provided they dodge everything the enemies throw at them). The games are therefore divided between slow explorations of each fortress and area in search of chests, moments dedicated to strategic advancement designed to face this or that boss in safety, or daredevil runs where you run towards the area boss to get rid of it permanently. Rogue Legacy 2: the classes are many, and all hilarious Rogue Legacy 2 then offers a series of systems (some taken from the predecessor, others new), which make everything even more fun and complex than in the past. In fact, beyond an architect capable of blocking the shape of the procedural map in case you want to immediately return to the unlocked areas, there is also an NPC who permanently frees access to the initial portals of each biome, greatly facilitating subsequent movements. That wasn't enough, the game takes weight elements from the metroidvania, bringing special movement skills into play(without which it is impossible, or very difficult, to advance in certain maps), and artifacts capable of offering interesting passive powers, which completely transform the approach to games. Gameplay: Muses are good for art Rogue Legacy 2: in the darkest areas of the game there are many surprises. Even a big dragon The presence of artifacts designed to change the style of play is a natural evolution of the original formula, and is one of those innovations that demonstrate the willingness of the development team to implement concepts and ideas acclaimed by audiences and critics in other successful titles . After all, these objects can lead a game to be extremely more strategic - perhaps when it comes to skills capable of regenerating life points through specific gimmicks - or aggressive once you have recovered significant bonuses to damage or the ability to inflict status. It resembles a more basic form of the abilities obtainable in a myriad of other roguelites (such as the divine powers of Hades, or the weapons and gadgets of Dead Cells), and it is even related to a resource influenced by the armor worn, which does not allow you to abuse of these advantages. Understandably, the evolution of the systems is not limited to this novelty, and an enviable job has been done at all levels, starting from the pure combat mechanics. Where in fact Rogue Legacy had diversified classes mainly in statistics, with attack methodologies that were nothing short of similar to each other (with rare exceptions), in this sequel each specialization boasts unique weapons and attacks, as well as extremely distinctive special abilities. There is even talk of about fifteen possibilities with lots of variants linked to legendary weapons (always returning to the inspirations linked to Hades), for a range of options that is absolutely incomparable to the previous title. And the best thing is the balancing work done with each of them, because while on the one hand there are some ~descendants~ that are more effective than others, on the other we haven't really found a single class that wasn't very effective in the right situations. A barbarian or a dragon spearman can therefore be fabulous for those who want to survive for a long time and recover tons of gold, incredibly mobile choices such as the astromancer or the pirate represent a boon in biomes richer in platforming elements and environmental dangers, while stormtroopers delicate but capable of doing brutal damage such as assassins can represent your best option to quickly melt into more resistant enemies of the title. In short, while in the first Rogue Legacy we had shortly settled on a couple of particularly advantageous classes, here at run we find ourselves pondering for a few seconds on who to use and why, testament to how exponentially the fun and uniqueness of the experience have increased. Technical sector and contents: procedural cartoon Rogue Legacy 2: some biomes are full of platforming stages. We didn't come up with the platform elements at random, of course: the general refinement of the formula also impacted the structuring of the maps and the biomes are not simple recolored maps with more powerful enemies in this Rogue Legacy. We have already mentioned above the presence of sections close to the metroidvania, where movement skills are required to advance, but we have not gone into detail on the procedural system and how the explorable areas are ~built~ during the adventure. Overall, each biome is formed on the basis of well-defined primary skeletons, which normally tend to significantly change the pace of the experience. Therefore, if in the initial building there is an area perfectly balanced between fights, dangers and platform phases, places like Axis Mundi or the Torre del Sole offer clips that closely resemble pure platformers, complete with map pieces in which navigation approaches even titles like Celeste or Path of Pain in Hollow Knight. A further reference to Celeste (and more precisely to her ~cassettes~) then seemed to us the scars: hidden testimonies for the maps that unlock advanced tests that can be tackled in your hub before leaving for the next game. This is another appreciable novelty to say the least, which offers rewards in a dedicated shop (the ~legendary~ classes are unlocked here, for example, but there are many goodies) and an additional challenge for players skilled enough not to being able to be satisfied by the however high difficulty of the campaign. The contents do not end, because once everything is completed - and it will plausibly take you between twenty and thirty hours, given the level of challenge and the size of the maps - you will even havesoulslike new game plus with progressive difficulty, ~enhanced~ alternative boss fights, brutal additional challenges, and even extra difficulty modifiers to make things even more punishing. Even the narrative has been expanded, with a handful of dialogue-prone NPCs and more than one background storyline to outline the game world in detail, although it is certainly not a memorable experience in this aspect. A truly respectable work, which makes Rogue Legacy 2 among the potentially longest-lasting and replayable roguelites in circulation (not to mention that further future updates certainly wouldn't surprise us, given how the developers approached early access). Rogue Legacy 2: bullets and enemies placed almost everywhere are the norm, even at the beginning. So everything is flawless? Well, actually the answer would be almost a resounding yes were it not for a handful of minor flaws. In fact, the game brings with it a couple of hiccups from the first title, which have not been adequately filed. Your bloodline's genetic conditions, for example, are once again more of a laughable side dish than anything else, and while the percentage gold gain bonus attached to some of them is a good justification for selecting some, you'll tend to avoid like the plague once again the most irritating ones (like vertigo, which inverts the screen). Furthermore, the procedural structuring of the maps is not impeccable however solid, and it can rarely happen to navigate large pieces of the map to find yourself in a dead end, or to have to deal with ~dangerous~ areas that are actually much more relaxed than expected predictable due to some miscalculation. Finally, the recovery of resources can be quite slow late in the game (especially in the initial biomes) and make some games slower and more staid than necessary given the size of the maps. Nothing serious, mind you, and it wouldn't surprise us if future patches could further mitigate these oversights. Few protests from a technical point of view as well: the game is certainly not an extraordinary peak of 2D graphics, but its cartoonish style is extremely spot on and we consider it a sharp evolution compared to the pixel art of the original. The design of locations, enemies and classes boasts a certain personality, and even without particular peaks, everything seemed to always run granite on our PC configuration.", "date": "2022-05-03", "grade": "S.V."}
