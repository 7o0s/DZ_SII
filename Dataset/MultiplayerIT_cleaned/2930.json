{"name": "Gear.Club Unlimited 2 Tracks Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gearclub-unlimited-2-tracks-edition-recensione.html", "text": "We can only start this review of Gear.Club Unlimited 2 Tracks Edition - available from August 27th - with a premise on the relationship between racing games and Nintendo consoles. Despite the presence of Mario Kart, often the best-selling racing game of the various generations (including this one), it certainly cannot be said that it alone can appease the appetites of those who love realistic racing games (whether simulation or arcade). Nintendo consoles have historically lacked in this context, and have never offered titles at the level of excellence of others. There is a big difference however between not achieving a certain quality and not covering a genre at all. On Nintendo Switch, had it not been for the presence of Gear.Club, only Burnout Paradise Remastered (however a conversion of an old game) would have remained to represent the category. In addition to this particular situation, the legacy of Gear.Club needs to be explained before we go any further into the actual analysis of the game. The game developers, Eden Games (they are French, from Lyon), are specialized in making racing games: in the past they have created excellent works, in particular V-Rally and Test Drive Unlimited, one of the first - and among the most successful - open world racing game. Gear.Club was born as a mobile game, and in that context it is among the best out there: the download is free, the controls appreciable, technically commendable, especially as regards the variety and complexity of the polygonal models of the cars. At the end of 2017 Eden Games converted his work, adapting it, on Nintendo Switch. A few months later they made a sequel, Gear.Club Unlimited 2; this one we're talking about is the (arguably) definitive edition of that game, with five new tracks, including the historic Le Mans, as well as new cars, such as the Ford GT40 MK I. From mobile to Switch Apart from the interesting introductions of this particular edition, which enrich and expand the game's offer, what we would like to illustrate - since we hadn't reviewed it at the time - it is the actual quality of the title. Which, in essence, is the definitive version of the sequel to an adaptation of a mobile racing game: if in 2017 it was normal for Gear.Club to still show a strong link with the original edition - still available for free - from the sequel we would have expected a deepening of certain mechanics, the abandonment of others and, more generally, a total adaptation to the needs of the console market. It didn't go like this, we tell you right away; at the same time, it is not such a devastating problem. As we've already said, as a mobile title Gear.Club is well done, by any measure. Despite the many (optional) in-game purchases and the facilitations to the control system, it is not - conceptually - a simplistic racing game, but rather the mobile version of a complex racing game. Long story short, it's a hybrid of both worlds; and it is also on Nintendo Switch. Starting to run, the first element you notice are the great facilitations granted to driving: what you need to worry most about is getting the direction of the curve right, because the CPU will take care of braking and slowing down adequately. Acceleration is not automatic - basic - but it can be inserted if desired. On the other hand, fortunately, it is possible to remove all these aids. In all there are three driving systems: the automated one, the professional one and something in between. Naturally, in case of purchase, we advise you to start immediately with the most complex and difficult one, the only one capable of guaranteeing a rather profound experience. Guide and methods In general, the feel of the game, both tactile and visual, we liked. The sensation of speed it gives is good and, by deactivating all the facilities, it offers a guide that proves to be an excellent compromise between simulation and arcade. The sensations that more or less powerful cars give are well diversified, and you have to gradually increase your skill behind the wheel to keep up with your opponents. While this is undoubtedly a positive factor, it cannot be denied that the collisions and interaction with the terrain are rather superficial. The difference between a snowy, dirt or asphalt circuit is not as pervasive as it should have been, and collisions, rather than sending you off the track or marking the end of a race, are even advisable in some cases. There are no breakdowns in the cars, after an accident (which in reality would have been fatal) you continue nimbly, and sometimes collisions with opponents, if done at the right moment, can guarantee an advantage. Furthermore, to help the player even more, if you want you can pause the race and send it back a few seconds, soto correct mistakes without having to restart the race. The game's primary mode is career, and despite Eden Games' track record, it's not open world. The various events are accessed from a map (quite awkward), and the process is always the same: the more races you win, the more money you make, the more you can buy and improve cars, the more difficult and faster the competitions become. The development of the car does not require the slightest engineering understanding, in essence it is not possible to make mistakes in the evolution of the car: you just have to improve certain aspects at the right time, increasing their quality. We wrote ~must~ because it is not the direct experience to stimulate the desire for upgrades: they are really necessary to access certain competitions. Among the most frequent types of race are timed challenges, derbies (~normal~ races with cars, all present on the track) and elimination ones, with a timer that occasionally excludes the last positioned from the race, up to isolate the winner. From the graphic point of view there is a big disparity between the excellent quality of the cars and that of the landscape; disparity that becomes even more evident playing on the television. Despite this, using the dock is absolutely preferable: not only for reasons of immersion, but also to enjoy the experience with a stable frame rate. Inside the Gear.Club dock it travels at a stable 30 FPS, while in portability we noticed some slight jerks which, of course, are very annoying in a racing game. Multiplayer is possible both from the same console (in split screen), both locally with several Nintendo Switches, and online, subject to joining or forming a car club: unfortunately, given the momentary absence of opponents, we have not been able to test the latter mode.", "date": "2020-08-30", "grade": "6.8"}
