{"name": "Hell Let Loose: la recensione di uno sparatutto in prima persona simulativo dall'anima strategica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hell-let-loose-recensione.html", "text": "Although the landscape of first-person shooters is largely focused on fast-paced experiences that enhance the prowess of the individual, there is no shortage of alternatives that focus on a broader strategic breadth, realism and tension, such as this simulation FPS developed by the studio Australian Black Matter. Hell Let Loose often starts with long traverses, in complete silence, with eyes fixed on the horizon to catch enemy movements. Then, suddenly, a massive explosion, bullets whizzing all around and the desperation of not even being able to understand where the red-hot lead comes from which in a few moments sent all our comrades to their creator, leaving us alone and confused in the middle of the enemy territory. We have experienced all this several times during the review of Hell Let Loose, a multiplayer shooter set during the Second World War which, available for 2 years in Early Access on Steam and also arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, first convinced several funders from below on Kickstarter and, subsequently, Team 17, finally arriving in view of the final release of July 27 with an update that adds the Soviet Union as a third faction and the maps of the eastern front. A strategic shooter Team play is essential Battlefield's influence on Hell Let Loose is evident, as it is in the case of many other modern military shooters, and can be seen in the character progression, in the two modes focused on capturing strategic positions, in the different roles of the soldiers and in the division into squads of the line-ups. But mortality is high and the simulation is evident, although not extreme, and extends to all elements of a game that includes tanks, trucks, artillery, supply system, fourteen classes, fortifications and gigantic maps. All nine maps available in the launch version, largely dedicated to the Normandy theater of war but enriched by battlefields of the Eastern Front with the new update, are immense and have been created by feeding the Unreal Engine 4 with satellite images, aerial photographs of the time and details taken from reality. Enough because Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, according to what the developers reported, is 1:1 scale with the original battlefield. Spectacular and massive explosions that give a lot of atmosphere, involvement and tension The play areas are far too large even for 100 players who, in the absence of organization, risk wandering around in circles, quite often ending up in the clutches of lurking enemies. All factions, with the Soviet Union joining Germany and the United States, have mirrored vehicles at their disposal that can get past barbed wire, unlike the slower foot units, but we're still talking about WWII trucks and tanks World championship, complete with a vintage manual gearbox to learn to master. Among other things, the maneuvering speed of the vehicles is such as to condemn any driving error in front of tanks or soldiers with anti-tank weapons. The judicious use of offensive means, divided into four degrees of armor thickness, can give great advantages on the battlefield and allows you to play on factors such as the resistant front surface, the possibility that too angled blows will rebound and the possibility of repairing the middle. However, at least two soldiers specialized in vehicles are needed, one for driving and one for weapons, and it is also good to have a third who enjoys a much better view from the turret. On the other hand, taking the right direction is vital. The rivers are impassable, there is smoke everywhere and the battlefield is continually shaken by the shots of the artillery which, controlled by the players themselves, can fire at enormous distances. It is also good to pay close attention to the carpet bombings which, thanks to the size of the detonations and the excellent visual and graphic rendering of the explosions, give a show bringing destruction on a large scale. So broad and convincing that it plays a key role in Hell Let Loose's ability to make the player feel like they're in a real war. The graphic rendering is far from that of a Battlefield, and there is no trace of destructibility, but speaking of tension and possible situations, the overall realism is decidedly superior. Specific classes are needed to be able to board a chariot There is no shortage of aircraft on the battlefield, but they are not usable. In fact, they are only functional for bombing and resupply, but this removes the problem of creating extremely difficult balancing vehicles. Furthermore, the choice is compatible with a game that has ithaving said that, it focuses more on the rhythm of a real battle than on the excited action and on the actions of the individual. Having said that, the action is not lacking between tanks that suddenly appear, snipers posted, doctors who tend to do their job saving our lives, cannons and the continuous fire of the artillery positions placed in the main bases. Gameplay Accumulating levels in individual roles allows you to unlock secondary loadouts Huge maps, high mortality and a strategic component make Hell Let Loose a game with a decidedly steep learning curve. Even the most successful of solo actions can be almost completely useless if disconnected from strategic dynamics that are vital in such a game. Pushing yourself up to the enemy rear lines to place a respawn point can make sense, but enticing your teammates to plunge into hostile territory, in a title where there is no way to move quickly from one part of the game to another map, it can leave a rear base uncovered, perhaps held at gunpoint by a tank that has outflanked our deployment, and it can make a killing without anti-tank units in the vicinity. An enemy from behind is doomed, regardless of the weapon in hand However, it is not said that an armored vehicle is needed to eliminate enemies. A small contingent can get behind any unit by exploiting maps of boundless size and full of passages. Occasionally the action focuses on a specific point, usually along the front, but generally there is a tendency not to risk all units at once, which is possible. On the other hand, one or two hits are enough to eliminate an enemy in a game that, although it is simulative, does not go towards the most extreme levels. The shots, in essence, lack ballistics and go straight and hitting an identified enemy is quite simple. However, it is not always easy to tell if an enemy has been taken. Visibility is often reduced by smoke or vegetation and the interface does not inform us of successful shots and it is an intentional thing that greatly influences gameplay. In fact, it pushes the players to maintain the barrage by often counterattacking those players used to sprint to surprise the enemy with their skill. But there is no skill that stands up to a well-organized team in a title with deliberately punitive mechanics that only works taking into account the strategic aspect, including the peculiarities of the roles on which fortifications, supplies and vehicle repairs depend. The visibility of the tank driver is minimal As in Battlefield, the army of the two factions engaged in a battle is divided into squads, each of which can accommodate only one soldier per role excluding the rifleman. There are no limits to the infantry squads which can even be 50, i.e. one for each single player of a faction in a full game, but there are for armored units, those that allow you to choose soldiers capable of using vehicles and tanks . Furthermore, there can only be two recon squads and the limitation to one role per soldier means that there can be a maximum of two snipers per faction. The classes, however, are 14 and include doctors, shock troops and engineers, all with special skills that include ammunition transport, healing, mines and the possibility of building mobile cannons to have an advantage on the battlefield. But to build the structures supplies are needed which push on the strategic importance of the role. The support can in fact take 50 out of the pockets while the goods trucks, other than those for transporting soldiers, carry as many as two blocks of 150 supplies. The problem is that they are vulnerable and this is where the importance of having a good tank crew capable of moving behind enemy lines comes into play. The ping system allows you to visually signal points where to bomb, soldiers, enemy tanks and so on However, they cannot intercept the commander, a particular role that we have already seen previously and which can be decisive. In addition to being able to drop a box of 100 supplies, the commander can give orders and can use the fuel, obtainable by capturing supply nodes, for the respawn of vehicles. It can also launch carpet bombing on the indication of the soldiers who have at their disposal a fundamental ping system to indicate imminent dangers to their deployment, armored units and a lot of other specific eventualities, each with its own icon. Unique experience, for better or for worse Garrisoning a building is a good way to learn how to spot enemies without the risk of being shot at from any direction A VOnce the importance of strategy and the ease with which Hell Let Loose is eliminated have been clarified, let's move on to the chiaroscuro of a very interesting and still evolving shooter, but far from perfect. The maps based on photographs and satellite surveys, combined with a realistic palette, return a good glance. On closer inspection terrain textures and polygon counts leave something to be desired, but distracting from the flaws are the fabulous explosions, convincing smoke, discreet modeling of soldiers, lots of detail, believable buildings and even more convincing models of tanks. On the other hand, the lesser detail of the trucks compared to the other vehicles, the animations of the flames that go jerky, an occasional but showy pop-up and many other elements that are not fully finished stand out. But the sensations you get, as we said, are those of a realistic war, thanks to a bombastic, powerful sound sector, full of excellent samplings, which pays attention to making us hear the enemy's steps clearly and seasoned with suggestive fanfares of the era. Furthermore, in support of the strategic component, there is a VOIP communication system that allows you to speak to nearby players, the team and the line-up and works well, as well as the servers that between official and paid ones, quite expensive to tell the truth, they abound in Europe, guaranteeing the possibility of playing with a decent ping and without long waits except for a queue, of maximum 5 players, in the most popular servers. A blocked supply truck can cause significant damage to the entire deployment What is missing is interactivity and destructibility, completely absent. Even the barbed wire remains immutable, even when crossed by a tank, and we don't expect changes in this sense, both for issues of complexity, given the size of the maps, and for performance issues. On the other hand, even an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti sometimes drops below 60fps in 1440p, busy managing immense maps full of vegetation. Instead, we hope to see faster means or perhaps the paratroopers to give a few more chances to reverse the situation for a disadvantaged faction, given the already punitive nature of a title that with a good commander and a well-organized army offers memorable matches, full of epic moments and satisfactions, but otherwise it turns into a real hell, including players who launch themselves on the reconnaissance teams, closing them immediately in order to lock down the snipers.", "date": "2021-07-26", "grade": "8.5"}
