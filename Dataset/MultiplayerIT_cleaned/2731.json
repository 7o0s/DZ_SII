The Japanese company has in fact released the turn-based strategy Valkyria Chronicles 4: Complete Edition on the Google game streaming platform. This edition is identical to the one already released last year for other platforms: that is, it includes all the DLC in one package, in addition to the base game. In this review, we'll explain why you have no reason to ignore this reissue. Back to war Valkyria Chronicles 4: Complete Edition takes us once again to the war conflict experienced in the first chapter of the series: the Federation - or our faction - and the Empire are at war in an alternative version of Europe for control of ragnite, a essential mineral for survival that is now scarce everywhere. The protagonists are Claude Wallace and his E Squadron, a fundamental part of the attack that the Federation has decided to carry out, to strike at the heart of the Empire. The story combines a war story with the daily life of a group of young soldiers, who have dreams, hopes and friendships. The fourth chapter is, surprisingly, an excellent starting point: the plot is in fact parallel and separate from the first game, thus allowing even newbies to enter without difficulty. In terms of gameplay, however, we are faced with an almost identical version of the first Valkyria Chronicles. Among the many narrative interludes, we will have to take the field to conquer enemy bases and win battles. The objectives change with each mission and the game offers a valid variety in terms of level design, but the fundamental components of this strategy always remain the same. Each character has a series of action points at his disposal to move around the map, choose an advantageous position (behind cover, at the top of a position reached by a ladder or hidden in tall grass) and engage in battle. At each turn you can attack with one of the available weapons, aiming (without any hurry) at the weakest enemy part (for example, the head for soldiers and the rear for tanks). However, each character belongs to a specific class and therefore has movement capabilities and dedicated weapons, which grant him certain advantages. The spearman, for example, is slow but tough and possesses a perfect weapon for damaging tanks. Snipers inflict a lot of damage from a distance and the tank, while requiring large spaces to manoeuvre, can advance and shoot down enemy heavy vehicles while resisting light fire from infantry without problems. Obviously, strategy and tactics are essential to be able to complete the missions, which reward us with resources, experience and upgrades. The quality of Valkyria Chronicles 4: Complete Edition, however, has been undisputed since 2018 and, if you want to deepen its analysis, we advise you to read our review of the original version. A crease-free port What matters most to us in this review is to understand if the Google Stadia version of Valkyria Chronicles 4: Complete Edition is worthy of your attention (and your money, above all). The answer, trivially, is yes. We can safely say that there is only one reason why you should ignore the Stadia version to give priority to others, if not the possibility of finding it at a discount (given the seniority) on PC, PlayStation, Switch or Xbox. However, let's spend a few more words on the conversion work carried out by SEGA. Valkyria Chronicles 4, we admit, is not a technically complex title, so we didn't expect the Stadia version to have any problems whatsoever, but it's still good to be able to confirm it. The strategic is in fact simply indistinguishable from the other console versions. In terms of resolution, frame rate and input lag, there is absolutely nothing to report, it being understood that you must have a connection that meets the minimum platform requirements, of course. The only ~problem~ we noticed was a momentary (literally one second maximum) decrease in resolution when we reset the character's view, forcing the camera to make an instantaneous shift: it must be said, however, that this did not always happen and that we deliberately forced it to see how often it happened. The answer is: from time to time, but it also depends on the environment. Our tests were performed with a 100 Mb landline (which Stadia rightly classifies as ~Excellent~, the maximum value), using mainly a Chromecast Ultra + Stadia controller, but we also performed some missions on smartphones. After all, one of the great benefits of Stadia is the ability to play games on TV, computer or mobile in totalfreedom (always if within reach of a valid wi-fi network). As for the smartphone sessions, we did some tests using the virtual controls included in the app and, all in all, the experience was manageable. Obviously using a mobile controller is always the best choice, but since it is a non-action title, it is not a problem to use the integrated commands. It should be emphasized, however, that Valkiria Chronicles 4 is not really a title designed for hit and run sessions, given the overabundance of dialogues and the slowness of the game. Also, with the smaller screens it's hard to target further away enemies with snipers. The choice of how and where to play, however, is up to you, the players. The end result will always be the same: Valkyria Chronicles 4: Complete Edition is a very good game and on Stadia you will have nothing less than in the other versions.", "date": "2020-12-15", "grade": "8.5"}
