The only way to establish itself and be able to have a loyal audience is to propose something new and original, a unique subset that can go from the original mechanics to a particular graphic style. In short, to be able to oust a king from his throne, you need to have an extra gear, a gear that must be parallel to the quality of the production, now insufficient by itself to sanction the success of a title. Mediatonic tries to establish itself among the collectible card games with its Fable Fortune, trying not to distort the genre and not to invent anything, rather improving the already known and present mechanics. Was it the right choice? Fable vs. Warcraft In a review the parallels and comparisons are usually uncomfortable and forced, but when analyzing Fable Fortune it is impossible not to immediately observe strong similarities with Hearthstone. So let's start with the selection of the characters, six heroes with a unique power to activate, which can be a shot at an enemy creature, the creation of a pawn on the field or skills similar to what we have seen in the past, a mechanic seen identical in the game of Blizzard cards. Even deck building and the various hero cards plus a pool of community cards work exactly the same way, so much so that some might even cry plagiarism when looking at the deck creation interface. In short, we said it at the beginning, if you want to beat someone on his own field you cannot present yourself to the battle with his own weaker tactics and weapons, given that Fable Fortune also lacks those small tricks that Blizzard has adopted over time such as importing and automatic deck export. Once your 30-card deck has been assembled, without too many problems since the packages you will receive upon your first entry are sufficient to create a fairly competitive basic deck, you can decide whether to face the various tutorials, throw yourself into the cooperative modes against the artificial intelligence or try your luck in online ranked matches. The modes are the classic ones even if we liked the challenges against the bosses and we hope they will be quickly fleshed out with new ideas. Unfortunately we find ourselves in the same condition as before: Hearthstone has already been doing all of this, for longer and in a better way, placing this Fable: Fortune in a limbo of mediocrity. We find ourselves in the hands of a production that fails to have its own specific identity, crushed under the weight of a competition that has been galloping fast in the wake of success for too long. But can it therefore make sense for someone to drop everything and move on to playing the Mediatonic title? Actually yes. If there's one thing that's driving Hearthstone players literally crazy, it's the randomness of many of its cards, an aspect that often causes victories and defeats and which, precisely for this reason, is hated by many. Fable: Fortune then completely abandons this factor proposing cards without particularly variable effects, with very few exceptions, for total control over the game where the player's skill is always put in first place, obviously excluding draws. Any real news? Analyzing in detail the gameplay of the title, however, there are some interesting ideas that are absolutely not to be underestimated. the first, and most curious, is the question of missions. At the beginning of each game, players will be required to choose one of three different missions that can range from casting a certain number of spells or summoning a certain type of creature. Once you reach the goal you will receive a reward, which is usually a card with the most varied effects, and a new power for the hero. We will be able to choose two types of power, one from positive alignment and one from evil. The choice not only changes the effects but also modifies a whole series of cards that change according to the alignment of your hero. Some gain stats on offense or defense while others change the type of buffs they receive. It is an interesting mechanic even if often, whoever gets to complete the quest first manages to gain a clear advantage, which is difficult to recover. As far as the abilities of the cards are concerned, however, there are no big news. Basically we have the same cases seen on Hearthstone, only with different names. We find for example Big Entrance, which is essentially the Battlecry, Deflect which works exactly like the divine shield and then there are cardswith rewards and effects activated upon their destruction and also buffs for certain types of cards, such as bandits for example. The only real revolution lies in the fact that at the cost of a resource point, here indicated by gold coins rather than crystals, it is possible to guard a creature forcing the opponent to attack it before directly damaging the hit points of our hero. Inevitably with this system the games tend to stretch beyond belief, especially when the top deck towards the advanced turns will always lead to having a creature with guard on the field, giving a lot of importance to the draw. The artwork of the cards obviously based on the Fable universe is nice, but there is an almost complete lack of well-finished visual effects and particular animations for the attacks and the card's entry into play, a practical solution but which frankly did not particularly impress us. Finally, as a good free to play, Fable: Fortune does not miss the possibility of buying the basic card packs for a handful of virtual currency coins, obtainable by winning battles and thanks to daily missions, but obviously does not disdain microtransactions and discounts for the different bundles, so as to expand your collection in the shortest possible time.", "date": "2018-03-05", "grade": "6.5"}
