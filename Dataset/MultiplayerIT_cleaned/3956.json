{"name": "Forspoken", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forspoken-recensione.html", "text": "It's almost ironic for a game whose concept revolves almost entirely around magic, but Forspoken almost immediately gave the impression of being a bewitched title. Victim of a little shrewd marketing, this new intellectual property of Square Enix has been surrounded since its first presentations by a sort of malignant aura, which has led almost every conversation concerning it to veer towards negativity in the most moderate cases and catastrophism in the more excessive ones. Surprising, in all honesty, how much of the executives of the Japanese company have already branded it in some ways as a misstep that there was no need for, especially if one considers that the project is led by a team of veterans and that more recent evidence has shown considerable potential in the underlying gameplay...that said, this pessimism isn't entirely without foundation. In fact, what we have seen has never managed to completely convince us, due to a narrative that started off on the wrong foot and the curious desire of the developers to limit the strength of their creature with an introductory phase with the brake on. In the face of similar defects there has always been the need for a careful evaluation of the campaign in its entirety, and of the actual value of the systems implemented once all the mechanics offered have been unlocked. So when Forspoken finally arrived in the newsroom, we threw ourselves headlong into the campaign, trying to figure out if, despite the obvious shortcomings already observed, it could surprise us by resulting in an incredible hidden gem in this vintage full of powerful releases. The answer? The game actually surprised us, but sadly it didn't do it only in the positive and its flaws are serious enough to prevent it from reaching heights that its gameplay deserves to explore. We explain why in the Forspoken review. Narrative: It was better with the isekai Frey had a very difficult childhood, we know it well, but it will be really difficult to sympathize with her in Forspoken given her characterization Something has clearly gone wrong in Forspoken and a large part of that something is without the slightest shadow of a doubt the narrative, a not indifferent paradox if we consider the illustrious names involved in managing it. In fact, despite being a choral effort (as happens in the vast majority of video games), the story and universe of Forspoken have been curated by Gary Whitta, film and television screenwriter also known for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, while for the narrative design the team had the support of that Amy Hennig to whom we owe the Uncharted and the Legacy of Kain series. On paper it should be a winning combination, certainly capable of giving shape to a story that is at least above average, yet the final result is far from these minimum expectations. Forspoken is based, to all intents and purposes, on the narrative canons of isekai: stories (mostly manga or novels) where the protagonist suddenly finds himself catapulted into another world. They are often stories of ~underdogs~ with an empty or depressing life who see their dreams come true in a parallel universe, but from this somewhat trivial beginning over the years various authors have detached themselves a lot, even managing to field events far from the canons truly hilarious classics or total deconstructions of the genre. However, this is not the case in Forspoken, because the protagonist, Frey Holland, is transported to the magical world of Athia after a prologue that contains all the possible clichs of the ~wretched life~, including a last-minute escape from a gang of petty thieves from the street. Much of the game's narrative revolves around the Tantas, who are interesting characters, if nothing else. Little else is saved For heaven's sake, Frey's narrative background is heavy and not to be underestimated, so much so as to lead the girl to even contemplate suicide before casually coming into possession of a strange bracelet and being sucked into a purplish portal. The fact is that the story does not exploit these foundations properly, due to a bad characterization to say the least of the protagonist, generally terrible dialogues, and a conclusion that comes just when the events begin to fuel. Adding a comic sidekick in the form of the sentient Cuff doesn't help, although it's at least possible to diminish his constant comments in the options until they are nullified. Yeah, because the problem isn't so much that Frey is a concentrate of self-pity , cynicism and decisions that would be unwise even for a lobotomized mouflon, but precisely in the aforementioned ending which instead of raising the narrativa kills her with a sharp blow. In fact, at a certain point in the campaign, you will find yourself directly in the closure so suddenly that it is hard to believe it; the impact is so lightning-fast and illogical as to suggest serious content cuts, and a couple of interesting (but highly predictable) twists are certainly not enough to save the barrack. Not enough, even the presentation leaves something to be desired, due to a strange dichotomy between the actual production values of the title and the intentions of the narrative: the developers have clearly given everything to give the whole a Western blockbuster tone, in particular during the main cutscenes, however every single thing outside of the cutscenes has more of an old-style JRPG-like feel, with some really incomprehensible choices. To illustrate, the game doesn't boast many side missions, only that these all have rather serious pacing problems, further aggravated by poorly designed phases (a ~stealth~ section during the first few hours shines for senselessness, and it is certainly not the only moment which will make you turn up your nose in the campaign) and by curious pauses once dialogues and objectives are completed which further slow down the progression. Even fast-forwarding the dialogues clashes because it causes sharp interruptions in the sound, not to mention that the animations of the various characters during the game do not boast particular expressiveness, amplifying the feeling of lack of general care for these elements. In short, it is a narrative rejected on the whole the line as far as we are concerned, with very few moments able to raise the bar and an unsatisfactory closure. If nothing else, it is a serious shortcoming that is partly dampened by the value of the gameplay, which is calculated with wit. Gameplay: goddess of magic In Forspoken you are not a mere sorceress, you are a natural disaster in human form, able to control the elements at will. It's just that it will take a while before you get all your powers Considering that much of the game's marketing to date has focused on setting and characters, and the story is a hole in the water, many will probably consider Forspoken already a failed project. In reality, the development team seems to have dedicated all the attention that was missing to the narrative element to gameplay and movement mechanics. The concept is as simple as its application is complex: allowing the player to use a system of spells with a myriad of spells divided into several elements, and pair it with agile and very fast movements to dramatically increase the frenzy of the action. So described it might seem like a trivial matter, but we assure you that it is not easy to create an action entirely focused on magic, because managing an inordinate number of powers in battle can be confusing to say the least, and it is certainly not easy to balance the fights when your protagonist he can cast spells of immense power without particular limitations. Square Enix's choice to eliminate the first obstacle was that of the ~weapon selection wheels~: in practice, every time you choose a school of magic, a support spell, or an offensive power, a handy circular menu appears that slows down time, allowing you to collect your thoughts and tactically select the desired option. This is the easiest and most logical solution to deal with the problem, but be careful, we wouldn't praise the system if this were the only gimmick put in place, because however functional it certainly doesn't represent who knows what fine design solution. No, here the combat designers have done things smartly even for those who want to hit enemies in bursts by quickly memorizing the spells to use and switching from one element to another without pause; each of the four elements available to Frey, therefore, can also be selected with the directional cross, and there are movement spells in the game that move the girl suddenly and immediately switch to the magical school she belongs to. You don't have to use radial menus in Forspoken if you don't want to, there are various quick options to switch between items naturally It doesn't end there, because as expected the system itself is nothing short of elaborate. To give you as clear an example as possible, imagine that Forspoken is a sort of third-person shooter (it's not like that, due to a pointing system that greatly limits the need to aim, but momentarily ignore it). In practice, each element available here has three offensive spells and eight support spells available, and the three ~attacks~ are comparable to classic shooting weapons.all without any limitation in ammunition. Earth powers are therefore the equivalent of a submachine gun, missile launcher and shotgun of sorts, fire ones melee attacks with a selectable javelin in addition, water ones arc attacks that hit area or similar to a sniper rifle, and so on. The offensive variety is impressive and is further enhanced by the fact that each element has unique mechanics related to powers, with which it is possible, for example, to instantly charge the blows of earth spells in combos with support powers, change the area of effect of the fire ones if you use them in the air, or multiply the homing shots of the electric ones if you attack the opponent first with the basic projectiles. Now of the end you will become a kind of unstoppable mystical tornado capable of destroying entire armies, passing from one sorcery to another with sudden leaps between pirouettes. It's nothing short of spectacular to watch when it all comes together, and we sincerely believe it's one of the best magical power systems ever implemented in a video game. The magic of water in Forspoken cannot be underestimated. It's practically the best possible option for taking out flying enemies in groups So no flaws? Well not really, considering that Forspoken is far from perfect anyway. Firstly, the campaign has serious pacing and power progression problems, which can lead to playing for several hours with only the first two types of spells available. The variety is already guaranteed by two schools, only that the approaches to combat are incomparably more varied and fun when you have all the spells, and it is almost hilarious that the last element (the most fun to use in our opinion) is it practically gets to the end of the campaign, so much so that its use is relegated only to the last lines and to the postgame if you decide to go straight and stop exploring. The other shortcomings are more marginal and mostly related to the management of the difficulty and the clashes. The defensive mechanics of the game in fact correspond to an extremely wide dodge and a counter that stuns the surrounding enemies after being hit. They are good maneuvers, but the first one is slightly deceptive because, given the large displacement, the invulnerability frames are only active at the beginning of the animation (if you don't understand it right away, you risk being hit often, convinced you are safe while you are in flight). In addition, considering Frey's fearsome power, the developers had to find ways to endanger her in the form of opponents equipped with projectiles - sometimes able to dash or glide in her face in an instant - and some damage spikes that send the girl close to death if hit, no matter how much defense she has. The most exploited ~trick~ are unstoppable shots whose stay on the ground is longer than the invulnerability of the dodge, practically inevitable if you don't run away from the attack area or don't take advantage of some moves with long invulnerable animations. We understand the need to use solutions of this type to prevent a good player from simply staying at a safe distance, yet it is a shame not to see a bit of variety in the opponent's artificial intelligence, especially considering that the (few) main bosses instead offer very scenic multi-stage battles with quite original gimmicks. We approve, as annoying as it may be if you don't get used to it, the fact that aiming disappears after eliminating enemies and cannot be activated during attacks: it sometimes makes it necessary to aim precisely during the most agitated situations, and avoid having excessively easy life against large groups of monsters, of which the game is full. Structure and progression: a very fast open world. Just too much As soon as she gets some more mechanics Frey moves with impressive speed for the maps and there are very few obstacles able to stop her Mechanically it is not only the combat system that shines, but also the movement system. In fact, Frey can take advantage of a curious ~magic parkour~ that guarantees her to whiz at the speed of a supercar for the maps of Athia. Imagine it as a sort of variation on steroids of Assassin's Creed free running, with which it is possible to climb even very high natural walls without too much difficulty, and avoid any obstacle as if it weren't present. For heaven's sake, these abilities also grow during the campaign, starting to become seriously impressive only once you have a special flaming grappling hook and a good amount of active mana (which in", "date": "2023-01-23", "grade": "7.0"}
