The famous ~Year One~, during which the developers of the new intellectual property linked to the name of Tom Clancy have not always had it easy. After the initial enthusiasm related to The Division, the guys from Massive Entertainment have in fact had to deal with an unsatisfactory endgame for the reasons we have repeatedly repeated, to the point of pushing many first-hour players to abandonment. The response from insiders has come in the form of constant updates to The Division, accompanied above all by three additional paid contents released during the year: Underground, Struggle for Life and Until the End. The article you are reading is dedicated to the latter, which arrived together with the new 1.6 update a few days ago. Waiting to know what will be of the game next year, here are our impressions after a few days spent between the Black Zone and television studios. Till the End brings a new Dark Zone mode to The Division, and a raid not to be missed! The new Dark Zone Game as the object of ambition of the players who arrived at the endgame, the Dark Zone proved to be the most critical aspect of The Division's first months of life. The PvPvE experience developed by Massive has in fact never properly convinced the players, partly due to deficiencies in its design but above all due to the lack of real alternatives for those who want something else. The updates published by the developers over the months have plugged a few holes in both directions, and the arrival of Until the End obviously completes the work done on the game dynamics after reaching level thirty. After the new mode seen in the Struggle for Life, Until the End also brings with it as a main dish a new type of game, which bears the same name as the DLC. Unlike the previous one, the main focus is dedicated to the PvP dynamics of The Division: teams made up of eight players find themselves clashing in maps located within the Dark Zone, where, however, there is no need to deal with agents traitors and loot that are stolen at the last second. Instead, it is a Dominion-type mode, in which there are three control points to guard to quickly accumulate the score that determines which of the two teams wins the game. We therefore find ourselves moving in a limited environment with respect to the entirety of the Dark Zone, within which we must obviously win the clashes with the opposing team but also keep in mind that human enemies are not the only ones present on the map. In fact, we also find others controlled by artificial intelligence, by defeating which it is in fact possible to collect the technology that is used to fortify the controlled points, placing defensive towers or rebirth points that are closer to the heart of the action. The comparison that seems to us best for this dynamic is that with MOBAs, where the bonuses and resources collected in the jungle can contribute significantly to determining the fate of a game. Based on the score obtained by the single player in a match, it is possible to return home with one or more boxes of equipment and Phoenix credits. Once inside the mechanics of the Until the End mode, it is possible to appreciate its frenetic pace, which leads to grinding games after games before detaching from the game. Having first-class equipment can undoubtedly have its advantages, but fortunately the teams have always seemed balanced in terms of the presence of more experienced players and novices. Compared to similar modalities present in other titles, Until the End does not offer particular novelties, but undoubtedly an element of this kind was needed by The Disivion to complete its offer to players. Who moved the antenna? The add-on content for Until the End is accompanied by patch 1.6, with which Massive has expanded the Dark Zone in the northeastern part that borders Central Park. Although the recently arrived news mostly concern the PvP component of the game, the developers have not forgotten to give other material to those who prefer PvE instead. From this point of view, therefore, the new incursion, entitled Signal Interrupted, could not be missing. Set entirely in a television studio, the new mission is probably the most beautiful of those proposed so far, as well as one of the most challenging. Its main feature is that it is made up of three different modular parts, which can be tackled in random order. Beyond the enemies who are still the same, namely the Rikers whohave taken the studio hostage, the three parts of Signal Interrupted offer different challenges to the players, ranging between normal phases of clashes with increasingly stronger enemies and others in which you have to deal with turrets that are apparently impossible to overcome or with an electrified floor. In addition to presenting different environments, Interrupted Signal also forces players to change strategy from time to time, relying on different skills to be able to overcome the three secondary areas. Once the latter have been completed, it is possible to access the final one, where the head of the Rikers who have occupied the studio is located. The commitment required by Signal Interrupted is by no means trivial, both in the three initial phases and in the final one. In the latter in particular, it is necessary for the team to coordinate as best as possible to be able to protect the hostage agents of the Rikers, while simultaneously facing the incoming enemies.", "date": "2017-03-07", "grade": "8.0"}
