{"name": "Revolve8", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/revolve8-recensione.html", "text": "Revolve8 is a project involving some stars of the Japanese gaming industry (a few names: Masayoshi Kikuchi from the Yakuza series, the illustrator Ryota-H, the composers Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Yasunori Mitsuda, as well as the creative genius of Koji Igarashi) with the aim to create a mobile strategy capable of competing on the same ground as the blockbuster Clash Royale. Available in the traditional freemium format for iOS and Android devices, the game looks like a real clone of the Supercell title, re-proposing its structure, mechanics and even the progression system, only by declining everything on a horizontal rather than vertical basis. A rich and extensive roster, made up of a myriad of characters belonging to the world of fantasy, reinterpreted for the occasion by Ryota-H's pencil, therefore competes in eleven cups, each characterized by a different scenario, accessible on the base of our ranking. The matches last three minutes, during which our objective will be to destroy the main tower located in the area of the screen controlled by the opponent, protected by two secondary towers and obviously by the units that the other player will place on the ground to counter us and attempt the same enterprise; all strictly in an online multiplayer context. After a fairly complete tutorial, which illustrates the simple rules behind the games, the characters and the use of the decks, we find ourselves ready to start and compete to level up in Revolve8, gradually unlocking new heroes and upgrading those already in our possession thanks to double cards: all exactly as in the aforementioned Clash Royale. The only differences are in the greater endowment of maps and in the possibility of indicating a team captain, so as to be able to take advantage of the special rechargeable ability: a maneuver that can make the difference in battle and which changes according to the unit. Gameplay and structure Anyone who has already played with Clash Royale will immediately feel at home with Revolve8, which as mentioned is a clone of the Supercell product in which only the view of the map changes substantially, not framed vertically but horizontally. It is certainly a useful solution to enhance the design of the characters, really very beautiful and embellished by cel shading, even if the small size compared to the scenario does not help in this sense. The interface between one duel and another is also strongly derivative (but not very clear at first, a bit intricate in navigation), with the four slots in which to ~mature~ the unlocked chests before being able to open them and the options for managing the deck, with the possibility of replacing any unit and enhancing those of which we have ~duplicates~, by spending a lot of virtual coins. The shadow of pay to win inevitably hovers over such a setting, even if during our tests we never came across unbalanced situations, on the contrary we managed to proceed without major problems and unlock new maps, not so much thanks to us as well as to the demerit of foreign opponents who are clearly novices with an experience of this type. Whatever the area of origin of the contenders, Revolve8 manages to keep the quality of the matches fairly constant and the traditional soft launch has certainly contributed to increasing the user base of the game, in fact it takes just a few seconds to find a game and have fun . The options allow you to adjust the graphics in different ways so that everything runs at its best on your device, and on iPhone X we were able to set both the detail and the fluidity to the maximum, enjoying a very pleasant visual experience, embellished by cutscenes (skippable, if desired) that accompany the execution of the special moves. The scenarios offer a respectable glance and are introduced by always different sequences, but in practice they turn out to be identical: their function is only to be the background to the matches, which structurally do not change one iota. The sound accompaniment is beautiful and engaging, with many dialogues in Japanese that contribute to creating a different, peculiar atmosphere for the SEGA production.", "date": "2019-02-11", "grade": "8.0"}
