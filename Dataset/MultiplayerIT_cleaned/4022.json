Whatever happens, life goes on relentlessly. People change, situations evolve, and sometimes existence itself takes completely unexpected turns or inevitable. The ~sliding doors~ effect is always around the corner. He looks at us mockingly, waiting for the fateful question to be uttered: ~and if I could go back, what would happen?~. But what in real life would turn out to be mere wasted time, ode to spilled milk, in the world of video games can sometimes have a constructive effect on the narrative and beyond. In some cases, in fact, the ineluctability of the passing of time served as an input also from an interactive point of view. The first example that comes to mind - perhaps even the one par excellence - is Braid, but it is also worth remembering titles such as Singularity, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Life is Strange, and why not, even the brilliant level of Dishonored 2 set in the villa of Aramis Stilton. In its own way, each of these approaches originates from an ancestral desire of the human being: that of failing an immutable rule of existence. The Gardens Between is also moving in a similar direction: the pretty puzzle-based adventure developed by The Voxel Agents reworks and makes the theme of time its own, with an all in all simple but well thought out approach. With the arrival on the market of the Nintendo Switch edition, available for a few weeks on the eShop, we seized the opportunity to write a review, and here are our impressions. A puzzle game in which memories must be reconstructed The Gardens Between is a work in which the main theme of the story revolves around the concept of friendship. Arina and Frendt are projected into an alternative and surreal reality, where the reconstruction of memories takes place by controlling the flow of time. The strongly dreamlike dimension that distinguishes each level in which the player has to immerse himself is marked by the multitude of objects that belonged to the daily life of the two young people. A bicycle, a game console and a PC, a tree house or a cassette recorder: everything responds to a specific purpose, and it is there because in some way it is part of the journey that has linked the two protagonists in the first part of their life. And so Arine and Frendt embark on a journey full of feelings, where the memories left engraved in the memory alternate with all those moments that, in spite of themselves, they will have to leave behind. The story told in The Gardens Between does not use dialogues: the visual representation, entrusted to those fleeting frames that can be unlocked after completing each section of the game, is the only tool the developers have used. The shots have precisely the function of reconstructing the relationship that unites the two characters: a bond born at an early age, forged by the fact of having grown up together, day after day, event after event. The successful soundtrack also takes care of supporting the gaming experience, which with discretion and a certain tact manages to feed that genuine sense of investigation that makes its way, one step at a time, after completing each single path. Time goes by and doesn't stop for an hour... or maybe not! The adventure represented in The Gardens Between doesn't involve directly controlling the two boys who are facing us, but the passage of time. By moving the left stick of the pad, to the right or to the left, it is possible to intervene in the flow of events, changing the position or function of some objects, unlocking levers, buttons or passages that at first glance would seem to be precluded. During the journey, the destinies of the two protagonists are connected: precisely because the player is not able to manage their movements directly, they must inevitably move together, heading forward or backward on a fixed path that has yet to be interpreted. Arina can carry a lantern, inside which a small luminous sphere is housed. This light proves indispensable to progress towards the end of each level. Frendt, on the other hand, is in charge of activating specific buttons with which he can go and change the positioning or status of various objects located nearby. By combining the prerogatives of both characters, it is therefore possible to intervene concretely on what happens, reworking the predefined path until identifying what may be the only winning combination. Each level is conceived as a sort of independent and self-contained small island. The shot flows clockwise and counterclockwise, transmitting that sense of cyclicality which is precisely the foundation of the experienceience play offered. The effective background music accompanies the passage of time, punctuating every situation without ever ending up over the top but not losing incisiveness either. Taking into account the fact that the puzzles have been properly balanced, everything flows in relaxed tones and with a certain grace, to the point of enticing the player to complete the path in small doses and without haste. A pinch of intuition and patience are certainly needed, but after understanding the approach of the game, the levels follow one another without ever being excessively obvious or vice versa annoyingly frustrating.", "date": "2018-10-08", "grade": "8.0"}
