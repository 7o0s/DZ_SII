It was like this on Game Cube, it was on Wii and the episode seems to repeat itself without stopping even with Nintendo Switch. There is no doubt that every title that arrived on the latest Nintendo home console has managed to create new experiences thanks to portability, and the stock of titles that has currently been chosen to flesh out the library seems to do its job well. From the ferocious Doom to the voracious Skyrim, portability has always represented that indispensable foothold to justify and praise versions that were technically not up to their counterparts seen on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On the one hand the mere brute power and on the other the possibility of fully enjoying the contents on the go, in complete freedom while tackling long journeys or short journeys on public transport. The variety of experiences on Switch is really interesting and this Dragon Quest Builders, unfortunately, fails in the task of clearing the genre on the console, given that only a few weeks ago the more than discreet Portal Knights had already peeped out. The competition is therefore fierce and the porting does not seem to present any relevant novelty such as to justify a new purchase. Will the cost be the same? Black fog Dragon Quest Builders has already been reviewed at the time of its release on the Sony home console and there are very few changes made to the game scaffolding for the new iteration. Indeed we would say almost none, so as to make this version seem like a one-to-one porting of its previous appearances. And on closer inspection, it doesn't go that far: in terms of content, a few new materials have been added, useful for embellishing the game world and giving it an 8-bit appearance, and the real highlight is a rideable creature that will allow you to move faster for the game map, as well as a limited mode in terms of free building space. Neither more nor less. In short, Dragon Quest Builders is the same game that you enjoyed on the Sony consoles and which, in the transition to Nintendo Switch, then lost in resolution going from 1080p and 60 fps fixed to 720p and 60 fps in dock mode, to drop further to thirty frames per second when the console switches to handheld mode. After having played it for a long time, however, we feel like reassuring you: the overall experience has not been affected and the slowness of the gameplay allows you to fully enjoy even a less fluidity. As usual then there is no problem with the reduced resolution, given that on the console screen the differences are almost imperceptible compared to the past. If you want to nitpick, you notice a less vibrant use of effects, slightly less defined shadows and even the line of sight is slightly reduced, small compromises to adapt the title to the limited power of Switch. Some slight improvements have instead been made to the camera, which now goes crazy with much less frequency during your raids in the dungeons, although it is still not absolutely perfect. We also didn't really appreciate the third-person view during the construction of the houses, which often led us to place an unwanted block by mistake and have to quickly destroy it to rebuild in the right place. A trifle probably, but which has happened to us a little too often not to mention it in the review phase. Defects precisely tolerable in the overall picture. Is it still worth it? Without going around too much, Dragon Quest Builders is a game that came out six months ago and buying it again on Switch will not bring any added value. If you have already devoured it on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation Vita, the purchase is therefore superfluous, but if it is the first time you hear about it or you intend to get your hands on it, well, things change drastically. Dragon Quest Builders is in fact a sort of well-packaged Minecraft, a Portal Knights with a fascinating and easy-to-follow story, a title capable of taking the best of current competing productions and mixing them expertly in a mix that works and entertains from the very first minutes, tutorial excluding. The story told is rather trivial initially but develops quickly through interesting choices. The Dragonlord steals humanity's ability to build, and only you, an unknown brave awakened from a mysterious slumber, seem to have retained this ability. From here on you will have a whole series of well-defined and linear quests to follow to bring light back to the world, rebuildand villages and towns and secure all the missing citizens. The title does not offer the same freedom as Minecraft and for this very reason, however, it carves out its very specific niche, outlining a structure that always accompanies the player by the hand, obviously leaving him the possibility to indulge himself but also allowing him to never feel lost during the game. evolution of events. There is another great strength and it is the consistency with the brand, the recognizability of the character design and the monsters we are going to face and also a simplistic combat system that is equally able to entertain the players, without shining. Carefully following the missions is a useful way to get prepared to face the final battle that will present itself at the end of each chapter and at the top of which, unfortunately, the need will become clear to abandon everything you have done up to that moment to move on to next region: the only real big regret of a production that can easily walk on its own legs.", "date": "2018-02-07", "grade": "8.0"}
