You may remember it for the embarrassing commentator who accompanied its presentation during the last Electronic Entertainment Expo, exalting himself for a five-hit combo, but Novarama Company's fighting game, beyond its quality, which as you can guess by glancing at the vote it is exactly excellent, at least it deserves attention for a series of features that its most illustrious competitors don't have, all based on some peculiar functions of the new Sony portable system. Hence, Reality Fighters fits better as one of those titles designed specifically to launch a new console by advertising its salient features, around which a game has actually been built. The problem is that this game is not much fun... Give face, take away face... If nothing else, now you can make one of your most exciting dreams come true. Next time you meet your mother-in-law, ask her to take a picture of her with PlayStation Vita because you love her so much you want to take her with you always. Later, you'll be able to cast Reality Fighters and use your beloved mother-in-law's face to customize a fighter that you'll pump up whenever you feel the need to let off steam. Because this is the main feature of Reality Fighters: it allows you to create your personal fighter, replacing his face with a photo taken with the console of yourself or friends and relatives. It is obvious that, starting from these assumptions, it is impossible to take a game of this type seriously, and in fact the character creation menu tends to remind us with a series of absolutely crazy costumes and accessories with which it is possible to adorn the polygonal model in question. While remaining within certain limits, the editor is quite satisfactory and allows you to modify, among other things, the size and voice of the character, in order to make it more similar - or different! - possible to the original. Another important option in the character editor concerns his personal set of special moves: the player can choose one of the available styles, which are then those of the predefined characters, ranging from famous martial arts such as kung-fu to completely invented. Here the donkey falls, however, because it is not possible to choose the special moves individually and each style has only a handful of techniques available which certainly do not allow who knows what combinations or attack strategies. It is at this point that the totally casual and superficial nature of the Reality Fighters fighting game becomes really evident, when you enter the ring perhaps playing the demented Story mode, led by Pat Morita, the legendary Miyagi master of Karate Kid: the animations all in all convincing some characters are at odds, pardon the pun, with a physics and a system of collisions that are anything but precise, a decidedly serious flaw for a game of this genre. Playstation 3 trophies To unlock the 18 Bronze, 5 Silver, 6 Gold and the ever-present Platinum Trophies, players will need to have the guts and patience to fully explore the game, for example by completing the various offline modes, defeating a certain number of online players and by collecting the objects, clothes and styles present in the game. Parallel realities None of the game modes offered by Reality Fighters shines for originality or depth: in addition to the very weak Story (moreover, the plot is the same for any character) we can try our hand at the traditional Survival, Time Trial and Quick Fight. To these are added a multiplayer mode that allows you to challenge an opponent locally or online, even if we doubt that the pool of interested players will be able to remain large for long. In no case, however, can you feel satisfaction in facing fights in which you have the clear sensation of winning or losing by pressing random keys: for some reason the response to player inputs, even through the touch-screen, is slow and vaguely inaccurate. Most of the special moves, quite simply, are not reproduced instantly and one ends up relying above all on normal hits and the modest combos granted by their random chaining. To further aggravate the situation there are also an inconstant frame-rate and the questionable effectiveness of augmented reality. The latter problemit deserves a somewhat clearer explanation; augmented reality seems to be a trend lately and it has already been implemented in some software for Nintendo 3DS in a more or less useful way. In Reality Fighters it is possible to basically transform any real scenario into a combat arena, both in photos and taken on the spot by the camera of the Sony console. The initial impact is really pleasant, above all because some special moves of the wrestlers tend to alter the scenario, for example by distorting the battlefield. However, a few minutes are enough to realize how harmful this feature is, which involves a whole series of problems, often random, which affect the already disappointing gaming experience. Beyond the often unbalanced proportions of the wrestlers in relation to the elements of the captured image, the most serious problem is that the software does not recognize elements such as walls or obstacles, letting the polygonal models cross them carelessly and effectively breaking the illusion of augmented reality.", "date": "2012-02-24", "grade": "4.0"}
