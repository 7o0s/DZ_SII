Which doesn't necessarily represent a problem, on the contrary: the reviews are also used to let you discover news that otherwise would soon end up forgotten. Beyond its belonging to a niche genre, however, Battle Brothers did not really want to know about ending up on the sidelines, on the contrary: since its exclusive launch on the PC (via Steam) in the now distant 2017, it has continued to update . So much so that the revised version now debuts on Nintendo Switch, optimized and complete with several interesting DLCs, which expand an already incredibly long-lived offer. But let's go in order, after reminding you that Battle Brothers is available on consoles, but exclusively on the Grande N console, at a price of 27.99 euros (which becomes 58.98 if you are interested in other optional, very substantial expansions). . Gameplay: A tactical RPG Battle Brothers: the mercenaries on the game map during a fight Let's start from the most interesting aspects of the production, and precisely from the gameplay: that of UKIYO Publishing and Overhype Studios is a tactical RPG to begin with. But this is just a label: specifically, the play offer is quite complex, and perhaps for this reason also satisfying. First of all, the player finds himself controlling an army of mercenaries: he starts with a few men and then can hire more and more (and more powerful) in exchange for gold. The role-playing element has its why, given that each of these individual (potentially infinite) characters can be equipped, customized, modified and upgraded properly. Half of the soul of Battle Brothers therefore consists of the RPG component, on which we will return in great detail. But the gameplay is completed on the other side of the coin, namely in tactics, because it is precisely a tactical RPG. Both the exploration of the game map and (above all) the individual battles take place within a freely explorable grid, where every move is never (and must never be) random. In short, the player has to think about practically every aspect before making his move, whether he is taking a look at the surroundings of a village or a forest, or fighting. In order not to make the use of the open world frustrating, here it is at least possible to pause or speed up the passage of time. The world of Battle Brother, to be more precise, proceeds on its own: day and night alternate, just as atmospheric events and the appearance of some occasional events enrich the whole with a further random factor. Game world and atmosphere Battle Brothers: Remarkable atmosphere, as you will notice The Battle Brothers game world is probably one of the aspects that helps to always keep the buyer's attention alive. Partly also due to the charm it exerts in itself, which in any case is not negligible: the title is set in a fantasy world with medieval hues, or it would be more correct to say in a sort of European Middle Ages with fantastic hues. Mercenaries, monasteries, fortified citadels and vast forests full of pitfalls alternate with undead, orcs, magic and all the other aspects that you could legitimately expect. Therefore, if in battle you eliminate what appears to be a simple bandit or a mercenary, well ... it does not mean that it cannot suddenly rise again. Many of the DLCs and expansions, by the way, return to insist on these fantastic elements. The atmosphere is also enhanced by the unpredictability associated with each match. One player's adventure will never be the same as another's, only vaguely similar and based on the same underlying elements. This is because Battle Brothers, in its being an open world tactical RPG, is also based on a procedurally generated game map. And therefore the names of the cities, their locations, the extent of plains or mountains are not predictable before starting a new game. Now imagine how much all this benefits the replayability factor, even considering that a single adventure can last many hours, depending on the actions on which the player will focus. And also considering that the individual elements of the gameplay are in almost perfect synergy with each other. Personalization and potential Battle Brothers - one of the game cities The customization, in Battle Brothers, goes very naturally with the depth of the individual game elements; each of them, in reality, deserves a specific treatment, which is logically impossible here. But let's take the individual mercenaries as an example, i.e. the playable characters they will make upo the player's party: beyond the pre-assigned ones, it is always possible to recruit new ones in the population centers of the world. Here you will notice that each present shows a certain recruitment price, but not only that: it also has its own nice narrative context. Battle Brothers: Did Someone Say Customization? Let's explain it even better, to fully understand the potential of the whole. You won't immediately understand which weapon enhances a particular new character. You will have to understand his parameters (guess them) from his personal history, which will be full of specific clues. If a woodcutter has decided to take up the profession of weapons, it is very probable that he is inclined to wield flails and clubs, with parameters oriented towards strength and resistance, therefore. A thief, guess what, will certainly not be skilled in frontal assault, and will love to wield knives. This as a basis; but after each battle the player receives considerable loot, and experience points divided by individual participants based on their usefulness in the battle. From here it will be possible to enhance the secondary skills, divided into attack, defense and support. In this way, over the hours, every single character will be different from all the others in practically every aspect. The conversion to Nintendo Switch Battle Brothers: The Nintendo Switch conversion doesn't excel at control mapping And here is the sore point of this version of Battle Brothers: the conversion on Nintendo Switch. Now, let it be clear that never as in this case is it a production conceived, developed and oriented towards the PC: you need a mouse, you need a keyboard with a choice of several quick keys; this is evident. After all, however, it does not mean that even the most reluctant console productions cannot be adapted with a little intelligence. Only Battle Brothers hasn't been intelligently adapted. On balance you will end up with screens identical to those present on the PC, with very small characters and texts, especially when playing in portability, and a very anti-functional mapping. It almost seems that the developers have taken the game, moved it to Nintendo Switch and finally reassigned keys for each action, going a bit good. From time to time the inconvenience is not evident: for example in the basic actions of the fights, or in the simple navigation of the game world. But try to sift through the details, want to get to a specific screen of a certain aspect of the game that is not highlighted: good luck finding the right command, or the specific way. Besides, why the hell does everyone forget to use the touch screen? Nintendo Switch has it, dammit.", "date": "2021-03-11", "grade": "8.0"}
