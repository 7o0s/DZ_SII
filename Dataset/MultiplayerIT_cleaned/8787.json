Waiting for that Steel Battalion, which seems to really go further, here comes this little game for Live Arcade, son of the same team that gave birth to Parappa the Rapper, which, for only 800 MP, puts us in the shoes of a adventurer who ends up in a haunted villa and who makes us do a few things, but very nice and full of inventiveness. GhostLightBuster Invited to this strange villa, we soon end up in a basement, accompanied by the old owner, a ghost who has remained imprisoned in the rather disturbing paintings that hang from the walls and from which he speaks to us explaining where to go in order, apparently, to be able to escape from the house after having recovered a series of ghostly gems, stolen by the ethereal inhabitants of the mansion. At the beginning, the only weapon at our disposal is a torch which is directed by pointing one of the two arms and which orients the camera when its light beam is pushed to the ends of the screen. To move in the direction in which the camera is pointing, you have to walk on the spot (or run when required), while to retreat, simply move one of your legs backwards. Just the walk constitutes the most unpleasant aspect of Haunt, which does not last more than four hours of play, during which, however, much of the time is spent walking on the spot and, since it is a real game, even the whole family, you may want to finish it in a couple of sessions, inevitably tiring you. Especially after that in Rise of Nightmares or Disneyland Adventures the programmers have found much more comfortable methods to advance, it is sad that the team has not been able to adopt one of the two systems in progress, making their game much more palatable . In Haunt you fight and the first ghosts are eliminated by stunning them with melee shots, avoiding their assaults by bending over and then lighting them up until they disappear. Along the way, however, facing a series of rooms divided into three different areas, you learn a series of special abilities, which end up being the funniest and most curious reason to play Haunt: the power to shout, which makes us eliminate enemies speaking to Kinect, which samples the voice in real time and reproduces it in game with a ghost effect applied or that of painting which is used to chain enemies by mimicking the gesture of a brush stroke on the screen, for example. During the game we are asked to cover our eyes so as not to be dazzled, to plug our ears to shelter from the excruciating screams of our opponents and a couple of other movements that represent the gems of a little game made with care. Xbox 360 goals 200 points like all Arcade games also for Haunt. About half are obtained by finishing the short story and a little more by completing some of the sub-quests or toying with some of the game's surprises. A non-demanding undertaking, even if you have to devote yourself to finding all the newspaper clippings that tell the story of the house. Scary! We have already talked about the Haunt walk and also about the creative use that is made of the Kinect features in the fights with the ghosts. There is not only this, given that small gems and interactions are dispensed, perhaps too sparingly (that is, there are not many of them), throughout the game, which, as mentioned, is not very extensive. For the rest, however, the overall experience is both fun and rewarding and helps, in its own way, to understand what are the things that, with a little effort and time, can be done with Kinect and this type of peripheral . From saying your name to open doors, to hurling your photographs around the house, there are more moments that manage to amuse and surprise. Even the graphic aspect is taken care of in its simplicity with a good system of lights and discreet models of ghosts and objects to be explored to find the secrets, while remaining very bare environments, even if well characterized. The whole game is subtitled in Italian, as are all the menu texts in Italian. Of the sound accompaniment, we remember little and this should tell you how much it may have surprised us.", "date": "2012-02-01", "grade": "7.8"}
