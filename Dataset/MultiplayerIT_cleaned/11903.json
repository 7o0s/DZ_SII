{"name": "SolaRola", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/solarola.html", "text": "Although the gameplay mechanics are substantially the same, SolaRola differs clearly from LocoRoco at least in terms of the storyline. The protagonists of the game are in fact Wiz and Waz, two colored blobs who travel in deep space aboard a spaceship: here they receive a request for help from a bizarre three-eyed alien, who begs them to save the universe from the clutches of the evil Ping. From this point begins the role of the player, who will command the rolling Waz during 25 levels set in as many planets with rather improbable names. Like LocoRoco, SolaRola also boasts minimalist and at the same time irresistible graphics: the settings are all made up of elementary but very colorful geometric figures, and the funny protagonist moves on the screen with really excellent animations, which perfectly give an idea of ~ gummy~. The combination between simplicity and effectiveness is a combination that in Solarola is not limited to the graphics sector alone, but invests the Eidos production also in terms of gameplay, starting with a one-thumb control system that is as essential as it is convincing: the game exploits the only right and left arrows for movement on the two-dimensional plane, plus the OK key to make Waz perform a jump. With such a slender structure, the weight falls entirely on the level design, which fortunately in SolaRola is of truly excellent quality: by exploiting a handful of elements and combining them in different ways during the stages, the Progressive Media title is in fact able to provide the There's something new in each level, keeping interest and the fun factor high. During his adventure, therefore, Waz will come across a series of objects (vines to hang from with his mouth, trampolines to jump on, rocks to roll, bombs to push towards destructible walls and so on) whose use will change depending on the situation intelligently studied by the developers. Not a small merit, which makes SolaRola a truly unique experience in the mobile panorama and which above all allows you to appreciate every single centimeter of the game's 25 stages. Which, to be honest, are all too short, even if a difficulty level with an extremely steep pace avoids the danger of completing the adventure in a short time. As a final treat, SolaRola presents something that few mobile games can boast: a soundtrack worthy of the name, composed by the Maniacs of Noise and which is completely pleasant without ever being repetitive or annoying. Pros: Extremely simple, fun and varied Apt graphics and refined sound Curated in every respect Against: Levels a bit short The influence of LocoRoco is all too evident", "date": "2007-10-24", "grade": "S.V."}
