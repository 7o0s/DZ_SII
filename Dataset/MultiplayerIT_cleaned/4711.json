Then came the leaks, the E3 presentation, the interviews with the development team, and hands-on testing and everything changed. What at first glance might have seemed like a second-rate toy has turned out to be a painstakingly curated project, an expression of the love that the Ubisoft Milan guys feel for Nintendo and its pillars, capable of re-proposing a genre on the market that is now very little represented in the landscape - that of turn-based strategy - and to transform it in incredibly stimulating ways. In short, overcoming any preconceptions related to the crazy (but not always very appreciable) rabbits of the French giant, Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle has managed to rightfully earn the limelight and the attention of the entire videogame press. At the center of the stage, however, the spotlights are shooting at a thousand, and it is difficult to hide the defects: will this strange but fascinating creature made in Italy really succeed in deserving the very lucid seal of quality of the good Miyamoto? It's all the washing machine's fault The narrative premise of Mario + Rabbids is certainly not the most original around, but manages to gravitate between the bizarreness of Ubisoft's rabbits and the simplicity of the plots typical of Nintendo products. It all starts from the Rabbids' washing machine/time machine, which ends up by chance in the basement of a brilliant inventor (with a passion for Super Mario), a few moments after the girl has left an extraordinary viewer unattended capable of merging any two objects. Unable to stay calm for more than a nanosecond, the rabbits take possession of the viewer, give life to a ~megabug~ that transports them like a dimensional portal to the kingdom of mushrooms, and involve Mario and friends in this galactic mess, who they were enjoying the quiet unveiling of a statue of Peach. Our people therefore find themselves dealing with a world transformed in unpredictable ways by the bug between dimensions and populated by fully armed Rabbid, in search of a frightened bunny named Spawny who, having merged with the viewer, has the bad habit to create monstrosities of all kinds as soon as it is stimulated. However, the simplicity of the story from which it all begins should not be misleading: Mario +Rabbids is a game that doesn't take itself seriously and focuses on light-hearted humor in a similar way to what Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario did. It's full of hilarious moments, more than worthily written, and shows incredible respect for Nintendo characters. Where the Rabbid are caricatures with which the team has had the opportunity to indulge themselves, all the other protagonists are instead extremely close to their original vision, and keep intact those characteristics that have made them so iconic over the years (even if sometimes they are strongly accentuated) . The result is an adventure that flows well both in the text and in the images, and it is a respectable result, even if the peaks of the aforementioned classics are not reached in this aspect. The only note, curiously, is that it seems that the texts - the team is Italian, we remind you - were written entirely in English and only then translated, since some jokes come out a little battered by the transition from one language to another. Nothing even remotely worrying, however. No aliens, just rabbits However, the colorful events in which Mario + Rabbids catapults the player are only one of its many praiseworthy features, and represent a small part of the whole when compared to the real fulcrum of the project: the gameplay. As already mentioned, in fact, the work of Ubisoft Milan is in all respects a turn-based strategy along the lines of the X-COM series, where the characters fight with firearms and the covers play a fundamental role. However, it is absolutely not the case to think that it is a clone without art or part, which exploits the official Nintendo licenses to make itself beautiful: the game takes the basic mechanics of the genre and turns them inside out, to the point of being completely different from the title which undoubtedly partly inspired it. In fact, where the X-COMs focus largely on the managerial element and on the tension deriving from an increasingly dangerous and uncontainable global crisis, Mario + Rabbids leverages a more contained structure, built in a painstaking way and capable of being equally engaging even if deprived of the permanent death of the characters (which would have been unthinkable seethe heroes involved) and research. It is precisely in being a more structured and contained product that Kingdom Battle finds the strength to compete on equal terms with (and at times surpass) the best exponents of the genre: the battles of the Ubisoft title are always driven in part by randomness, but the percentages are drier and in each map we have to deal with extremely clear covers that offer total or 50% protection respectively, and have various levels of destructibility based on the material (the ice covers collapse in one blow, the metal ones are indestructible, and the rocky ones instead require some resounding broadside to collapse); the only other element left to luck are the special effects of the weapons - also available to enemies - whose percentage increases based on the power of the weapon used. Putting these two factors of the equation aside, we find ourselves grappling with a title that focuses entirely on mobility and allows you to execute magnificently satisfying complex strategies, thanks to a significant diversification of the characters put on the field and to maneuvers that are atypical to say the least for a notoriously ~slow~ genre like the one to which it belongs. Combative leaps Let's explain ourselves better: while normally in turn-based tactical titles both soldiers and enemies can move a few squares, and their agility improves over time within rather large maps, the protagonists of Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle start from immediately with the ability to travel considerable distances, further accentuated by battlefields of not exaggerated dimensions. Around this mobility, the developers have also built offensive mechanics specific to each character, and it is possible to damage opponents freely within the passable area with a slide (even several opponents at once, if the character has an ability that allows). To further accentuate the thing we think about the possibility of performing the ~Salto Team~, a leap that exploits one of the companions as if it were a spring - similar to the infernal catapult of Holly & Benji - and which, in addition to allowing to reach elevated areas , can even damage certain enemies if carefully targeted (although only Yoshi and Mario can do damage in such a way). The beauty is that enemies have similar abilities based on their type, which makes the fights much more frenetic, unpredictable and fun than normal. However, that's not all, since there are other very tasty icing on this mushroom-shaped cake: in fact, the heroes of the game - gradually unlocked from world to world - possess unique powers, which make them fall into specific archetypes that can be combined in various ways. When facing the campaign you are always forced to use Mario (a hero clearly devoted to attack in this title) but his two companions can be selected as desired, provided you have at least one Rabbid in your team. Regardless of the choice made, however, the various abilities have a strong synergy with each other, and it is possible to create devastating combinations of weapon effects, powers and positioning, capable of eliminating in a single turn extremely massive enemies that would have created serious problems if approach normally. The progression of the characters is equally well calculated: the heroes are developed with increasingly powerful weapons that can be purchased with gold coins, while for skills you need globes that can be obtained in scattered chests and by completing battles; every point spent is felt, we assure you, and allows you to respond with ever greater strength to the many threats that the game puts your way. Quality and quantity The variety of enemies is remarkable, and you are practically forced to devise sensible strategies in every battle or you risk quickly succumbing to their blows (there is always a random element to attacks, however, and a few critical hits from opponents in a row can put you in serious trouble). The level of challenge is therefore more than worthy, even if a veteran of the genre will not have major problems cleaning up the main campaign, and will aim more to obtain the maximum rating among those obtainable in each fight. To further increase the stakes there are then challenging bosses and fairly difficult mini-bosses, but, in the awareness of not being able to field a management phase comparable to that of X-COM, Ubisoft Milan has decided to replace it with rich exploratory phases of puzzles, which nicely break up the action. These are not particularly original or complicated puzzles - even if some force you to rack your brain more than expected - yet they manage to be a fillerI am very respectable, because they largely refer to some of the most well-known titles seen on Nintendo consoles: ranging from puzzles with blocks on ice practically identical to those of certain Pokmon gyms to pipes to be moved to make certain areas passable, passing through games of mirrors, activation altars and in general all the manual of the JRPG puzzle, applied with grace to the beautiful worlds of the game. This tendency to pay homage to Nintendo and Japanese gaming is perceived in a crystal clear way also in the artistic direction, of course, which reworks the aesthetics of the Kyoto house in a slightly demented, but at the same time superbly creative key. Each location offered by the title is unique, boasts sudden changes of settings, is enriched by often highly inspired visual inventions and manages to launch itself into quotations without ever exceeding. There is obsessive attention to everything here: animations, models, even the use of color; one sees that it is a work created with an inexhaustible reserve of passion. Bwaaah? Even in terms of content and music we are there: the main campaign can easily occupy about fifteen / twenty hours, but once completed the game offers additional content in every single world, including scattered challenges, secrets that can only be discovered with skills related to exploration and obtained at the end of the various phases (and which we do not want to anticipate) and a whole series of collectibles that can then be easily viewed in the main hub represented by Peach's castle. The soundtrack is instead the work of Grant Kirkhope - former composer of Rare considered among the best in the world in the field - and goes perfectly with the adventure of Mario and company, going from extremely recognizable sounds to equally memorable splendid novelties. Overall, between one thing and another, about thirty hours should fly by easily with this game, especially if you have friends with whom to tackle the cooperative missions that accompany the single player content. They don't differ much from the basic ones, of course, but they have three difficulty levels, allow you to use two teams of two characters each (without the obligation to use Mario this time) and are undoubtedly as well-finished as the rest of the project. But is Mario + Rabbids really flawless? Has Ubisoft Milan seriously managed to create a small masterpiece? The answer is a ~not entirely~ which leaves a little bitterness in the mouth even though the final result is still excellent. There are indeed some imperfections in this title, which prevent it from exploiting its potential to 100%. The first is a slight imbalance in the difficulty curve and characters: the title gradually becomes more difficult as you progress, and the progression, as mentioned, marries brilliantly with this advancement, only that in the worlds there are some difficulty peaks related to the composition of the enemies and the maps, which are sometimes followed by significantly weaker challenges. Furthermore, although it is possible to face and dominate battles with multiple combinations of heroes, there are undoubtedly more dominant characters than others, who minimize the dangers since they are practically devoid of weaknesses if paired (this is particularly easy to notice when they are still halfway through the development). Another problem is the absence of competitive multiplayer: on the one hand we are perfectly aware of the fact that Kingdom Battle is a title focused on the single player experience, but its very particular mix of mechanics would have been a bomb against other players, and it is a pity that there is no such option. On the other hand, very few complaints from a technical point of view: we have practically never encountered any bugs - apart from some crazy shot during the coups de grce - and the only feasible criticism concerns some rare drops in frame rate in certain situations (which for obvious reasons in no way detract from the experience). Just think, even the artificial intelligence is excellent: it follows often repeated patterns but it is aggressive, mobile, bad enough and capable of putting the player in serious difficulty in the most difficult battles.", "date": "2017-08-28", "grade": "8.8"}
