If you recall, we've left Jesse and his friends in the annoying company of Ellegaard and Magnus, two seasoned heroes who bicker with each other like a pair of curmudgeons. Thankfully in episode three we don't get to hear them speak again until the very end when the writers give them a chance to redeem themselves. Our goal now is to find Soren, the fourth companion of the old group of heroes. To find it, we have to start digging. Luckily, the strange amulet Jesse is carrying tells him exactly where to start. From there it's all a keystroke to reveal an amazing underworld. We are only a few minutes into the episode and already we are plunged into a whirlwind of action, with the opening credits mixed with the fights, an effect that Telltale always manages very well. The first thing that struck us is the architectural majesty of the scenarios, created with the Minecraft graphics engine. A clear tribute to the visionary ingenuity of the millions of players who have filled the network with blocky constructions. The pleasure of looking around, together with the pressing rhythm of the scenes, pleasantly transports us to a world made entirely of wool, in which the passage to finally meet Soren is hidden. Between a sword stroke and a dodge, the writers introduce a little introspection into the story. Petra's health deteriorates visibly, and Lukas becomes increasingly restless. Jesse must decide whether to keep Petra a secret and reflect on how important the people around him are. We are not in front of who knows what psychological explorations, but we were pleased to see the characters acquire some depth. A few nice jokes and the funny gag of Axel who always crashes into Lukas' head act as a counterpoint to the most emotional moments, keeping the pace of the game flowing. And when we finally get to know Soren, we're still halfway through the episode. The third installment of Minecraft: Story Mode is more solid and satisfying, but far from greatness Not just Minecraft We were talking about the meeting with Soren. This hero is a builder, so his architectural inspiration goes beyond the funny woolen garden that hides his underground mansion. Once inside his house, it is enough to look around to understand that we are dealing with a somewhat eccentric craftsman. Paranoid, manic, Soren is undoubtedly the funniest character encountered since the beginning of the game. Above all, his entry onto the scene marks the achievement of a minor goal. The player feels the satisfaction of having accomplished something, even though the series is not over yet, and is stimulated to continue towards the new goal: to destroy the final mega enemy. After a long exploratory phase, the action resumes pressing, with new scenarios and even a short submarine sequence. The developers have worked hard to offer a complete episode, without rushed steps. Even the final confrontation, although it may not really be the last, still gives us the feeling of having completed a first narrative arc to the end. Jesse is more self-aware and the group has discovered a new unity. When the final enemy prepares for the second round, a small twist closes the episode and sends us back to the next appointment with the series. The journey up to there was pleasant. Compared to the first two episodes, The Last Place You Look has more jokes that are funny, but not laugh-out-loud, and some genuine, though still very mild, emotion. The voice actors once again prove their talent and both the action and exploration sequences serve the sacred purpose of moving the narrative forward. If we were to compare Minecraft: Story Mode with other Telltale series, the judgment would be harsher. But the target is different, so it is right to take this into account. Let's just hope that the series does not disappoint us at the next meeting.", "date": "2015-11-26", "grade": "6.4"}
