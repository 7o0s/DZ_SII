{"name": "Judgment", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/judgment-recensione-pc.html", "text": "Takayuki Yagami is a lawyer who has decided to abandon the legal profession following a tragedy and to reinvent himself as a private investigator, using not only his knowledge of the underworld of Kamurocho, but also his extraordinary skill with martial arts to carry out any type of assignment without having to pay attention to courtrooms, witnesses, juries and bureaucracy. A very interesting incipit, yet Steam users risked never being able to try their hand at this adventure, given that the agency of the actor who plays the character by Yagami had vetoed a landing of the game on the Windows platform, it is not known for what reason. Fortunately the controversies have been overcome and here we are writing the review of Judgment for PC. History Judgment, the protagonist Takayuki Yagami As mentioned, the story of Judgment revolves around the figure of Takayuki Yagami, a brilliant young lawyer who, after a traumatic event (a boy who had exonerated kills his girlfriend and sets fire to the house) decides to leave the studio where he works and to found an investigative agency together with Masaharu Kaito, a former Yakuza with resolute ways, but with a heart of gold. The two mainly deal with cases of marital infidelity and scams, but one day Kyohei Hamura, captain of the Matsugane family of the Tojo Clan, is accused of killing a man with whom he had an altercation, by ripping out his eyes. As hateful as Hamura is, it seems that he didn't actually commit the murder and Yagami reluctantly decides to investigate to exonerate him and find the real culprit. If you are familiar with the Yakuza series, of which Judgment is in fact a spin-off, you will know that these are experiences characterized by a valuable narrative sector, comparable to that of a mystery novel, full of thick characters, long dialogues assisted by cinematic direction and powerful twists to mark the progression of events. Takayuki Yagami's adventure is no exception and is enhanced by excellent dubbing in both Japanese and English (with the characters' lip adapted to both languages!), but above all by Italian subtitles that truly allow everyone to enjoy the plot and its many facets without missing anything of what is happening on the screen. Structure Judgment, the protagonist on the streets of Kamurocho Even on the structure front, Yakuza fans will not be surprised, in the sense that the Judgment campaign is made up of thirteen chapters that alternate, as per tradition, interlude sequences, exploratory phases, fights and side activities for a duration of almost thirty hours where proceed quickly, but they become over a hundred if you decide to complete all the secondary missions and try your hand at the extras. The Kamurocho setting supports this system in a solid way, showing itself in one of the most detailed and interactive versions ever, with various buildings that can be entered and numerous side activities, ranging from the classic (and now late) SEGA Club with the coin-ops of Virtua Fighter 5, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Motor Raid, Puyo Puyo, Fighting Vipers and the unpublished Kamuro of the Dead, to the OutRun cabinet in Yagami's office, from the inevitable battling center to the places where you can try your hand at darts, Mahjong, Shogi and cards. Judgment, Takayuki and Mafuyu To these mini-games are added some tantalizing new features, such as drone racing through the streets of the neighborhood and a virtual reality arcade application that mixes fights and movements on a game of the goose-style board, to finally arrive at the dating component of Judgment: between one mission and another, the charming Takayuki will meet girls with whom he will be able to establish a relationship, going out with them, buying them gifts and making the relationship grow. The original Judgment was released in 2019, but structurally incorporates the mechanics of the Yakuza series, born in 2005), which the authors have tried to reinforce through the introduction of investigative elements that we will see shortly, the package boasts great substance and the price of the Steam version, equal to  39.99, is the same proposed for the PS5 edition, released last year. Gameplay Judgment, a fight sequence The gameplay of Judgment is that of the classic episodes of Yakuza, as mentioned: a mix of narration, exploration and action combat which in itself is rather linear (the objectives are always indicated on the screen, perhaps simplifying the progression too much), but which as I said I was bornmaking it a mine of extra content with which to try your hand between one investigation and another. Speaking of investigations, it is precisely the novelty of the profession of the protagonist to bring with him some unpublished element, in this case the tailings, the camera phone to identify details or take photos that we can then exhibit as evidence within Phoenix Wright-style dialogues, interrogations in which to choose the right questions to ask, the use of the drone to fly through the streets of Kamurocho in search of specific targets and the search for objects within certain places. Judgment, the dialogue options These are mechanics implemented in a not very convinced way, but which nevertheless give the experience a different flavor compared to the adventures of Kazuma Kiryu and are effectively linked to the figure of the investigator, also and above all as regards the development of a plot to which, as already mentioned, there is no shortage of powerful twists. As for the fights, Tak can alternate between two different fighting styles, Crane and Tiger, ideal respectively for clashes with multiple opponents and for bosses. Both positions can be enriched by unlocking extra maneuvers from the inevitable skill tree, using the experience points obtained up to that moment. The management of vital energy is the one we know well, with the various restaurants where you can order something for recover health as well as pills and snacks to carry with you for an instant health recovery, even in the middle of a fight. The exceptions are mortal wounds, which require special care. The PC version Judgment, the graphics options of the PC version The graphic options of the PC version of Judgment are not extraordinarily numerous, it is true, but they are enough and advance in order to scale the experience on the less powerful configurations: they range from the resolution to the vertical sync, from the frame cap (also unlocked) to the advanced adjustments , which include texture filtering, shadow and geometry quality, real-time reflections, volumetric fog, SSAO and anti-aliasing. Most importantly, the game includes both an effective resolution scaler, thus allowing you to get 4K output even if the Real pixel count is lower in percentage, both support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 and 2.0. Well, unlike Marvel's Spider-Man, in this case the resampling technologies work very effectively, increasing performance by up to 20% without sacrificing much quality. Judgment, a look at the visual richness of Kamurocho at night According to our tests, running Judgment on an RTX 3070 at 4K and with all settings maxed out produces a frame rate generally equal to 40 fps. To reach the 60 stable frames it is possible to carry out a series of tests to understand which presets to lower or, for simplicity, to act on the effective resolution. With the scaler you have to go down to 80% to be on the safe side, getting almost a real 1800p, while with AMD FSR 2.0 you just need to activate the ~quality~ preset in order to get the same result. In direct comparison, the images captured at real 4K and those with AMD FSR 2.0 differ in the sharpness of the details, but it's not easy to notice it with the naked eye, in movement and with a 100% magnification: you have to study the image by zooming in. True, we are still talking about a title that runs on the Dragon Engine, but the PS4 original had major frame rate problems, a sign of the greater visual richness compared to the various Yakuzas released up to that point. Judgment, the stalking is one of the novelties of the game We find all these additional details in the Kamurocho scenario, which, as mentioned, is presented in Judgment with one of its densest and most sophisticated versions, particularly fascinating during the night phases, also thanks to the screen space reflection of the neon signs on the puddles, while during the day it loses something but it doesn't feel flat as it happened previously in the SEGA series games. That said, the polygonal models boast an excellent quality, especially during the cutscenes, and the protagonist can count on a large set of animations. The dialogues in both Japanese and English are very well interpreted, although the best way to enjoy such an experience is to activate the Japanese voices with Italian subtitles. As always, the soundtrack is excellent.", "date": "2022-09-17", "grade": "8.4"}
