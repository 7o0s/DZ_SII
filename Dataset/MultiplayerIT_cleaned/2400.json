{"name": "Spiderman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spiderman.html", "text": "Instead he came back in better shape than before! The game system is structured in such a way as to offer a dynamic and at the same time precise view in order to allow the player to carry out the movements in the best way. Spiderman's abilities and powers have been faithfully reproduced. Instead he came back in better shape than before! You can therefore take advantage of the various jets of cobwebs both to stun enemies and to move from one building to another. Furthermore, it will also be possible to walk on the walls of the buildings, on the walls and on the vault of the rooms in order to use the various ducts to access locations that would otherwise be unreachable. Instead he came back in better shape than before! Functions relating to the use of webs are performed by the Y button, while the direction is calculated using the D-Pad. So if you want to throw a web just press the Y button, while if you want to use it to reach a nearby building you will have to press Y and hold Up on the D-Pad. The cobwebs play their fundamental role especially outside the fights: they actually allow the most unthinkable movements. Get ready for a new adventure to be experienced! Graphically the game is well done. The camera system is well made. You will have a camera with a well-defined angle of view able to follow the movements of the spider-man in the way that best suits you. Get ready for a new adventure to be experienced! However, sometimes the view jumps quickly from one camera angle to another causing you to momentarily lose orientation. However, these drawbacks rarely occur and do not compromise the overall good workmanship of the game. Get ready for a new adventure to be experienced! The settings are rich in detail and have well-crafted textures that make them very realistic. Noteworthy is the creation of movies in FMV: they are frequent and have graphics and sound worthy of a real movie. Spiderman moves without slowing down with fast, precise and realistic movements and is equipped with all the powers that compete in the comic. The AI of the enemies is enough to make them dangerous especially when they attack in groups. Get ready for a new adventure to be experienced! In any case, the difficulty of taking down a final boss is never too high and therefore you will be able to complete the game in a short time. The soundtrack is made up of music with somewhat weak tones compared to the dynamism of the action. The sound effects, on the other hand, are well done and very realistic. In conclusion! Fans of the series will greatly appreciate the work done by Activision to bring their paladin to the Dreamcast, the game offers the possibility of healthy hours of entertainment even to the uninitiated of the famous hero with an easy web. Pros: Easy control and smooth movements for fast and engaging action Well-crafted environments A must for fans of the comic series Cons: A little underwhelming soundtrack It will take you little time to understand all the secrets and complete each level But hadn't they killed him? Although the Dreamcast is already considered by everyone as an antique due to the cessation of the production of the latter by Sega a few months ago, the production of games has not stopped at all and indeed is continuing booming with the release of really interesting titles. One of them is definitely Spiderman. After the PlayStation release, Activision decided to bring the popular spider-man to the Dreamcast and the result wasn't bad at all. Surely the most obvious improvement has been made in the graphics even if the game is essentially based on the version released for PsOne. Activision has created a very enjoyable platform with Spiderman from the point of view of playability and overall good workmanship.", "date": "2001-09-24", "grade": null}
