{"name": "Ciao ciao half-pipe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127688-olliolli-ciao-ciao-half-pipe.html", "text": "The vast majority of skateboarding games, from Trashers to California Games, via classics such as 720 or Skate or Die, have almost always offered the player a closed structure, made up of half-pipes, ramps and railings to be exploited for neck-breaking tricks. All in all, the attempts at urban free roaming seen in Skate and Tony Hawk also recall this idea of a huge closed playground, albeit in a more articulated and wide-ranging form. With OlliOlli, the London developer Roll7 instead wanted to try a rather different approach, clearly taking inspiration from Canabalt and derivatives but being careful not to find a trivial running game with the skate in your hands. Grinding non-stop From the more classic running games, OlliOlli inherits above all the horizontal structure of each level, which must be crossed from left to right in an attempt to reach the finish line (all in one piece). There wouldn't be anything particularly new or interesting about jumping over obstacles along the way, except that underneath the surface OlliOlli remains just as much a skate game as any of the aforementioned. The score is sovereign, the multiplier a treasure to protect: before finishing the level, you have to take advantage of every ramp, every railing, but also every single dead moment to perform some tricks and pocket a handful of points. Easy, in words. Since you can only chain combos until you land with the table, the player is encouraged to ~grind~ on every single railing, and even some levels are designed in such a way as to be completed with a single and endless combo. Initially conceived for the touch screen of smartphones, OlliOlli became an exclusive for PlayStation Vita during construction, and subsequently landed on all other PCs and consoles. A decision that had a radical impact on the control system and, consequently, over the entire gameplay of the game. Since your alter ego travels quickly in complete autonomy, the analog stick is used exclusively for jumping, grinding and performing various tricks; in addition you can then press one of the bumpers to rotate in mid-air, which makes everything more risky but allows you to take home a lot of extra points. Everything would still be too simple if it weren't for the need to ~close~ each chain of combos with the pressure of a key: if you forget or press it too early, then many greetings to the points collected with that series of tricks. The timing with which you land or initiate a grind is crucial, because a perfect impact not only gives you more points, but also allows you to increase your speed, unlike awkward landings that slow down the skater and do not allow him to jump for a few instant. Always the same button can be pressed to give a push with the foot, and this means that, just like in Adam Atomic's running game, you traverse the level at a variable speed, thus creating a better paced and more interesting experience. And speaking of rhythm, one cannot fail to mention the absolutely spot-on soundtrack, with some rare decreases in intensity but which in principle swings successfully between electronic and dubstep. Skate game or running game? OlliOlli is Tony Hawk meets Canabalt PSVita trophies The Trophies offered by OlliOlli are decidedly predictable, considering the genre they belong to: they range from accumulating a certain score or pushing the multiplier to x25, completing all the missions or performing 1000 perfect grinds. We would have liked to see something more original, like ~Perform a 180 after grinding on Godzilla's tail at midnight on Friday~. Differently simple However, what OlliOlli certainly does not lack is charisma. Its pixel art may be simplistic or unsophisticated, but you can't help but get excited as you traverse a neon-lit city, grinding on Godzilla's tail and listening to dubstep music. The first minutes give the feeling of being faced with an all too simple game, but once you get used to it, all those finishes and design attentions that distinguish the Roll7 title emerge. Not to mention that the more advanced levels are quite difficult already on the Amateur difficulty, with small platforms, bursts of grind and carpets of quills between one jump and another. The Pro difficulty is unlocked by completing a series of missions ranging from collecting all the spray cans along the way or getting a certain amount of points with a single combo. As if that weren't enough, the more masochistic players can try to complete all the objectives in both difficulty levels to access aan even more complex option, which is accompanied by the appeal of the online rankings and, above all, of the daily challenges: in fact, a special route is proposed every day, and players from all over the world have a single attempt each to complete it with the most points. In short, not only is OlliOlli a title that is anything but easy, but it is also an ideal experience for short hit and run sessions, destined to occupy a fixed space in the memory of your console. Stunts on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U In celebration of the release on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, we spent some time grinding and tumbling in the two versions curated by Curve Digital. Considering that it's been a year since the release of the original on PlayStation Vita, and that the sequel has also been released in the meantime, it's a shame that the developer hasn't introduced anything new in terms of content. Modes, levels and tricks have remained exactly the same, as has the look and feel. However, the characteristics of the two Nintendo consoles have allowed Curve Digital to add some interesting additions to both versions. On Nintendo 3DS, for example, the second screen is used to always keep an eye on the list of tricks and the list of objectives to be completed in each level. The same goes for the GamePad screen, but it really doesn't work particularly well - the action is too fast to take your eyes off the TV and look at the controller, while the close proximity of the Nintendo 3DS's two small screens allows for quick glances instead. However, it is on Wii U that OlliOlli performs better overall, both from a graphic point of view and in the controls. The experience is smoother and maneuvering with the Nintendo 3DS stick felt much less natural. For those who own both consoles, we have good news and bad news: the good news is that OlliOlli is one of the first cross-buy games between the two Nintendo platforms, allowing you to play it both at home and on the go by buying it only once. The bad news is that, unlike the PlayStation 4 and Vita editions, there is no cross-save option, making it impossible to continue the same game on both versions.", "date": "2015-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
