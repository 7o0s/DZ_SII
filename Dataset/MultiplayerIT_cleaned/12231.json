{"name": "Honeycomb Beat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/honeycomb-beat.html", "text": "Given the enormous commercial success that ~brain~ puzzle games have been enjoying for some time now, Hudson has seen fit to ride the wave with a product halfway between the classic and the modern. Indeed, in Honeycomb Beat we will be dealing with the classic structure of puzzle games, in this case with a series of stages in which we are presented with a honeycomb grid in which the boxes are colored gray or yellow. The goal is to make all the boxes gray, and to do this you act on the grid by pressing the FIRE key, which automatically changes the color of the selected box and those in the immediate vicinity. The operation is made more difficult by a time and move limit, which rewards quick solutions with a star of merit. This is how colored blocks combine with ingenuity, because there is always a perfect way to solve each stage. Once a profile has been created, we will be able to access a large board also made of honeycombs, in which each box represents a game level. You can continue in stage selection when you start completing any of them, proceeding horizontally or vertically along the table, with the difficulty increasing as you go down. Completing the stages with a few skilful moves not only yields textual recognition (in the exaggerated praise of our guide) but also the unlocking of an alternative game mode, a sort of ~survival~ in which there is a table that moves and we who have to color the boxes with the usual method, but before everything reaches a point of no return. On a technical level, Honeycomb Beat looks good, with functional and essential graphics, but ~agile~ in scrolling and colorful enough to give an idea of liveliness. The background music, which as usual can be deactivated at the start, in this case is quite nice and well done, even if it absolutely does not leave its mark. The control system is as simple as it gets: with the joystick (or the relative numeric keys) you move on the table, while with the FIRE (or 5) button you act on the selected square, changing its color together with the adjacent squares.
