An approach that rewards replayability and skill, and which prevents an ~ethereal~ use of the experience as the simple completion of the missions with the minimum wage does not allow you to continue the adventure beyond a certain point. To this we must add that the developers of Hutch Games have already committed to releasing new levels, enriching a package that is already convincing in terms of duration and degree of challenge. But let's proceed in order. As mentioned in the introduction, the game is quite clearly inspired by certain American broadcasts that make police chases spectacular, and in the various stages we will be called upon to get behind the wheel of a steering wheel and catch the bad guys on duty, trying to stop their racing with the hard way, or by ramming their vehicle until it becomes unusable and you can proceed to arrest. A simple tutorial explains the operation of the control system, which boasts quite a few original aspects: on the touch screen there are no usual buttons for steering or accelerating, because everything is done with a finger. To be precise, you put a finger behind our car and in this way you ~push~ it, as if you had hooked the rear end. As long as we hold down the pressure on the screen, the car accelerates and can therefore approach the designated target, but sometimes this is not enough to impart the necessary speed to the maneuver. At that point the boost bar intervenes, which recharges after a few seconds and allows us, with a further touch, to quickly leap forward and therefore transform our patrol into a sort of battering ram, capable in most cases to roll over the ~enemy~ vehicle. Straight to the bushes The heart of the gameplay of Smash Cops, or rather the search for the ~smash~, of the impact, works great and is rendered perfectly even in visual terms, with a bullet time that emphasizes the extent of the clash. In short, chasing a fugitive's car for a long time, perhaps faster than ours, and finally being able to hit it sideways to make it overturn produces great satisfaction, which alone is undoubtedly worth the two euros and pennies of the price. Unfortunately, however, it is enough to complete a third of the missions to have clear what are the limits of the product developed by Hutch Games: in the first place the practicality of the controls, almost impossible to master using the thumbs and which therefore force you to keep the 'iPhone in an inconvenient way; secondly the view, which does not follow the movements of the car quickly enough and often finds itself framing us frontally, generating a lot of frustration. The presence of intense ~hostile~ traffic as well as the brevity of the missions are instead comparable to ~half defects~, considering that the first factor serves to increase the challenge and the second to make the experience usable even in a fast and impromptu way. Finally, nothing to say about the technical sector, which shows off a fairly fluid and detailed graphics.", "date": "2012-03-30", "grade": "7.6"}
