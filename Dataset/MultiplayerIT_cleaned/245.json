Some will reveal details about the world in which we find ourselves and its stories, others will allow us to receive missions, buy weapons, items, equipment and reagents. One of the most important areas of the game is actually the ability to create objects. In fact, each of the weapons that we will use in combat has a well-defined amount of ~life~, which will decrease with wear, until it reaches its breaking point. This does not mean, fortunately, that we will be forced to buy replacement weapons every time we lose one, the game in fact allows us to literally manufacture weapons and objects, thanks to a series of formulas or ~recipes~ that we will find and learn step by step, both bringing the weapons to an ~appraiser~, which will somehow reduce the weapons we bring to its original elements, thus obtaining the recipes, both through quests. We can also try to create items by experimenting a little without recipes, but in this case we can reasonably expect a certain number of failures. Fortunately, however, if we were to make a mistake in the formulas, the primary objects will not be lost, or at least not all of them... Furthermore, a little foresight must be paid to the specializations of the various characters, which will make them more skilled in certain recipes rather than others. To talk to characters, as well as to interact with objects, simply select them with the square key and then use the X key. An expanse of floating skulls... and aggressive Once we leave the city, we will find ourselves observing landscapes populated by floating skulls. Could it be the horrible monsters that plague the countryside, and that we must defeat? The answer is yes... but also no. Or rather... the skulls are simply representative of individuals or groups of monsters, having come into contact with which we will have to face. Depending on the color of the skull, the monsters will be easy or difficult to deal with at our level, allowing us to immediately understand whether a fight is to be avoided or accepted. Each of these skulls tends to follow the same ~route~ on the map, and to reappear quite quickly, so it will be good to move with caution, in case you prefer to explore the map without fighting or if you want to stop for a moment to adjust your equipment. change settings or just go answer the phone. The combat system is based on a turn-based system, with a sort of ~moon clock~ placed next to the characters' names. Once the timer has expired, an exclamation point will appear indicating that you can perform an action. The choice involves the classic sectors of most RPGs: we can perform physical attacks, use objects, withdraw from combat or use special abilities called ~lunabilities~. The characters do not have energy reserves, so it will be the lunar charge bar that we will have to check. Once full we can use the related skills. Note that our enemies also use lunar abilities and the recharge bar is shared, which makes the clashes more interesting, adding some strategic elements. Graphically, Blade Dancer cannot be considered exceptional, but still certifiable at a decent level, perhaps recalling an early RPG for PS2. The characters are well drawn and quite detailed, as are the enemies, the animations are rather pleasant and the same can be said of the settings, even if sometimes both the monsters and the environments are a little repetitive. The cities are not as detailed, but still maintain a good level of pleasantness. The audio sector is more or less on the same level as the video one: it does not exalt, but it does not disappoint. Purists will be happy to be able to use Japanese audio to hear the dialogue. Comment Blade Dancer: Lineage of Light is an RPG that boasts the undoubted merit of bringing truly appreciable innovations to the Sony portable RPG market. The object creation system, similar to the one present in Oblivion and decidedly central, has a really positive contribution to the game dynamics, as well as the combat system based on the Lunability, whose bar shared with the enemies adds strategic elements to the encounters with the enemies. However, the characterization of the characters was unfortunately rendered superficially, and the main story quite trivial, and also treated with a certain superficiality. It would have easily been a must have, if it hadn't slipped on the fragility of the storyline. The video and audio sector and the manageability of the sHowever, the control system make it a valid title both for fans of the genre and for those approaching it for the first time. Pros Innovative, varied and versatile object creation system Turn-based combat system with tactical elements Very pleasant graphics and sound Wireless multiplayer mode Against Superficial characters and storyline Not particularly long-lived Some stages are repetitive Discovering the Isle of Foo In Blade Dancer we will find ourselves following the adventures of the young Lance Bennet, who set sail in search of great enterprises and landed on the mysterious island of Foo, where he will be able to test his skills as a swordsman and his heroic temper. However, as far as we know from the introductory films, the young man is tormented by some visions, or dreams, in which a mysterious young red-haired woman invokes his help. As in any self-respecting RPG, a host of other characters will join Lance on his journey as the game progresses, as the storyline reveals details of the usual threat to the known world and how we will be involved in saving it. A storyline that anyone familiar with the genre will find familiar. In fact, these days it is extremely difficult to find an RPG that does not present a young hero committed to saving the world and experimenting with his skills. Even the characters that will accompany the main hero during his adventures are quite stereotyped. Next to the young, energetic and lost adventurer committed to saving the world we have the calm but incredibly powerful strongman, the young woman afflicted by states of amnesia... characters potentially rich in depth, but unfortunately not thoroughly outlined. Once you arrive on the island of Foo, fortunately there will be plenty of opportunities to find adventures, as the city is full of good people but too incompetent to take any action against the monsters that populate the surroundings. Talking to the inhabitants we will begin to hear the first fragments of a story that tells of a utopian civilization fallen into ruins due to some sort of dark powers, until a legendary Blade Dancer arrives to oppose them. Lance will thus discover that he has some tattoos mentioned in these stories, thus starting to unravel his personal story and placing him, as the game progresses, in the frame of an ever greater personal involvement.", "date": "2006-11-30", "grade": null}
