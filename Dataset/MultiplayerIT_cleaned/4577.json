In the year of greatest decline for the brand, with a chapter not particularly loved by the public and with a launch trailer that set the absolute record for dislikes on Youtube at the time, Call of Duty still managed to establish itself on the market, perhaps losing ground against Battlefield 1 but remaining firmly anchored on the throne. Already three years ago, however, the Activision leaders were clear that the public was becoming disaffected with the brand, bored more than with the gameplay, with a futuristic setting that by now had very little else to say and to offer. The Exo suits had taken the rhythm and movement to an exaggerated level and the players bounced like crazed pinballs in the small multiplayer maps, making the games difficult to read and extremely chaotic. Sledgehammer was therefore proposed to start from scratch, to return to a type of reasoned gameplay that was rooted in a system that was perhaps more linear but at the same time more technical, less based on reflexes. The solution chosen to face this radical change was to take a step back and go back to the Second World War that had been missing from the scene for far too long. This year, among other things, very little has been said about the Call of Duty campaign and its extra content, leaving it to the multiplayer to absorb all the attention during the events and public betas. However, a few weeks ago we flew to London to sink our teeth into the complete package and today we return to you with the final verdict for the production. Has the trust placed in Sledgehammer paid off? Welcome to Omaha Beach, gentlemen! The Second World War is certainly not an easy subject to deal with. Many other games, well before Call of Duty: WWII, have tried to tell the impressive clashes that took place in Europe between 1939 and 1945, narrating the deeds of the soldiers and bringing to the screen some of the bloodiest battles that humanity remembers. If we add to this a huge amount of books and films based on the topic, it is not difficult to understand how the events have already been stripped multiple times through many types of media, thus making it difficult to talk about something new or tell it differently. Sledgehammer has therefore decided to take the bull by the horns and play it safe without risking anything, putting on the plate a well-written war story full of memorable situations but built on tracks that have already been traveled many times. In short, an unprecedented reading of the conflict is missing and what you will be faced with once the single player campaign has started will be one of those intense stories without unexpected twists, a tribute to the heroism of allied soldiers with a magnifying glass pointed obviously on the US military and on a vision that places them on a pedestal as saviors of a Europe, caught in the grip of Nazi Germany. In short, Call of Duty: WWII is an extremely patriotic game and from the very first moments it will make you understand what type of experience you are going to have in the approximately six/seven hours of the campaign. You will take on the role of soldier Ronald ~Red~ Daniels, a member of the 1st Infantry Division of the United States and ready to give his life to save the ideals he believes in. And what better theater than the Normandy landing to start off on the right foot? This new chapter certainly doesn't waste time in useless chatter or preambles and within a few moments you find yourself involved in one of the most important conflicts of the Second World War. Packed like sardines on the landing ships, the atmosphere you breathe is made of tension and fear, cloaked in a sound and a technical sector that manage to do a truly excellent job this year. The hiss of bullets bouncing off the metal hull of the boats, fellow soldiers dropping like flies before our eyes, the water turning red as we try to figure out what to do are perhaps redundant images in our memory but brought back to life in impeccable manner. We move with the whole division in unison, seeking shelter while the explosions decimate our comrades, we approach the bunkers and we immediately realize that this Call of Duty has hit the mark on the emotional side. He may not be telling a new story but he certainly draws it in a credible and realistic way, leaving nothing to chance. It is obviously only the beginning of a campaignto which he will then expand, accompanying us first on French soil and then in the heart of Germany, but makes all the intentions of the production very clear. When it comes time to take up the rifle, attention and adrenaline do not diminish, despite the feeling of the weapons being extremely recognizable and well in line with the canons of the series. There are other details that strike the player's attention and, like a bolt from the blue, some important changes arrive in the structure of the gameplay that dramatically amplify the need to stay with your platoon. The automatic regeneration of life has been completely removed, this time replaced by a system of medikits that can be obtained by rummaging through the game maps or to be requested from teammates in times of extreme need. Once injured, you can in fact approach one of your companions and urgently ask for bandages to be thrown at you and in the same way you can request extra ammunition and grenades, up to making you highlight enemies through special binoculars or request the launch of smoke bombs to bomb an area assaulted by enemies as if it were a normal score streak, however based on a cooldown system rather than on scores. It's a mechanic that works well and finally makes you feel part of a unit, especially if you want to play at higher difficulty levels. Of course, you will always be that fearless soldier who manages to defeat an army single-handedly thanks to your infallible skills as a sniper, pilot, machine gunner or who knows what else, but finally we see interesting steps in a direction rarely taken by other shooters. Thus we find ourselves moving tortuously in a chameleonic campaign, capable of changing its appearance with each new checkpoint. There are still some classic corridor sections of Call of Duty where the narrative becomes more intense before flowing into the usual shootouts in more open areas but there are constant changes of pace, going from driving a jeep to chasing a supply truck , up to having to manage the attack of a tank or fly in the skies of Germany colliding against an entire flock of Lutwaffe aircraft. In the middle of all this Call of Duty: WWII puts in the usual cinematic spectacularity of which he is the master, managing to vary the experience sufficiently thanks to successful stealth sections (much better structured than the sections with the dog seen on Ghost ) and instilling in the player the desire to continue mission after mission, exalting him and managing to never get bored. Unfortunately it's not just roses and flowers and the most out of tune note of the melody must be assigned once again to the artificial intelligence which desperately tries to seem intelligent by approaching and proposing encirclement tactics or hit and run attacks but then getting completely lost when it gets in close combat. body, sometimes even ignoring the player even if he starts firing constantly. The problem probably derives from Sledgehammer's desire to create skirmishes between two rather numerous fronts, a skein that artificial intelligence is unable to unravel properly. Unfortunately we must also report some noticeable drop in frame rate on Playstation Pro, probably due to imperfect optimization. Roots Statistics on the Call of Duty campaign tell us that only about 15% of players complete it: an important signal that outlines, in case there is still a need, of how COD is still synonymous with Multiplayer. This year, however, the way of playing has changed significantly and we return to having cleaner firing lines, fewer engagement options and greater possibilities of predicting the enemy's positions. So you stop running wildly with your nose up hoping to see someone clinging to the walls or during a double jump and you go back to monitoring the ground in search of possible lurking enemies. It is an ~evolution~ of the gameplay compared to the previous years because it substantially changes the way we play that we have become accustomed to, but at the same time it is a decisive step backwards in terms of dynamism and frenzy. Let's understand each other well: COD is still that arcade shooter based on reflexes, frenetic respawn and non-stop game action, only this year it does it by taking its foot off the accelerator and returning to less exasperated rhythms. We could say that the appreciation of this type of game depends on tastes, but we can actually go too far by saying that it is much more enjoyable to play than the latest iterations, with cleaner and more beautiful games to look at, clearer tactical schemes and an ability look at what time it comesrewarded even more than before. Running slides also disappear, but obviously not dropshots, and snipers and weapons with a low rate of fire are once again really dangerous, now more easily manageable thanks to the slower soldiers. These are obviously the changes to the heart of the gameplay pad in hand, but there are also many new features in terms of content. The first gimmick of this year is the headquarters, a sort of huge HUB where players can show off their clothing and equipment, a bit as if they were on the Destiny tower. You can likewise take the daily missions, participate in some mini games, try the score streaks or challenge each other in 1vs1, a good way to pass the time between one game and another but nothing that obviously makes you cry for a miracle. Instead, the favorite playlists of the players return practically unchanged, as well as the modes: there are team Deathmatches, Confirmed Killing and Domination and there is also no shortage of Capture the Flag, Search and Destroy and Location. The more caciaroneous modes such as Game of Arms or Infected have been lost, and in place of Uplink Football makes its appearance, whose mechanics are substantially the same.~. However, some absences are balanced by the War mode and the three maps present at launch, offering a unique experience based on the collaboration of team members rather than simple personal skill.In War, two sides will face off in a checkpoint match for supremacy, alternating between attack and defense to decide the winner. we will dwell too much on this modality since you can already find an exhaustive article with the explanation of each single map, it is enough to know however that it is an extremely successful modality and that offers not only a lot of fun but also that indispensable variety to give heterogeneous experiences. it could soon become one of the favorite modes of the more casual players given the absence of statistics relating to the kill / death ratio, but our hope is to also see competitive teams try their hand on these maps, taking COD into hitherto uncharted territory. and we can only promote it with full marks. Granitic and guaranteed sixty frames per second in each mode and the visual impact is also good, lower than that offered by the campaign but clean and functional for multi-player clashes. One could possibly complain about an outdated animation sector, the only really subdued piece for a sector that is instead being renewed in an intelligent and successful way. The novelties of this year do not end there, and the divisions that players will have to join before making their first game also appear. Divisions basically play the role of classes and level up with experience earned in the game. Rather than having special abilities or super powerful weapons, however, they simply offer passive bonuses as you level up. For example, the infantry division provides you with a bayonet to attach rifles (to be used exactly like in Battlefield 1) or extra magazines while for paratroopers there will be increased speed in the sprint and silencers for SMGs or even greater resistance to explosions and to fire for the heavy division and so on for a total of four specific perks for each of the five divisions. The score streaks are also back, modified in appearance but with a functionality very similar to those seen in the past with detector drones, bombings and air support, functional and never excessively unbalanced. The micro-transaction issue, always very delicate in these cases, did not seem particularly problematic to us. Cosmetic mods, new skins for both character and weapons, and the usual player tag mods can be obtained as usual through open crates in HQ, but nothing that actively affects gameplay, with the exception of cards for zombie mode. In your head This is in fact the element that most perplexes us because if it is true that on the one hand the objects that you will find in the zombie crates can offer you active advantages on matches in this mode, it is also true that we are not talking about a competitive system where players are pitted against each other, so finding someone equipped with these packs might even come in handy. Also in this case the cards and all the objects can easily be obtained simply by playing and offer discounts on mystery boxes, for example, or on the activation of traps.
