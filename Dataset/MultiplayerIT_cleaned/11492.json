{"name": "Command &amp; Conquer 3: L'Ira di Kane - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-amp-conquer-3-lira-di-kane-recensione.html", "text": "The conclusion of the base game left several questions unanswered: how did Kane get resurrected? Why was Boyle, despite being a bureaucrat, not on the Philadelphia at the time of the bombing? All valid questions, opened by a very complex, but equally incomplete original plot: gaps which, incidentally, are partially filled by this expansion, called the Wrath of Kane, where some interesting background of the NOD universe will be revealed to you. So dust off your spades and buckets to collect the tiberium and get ready to return to the C&C universe! The new campaign This new expansion consists of two different macro-modules: the first is represented by the classic sequence of missions (also known as campaign), which follows the evolution of a plot told through cutscenes. As mentioned in our incipit, Kane's Wrath does not want to tell a real story, but rather to fill the gaps left by its predecessor: this explains the use of the Acts, for a total of three, each of which deals with follow the events in three different decades. This means that, of the 13 missions that make up the campaign, you will initially find yourself playing immediately after Kane's defeat at the end of the Second Tiberium War (and you will be responsible for his military rebirth), then you will take part in the events immediately preceding the attack on Philadelphia (told in C&C3) and in the last decade you will have a pleasant twist, which we prefer not to reveal. If the quality of the acting settles, as always, on excellent quality standards, the choice to cover such a large time span proves to be all too wasteful, even for those who have been adept of the saga since time immemorial: it doesn't matter, because with a minimum effort of the imagination it is still possible to intuit past events. Lots of new weapons As in tradition, the game mechanics have remained completely unchanged, always providing for the same cycle: amass Tiberium, build buildings and then units. The gameplay, despite being an exact photocopy of the base game, is slightly enriched by some improvements: firstly, the Artificial Intelligence has undergone a considerable tweak and is much more aggressive, with much more meticulous research patterns of your base and the ability to create quite lethal army combinations. This task is also made easier by the introduction of new highly specialized units, particularly effective against a specific type of enemy: each of the three main factions will deploy, within two different sub-factions, approximately 10 new units which, while the characteristics and some even the design of those of the base game, differ in power and destructive capacity. In this expansion, however, you will only be able to use those of the NODs within the main campaign, while in Global Conquest mode, in Skirmish games and in multiplayer you will be able to use all three factions, with their units. Global Conquest Comment Kane's Wrath cannot be missing in the playroom of all those who have explored the three long campaigns of the base game, while for all mere mortals it represents a pleasant expansion, which will prolong your experience in the Tiberium universe. The whole package settles on absolutely normal quality levels, with some peaks of excellence, unfortunately, not constant, which slightly undermine the final grade. However, some missions in the main campaign are truly unforgettable and fun. And then impersonating the NOD fanatics always has its charm!
