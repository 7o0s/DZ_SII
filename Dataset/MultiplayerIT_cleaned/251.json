{"name": "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The DVD Action Adventure - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-dvd-action-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "the production of Eidos is nothing more than an adaptation of Angel of Darkness, the sixth and much criticized chapter of the Tomb Raider saga A life at the crossroads The production of Eidos, distributed in Italy by Koch Media, is nothing more than an adaptation of Angel of Darkness, the sixth and much criticized chapter of the Tomb Raider saga. However, don't expect the typical playful coordinates of Lara Croft's 3D action adventure as much as a sort of interactive story at crossroads in which, using the remote control, we will have to choose which action to have the beautiful archaeologist perform. Usually, one choice will automatically lead to game over, another will allow us to continue the adventure and the last one will allow us to go ahead with even a small bonus in terms of score. In fact, you should know that a small peculiarity of this DVD Game is a numerical evaluation of our actions and that they can also be compared by playing together with a friend, alternating from level to level. The sequences taken from Angel of Darkness will often require only a little common sense in choosing the action, other times there will be some puzzle and rhythm game-style grafts to diversify and give that minimum of ~depth~ to the gameplay. As always happens in DVD Games, it will not be possible to save the position of the game and we will have to mark the codes to resume the game from the previously concluded level. The Angel of Darkness If talking about the technical aspect in a DVD Game is at least out of place (we are dealing with the movies of the in-game part of Angel of Darkness), however we can undoubtedly mention the plot that supports the game: Lara has taken a period of deserved rest, far from conspiracies, intrigues and narrowly avoided ends of the world. Suddenly, however, she receives a call from her friend and mentor Werner and immediately rushed to him in Paris, to find him in a state of panic and terror like she had never seen him before. And he doesn't have time to ask for explanations that the old archaeologist is killed by a barrage of bullets: Lara, in a confused state, is accused of the murder and the game begins with her desperate escape from the scene of the crime and the discovery of the Obscura Paintings, mysterious paintings from the 18th century linked to the Esoteric Arts... As is clear, the plot of The Angel of Darkness is a pleasant common thread that links the levels of the game, intricate enough to interest the spectator/player. The soundtrack is also of absolute importance, like practically all the episodes of Tomb Raider. Conclusions The transposition of Angel of Darkness in ~DVD Game~ format proves to be a pleasant crossroads game in which to make the right choice to continue in the very pleasant and intricate plot of the sixth chapter of the adventures of Lara Croft. Clearly hardcore gamers keep a safe distance since the production of Eidos is indicated for the family audience and for those who have never had a joypad in their hand (or have had it very rarely). Even the recommended price, 19.90, makes you want to try Lara even on a ~simple~ DVD player with remote control. Pros Lara Croft is an icon of the videogame universe Very suitable for family audiences Reduced price Cons Regular players keep their distance.... More Lara for everyone It is known that in recent years the user of videogame products has expanded and diversified widely and the software houses are trying in every way to expand the catchment area as much as possible. Within these strategies, one cannot fail to underline the novelty of ~DVD Games~, video games usable with a ~simple~ DVD player and its relative remote control. Clearly from similar products, one cannot expect gaming experiences suitable for hardcore gamers but games suitable for families and/or those who have never had a joypad in hand. The Lara Croft DVD Game also falls into this category.", "date": "2006-11-28", "grade": null}
