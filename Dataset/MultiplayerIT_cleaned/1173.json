On the other hand, a certain confusion is understandable once you find yourself in front of the shelf in the shop: the overcrowding in October risks making you lose your sense of orientation towards purchasing and making the choice between the many similar titles a bit difficult, so let's districate ourselves from this jungle of ~Vietnam~! Pivotal, this stranger We introduce the review by immediately clarifying that both the Xbox and PlayStation2 versions have been tested. Let's also say that the two differ substantially in one aspect: the graphics sector, which we will analyze later in detail. For every other aspect of the game, including gameplay, Conflict Vietnam on PlayStation2 is totally identical to the Verdecrociata counterpart. Once you start the game, it immediately becomes clear how much attention to detail the developers of ~Pivotal Games~ have put, which we recall include titles such as Warzone: 2100 and Conflict Desert Storm in their curriculum. The Ex-boys of Microprose and Eidos boast a small number of games to their credit but they have already been able to prove their worth by programming a new graphics engine from scratch on the occasion of the launch of the ~Conflict~ series. Their working background is called Zeewolf on Amiga, G-Police, Dagons Lair for SNES and all the Grand Prix series on PC. Closing the short digression and returning to their last job, the player will begin the adventure immersed in an American base camp in Vietnam, where he will be called several times by his superiors to face training and shooting tests at the range, practically ~walking around~ and living the 'camp. You will therefore be free to go and chat with your fellow soldiers, listen to what they are talking about with a nice background of 70s music coming out of the speakers and wander around in a sort of ~free~. Scrolling shooter, or war simulator Like its predecessor, the gameplay will see you command a team of four soldiers, with the ability to issue orders to each of them. Every soldier is specialized: there are doctors, snipers, scouts and others. The game interface is fairly intuitive, fast and easy to use, this makes it possible to use every man at our disposal, even in the most critical situations, without particular maneuvering difficulties or Joypad virtuosity. Certainly a few hours of play are needed to learn how to manage each of our men, each possible executable command, all in complete fluency. But just as certainly, with a Joypad console difficult to imagine better. Most of the time we will find ourselves immersed in the thickest jungle through very long ~corridors~ surrounded by very green invisible walls. The freedom of action within the levels is certainly not the most exciting that has ever been seen in a video game. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is not the most sophisticated. A conspicuous system of ~respawn~ of the enemies, who will flock from every direction, however, means that our raids do not always run as smooth as oil. Most of the time we will find ourselves immersed in the thickest jungle through very long ~corridors~ surrounded by very green invisible walls. Scrolling shooter, or war simulator Although Conflict Vietnam presents itself in front of the player as a ~simulator~, a few enemy shots will not be enough to bring us down. The resistance of our military is Arcade-style, certainly not ~One shot, One Kill~ as games like Rainbow Six have accustomed us to. During the raids it is possible to change the character using the four keys of the directional, and once you leave the one used, they will continue the action through their artificial intelligence. Conversely, the Vietcong seem to fall under our blows with a little too much ease and diligence. Furthermore, they don't seem to seek hiding places, to cover themselves behind something, to defend themselves. The programmers of Pivotal seem to focus the whole fight on the high number of enemies to kill, perhaps a little too easy and comfortable in a video game that should be defined as ~modern~, but which in reality seems to have a lot to learn from more illustrious colleagues, and even older ones, such as the Vietcong or Halo. ..when the Rolling Stones playedor on the radio Putting aside the playful aspects of Conflict Vietnam, it's time to take a look at the general realization of this title. At a glance it seems immediately clear that the strengths lie in an almost maniacal attention to detail: inside the base, using the subjective view that can be activated by pressing the left analog, it is possible to notice a myriad of finishes. From the cigarette butts on the ground, to the precious texture of each wall up to the very nice dynamic lighting system. The shadows, carried and proper, are well done. The movement system is functional, even if not exactly responsive. The analog that regulates the view is in fact slightly too slow to the solicitations of the pad, and the problem is annoying at times, especially during particularly eventful game sessions. Every detail, starting from the weapons, passing through the uniforms up to the objects and means, is historically researched and cared for. However, the advice is not to linger too much, in a subjective view, on the faces of the characters: from a close distance it is embarrassing to notice the lack of polygons with which they have been modeled. Comparable to a higher detail PsOne. On the other hand, the audio sector is truly engaging. Inside the field a radio will play period pieces (Rolling Stones above all) continuously, while an improvised DJ (and well interpreted by the Italian dubbing), will chat continuously talking about this and that. Each weapon produces its characteristic sound, each surface also trampled on, the noise of vehicles and helicopters, the muffled sound of grenades that stuns the ears and makes the ear hiss for a few seconds: each of these effects is well done. Ultimately this Conflict Vietnam turns out to be a shooter on tracks set in the Vietnamese jungle, surrounded by a much improved artificial intelligence and fluctuating graphics in the Xbox version, below the sufficiency in the PlayStation2 version. More bad news: no online support, just multiplayer via splitscreen. Despite these serious flaws Conflict Vietnam retains some good basic ideas, such as the command system and the use of one soldier rather than another depending on the situation to be faced, but cannot compete on the market with the competitor ~Vietcong~ which it surpasses it in atmosphere, and neither does Shellshock surpass it in realism and level design. Pros: Four usable and commandable characters Good textures and detail Audio compartment Cons: Levels too linear Limited artificial intelligence Sparing use of the polygon count Immersed in a jungle of ~Vietnam~ In a period that certainly could not be defined as one of peace, it will perhaps be a coincidence but a multitude of titles inspired by past wars are pouring onto the market. Perhaps to exploit a vein of hype generated by the national media, perhaps by a coincidence of fate, this month we will find many military-style video games among our fingertips. After a Shellshock Nam'67 that brought a breath of raw (perhaps too much) realism to the console, passing through the Vietcong and its online multiplayer up to Man on Valor, an Xbox exclusive, here we come to this Conflict Vietnam , probably the most awaited title since the successful predecessor Conflict Desert Storm.", "date": "2004-10-20", "grade": null}
