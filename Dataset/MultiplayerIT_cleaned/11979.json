{"name": "4x4 Monster Trucks 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/4x4-monster-trucks-3d_a.html", "text": "At first glance, the game is reminiscent of the Micromachines series, mainly due to the use of a bird's eye view. In reality, while sharing some aspects (for example the high level of difficulty) 4x4 Monster Trucks deviates quite clearly from the Codemasters saga, proving to be slightly more complex but objectively also less enjoyable. From the main menu it is possible to choose one of the three play modes: Time Attack, Championship and Arcade, so obvious that they do not need explanations. Beyond this, the Micazook title offers the user a range of six vehicles to choose from and ten tracks to tackle, all quite elaborate and divided into a variety of settings. Regardless of all these options, however, the substance of the game does not change: it is a question of passing through the various checkpoints in the shortest possible time, with an eye to fuel and damage levels (to be filled thanks to special power-ups scattered here and there) and avoiding at all costs to run over the sheep, on pain of a temporary but harmful loss of adherence. However, it only takes a few moments of play to notice the main limitation of 4x4 Monster Trucks, represented by a too close view: evidently the developers have chosen such a compromise in order to be able to manage fully polygonal graphics without showing excessive bad clipping (which always peeps out at the top of the screen), but thus compromising the good use of the product. Difficult to understand which direction to go, and even more difficult to identify opponents or obstacles before it's too late: as a result, winning at 4x4 Monster Trucks is largely a matter of luck, also given the not exactly friendly difficulty level . To make the situation worse, a sensation of practically zero speed and a rather ~slippery~ control system, which does not allow you to control your vehicle properly, intervene. However, the Micazook work is not a failure on all fronts, and indeed it should be praised under some technical aspects. Even if penalized by the aforementioned visual, the 4x4 Monster Trucks cosmetic certainly does not leave one indifferent, being totally 3D and offering very broad scenarios full of bumps, ups and downs and various asperities. The physics of the various cars are also excellent, which react in a plausible way to the various obstacles they encounter on their path, leaning or overturning often and willingly. Finally, the sound is not very incisive, which deserves a mention only for the tremendous bleating that the sheep emit when they are run over...
