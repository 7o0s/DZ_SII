Big Brain Academy is a growing challenge. It will hammer your brain bloated, no matter if from the number of synapses stimulated or from bumps caused by challenges. The Big Brain Academy exercises, all to be tackled with stylus strokes on the touch screen, are fifteen in total, and are divided into five main sections: Calculation, Identification, Reasoning, Memory and Analysis. Initially the Academy, headed by an eminent yet stylized professor in tunic and cap, introduces the new player to a brain weight test. According to the professor, the brain of someone who doesn't train would ideally weigh around 800 grams, while his would reach the considerable figure of almost two kilos. Once we have passed five random tests, each relating to one of the five categories of exercises, we will know how much our brain weight is and will therefore be able to calculate how many grams we will have to conquer with exercises to show who is boss to that pedantic scribble in tunic waving us from options. There are about fifteen exercises, very varied and all decidedly interesting. They range from numerical calculations and sums and quantity estimates of the calculation section to the recognition of shapes, shapes and shadows, from memorization and recognition exercises of figures and sounds in random order to counting the number of cubes that make up the polygonal structures of the section of analysis. The reasoning section, in particular, includes very special games-exercises. In one of these it is necessary to reconstruct the movement of a figure on a layout of boxes starting from arrow indications that appear fleetingly. In another you have to complete the path of a figure to bring it to join another by tracing lines. In still another it is necessary, by comparing a series of figures on scales, to conclude on which figure is the heaviest of the set. More reasons, more weights... Overall, the games form a challenging and varied whole, capable of measuring the player across the full range of skills typical of intelligence tests. The player can decide to take the brain weight test, facing a series of random exercises in order on which the weight of his brain will be determined. Alternatively, he can choose the category in which he intends to compete, and within this the particular exercise with which to train. Big Brain Academy recognizes three levels of difficulty for each exercise, and assigns a score for each one, which includes a bronze, silver and gold medal. Having the biggest brain, then, is a matter of practice, but it's also proven by the number and quality of medals won in each game. The sum of all the scores achieved in each game is therefore the total success amount for the game. More reasons, more weights... From such a game structure, the similarities and differences with respect to Doctor Kawashima's Brain Age are understood, with respect to which Big Brain Academy is a continuation but certainly not a clone. Both titles, this is clear, are part of a very original video game project, which intends to address casual players, not enthusiasts or a type of audience generally unfamiliar with more traditional video games. If Brain Age entirely reflected this intent also in the very dry interface, in the ultra-minimal aesthetics and in the daily exercise structure, Big Brain Academy tries to harness the same substance of the exercises in a more traditional structure, with the medal structure of conquer, a slightly more constructed look and a less unusual interface that renounces the vertical positioning, like a book, of the console, as happened in Brain Age. This new collection, in particular, is offered in a slightly different spirit than its predecessor, in a certain sense being played with a more traditional video game spirit than the philosophy of an unusual paper intelligence test in electronic form of Brain Age. In addition to the type of games, less focused on writing and calculation and more on questions of reasoning and visual aspects, this is reflected in the greater difference in terms of game design: in fact, the lack, in Big Brain Academy, of a graphic which records the results obtained on the time axis. It is then clear that Big Brain Academy does not attempt the radical path of non-video game, but that of mediation, implemented according to the renunciation of temporal continuity from continuous exercise and the search for a greater variety of games and a slightly less stylized look. Big Brain Academy is an original project of Brain-style intelligence exercisesAge dropped into a slightly more traditional game structure, conceived without a daily graph and with a medal progression. Even so, however, evaluating the game according to categories more familiar to videogame critics (graphics, longevity, playability, and so on...) would be tantamount to wanting to make all games the same, not understanding the intent of this software and doing it an injustice. Big Brain is then a great game, but not the usual video game. The result in terms of design is probably less cohesive than that of Brain Age, and offers - also on an aesthetic level - a feeling of less dryness. On the other hand, Big Brain Academy offers a greater variety of exercises, many of which are decidedly less gray and more fun than the systematic and irrepressible equations of ~Dr. Kawashima's~ game. It is not, then, a clone, but a parallel project, a second attempt on the road to the new trend of ~mind games~. The eight-player multiplayer, which can also be implemented with a single cartridge, offers one more excuse to enhance the potential of many of these difficult and exciting exercises in challenges between friends and relatives to find out ~who has it bigger~. Pros Many and varied Brain Age-style intelligence exercises Brain pumping is exciting business Suitable for regular and casual gamers Eight challenges with one cartridge Cons A progress graph would have been nice Where's the sudoku? Big Brain Academy, part of Nintendo's ~Touch Generations~ series for DS, is an atypical game of exercises in logic, memory, calculation and visual intelligence that invites the player to undertake a series of challenges in order to achieve medal after medal in each exercise and gain brain weight. The weight of the brain, which is obviously a simple metaphor for the score and has no real scientific validity, measures the player's performance capacity in the different exercises. Big Brain Academy is the second chapter of the new series of reasoning games from Nintendo, a sort of unofficial sequel to Brain Training: but it shouldn't be considered a real ~more of the same~. This new game, compared to Doctor Kawashima's Brain Training, has a slightly different spirit, less geared towards daily exercise and, if you like, slightly more ~traditional~ in terms of interface and game structure.", "date": "2006-07-19", "grade": null}
