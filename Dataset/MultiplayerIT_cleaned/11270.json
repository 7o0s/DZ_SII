{"name": "Penumbra: Black Plague - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/penumbra-black-plague-recensione.html", "text": "Pepsi on a pipe?!? The atmosphere of the first Penumbra had struck, that sense of restlessness and claustrophobia that permeated every single room, while our alter ego wandered lost in that huge mining complex, desperately looking for a way out: all improved by some style choices, including not clearly showing your true antagonist, placing you in front of complex puzzles that required you to combine different objects and an enormous effort of ingenuity to overwhelm your enemies with makeshift materials. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned style elements have been lost in Black Plague: your enemy (a sort of zombie) will be shown to you from the first minutes of the game, removing much of the anxiety due to the sensation of fighting an ~something~ you don't defined; the proposed puzzles, with the exception of a few, particularly pleasant ones, are absolutely elementary for their resolution and will rarely require you more than a few seconds to solve them. The biggest problem, however, is related to the nature of the puzzles themselves: in some cases you will not be able to understand what to do because the solution to adopt is absolutely illogical and you will therefore find yourself going by trial and error, trying to combine all the elements of your inventory until to reach the one foreseen by the developers. Irony The other element that came out ruined is the atmosphere, the main strong point of the first episode: for some unhealthy reason, the plausible anxiety due to venturing into a secret base in Greenland, with the anguish for what you might find behind every corner, has come up short with the introduction of a comedic sidekick, disguised as a voice in your head, who will spoil some of the more tense moments with some not-so-funny one-liners. the proposed puzzles, with the exception of a few, particularly pleasant ones, are absolutely elementary and will rarely take you more than a few seconds to figure them out Irony A real shame, considering that all the tension was based on being isolated in an unfamiliar place, where it was your imagination that took the lion's share. But if Black Plague manages to save itself from the panning, this is undoubtedly thanks to the gameplay, which made the first one so successful and which is proposed again, exactly identical, in this successor; the peculiarity lies in the fact that to carry out any action, such as opening a door, turning a lever and so on, you will have to perform the gesture with the mouse that you would do in reality: therefore to turn a valve you will have to make a circular movement, while to to force a lock with a lever you will have to give decisive blows. This ploy improves player engagement and in some circumstances, perhaps when you're being chased by a monstrously large earthworm, helps to greatly increase the tension, only to be ruined by that annoying voice in your mind. Comment A second chapter much more disappointing than the first episode: the past year has not served to make any aesthetic improvements and even the choices on how to develop the plot have ended up in the usual evergreen clich of the world sect versus the rest of the world. Black Plague does not represent the worthy successor of Overture, especially because it fails to resume the atmosphere and the involvement with which the first episode had charmed all the players: you can decide to buy it if you want to get to the third episode (entitled Requiem) having a a little clearer idea of the plot or if you want to dampen this scorching August with a virtual trip to Greenland. But don't expect much.Pro Gameplay different from the usual There is the giant worm! Cons Graphically poor Atmosphere ruined A year of waiting for this? Spoilers & Bugs In Black Plague, during our tests, we came across several bugs, definitely present in greater quantities than in the predecessor: in addition to the graphic glitches, we get to real programming errors, some of which will prevent you from completing the game. On some configurations, for example, entering a research laboratory, the game will appear as frozen, with a frame rate equal to zero, forcing you to restart the entire computer. It must be said that Frictional Games is quite community-focused, so expect a patch soon.

Penumbra Overture has had a rather interesting life: created first as an experiment in innovative gameplay, it immediately gained worldwide success: what could have been a top-level freeware turned into a commercial product. As such, by requiring the user to pay money, the demands that the good consumer makes are also raised: the first episode (you can find our review at this address) had garnered success among the public and critics, precisely due to the mechanics of innovative game that let you turn a blind eye to the other defects, primarily a backward graphics and a rather elementary artificial intelligence. Time has passed since that April 2007 and this second chapter, entitled Black Plague, aims to turn the fate of poor Philip and all the unresolved questions with the conclusion of the previous episode, however losing all the charm of its predecessor.", "date": "2008-08-04", "grade": null}
