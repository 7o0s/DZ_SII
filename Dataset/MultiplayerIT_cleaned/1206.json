{"name": "La recensione di ShellShock: Nam '67", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-shellshock-nam-67.html", "text": "A jungle for three We don't know how much the Dutch of Guerrilla were inspired by the Vietcong - the almost masterpiece of the Pterodon - to give birth to their work, however the common points seem many, even too many. Too bad it is really difficult to notice real progress in the Guerrilla title and it is instead easier to find all too obvious flaws. A necessary premise: ShellShock is a cross-platform title. Albeit with the necessary adjustments, the same version of the game is available for PC, XBox and Playstation 2. Far from getting preconceived, a few minutes of play are enough to find yourself faced with all the structural limits of a title which, albeit with some exceptions, is technically appears decidedly underutilized. And yet, stopping at grainy textures or some unconvincing three-dimensional model could hide much deeper wonders. Unfortunately this does not seem to be the case. ShellShock brings back all the typical mechanics of a shooter, however, varying the perspective and presenting all the game action to us with a third-person view just behind the shoulders of our alter-ego. The control method turns out to be confusing and inaccurate, if in other titles a few moments of practice were enough for us to balance the sensitivity of the mouse, in ShellShock we have never managed to find the most congenial settings for us. As usual, most of the weapons will have two fire modes (automatic or semi-automatic) while for greater shooting precision we can press the right mouse button and, in a very similar way to (guess it?) Vietcong, enter a mode which, to the detriment of the field of view and our speed of movement, will allow us to be more accurate. Considering that the heart of the game should be precisely to aim and shoot, it is evident that a large part of the gaming experience is compromised from the beginning. During the tightest fights, when we find ourselves in the middle of a trench melee, our weapons will automatically be used in ~melee~ mode, allowing us to knock down enemies with a single well-aimed shot. In case we find ourselves in a rather critical situation, we can always use the ~sprint~ mode: in practice we will shoot like a new Ben Johnson paying the simple price of not being able to shoot. To seek a little realism - and following the trend launched by Halo - we will not be able to carry an unlimited number of weapons with us; overall, however, the entire game system appeared to us rather arcadey and unsatisfying, above all due to the poor artificial intelligence algorithms. The save system is that of a clearly console nature at Check-Point. If on the one hand the tension and the thrilling of the clashes gain, on the other it will happen more and more often to long for the presence of an even minimal quick-save ... There is no shortage of positive notes, such as the skill subgames to which we will be subjected to to defuse the Viet Cong traps, or the level design of the maps which, in addition to presenting us with various and plausible environments (the jungle is represented in a truly convincing way), also allows us to occasionally a certain variety of approach to the battlefield. The presence of a couple of missions involving the use of stealth techniques that manage to break the pace of the game a little has also been introduced. But it's really a small thing, unfortunately, especially considering that the longevity of the title - despite the save system and the not exactly optimal control method - seemed rather narrow to us. As already mentioned, on an audiovisual level we are far from both the latest multimillion-dollar productions that are forcing us to change our beloved PC, and also titles such as the now outdated (and certainly not avant-garde) Vietcong certainly do not disfigure with what ShellShock offers Nam '67: low-quality game textures and some architectural angularities reminiscent of Picasso's cubist period seem to sadly denounce the cross-platform nature of this title. As if all this weren't enough, the whole picture is further worsened by an annoying ~grainy~ effect that afflicts our game view, making the graphics blurry and rather muddy: those who have played Silent Hill or Manhunt will be able to better understand what we mean. Not just war To allow us to best identify ourselves in the filthy role of a tired and disillusioned soldier, the designers have seen fit to recreate, between one mission and another, the atmosphere of the base camp, giving us the opportunity to visit it far and wide and to have a chat with fellow soldiers and various nurses. There is also no shortage of opportunities to distract ourselves thanks to the possibility of offorgetting, at least for a few hours, the atrocities of war with the best ~entertainers~ in the area. In fact, during the missions, we will be able to raise some money that we can then spend during our free time Shock & Awe As the name of the game suggests, the Guerrillas have not spared atrocities and cruel scenes in our eyes. After all, the first casualty of war is always innocence. During the game we will have to shoot and blow up (literally) even exponents of the so-called fair sex, just as we will helplessly witness summary executions by our own fellow soldiers but also find ourselves face to face with the cruelty of our enemy (as the facade of a fort with the phrase ~Welcome to Hell~ written in blood on it). The interlude scenes and the nature of some missions thus manage to recreate a sense of unease by reminding us, with all the due caution of the case, the same sensations that one can have by watching films of the caliber of Apocalypse Now. To conclude the positive notes, the complete localization in Italian with a good level of dubbing and which will hardly make us regret the original audio track. Excluding the various cinematic sequences of introduction and conclusion of the various game missions, the in-game dialogues are however rather limited, as are the various sound effects. The soundtrack of the title is of a good standard, which incorporates some great masterpieces of the period: the atmosphere can only gain from it. You probably won't miss it, however we point out the absence of any support for multiplayer. Like all recent Eidos titles, the game is distributed on a single DVD. Comment If we exclude the purely narrative aspect and little else, ShellShock is a disappointing title in all respects. Not very funny, sometimes even frustrating, the title suffers above all from the point of view of the game mechanics and does not really offer anything that can make it preferable to other titles of the genre. While not taking into consideration the purely technical aspect, the third-person view itself struggles to be appreciated, while the low level of artificial intelligence of the enemies soon makes us lose any possible little attraction left. If you went crazy for Platoon or you particularly like the historical period covered, maybe you might even like the title, otherwise ShellShock is to be recommended only to all those in shooter withdrawal. And it doesn't seem to me that there is currently a particular shortage of this genre of games. Pros: Entirely localized in Italian Apt soundtrack Some rather neat converse elements... Cons: ... but everything else was forgotten Technically subdued Controls not always optimal Short enough... if you can finish it To gain space in the crowded shooter genre, we are seeing the release of more and more titles which, rather than reviving the gameplay, mainly try to concentrate all their appeal on the public, on aspects that until a few years ago were considered only side. ShellShock Nam '67 is one such title. Will this approach be enough to make us want to venture back among annoying insects, humid jungles and deadly traps? We'd just like to tell you no, but it's a dirty job and someone had to do it...", "date": "2004-09-30", "grade": null}
