The Canadian Interdimensional Games project was able to see the light thanks to the Kickstarter campaign (which ended at an altitude of 70,000 US dollars) and the consensus obtained on the Greenlight platform. Set in a Hubbardian December of 2042, the year in which energy and food issues will be resolved, CONSORTIUM catapults the player inside the huge Zenlil plane, a real orbiting station that recalls the Paladin of Splinter Cell: Blacklist but above all the Normandy of Mass Effect, and within which operates a cell of a paramilitary organization that has the task of maintaining peace in the world. CONSORTIUM is a rough gem that can only be appreciated by true enthusiasts But shouldn't teleportation already exist in 2042?! On board the flying fortress, the user takes on the role of the new enlisted Bishop 6 (the crew members are identified with the names of the chess pieces, a somewhat misleading choice that a little more experience could have avoided), a sort of ~azzeccagarbugli~, whose arrival coincides with the precipitation of the situation. Everything is made even more engaging by an intriguing game of misunderstandings: in fact, at the beginning of each game, a declaration of responsibility informs the player that he is about to access a virtual reality simulation that will catapult him into a parallel dimension, in the role of a protagonist whose past he does not know. The other actors around him, naturally unaware of this secret, won't miss the opportunity to put him in trouble with seemingly trivial questions that will require a good dose of improvisation. A few minutes after having become familiar with the rudimentary combat system, which we will discuss later, and having introduced ourselves to fellow venturers, we will find ourselves grappling with a murder committed inside a cabin; as if that weren't enough at the same time, the plane will be targeted by Bulgarian dissidents determined to hijack it. The story is really well structured and full of twists and turns and, by leveraging the player's ignorance, manages to create a good dose of suspense despite the fact that the pace is sometimes decidedly slow. Excellent diplomatic skills will be needed to define one's dimension in CONSORTIUM: for example the aforementioned boarding of terrorists will not necessarily have to end in a bloodbath, but can be resolved with a skilful exchange of jokes. There is no ~right~ road, just a series of forks to take that lead to different ways to complete the game. The entire adventure takes place inside the plane, the three floors of which guarantee a minimum of freedom of exploration, even if the interactive level is very limited and often an end in itself. Shut that mouth! Zenlil is a pulsating microcosm, where NPCs, however scripted, are free to move and interact with each other. Thus it will happen to start a conversation simply by moving from one booth to another; in this way it will be possible to have access to secondary quests that will allow to increase the influence on the companions. In fact, there are no experience points, nor will our alter-ego be able to improve their physical or intellectual characteristics: choosing how to channel a discussion, swaying from time to time between humor and diplomacy, between blame and comfort, will lead to being loved or discredited . However fascinating, this system based on dialogues is not free from flaws, sometimes even marked ones, which manifest themselves above all in the key situations of the story, i.e. when the player is led to believe that he can give a turn to the succession of events which instead, due to obvious design limitations, they must follow the course set by the developers. On the other hand, the sidequests are of a slightly wider scope which do not impact on the main plot; the merit is undoubtedly of the excellent work done on the character of the non-player characters to which a dubbing (exclusively in English) worthy of higher budget productions has contributed. From the authoritarian commander to the rude cabin boy, from the religious extremist doctor to the grumpy engineer, there is a wide range of personalities to analyse, adopting the right semantic register from time to time. Being irreverent or aggressive could open new branches of dialogue with some crew members and close the conversation early with others, which is why you have to choose carefully which turn to take the conversation with an eye also to time, as the programmers have decided to leave a few seconds of reasoning. to beand or not to be The combat system is one of the aspects that betray an incompletely defined nature of the first work of Interdimensional Games. While the first few minutes of the game try to put emphasis on firefights and whether or not you can kill opponents, incandescent situations occur so rarely that perhaps they should have been omitted altogether. Similar considerations can be made for the inventory, on the effective usefulness of which many doubts arose: for the entire duration of the game we did not feel the need to access it, also because, as written just above, the low level of interaction with the The environment combined with a general limitation of the spaces to explore did not allow for the insertion of a large number of objects to collect. The structure is therefore partly betrayed by the presence of elements that the programmers hoped to be able to make available but which in practice remain in the background. During the journey, the furious shootings that the variety of the arsenal and the combat simulator had given rise to never occurred. It could be that, in the intentions of Gregory MacMartin and his companions, these aspects are used more intensively in what should be the next two episodes of CONSORTIUM. On the technical side, the historic Source graphics engine is used, with disappointing results. The choice to use cel shading perhaps clashes with the futuristic setting; what leaves us most perplexed, however, is the paucity of polygons and in particular of textures that would certainly have come in handy for also visually characterizing the plane and its crew. However, there is no need to tread too much on this front, given the limited financial resources available to the development team. The audio sector can only be partially judged; as written above, the acting of the voice actors deserves applause, skilled in instilling lifeblood inside the monitor. The soundtrack, on the other hand, should have been edited by a videogame sacred monster like Jeremy Soule, but the conditional is mandatory because, perhaps due to technical errors, we have not been able to appreciate even a single note. If this were the case, the entire production would probably earn half an evaluation point. Soundtrack or not CONSORTIUM still has some youthful problems which, despite having been largely resolved with the patch released at the end of January, can force annoying restarts. We speak in particular of interpenetration of polygons and dialogues that sometimes disappear leaving the player unable to continue the game; however the free saves and the sporadic with which such situations occur do not make them excessively frustrating. As can be guessed, the replayability factor is more than good: for once we feel we can give credit to the on-screen advice that suggests ~starting the simulator~ several times to test some paths that were initially rejected, also because some puzzles ( we don't want to reveal too many details about the plot) can only be solved by choosing a specific set of answers. However, one cannot ignore a very short duration of the title which can be ~completed~ easily in about four hours. We use the quotation mark because the final screen prepares us for the next episode, thus confirming the not entirely definitive nature of the Vancouver team's project.", "date": "2014-02-12", "grade": "6.5"}
