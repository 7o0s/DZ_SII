{"name": "My Child Lebensborn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-child-lebensborn-recensione.html", "text": "The appearance of a small mobile game could be misleading, but the review of My Child Lebensborn tells of one of the most impactful experiences that have been seen in these times in the videogame landscape, with a game that succeeds in the very difficult task of dealing with dramatic elements of the story in an unprecedented way, fully exploiting the potential of the medium in question and hitting hard. The particular title may have already prompted someone to read up on what the theme of this strange experiment by Sarepta Studio is, considering that it is a dramatic page in European history that is perhaps less treated than many others: we are also talking here about Nazism and Second World War, but to stage something much more hidden and decidedly less spectacular, but no less shocking, than the battles on the front. The Lebensborn program was to be a pillar in the construction of the racist nation of the Third Reich, a real practical application of eugenics to give a demographic boost to the Aryan race, with support for the birth of children who fit the characteristics prescribed by the SS. My Child Lebensborn stages the plight of little-known war victims Going deeper into the subject would take too much time, but we advise you to gather some information to have a clear background in which the story of My Child Lebensborn fits, so as to remind you that what is staged by the game is extremely realistic and therefore even more unsettling. In this particular narrative adventure with management elements we have to look after and raise a child born precisely from the Lebensborn program, one of many who found themselves thrown into adoptive families after the war, suddenly transported from German maternity centers to their countries of origin a time the Nazi system collapsed. Norway, the game's setting, was one of the places most affected by the phenomenon, given that Scandinavian women were considered the most naturally suited mothers to carry on the program of expansion of the Aryan race and therefore the privileged subjects for these unions with soldiers Germans. It is easy to understand how, in a country that had suffered from Nazi occupation, such children were seen as a symbol of oppression and treated accordingly by the post-war society, so what is presented on the screen is a sad story, made up of difficulties and misunderstandings, tense relationships and injustices, but also moments of tenderness and joy such as those that can realistically emerge in a difficult childhood, but in a society that is at the end of a long nightmare. A profound human tamagotchi At the beginning of the game you choose whether to adopt a boy, Klaus, or a girl, Karin, but apart from the representation and some secondary elements, the structure does not change and simply plans to raise the adopted child in the best possible way, trying to provide its primary needs, playing with it and talking to it in order to face the thousand difficulties of daily life in such a situation. The management of the child is based on the actions to be carried out within the various units of time that make up the day, between moments of work with the possibility of sewing clothes and making useful objects, and household chores, with the need to do food and in general check that the various parameters of the child between hunger, health and comfort remain on positive levels. The amount of time in each day is limited and this forces us to make difficult choices, just like in real life: working overtime to be able to buy some new object takes away time from playing with the child or cancels a possibility of dialogue on some problem emerged, or the need to make him study or send him to bed early overlaps with possible moments of play that could refresh the spirit. Kind of like being a parent, it's not easy to always make the right choice and it's often difficult to even identify it precisely. The management of the adopted child starts from the satisfaction of primary needs Among the various actions, which take place in a way not unlike real mini-games, we find moments of direct dialogue, which allow us to establish a deeper contact with the adopted son. In these moments we become aware of his dreams and his difficulties, trying to mediate between childhood enthusiasm and the numerous problems that emerge between constant bullying, ostracism of adults and the difficulty of fitting into a society that inexorably places us on the margins. Even in these situations we have to make choices, adopting a certain type of action from time to timedealing with the answers to be given to the child, also deciding how to deal with the question of the biological parents and the possible possibility of meeting them, including how to deal with the subject of Nazism which inevitably emerges amidst the thousand doubts of the child. true, the management part of My Child Lebensborn raises more than one doubt, because it does not seem that the practical choices made on the control of the various parameters have enormous feedback on the evolution of the child and of the story, therefore these decisions seem to serve above all to highlight different narrative elements, rather than lead to actual consequences on the life of the child. On the other hand, it is a mainly narrative experience, therefore the purpose of this title is above all to tell a story: hard and sad, in most cases, but importantly valuable also because it follows a path that has never been previously traveled very much, above all with methods that are possible only through the video game and its natural interactivity.", "date": "2021-07-29", "grade": "8.2"}
