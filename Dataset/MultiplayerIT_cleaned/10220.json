{"name": "Le ali della libert", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74017-skies-of-glory-le-ali-della-liberta.html", "text": "For lovers of propeller planes and shooters set during the Second World War, here is also a reference title on the App Store, capable of setting new technical standards and launching a challenge that is unlikely to be overcome in the immediate future. Developed by Revo Solutions, Skies of Glory is a successful mix between shooter and flight simulation. In fact, all the typical components of both genres are present: from spectacular clashes based on machine gun bursts to yaw control, from the aircraft upgrade to the take-off and landing phases. Three game modes available: single campaign, dogfight and multiplayer both online and via bluetooth. Once we have selected a character and an aircraft, we can try our hand at the campaign or single combat missions, but it's best to first take a tour of the simple tutorial which will explain how to control the aircraft. The control system is entrusted to the accelerometer and touch screen. The first allows us to turn and therefore to control the direction of the aircraft, the second makes all the other commands available: yaw, speed adjustment, weapons and view control (there are two: third-person view, enabled by default, and first-person view). The king of the skies The first impact with Skies of Glory is a bit traumatic, as the plane is not very easy to fly and it is necessary to adjust the sensitivity of the accelerometer (as well as calibrate its ~neutral~ position) to be able to control it better. However, a few minutes are enough to become familiar with the controls and lock on to the first targets, thanks also to a balance of difficulty that increases the level of challenge very gradually. The controls are undoubtedly arranged on the touch screen in a practical way, and although the position of the accelerator (top left) may be disorienting at first, one immediately realizes that in this way the right thumb remains free to operate the arms quickly. The game structure is immediately robust and full of depth, with a good level of AI and a series of spectacular situations that alternate as we proceed in the missions. All this is accompanied by an extraordinary technical realization, which finds its strong point in the quality of the graphics but does not disdain the sound sector, which is produced in well-made music and effects. The polygon count is exceptional, with very well designed planes flying within tremendously extensive and detailed scenarios, perhaps not who knows how varied (mostly mountainous landscapes) but full of excellent textures. The acceleration phases are underlined by a very effective visual effect, as are the explosions and the damage to our opponents when we target them. In short, the general picture speaks to us of a product of the highest level, realistic and profound, spectacular and engaging, with frightening graphics and downloadable for free from the App Store. So where is the catch? Well, on balance (literally), Skies of Glory presents itself as a sort of ~shareware~ title, which can be enjoyed without spending a cent, but only in a very limited way. The ~basic version~, in fact, has a single single mission and a few dogfights, in addition to ~timed~ multiplayer. To purchase the packages with the additional missions, the complete multiplayer mode and possibly other planes in addition to the supplied model, you have to spend a lot of money: the first Mission Pack (with ten missions and one plane) costs 3.99 euros. the Dogfight Bundle (with ninety-five dogfights and the Skirmish mode) also costs 3.99 euros, the Multiplayer mode costs 1.59 euros and the price of the individual additional aircraft varies from 79 cents to 2.39 euros. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-02-01", "grade": "8.5"}
