Zeavis understood the meaning of the artifact that we recovered in Rhem 2 and now it's up to his brother Kales to fill the role of human interface during this third adventure. Don't expect any kind of dialogue though, it's just rare pre-recorded video messages. From here on we will in fact be alone, in the heavy silence of Rhem 3. Once again the exploration takes place by advancing frames from one screen to another, each one to be explored in detail. In fact, it is not rare that looking to the right in an anonymous corridor, a control panel does not jump out containing incomprehensible geometric sequences to be inserted in the right order. Rhem 3 appears today a title that would have made a discreet show of itself at the time of Myst The dictatorship of the left hemisphere This is the bread and butter of Rhem 3, which as always starts with a series of rather bland puzzles and then ends up with puzzles that require hours and hours of rumination to solve. As always, we will be required to retrace the same roads back and forth countless times. In fact, the solution to a puzzle often comes only after many hours of playing with respect to the interface to be activated. In general, however, everything is resolved in powering generators, opening hatches and lowering bridges, not to mention the infinite doors to open. Compared to the previous episodes, however, a few touches of creativity seem to make their way. In fact, much later in the game you will have to deal with a puzzle involving paintings, while collecting a sample of leaves from each tree, you will then have to recompose the song sequence of the birds heard among the fronds. Too bad that to get there we found ourselves wandering around the house without eating for days. Of course, everything is valid if you are a player not accustomed to solving puzzles, but in this case Rhem 3 is not exactly the right title for your palate. If, on the other hand, setting the logic circuits in motion feels as natural as getting out of bed in the morning, then it will only take you a few minutes to be completely absorbed in the world of Rhem 3. Every door leads to another door It is not necessary to have a PhD in physics to complete the game and finally camp out in the longed-for mysterious library. After all, drawing the maps and recomposing the sequences of numbers, words or symbols that solve the last puzzles of the game is a matter of possessing a lot of patience and love for logical meditation. However, most could find themselves wandering around discouraged for hours and hours. Furthermore, the total absence of a narrative sector, even if it were a weak story with sequences or dialogues to activate, penalizes the series as always. Enigma after enigma, the only gratification that Rhem 3 can provide you with is that of proceeding beyond the obstacle. A real shame because the claustrophobic and nagging atmosphere is an ideal setting for an ambiguous and paranoid plot. Evidently Knut Muller, the creator and creator of the saga, is of a very different opinion. At least this time they've scrupled to allow us some minimal animated interaction with the surrounding environment, but if you saw what we're talking about you couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. Touching a dress and seeing it swing will seem like an infinite banality, but for the third chapter of this saga it is a goal achieved. Far from wanting to put the graphics on some pedestal, but Rhem 3 appears today as a title that would have made a discreet show of itself in the time of Myst. You do some math. Needless to mention the music, because it doesn't exist and in the end that's okay, because the effects are all this title needs. What's left then? As always, a binge of original puzzles in a context that makes us want to believe that something will happen after each unlocked door, even if we know very well that there is nothing to see. Who knows, Rhem may not have the potential to shine one day or another. For the moment, however, he is satisfied with emphasizing his classic standard, which someone evidently seems to love in spite of everything. Rhem 3 is available for PC. Comment Rhem 3, as was the case for its predecessors, knows only one direction. Needless to go around it, you must be willing to put yourself to the test for days in an attempt to solve tenacious puzzles. It is a world built according to the geometry of the puzzle, where outside of its bizarre machinery there is nothing else to see. You may believe that at some point the Sphinx himself will show up to test you, but think again. The story is absent, and although there is a relic to recover, it always comes back to haunt you.re neurons. Well, now that most have rightly stepped aside there are those who might love Rhem 3 and who have probably already exhausted its predecessors as well. For them there is a royal feast of puzzles, a true celebration of puzzles, with creative and unique challenges. If nothing else, once you reach the cursed secret library you will have increased your self-esteem by at least two points. a narrative structure Technically it stopped ten years ago PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 500 MHz Pentium III or AMD Athlon RAM: 512 MB RAM Video Card: 16 MB Operating System: Windows 2000/XP/Vista Hard Disk: 700 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.40 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video card: GeForce 8800 GTS with 320 MB memory Operating system: Windows XP Hard Disk: 70 GB Rhem's is an atypical series. Each episode is a step back into the same surreal world, where someone or something we will never know about has scattered mysteries in profusion. If it weren't for the years that separate the first episode from the third, it would be easy to confuse them with each other. Not that this Rhem 3 boasts of who knows what technology, but at least the 640x480 resolution is a distant memory. This fidelity to one's identity is good and bad, because the strengths and weaknesses that we have highlighted when talking about Rhem Collection are in fact the same. We repeat, a world that uses a point and click interface to put the player in front of an environment that seems to hide the Grail, a small narrative element could also have considered it among its priorities. However, there is a purpose that guides our efforts in this third chapter, and it is the discovery of a mysterious relic hidden inside a library, which will make you spend sleepless nights before you can set foot inside. Sinister machinery, puzzles left behind by unknown entities and long silences are however a fascinating mix despite everything, and now we also have a touch of humanity, a room of knowledge that hides the ultimate mystery.
