The all-digital title from the British Hello Games immediately jumped to the public's attention, a mix between a racing and a platform game with looks and playability of pure excellence. Now the turn of the Xbox user has finally arrived, with a renewed edition specifically for Live Arcade, called the Special Edition. Before analyzing the new proposals, let's refresh our ideas on the elements that have made this product great. Death proof The story revolves around the vicissitudes of stunt-man Joe, who on the saddle of his motorcycle tackles a series of routes of increasing difficulty. The game setting is conceptually elementary, it is a question of following horizontal sections completely devoid of curves that culminate with the classic finish line. The level design is defined by the immoderate amount of traps and obstacles placed on the ground, not to mention the numerous ramps capable of hurling Joe's bike to unusual heights, thus also facilitating a discreet vertical development of the circuits. The keystone is all played in the balance between speed and physics of the bike, which can be managed respectively by the back triggers and the lever. We have already seen all this in the phenomenal Trials HD, but Joe Danger embraces the same philosophy to take it in a different direction. The aim is not focused on crossing the finish line, but rather on completing a whole series of activities, from collecting the items hidden in the level to the numerous stunts that can be performed during the jumps, which lead to the conquest of special stars necessary to advance through the leagues of career. As we said before, it is no exaggeration to compare the game to a platformer. Elective affinities In short, the inspiration seems to be directed towards the great Nintendo classics, starting from a comic graphic creation, pleasant and never stingy with details. There is no shortage of races against other runners, set up in special events where the shrewd use of the turbo is essential, rechargeable by wheeling the bike, and which not coincidentally recall another Nintendo milestone, Excite Bike. Yet all this referential attitude is never resolved in a sterile and derivative work, but one that actually manages to live on a brilliance all its own, at times disconcerting. This is one of the few games where a death arouses hilarity rather than anger, thanks to the prevailing humor, of course, but not only. The truth is that Joe Danger: Special Edition is a title so well-finished and overflowing with playability that it avoids any kind of frustration. There is no real sense of urgency, nor constraint, the player is free to face the old trials as many times as he likes to conquer new stars, or restart from the checkpoints. This does not mean that it is easy to complete, the more advanced challenges are able to make you sweat the proverbial seven shirts. For this reason, the comparison with Nintendo for once is far from out of place, the Hello Games product could have easily come out under the effigy of the Japanese house, and by playing it you will find out why. This Special Edition version offers new levels collected under the Laboratory mode, it is about fifty new decidedly demanding challenges and set in abstract scenarios. Xbox 360 goals Joe Danger: Special Edition offers the classic 200 player points spread over a dozen objectives, which is the standard for Live Arcade. To obtain most of it, it is sufficient to complete the career, but above all all the levels that make up the new Laboratory mode, a rather expensive operation! Good luck. J-J-J-Jo Danger! For the rest Joe Danger: Special Edition maintains the characteristics of the version already seen on Playstation unchanged, including the editor mode where it is possible to build the circuit of our dreams, the local multiplayer and obviously the rankings that track the scores of our friends in the list . It is possible to unlock bonus clothes for our avatar by completing certain tasks. Technically there was very little to improve, so we have the same cartoonish style characterized by bright colors, and the main character who constantly steals the show with his irresistible humor. The soundtrack quickly follows the light-hearted tenor with funky tunes and an out-of-the-box commentator, while each action is underlined by a specific sound effect, even the increase of the turbo bar, to continuously stimulate the player's senses. Also in this case a maniacal care is denoted which refers once again to Nintendo, instead it's just the miracle of a small independent English house.
