Card games can be extremely engaging once you enter their complex mechanics but often require you to overcome the obstacle of a not exactly inviting first impact, perhaps appearing as austere as a chessboard or a poorly finished game table, with a side story which can be a bit cheesy or unattractive. Card of Darkness easily overcomes this problem by proposing a characterization built by Pendleton Ward, or the author of the famous animated series Adventure Time, who with his indistinguishable trait manages to give life to a crazy and extremely cheerful universe even starting from simple elements such as decks of cards and a 4x4 grid. Ward's style embellishes what is still a solid game, which has a lot of puzzle game and something of a role-playing game, using cards above all as a means to stage the randomness of the clashes and the construction of the challenge elements. In essence, it is a question of passing levels composed of the aforementioned 4x4 grid going from the lowest row to the upper edge, where the exit is located. To do this, it is necessary to draw cards from the decks found on the boxes and this is where the trouble begins: there are cards with positive effects but above all monster-cards capable of damaging the player and the most interesting thing about Card of Darkness is the fact of having to face them mainly with what we can find at the moment on the grid, that is by continuing to draw cards and trying to frame an optimal sequence of actions in order to clear the way towards the exit of the level, eliminating all the cards from the decks present in the boxes that they can form a pathway from the bottom to the top of the screen. A card puzzle Card of Darkness is based on a considerable amount of rules linked together, so much so that it is impossible to explain in a few words that can also be well understood, so we limit ourselves to indicating some basic characteristics to make it clear what we are dealing with . The presence of hit points, spells and consumable weapons and the clashes against various enemies borrow from the RPG, but everything is structured like a card-based puzzle game. These can represent monsters, weapons, spells and potions, among elements that help the player and above all threats and obstacles to overcome. You start with your bare hands, therefore it is a good rule to look for a weapon among the decks on the grid. Enemies inflict the amount of damage indicated by the number that distinguishes them, with possible variations given by their type such as the possibility of inflicting additional damage from poisoning, having a power level that increases with each turn or the possibility of moving from a square to another. Even the weapons have a number that determines their power and resistance, therefore if it is higher than that of the enemy we win the fight without consequences, otherwise the number of the weapon is reduced proportionally to the difference between the two values, but there is to consider also the fact that if there is a discrepancy between even and odd number the weapon breaks during the attack. Added to this is the obligation to completely eliminate all the cards of a deck from which a card has been drawn, therefore it is necessary to consider carefully before drawing beneficial cards (such as the indispensable potions that recharge hit points or spells) , because if they are at the top of a deck we will then also have to manage all the cards that remain within that box. Confused? It's the least. At first the effect can be alienating but Card of Darkness does a great job of introducing us to its mechanics gradually and above all, given the immediacy of the gameplay, it is natural to learn even by trial and error, simply progressing one game after another to discovering all the various finer details of an apparently chaotic but in truth decidedly rigorous system. Once the first instructive phases have passed, the challenge becomes decidedly tough, with the need to ponder every single move also due to the multiple levels, which require you to clean up multiple grids in sequence to reach the conclusion and make survival more difficult. As mentioned, the game requires you to find solutions to its challenges based on what you can get from the same cards that are on the grid, but this is not the complete picture yet. We must also consider the possibilityability to buy some tokens from the in-game shop using the gold coins earned in the stages: these tokens can provide special abilities to be spent during the levels (turning a card into a weapon or a potion, for example), while a single passive ability can be activated at the start of each grid by selecting a special card from the ones we have available. Added to this are the spells that can be accumulated in the inventory and used when necessary, therefore the strategic approach is based on the ability to adapt to the immediate situation but also relies on a certain upstream preparation, before entering the levels and also trying to plan the moves a little in advance.", "date": "2019-12-24", "grade": "8.5"}
