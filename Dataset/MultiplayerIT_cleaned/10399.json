With the release of this ~Next Chapter~, the idea behind the series returns overwhelmingly, however it has to deal with a profoundly different input system compared to that of the DS; why the Wii-mote can be accurate, but from here to using the pointing device as a pen, to draw on the screen, there goes. It only takes a few moments, once you start the game, to realize the big limits of this operation: the editor integrated in Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter offers us three types of brush and shapes, fill tools and a color palette not very rich, asking us to draw our custom hero's face, chest, arms and legs as if we were masters of ~drawing on the air~. The lines we draw are not optimized by some intelligent correction system, so what will come out of our tests will most likely resemble the utterances on paper of a psychopath or, at best, the first drawings of a child. In this sense, the uselessness of the ~clone stamp~ tool is surprising, which instead of providing us with ready-made objects is limited to standard shapes (hair, eyes, mouth) that are anything but intuitive to use. Fortunately, it is possible to recall the preloaded models and get rid of the task of drawing what the game asks of us every time, however breaking the rhythm of the action with excessively long loading. I drew a booger with legs The villagers of Raposa have been attacked by a sneaky and dangerous enemy, and once again they need help. After creating our character, therefore, we will make ourselves available to them in a series of missions set in different locations. To access each new stage we always have to start from the village, sometimes making a long way, and the operation must be repeated to ~validate~ the completion of a mission. The logical sense of all this walking is obscure, let's say that the developers thought in this way to involve us more in the plot, unfortunately they were wrong and only added a further element of boredom to an already far from compelling structure. As with the previous episode, The Next Chapter presents itself as a very simple two-dimensional platformer in which you have to collect objects, jump from one platform to another and eliminate some enemies by jumping on their heads or hitting them with a punch. The actions that our hero can perform are gradually enriched with new possibilities, thanks to the extra objects that can be collected along the way. The tail, for example, allows us to hook onto certain holds and rotate and then obtain the necessary momentum to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. In some moments, and with increasing frequency, the game confronts us with situations on which it would have been appropriate to focus more, or rather ~live drawing~: we can use the pointing of the Wii-mote to draw platforms on which to jump when we need it, but without loading the editor and in a rather ~agile~ and pleasant way. The introduction of differentiated elements in this sense (see the drawings that react to gravity) adds a little variety, but it is still a minority of situations compared to the bulk of the gameplay. The beauty of playing sports If we are tired of the standard game action, the Raposa village sports hall offers us four alternatives that can also be played in multiplayer, from one to four players. These are precisely four different sports, unfortunately far from fun and characterized by a very low playability. The protagonists this time are cute puppies full of enthusiasm, and luckily we won't have to draw them... That doodle is me Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter is a classic platformer, as we said, characterized by a very simple action: the jumps are not complex, the enemies are few and far from threatening, the puzzles practically do not exist. It seems clear that the target of this product is made up of young and very young people, but this does not mean that years of progress from the gameplay point of view can be ignored. The fact of focusing on interactive graphic elements ends up penalizing the visual quality of the THQ title, especially as regards the animations: you have the netThe feeling of playing with an editor, and this in particular should make you think about the quality of the code. The collisions are visibly inaccurate, but it is above all the general design that is not convincing, starting with the villagers to continue with the enemies and the scenarios, colorful but bare and with a certain tendency to repeat themselves. The only consolation: the frame rate is smooth and stable. The sound sector carries out its work discreetly, without surprising or remaining in the lead: the music is quite catchy, the effects are normal.", "date": "2009-11-09", "grade": "5.2"}
