However, even beautiful things can get tiring in the long run; and in the case of Shrek, we find ourselves nostalgic for the times gone by, when people ran away in panic after seeing him and no one dared go near his swamp. Perhaps transient but dangerous desires, if there is someone who can take advantage of them: the cunning sorcerer Rumplestiltskin offers to make everything go back to how it once was, even if only for one day. Just get Shrek to sign his contract, and for a few hours he can be the scary, lonely ogre he was before he met Donkey, Fiona and Puss in Boots. A temptation too strong to resist... too bad there is a deception behind it! In fact, Shrek finds himself feared again by the population, but he is not the only one: even Fiona and many other ogres are looked at with contempt as they fight against the tyrant who, who knows how, has taken office on the throne of the kingdom of Far Far Away. And guess who this tyrant is? Reality has been changed, therefore, and not just for a few hours: Shrek must win the trust of his old friends and his love (who don't recognize him in this alternate dimension) to put things right and regain the coveted ~ happy ending~. Shrek: Happily Ever After - The Game presents itself right from the start as a product designed for the youngest, but which in any case is pleasant regardless of the age of the player. Fantastic Four The gameplay is based on the alternating use of four different characters (Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Puss in Boots), each with unique abilities, also necessary to solve some simple puzzles. Shrek, for example, is the strongman of the group and in combat he shows off some spectacular wrestling techniques, he can paralyze enemies with a scream and his special ability consists in being able to move huge wooden crates. Fiona is faster and fights using a sword, she can make her ears ~ring~ to stun her opponents and she can set fire to flammable objects she finds within the scenarios. Donkey, probably the weakest in close combat, can make enemies flee by singing songs and his kicks are useful for opening gates, breaking through walls, moving large objects or even pushing improvised boats. Finally, Puss in Boots proves to be effective in fighting (he too, like Fiona, has a sword), can use his sweet gaze to soften his opponents and has the ability to climb walls. In short, a well-assorted group, with each member who can be recalled instantly (just press a direction on the d-pad or a special button on the controller) and has not only its own health bar, but also and above all a own level of experience. In fact, drawing a little from the tradition of RPGs, the developers have endowed each character with the ability to ~level up~ according to the points scored, with clear repercussions on strength and resistance as well as on the power of their special abilities: some objects can be collected only when we have the necessary skills to reach them, others even necessarily require the collaboration of a friend. In this regard it is necessary to open a small parenthesis: Shrek: And they lived happily ever after - The Game has a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players, certainly interesting and nice but which at the same time makes an already too undemanding experience really too much. in itself rather simple and linear. Green is beautiful Our four heroes therefore become more powerful as the game progresses, but experience is not the only element to take into consideration. In fact, scattered within the locations there are numerous chests full of gold coins, coins that we can spend between one stage and another to buy upgrades or special weapons to use during the most complicated fights (if there are any.. .). The impression, therefore, is that of being faced with a tie-in made with a certain care, which does not revolutionize the genre but draws inspiration from some fairly well-made titles (for example the various transpositions dedicated to ~The Chronicles of Narnia ~, based on very similar principles) and puts emphasis on solving puzzles that involve quickly switching between characters, as well as solving a few small puzzles. THEThe combat system, even with all its limitations, transmits the necessary ~feeling of impact~ and is therefore quite satisfying, even if the low level of challenge somewhat ruins the goodness of a contour structure made up of extra upgrades and weapons. Graphics and sound in the PC version are really excellent: the first boasts a good general definition, well-designed and animated polygonal models as well as scenarios full of details and characterized by a good use of colours, the second offers really enjoyable music and dialogues. However, the game turned out to be rather light: we played it at a resolution of 1680x1050 pixels, with all effects maxed out and v-sync activated, without ever dropping below 60 frames per second. The Wii version On the Nintendo console, Shrek: Forever After - The Game is practically identical to the ~major~ versions in terms of structure, while the gameplay has some small differences involving the motion-sensing control system. Nothing transcendental, fortunately: it is not necessary to shake the Wii-mote to fight, for example, but you only have to do it in some situations to get a greater number of gold coins. If possible, therefore, on Wii the game is even easier since you can collect money more quickly and consequently the power-ups can be acquired a little in advance, all at the (further!) detriment of the challenge. The technical sector is clearly the one that suffers most from the technical gap compared to the PC, but it must be said that Activision has done an excellent job in this case too: the frame rate is not very fluid but at least it is stable, the polygonal models are the same albeit slightly less detailed and the general glance is still more than good. It must also be said that on the Wii the game will in all likelihood have a better chance of finding its target user, given that it is a ~casual~ product in many ways, even if it is far from cheap.", "date": "2010-09-13", "grade": "7.0"}
