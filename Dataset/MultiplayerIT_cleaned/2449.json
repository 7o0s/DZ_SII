{"name": "Harvest Moon 2 (GBC)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harvest-moon-2-gbc.html", "text": "At 6 a.m. The story tells us about a small town like many others, in which no one wants to be a farmer anymore: since the farm is going down the drain, the mayor decides to sell it and turn it into a playground: suddenly our hero appears, who offers to manage it! The head of the city gives you three years to transform the decadent farm into a modern reality: do you think you can do it? Old McDonald had a farm. First, you will be asked to choose the gender of the character: even if it is not explicitly stated, I believe that this affects the level of difficulty. It is no coincidence that the girl is equipped with 1000 coins against the boy's 500. Immediately afterwards, the Japanese origins of the game are betrayed: you will be asked to enter the name, and your date of birth. To simplify things, the year has been divided into ~4 months~, spring, summer, autumn and winter, each of 31 days. The last part of the choices asks you if you prefer to have a dog or a cat: the former will keep animals away, while the latter ~should~ occasionally bring something back home! The Town There are 3 game scenarios: city, mountain and farm. The city is east of everything: besides the square, there are all the shops you need: carpentry, seed store, restaurant, hospital, library, livestock and equipment. Everyone has a precise task: the carpenter builds new buildings: a bridge, a more beautiful house, a greenhouse or a sheepfold: in addition to a large monetary outlay, he will also ask you for a quantity of bond: to obtain it, you will have to arm yourself with an ax and go to the mountains to break the roots of fallen trees. Leaving aside the function of the seed store, the restaurant provides you with two things: the ~packages~ of food that you eat every day, and other bulk foods that give you some energy; in fact, our villager has a level of ~resistance~ which gradually wears out: to increase it, you will have to find special fruits by hoeing the ground. There are 10 of them, and their number is equivalent to that of the flowers present, in the ~secret garden~. The library, in addition to preserving the inevitable books with photos (all printable), has the ~trade~ mode, which allows two Game Boy Color to communicate with the Link cable. The game can also be interfaced with Legend of the river King 2, adding new fish and new flowers. Periodically there will be parties: participating actively will improve relations with citizens, thus unlocking some secret modes! The Mountain The mountain is the intermediate stage: there you can find three berries a day to sell, many roots to break and a thermal bath, which gives you some energy. Here too there is a little trick: by walking against the trees behind the hot spring, you can get back close to the house. That's all! The Farm See how good I am? I even learned English! (read the titles!!) On the farm there are some buildings and some dedicated areas: in the house (which can be enlarged) there is a bed, a TV for weather forecasts, and a trunk where you can change the tools you need to take with you : it is in fact possible to use up to four tools at a time. Next to it we find the stable for the cows with its pasture above it, the silos for storing the hay and the chicken coop. The other buildings (greenhouse and sheepfold) can be built later. The first screen closes with the ~Secret Garden~, if you've been paying attention, you already know what it's for. Immediately below we find the fields and the fishing area: there are two fields, one can only be reached after building the bridge. First you will have to remove the stones and roots, hoe the soil, sow and water every day. Hoe, sickle and hammer, if used too much they break: you can have them fixed by the one who sells the tools: after three days you will have the ~super~ tools, much more powerful. Fishing, on the other hand, is perhaps the only sour note in the game: by fishing all day you can also earn 3000 coins, much more than with any other activity. There is also a tank where to ~park~ the fish caught and sell them later. Needless to say, it could distract you from your main tasks And the game is??? The game has excellent graphics. We are largely at the level of Zelda, and the story (as well as the level of interaction) is very high. Periodically your neighbors will come to ask you for pleasures, invite you to parties, they will give you objects and suggestionsbased on your friendship level. Cows are equipped with a ~love level~ that is a measure of your goodness. The three years are long, and after a very euphoric initial period, a bit of boredom can arise, however mitigated at the halfway point of the first year: every spring, new tools will become available. However, the game is studied in detail: over twenty different fish, many catchable insects, many plants, and ~goodies~ such as the malaise that will follow a day spent in the rain, the sensation of being faced with a product ~designed~ in minimum details is really very high. There are very long FAQs in English online, a sign of a difficult and long game. Any interaction with other users (both between the usual game and with Legend of the river King 2) improve this ~boredom~ aspect. In other words, the game gets full marks in all items, except in longevity, where it gets 9. If you love long and laborious ~growth~ simulations, you've found a way to ruin your summer (!); if, on the other hand, you love games like Zelda, after a complete session you will hardly play them again understood? Bertocci ~RED~ Daniele And the game is??? PROS - excellent quality - well cared for - fun - suitable for all ages CONS - can in the long run be repetitive for some Ahh work! There are hard jobs and easy jobs. Being able to live in the green Tuscan countryside, I can assure you that the farmer's job is the hardest that can exist. Strict schedules, cold in winter and heat in summer, heavy tools, meager harvests. One might wonder why a person today should do this job; even if, in fact, almost nobody does it anymore: greenhouses and tractors yield more and cost much less effort. Anyway, dedicated to all of you, my gray metropolitan boys, here is Harvest Moon 2, for GBColor, game by Natsume, completely dedicated to cultivating your little farm", "date": "2001-07-14", "grade": null}
