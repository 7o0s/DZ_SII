Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. ~There is a special city under water, who knows where it is and who lives there~, recited the Snorky theme song, and in fact the depths of the seas have often been the protagonists of fantastic stories, just like that of Quadropus Rampage. The protagonist of the game is in fact a brave octopus with four tentacles, determined to eliminate the threats that infest the ocean and, in particular, the evil god of the seas. To achieve his goal, our character will have to face a myriad of randomly generated levels, in full roguelike style, and wield many different weapons with his own suction cups, each with unique characteristics in terms of damage, range and frequency of blows . Once the first levels have been completed, the difficulty of the game begins to increase and so does the number of enemies, who at a certain point will try to hit us from all directions, getting dangerously close. In addition to attacking them with the equipped weapon, we will be able to avoid their touch using a quick dash, generate a defensive bubble to decrease any damage suffered and finally activate a special move capable of defeating entire groups of opponents. Quadropus Rampage is an interesting experiment in the field of roguelike-style action games Sea Salad The control system adopted by the developers of Quadropus Rampage refers entirely to the touch screen and works through the classic combination of virtual d-pad and buttons. On the right side of the screen there are four: a larger one for the standard attack, one for sprinting, one for generating the defensive bubble and finally one for the special attack. but it can be used in a limited way. Each of the levels is characterized by a set of platforms that often hide annoying chasms, annoying in the sense that you end up in it quite easily and it is quite a bit frustrating. It is a consequence of the type of action proposed, indeed rather ~slippery~ and devoid of particular emphasis on enhancing the blows inflicted. But it is also the only real problem that we have noticed in this title, which can be downloaded for free and, unlike many other freemium, does not require any outlay to be fully enjoyed. Yes, there are two types of currency, one virtual and the other real, but it is possible to do everything we want by using only the first, for example to boost the character permanently in the menu between one game and another, improving the its ability to attack, speed, endurance and even the type of support unit, which by default is a small but stubborn bluefish. The upgrades make the game mechanics even more interesting, allowing us to reach advanced levels and ring boss fights with relative ease, but always with a certain attention to the general balance. The graphics of Quadropus Rampage initially seem to wink at pixel art, and some screens quite clearly pay homage to productions such as Super Meat Boy, but in-game it does not always appear very pleasant, while recognizing a good use of colors and a excellent fluidity.", "date": "2013-07-13", "grade": "8.0"}
