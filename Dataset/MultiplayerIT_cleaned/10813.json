{"name": "The Wheelman - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-wheelman-recensione.html", "text": "It is certainly not the first time that a video game has been based on a film, but the case of Wheelman is certainly particular, which comes out first as a game and will only see the light of day in the form of a Hollywood film in several months. The ingredients for a successful project are all there, a mix of adrenaline-pumping action scenes, fights, battles aboard powerful racing cars and an incredible protagonist, Vin Diesel. Undercover We are immediately catapulted into the shoes of Milo Burik, who is none other than the perfect virtual reproduction of Vin Diesel, an undercover agent on a mission to Barcelona to try to understand more about the three most powerful criminal organizations that infest the Catalan city: the Romanians , the Los Lantos and the Chulos Canallas. To do this we have to infiltrate as ~drivers~, but never as in this case the term is reductive, and carry out different types of missions for each gang, always being careful to escape the control of the police. Before going into the details, it is important to underline how fascinating the chosen location is, not the classic American metropolis but a true old European city, with its particular buildings and architecture so dear to tourists from all over the world. To move easily through the streets of Barcelona we have the possibility of using two different systems, the GPS or the PDA. The GPS helps us as a navigation ~compass~ in real time complete with a green arrow on the screen that indicates the right direction while the PDA, which can be activated by pressing the back button on the joypad, as a static map in which we will find all the events indicated which it will be possible to participate, from the missions of the main storyline to the different alternative challenges that we will be able to complete. Once a vehicle has been stolen, as in GTA we can do it simply by pressing the Y key, we can access the different active competitions. After completing these missions you get a rating that indicates how fast and efficient you were in achieving your goal. The alternate modes are: Taxi, Custom, Rampage, Hot Potato, Fugitive, Street Race and Contracts. In the first we simply have to get a passenger from point A to point B as quickly as possible. In the second we have to locate the required target, usually a high-value car, and steal it from its rightful owner using one of Milo's Hollywood moves , the Air Jack. In practice, once our protagonist has reached the correct distance from the vehicle to be caught, he jumps over the roof and, entering through the window with an acrobatic maneuver, manages to take possession of the vehicle. In addition to being very spectacular, this move becomes fundamental not only in this type of mission but above all during those of the main plot, when it is necessary to change the vehicle because it is damaged or when we will have to steal a load from our rivals in speed. Returning to ~Made to order~ once we have taken the car we must take it back to the garage without doing any damage to it. In Fury mode, on the other hand, we have to destroy all parts of the scenario with the aim of obtaining a high number of damages. By destroying the required elements several times we will get many more points. During the ~Hot Potato~ missions, however, we have the task of acting as couriers, literally flying from one checkpoint to another. In ~Fugitive~ it is easy to understand that one must escape... in this case from the other gangs. Road racing is nothing more than a race to finish first, a fight in which anything goes. Finally, the purpose of Contracts is to attack armored vehicles on which therefore firearms have no effect, we can only use the brute force of our vehicle. Only one driver During the main story not only are new alternative missions unlocked but you also discover how to win clashes with rival gangs. As already mentioned, a fundamental move by Vin / Milo is that of the Air Jack which more than sometimes will save our skin by allowing us to abandon our burning vehicle and take that of an unsuspecting Catalan driver. The other two fundamental tricks of our protagonist are the Precision Shot and the Cyclone. Both can only be achieved after filling the classic power indicator, here called Focus, this loads every time we do something dangerous and at the same time very cinematic, for example running against traffic or performing an AirJack or attacking enemy vehicles . Both tricks make the game enter a sort of bullet time, time slows down giving us the possibility to shoot accurately using the gun from inside the machine. But if with the Precision Shot it is possible to shoot towards the aOpponents who are in front of us or at our side, aiming accurately at the pilots or at the weak points of the vehicles, with the Cyclone one of the most ~stylish~ scenes seen so far in the Fast and Furious films is created. The car is spun and it rotates exactly 180 degrees while continuing its normal course, thus allowing us to shoot through the front window at the enemies who are behind us. In other words, for a short distance we go backwards by shooting the opponents behind us. A great way to clear out the pursuers. In addition to these special shots it is possible to attack gang members and their vehicles using the means that we have available among all those circulating in Barcelona, from cars, to motorcycles, to SUVs to trucks. In fact, by tilting the right analog stick it is possible to abruptly swerve left or right and leap forward. This rapid movement allows us to crush our opponents against the roadside until they are deprived of energy. When they are actually one step away from defeat an indicator starts flashing and this makes it clear that with the last attack it is possible to end the chase with a highly spectacular scene that normally ends with an explosion. Different missions The missions we are facing are very varied, stealing a car on commission or participating in the escape of a gang member, driving a large truck across Barcelona defending ourselves from rival attacks or chasing a subway train in search of precious documents. As we face these challenges, the game area expands, and new districts of the city become available, overall it takes about five or six hours of play to be able to roam freely throughout Barcelona. We can only underline the good variety of these objectives, since in essence the constant is always to destroy the opposing vehicles and reach a pre-established point, otherwise boredom would peep out much sooner. The driving missions in the course of the main story alternate with those on foot in which with a good arsenal available we will be able to hunt down the gangs. These walking levels are certainly the least successful for the developers, the scenarios are simple and often repetitive but above all the paucity of the opponents' artificial intelligence emerges. The auto-aim system works well, making the task too much easier, which in short results in a ~hold the trigger and shoot~ without any kind of strategy. After having accumulated experience and sufficient hours of play, around ten, the plot will become more intriguing and even the more ~substantial~ missions, connected to each other, will lead us to a dramatic ending with an important decision to make. To complete the game in its entirety, with all the sub-missions, you need about 25 hours of play, longevity is therefore guaranteed above all by a highly cinematic plot but we doubt that you will want to put Wheelman back on your console. Technically speaking From a technical point of view Wheelman was certainly a surprise, it is in fact the first game of this type to take advantage of the now famous Unreal Engine 3 and the results are at least partially visible. Barcelona is sufficiently cared for and a lot of attention has been paid by the developers of Tigon in recreating its peculiar architecture, a pity that the interaction with the buildings is practically absent except for those elements, such as road signs, bus stops and umbrellas, which are on the road and can be destroyed by vehicles without problems. Exceptional to say the least is the polygonal model that reproduces Vin Diesel but the characters that surround the story are also very good. The vehicles proposed in the game are good, we underline the official license of the Opel Astra while the other cars are absolutely fictitious. We have noticed some sporadic slowdowns in the game engine during the game, but these are absolutely rare phenomena. The artificial intelligence of the rivals during the car fights is credible while, as already mentioned, it becomes very bad in the on-foot firefights. A parenthesis, unfortunately negative, is that concerning the police, its implementation in the game was absolutely unsuccessful given that the artificial intelligence is too elementary and the chases are not at all realistic, even when our level of crime becomes higher yes he manages to escape capture simply by moving randomly. The difficulty level is set discreetly and Wheelman is never frustrating thanks to a good systemsave through checkpoints even during missions. In addition to the main storyline and the various pure arcade racing missions, wandering around the Catalan city we will find some hidden elements of the scenario that will have to be destroyed to increase our score, an interesting incentive to fully explore the game area. We were surprised by the fact that a dynamic system for managing the hours of the day and night was not introduced, of course the missions take place at different times of the day but seeing the conditions change in real time is another thing. Overall, the graphic impact is pleasant, perhaps a little too spartan and without the care now necessary to excel. The driving model, definitely arcade and could not be otherwise, performs its function discreetly allowing you to drive the different vehicles without too many problems, a little more problematic is instead the control of the motorcycles with a slightly too accentuated sensitivity. Before closing, we can only highlight that no type of online game is planned, perhaps because the plot is too important a part of Wheelman but it is certainly an important lack. Exclusively on Multiplayer.it a video excerpt of Fast and Furious: Only Original Parts starring Vin Diesel, expected in cinemas for April 10th, and the interview with the game's Producer! Interview with Joe Neate, Producer of Wheelman for Midway Games Newcastle Multiplayer.it: How did Vin Diesel participate in the development of Wheelman? Did he give you any suggestions to make the game more fun?? Joe Neate: Vin has been involved since the beginning of the project. He's really a huge fan of the game and it was great to get his suggestions for Wheelman. He discussed various aspects with our Creative Director, Simon Woodroffe, always finding the right understanding. He was particularly enthusiastic about the vehicle combat system present in the game, and above all he provided us with useful suggestions to make it more profound. M.it: It seems that Vin Diesel is a true gamer, is that right? What titles do you prefer? JN: Absolutely! Love MMORPGs and play World of Warcraft like everyone else. He regularly plays several games on Xbox Live and one of the titles he was working on when he first met our Creative Director was Dead or Alive 4. He played them all!M.it: Vin's polygon model in the game it is really cared for in an exceptional way, several motion capture sessions will have been necessary, did Vin Diesel willingly undergo this procedure? JN: Of course, Vin was very professional when working with the developers, even though he was busy shooting the film. He wanted at all costs for the character to be as strong and realistic as possible, and he really did everything he could do to help us. M.it: The thing that is really great about Wheelman is the cinematic game scenes. Did Vin give you any help in making the game have a more distinctive cinematic edge? JN: Absolutely. Working with Vin has given us connections in Hollywood that we otherwise wouldn't have had. He contacted Hollywood screenwriters who worked closely with us in developing the story, always keeping in mind the gameplay aspects we wanted to achieve. Being able to work with these guys was really a great opportunity. As we developed side-by-side with him and his studio, Tigon, we reviewed every storyboard, every animation, and every scene numerous times until we were satisfied. It took millions of phone calls, video conferences and emails to make everything perfect, and this can be seen in the finished product. M.it: It's the first time that Unreal Engine 3 is used for a title like Wheelman and the result was really good. Is it really that easy to work with this engine and its development tools? JN: Originally Unreal Engine 3 was not created for this kind of games. It has traditionally been used for shooters set in a smaller playing space. At the beginning of the project we spent a lot of time working on the technical part in order to get an open world, traveling at the speed of our vehicles (and we assure you it's extreme!) and it was a great achievement for our developers to make it work so perfectly . Now, thanks to our work, this technology is also available for the other Midway studios, and this is a great achievement for us. However, the Kismet tool provided with the Unreal Engine allowed us to quickly prototype all the features of our game (such as the combat system", "date": "2009-03-19", "grade": null}
