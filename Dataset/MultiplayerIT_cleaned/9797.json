Sure, the big name alone draws attention, but building a game based on a superhero with an original script and its own characterization is not the relatively simple operation that seems to be the good old tie-in, refuge safe for any self-respecting publisher. It's not easy, but when you manage to associate a good game structure with the presence of a super-hero, you can enjoy an edge over a normal action game thanks to the charisma of the character, to the entire universe linked to this and to his particular characteristics as a fighter. Only last year such an operation was perfectly centered by Rocksteady Studios with Batman: Arkham Asylum, a product that has managed, in addition to establishing itself for its good play structure, to present an excellent characterization of the character, in line with the most extreme and dark visions of the man-bat. Something similar is also attempted by Beenox with this Spider-Man: Dimensions, a game about Spider-Man which, in addition to attempting to conquer the public from the point of view of entertainment, also tries to impose a particular vision of the famous character, framing him from different points of view and taking advantage of different graphic styles and alternative settings in this regard. Four versions of Spider-Man are present in this game, belonging to four different universes: Amazing Spider-Man (the classic), Noir Spider-Man (an original 30s version of Spider-Man with noir colors), Ultimate Spider-Man (with our hero bonded to the dark alien symbiote) and Spider-Man 2099, set in the future. The presence of four different versions of the protagonist with their respective abilities and different characteristics obviously helps the cause of the variety in the gameplay and the idea holds up well for a good part of the game. Some technical uncertainty and the heaviness of the game action which in any case begins to emerge after a few hours, however, prevents this title from reaching the highest levels of videogame production. The dissociated Spider-Man The pretext for such a strange situation is obvious: as illustrated at the beginning of the game, Mysterio aims at the theft of the ~board of Order and Chaos~ an event that Spider-Man obviously cannot tolerate. In an attempt to stop the theft from the museum, the magical artifact breaks into various fragments, cracking the very fabric of reality and spreading into four different dimensions, which risk colliding with each other. It is the task of the four different Spider-Man belonging to each dimension to recover the fragments of the table, under the guidance of the enigmatic Madame Web, whose omniscient voice accompanies the various super-heroes (or rather, the various versions of the same super- hero) during the adventure. Within the simple search for objects, secondary adventures and clashes with various villains are obviously set, each linked to the particular universe in which the four protagonists find themselves. The main story is of a disarming and ancient simplicity like the video game itself, or rather the search for different objects scattered around various settings, each to be conquered by knocking down a certain boss, but the way in which this unfolds in the particular and fragmented game world manages to pick up a rather hackneyed premise and present it in an interesting way. The four worlds differ substantially from each other and in the same way also the different versions of the protagonist, whose appearance changes together with his personality, complete with behavior and tendency for classic Spider-Man jokes. Similarly, the villains belonging to the different worlds, although linked to the typical Spider-Man tradition, are filtered through the particular vision adopted to characterize the different universes, with substantial changes to the appearance of historical characters such as the Green Goblin, Octopus and others. The idea succeeds well in making the progression in the game interesting, despite the soporific simplicity of the initial pretext and the absence - which is rather felt - of the now characteristic city of New York to be freely explored with cobwebs, sacrificed in favor of a much more orthodox and narratively functional, but also decidedly limiting, classic forced progression from level to level. Playstation 3 trophies 43 trophies are collectible in Dimensions. Most of them are related to the progssion between levels and the achievement of particular moments in history, but to obtain the complete collection it is necessary to dedicate oneself carefully to a series of particularly demanding performances. Spider life Those who have had the opportunity to play other titles based on Spider-Man will know more or less what to expect from this Dimensions, which at the core of the gameplay fully demonstrates its belonging to the tie-in series based on the Marvel super-hero. We therefore find ourselves moving between different levels by knocking down enemies and trying to reach the fragments of the table, exploiting the various powers typical of Spider-Man, with different variations depending on the ~dimensional~ version of the protagonist. The use of the web, strength, spider sense and the ability to adhere to walls are obviously the basis of Spider-Man's abilities, the mastery of which is necessary to be able to move better within the various environments and to be able to shoot down enemies. In addition to jumping and climbing on any type of wall, moving often occurs through the typical undulatory movement executable by throwing cobwebs and using them as lianas to move in the air, while the combat phases are characterized by an enormous amount of attacks and defensive maneuvers, further expandable with the purchase of new powers through the spending of points accumulated by completing the levels. As far as these points are concerned, there is a decidedly spot on original idea on the part of Beenox: within each mission a ~web of destiny~ develops in which some particular actions to be carried out are highlighted (eliminate a certain number of enemies, perform particular moves, stay within given time limits), in general alternative objectives to be achieved while we are dedicated to the main story. The satisfaction of these requests determines the conquest of a certain number of points, as well as the opening of new objectives to be pursued. The points thus earned can be spent on the acquisition of new powers, costumes, accessories or extra materials on Spider-Man to be consulted in the appropriate gallery. While adding practically nothing to the depth of the game and to the unfolding of events in the various chapters, this particular initiative nonetheless contributes to following the action with greater interest by diversifying the experience and approach to combat or exploration of the levels, managing to partially vary the somewhat repetitive action of the game. Another element of diversification, this even more evident, is the clear division of the game world into 4 different dimensions, each characterized by its own graphic representation but also by some variations in the style of play. The phases with The Amazing Spider-Man are the more traditionalist ones, with the protagonist able to perform devastating hammer attacks with his web, Ultimate Spider-Man has a more violent approach thanks to the Rage mode that the black costume is in able to deal extra damage, Spider-Man 2099 is able to move at great speed while the huge skyscrapers that make up his world guarantee a good dose of action in free fall and vertical displacement while Noir represents a digression, completely unheard of for Spider-Man, in the world of stealth. The 1930s Spider-Man with leather suit is physically weaker than the others but has the ability to hide in the shadows, becoming practically invisible and attacking undisturbed by them with devastating effect. 4 different representations The idea of the 4 different dimensions is also reflected in the graphic representation of the game, characterized by as many different styles and in line with the different versions of the protagonist. The sections starring the Amazing version stage a more or less contemporary world, represented with a sort of cel-shading that increases the comic effect of rather realistic settings, an effect similar to that used for the phases with Ultimate. With Spider-Man 2099 the graphic style changes quite radically, staging deeply futuristic settings and rather detached from reality, while even more characterized in a peculiar way is Noir, whose adventures set in a 1930s world stand out for a particular representation desaturated, based on strong contrasts between light and dark tones that well represent the dependence on shadows and the contrast with light. Stylistically, the work carried out is excellent, moreover supported by interlude scenes in computer graphics that are truly enjoyable as well as directorically apt. However, there are some flaws in the technical realization: beyondAside from sporadic polygonal management problems, which can culminate in fake interpenetrations or unconvincing animations, the persistent annoyance is that linked to the camera. Showing the protagonist up close and often in confined play areas, the shot tends to get confused with Spider-Man's fast and wide-ranging movements, resulting in difficulty figuring out where we're going and what exactly. we are doing, contrasting with the good control system that the game is equipped with. The audio sector performs its function excellently, especially as regards dubbing and dialogues, with the first which differs according to the protagonists, helping to highlight the character differences of the four versions of Spider-Man well and the others which perfectly reproduce the typical light-hearted and ironic style of this Marvel super-hero, with exchanges always bordering on sarcasm between Spider-Man, Madame Web and the various enemies to face.", "date": "2010-09-20", "grade": "7.8"}
