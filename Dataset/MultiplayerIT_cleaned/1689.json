{"name": "Sonic Mega Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-mega-collection.html", "text": "A story with a capital S Sonic Mega Collection is already a great ~package~ only for the quality of some of the games included. However, let's try to understand in what sense some of the classics contained in this collection constitute an obligatory stop in the history of video games: then let's think of the face of Sega today and compare it with that of Sega in the first half of the 90s. Today we certainly see a large, historic house, without which the current face of videogame entertainment would have an infinite number of expressions less, but we can also see a name that is in some ways controversial and unfortunate, often commercially frustrated in its position as innovativeness and reluctantly withdrew from the hardware market to pursue a software-only policy that has not borne the desired results either at the box office or on critics. Looking back to the early 90s, however, the years from which all the titles in this collection come from, Sega was synonymous with innovation and coolness both on the hardware and software markets, the only challenger capable of toppling, with the glorious MegaDrive, a Nintendo monopoly at the time much more radical than Sony's hegemony today. Sonic was a fast, captivating mascot, who forcefully entered the register of the greats by dragging the MegaDrive with him to the commercial hymn of ~Sega does what Nintendon't~. Sonic wasn't the usual copy of Mario, it was a different platformer, more adrenaline-pumping and visceral, and therefore unique in itself. Loading the very first, revolutionary, very fast Sonic of 1991 and reaching the fantastic Starlight Zone in this faithful collection from an emulative point of view, fortunately, always gives the same sensations. The same is true if you decide to load Sonic 2, to roll in the amazing high-speed tunnels of the Chemical Plant, become SuperSonic or blame Tails the fox for interfering more than helping; if you venture into the vast levels of Sonic 3, appreciating the ~cooler~ style of the hedgehog against his new nemesis Knuckles; or, finally, if you decide to experience the thrill of using Knuckles in the big, challenging, stylish levels of Sonic & Knuckles. All of these experiences are intact, still thrilling ten years on from the originals and - thankfully - almost perfectly emulated in Sonic Mega Collection. But here is the list of available and unlockable titles. A look at the originals... Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 Sega) A look at the originals... Historic beginning for an almost infinite saga of sequels and spin-offs, Sonic the Hedgehog and his very fast, captivating hedgehog represented a very powerful response to Mario's Nintendo overwhelming power, becoming the symbols of a ~cooler~ and faster attitude to video games. Sonic jumps, runs at unimaginable speeds, spins 360 and darts off to save his animal friends from the evil mad inventor Ivo Robotnik and recover the precious Emeralds. Fast, very original, a manifesto of a unique way of understanding video games. Verdict: CLASSIC Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (1992 Sonic Team) A look at the originals... Very similar to its predecessor both in level design and in aesthetics and game concept, Sonic 2 still does an excellent job of further cleaning up and refining the physics of the environments and collisions. But it also does more than refine: it introduces the now-standard Spin Dash, which allows you to build speed and start quickly from a standstill; features a split-screen challenge mode for two players; and above all introduces the legendary two-tailed fox Miles Tails Prowler, who will accompany Sonic (and his new Emerald-powered SuperSonic version) in all the games to come. Verdict: CLASSIC Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994 Sega Technical Institute) A look at the originals... Dr. Robotnik is back and this time, sowing discord, unleashes Sonic against his new nemesis and his future friend-rival, the now famous Knuckles. The storyline becomes a little more complex than the ~fairytale~ model of the first two chapters and inaugurates the trend towards fiction typical of the more modern games of the saga. But, regardless of the accessory plot, the game is very faithful to the concept of its predecessors, expanding the levels and introducing a more marked exploratory aspect than the usual acrobatic escape as well as a slightly bolder and more slender graphic style. Also new are some two-player modes, the ability to save progress and to play with Tails as well. Verdict: EXCELLENT Sonic & Knucles (1994 Sonic Team) A look at the originals... The original Sonic and Knuckles is a true collector's item for all fans: Sega, in fact, marketed it in a special cartridge which,in turn, it featured a cartridge input at the top through which to interface the game with the other chapters of the saga. Furthermore, Sonic and Knuckles can be played with both Sonic and Knuckles the Echidna: being the latter capable of climbing and gliding, the game lends itself to different levels of gameplay. As for connectivity, by entering Sonic 1 the player would have had access to a series of reworked subgames from Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles. By entering Sonic 2 he could have played the second chapter of the saga using Knuckles. The most interesting interaction, however, was that between the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge and that of Sonic 3. In fact, once the two games are combined, they become a huge, single adventure with a 34 Mega plot, character selection, ability to save, non-linear use of levels and numerous bonuses. The slightly higher difficulty and the more complex construction of the levels, combined with a higher level audiovisual cosmetics, make this chapter a great swan song of the 16bit saga. In Sonic Mega Collection, combinations between Sonic and Knuckles and other titles are unlockable as extras (see below). Verdict: CLASSIC Sonic Spinball (1993 Sega Technical Institute) A look at the originals... Sonic, when rolled up, had ogled its resemblance to a pinball (pinball for Americans) from the very first title. In the second chapter, Sega even inserted a level set in a huge casino complete with pinball machines and springs of all kinds on which to bounce the hedgehog, which has now become a clich of each new incarnation. No wonder, then, for this attempt by Sega to build a solid pinball game in all respects starring Sonic. The game is technically a bit disappointing, with a low-profile audio / video sector and imprecise controls. However, it is a nice addition to the collection. Verdict: FAIR Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (1993 Compile) A look at the originals... It is, neither more nor less, the classic and always very enjoyable Puyo Puyo, a puzzle game localized here and aesthetically altered with the introduction of Dr. Robotnik, the villain of the Sonic saga. Drop the cute blobs to join them horizontally or vertically four or more at a time to make them disappear and possibly set off chain reactions. Be careful not to bottle yourself up, reaching the ceiling and its Game Over. For one or two players, in various modes. Always entertaining and pleasantly characterized. Rating: GOOD Sonic 3D Blast! (1996 Traveller's Tales) A look at the originals... By 1996 the Megadrive's shockwave had petered out and Nintendo's SuperNES was on the verge of obliterating Sega's 16-bit entirely thanks to technological superiority and an impressive array of killer applications, including the Donkey saga. Kong Country and Super Mario RPG, titles equipped with pleasant graphics pre-rendered by powerful workstations to increase their cleanliness and visual impact. Sega tried quite unsuccessfully to step into this groove with Sonic 3D Blast, with a 3/4 isometric view and pre-rendered graphics. The visual result is nice, but the gameplay falters and is not even remotely close to the classics of the saga. Rating: DISCREET ... and a look at the Extras Unlike the first titles, all modes and subsequent Extra games are not available from the start but are unlockable in Sonic Mega Collection Blue Spheres ... and a look at the Extras At the release of the special Sonic and Knuckles cartridge, the first chapter of the saga was the only one that could not afford to be replayed with the newcomer Knuckles. In fact, problems with the color palette prevented it without laborious reprogramming. Sega then decided to randomize the Sonic and Knuckles bonus stage: in Sonic Mega Collection, this subgame formerly known as ~Special Stages~ was renamed ~Blue Spheres~. Rating: PASSABLE Sonic 2 with Knucles ... and a look at the Extras Simply, the mode that combined the special Sonic and Knuckles cartridge with Sonic 2, allowing Knuckles to be used in the second chapter. Verdict: PASSABLE Sonic 3 and Knuckles ... and a look at the Extras This is the aforementioned union between Sonic and Knuckles and Sonic 3, thanks to which players can enjoy an adventure and an alternative storyline and which combines the two games in a single 34 Mega course, adding extras, secrets of various genre and the possibility to play with Sonic, with Tails, with Knuckles or with Sonic and Tails together as in the second episode. Among the extras,a series of Super Emeralds and the first and only appearance of Super Tails. In addition to a dutiful save mode. Rating: EXCELLENT Flicky (Sega of Japan 1991) ... and a look at the Extras A very dated game with decidedly ancient gameplay, Flicky puts you in the role of defending young ~Chirps~ from a menacing cat named Tiger. The gameplay, a strange mix between the first Mario Bros and ancient ladder games like Circus Atari, consists in collecting all the helpless birds and bringing them to safety avoiding the predator's traps.Rating: PASSABLE Ristar the Shooting Star (Sega of Japan 1995) ... and a look at the Extras Ristar is certainly the most attractive extra of the whole collection. It is a classic platformer but with a good dose of originality: Ristar is in fact equipped with extendable arms, thanks to which he can cling to enemies and walls, climb environments, swing from platforms of various shapes, throw objects, rotate, activate levers and contraptions or unleash his Meteor Strike. Good playability, varied game design and excellent graphic proposal. Rating: GOOD Classic, good, classic, decent, classic, good... Sonic Mega Collection therefore includes excellent titles for any gamer worthy of the name. The four chapters of the Sonic platform saga stand out decisively on the others, together constituting a more than valid reason to own the collection. Even the new platform episodes on GameBoy Advance do not have the same attractive force towards the player. The other titles, including the secret ones, are of fluctuating but never insufficient quality, enjoyable alternatives within a package like the one we have in our hands. However, for all titles, these are games that are technically anchored to their era. Graphically speaking, therefore, as well as for the sound, the suspension of a ~contemporary~ judgment in favor of a ~communicative~ one is taken for granted. A judgement, that is, that looks at what a title can express regardless of its technological advancement: in this sense, games like Sonic Spinball today appear aesthetically not very enjoyable exactly as in the past, while some of the best moments of Sonic 2 or Sonic and Knuckles remain entirely unaffected and unassailably aesthetic. In this sense, Flicky is also a nice game which, while appearing decidedly dated, is very enjoyable. The only notable extra is the nice platformer Ristar, while Blue Spheres, rather than a new game, is nothing more than a modified version of the Sonic and Knuckles bonus level. But Sonic and Knuckles also deserves a separate discussion. It is in fact a game that Sega marketed in a special cartridge, which combined the games into a single experience with an alternative storyline. Too bad that, in this collection, the following opportunities are ~unlockable~ and considered as ~extras~, in an evident forcing of the spirit of the originals. Anthology? Yes! But how, and why? It is by following this forcing that we arrive at the real sore points of the collection, that is the bad progressive unlocking system and the insipidity of the extras package. The unlockable extra games, which we have described above following those available from the beginning, are accessible not according to a logical criterion, but according to the number of times you play a game. In an unpredictable and cumulative way, in short, the player will have to operate all the games dozens of times and go back to the menu until he finds something new. The whole procedure (not to mention the Sonic and Knuckles affair) sounds particularly unjustified: not only would a more meritocratic criterion have already been preferable, but we are obviously light years away from a work of historical collection, of a time frame, of a reasoned reproposition -l-Smah Bros or a-l-Activision Anthology that similar titles would have deserved. From a collection of classics of this caliber, one expects, above all, an at least captivating interface: a languid little tune in the menu is not enough to increase the effect of nostalgia and the background of the (few) options that flanks the GameCube controller with that (not even first version) of the Megadrive. A much broader historical and museum setting is expected, the lack of which is not filled by the few lines of information from Sonic Mega Collection. The scrollable and zoomable manuals are a very nice addition, as are the covers for all issues of the Sonic-inspired comic series. The same, however, cannot be said of the bonus films, quite useless, of laughable video quality and truly those of a promotional disc rather than a historical collection: the", "date": "2003-04-10", "grade": null}
