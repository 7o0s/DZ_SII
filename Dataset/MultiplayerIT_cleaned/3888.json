{"name": "Cabela's: The Hunt - Championship Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cabelas-the-hunt-championship-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The protagonist of this review, Cabela's: The Hunt - Championship Edition, is a video game and as such, excluding those that set out to train soldiers, has among its strengths the ability to subtract the action from reality, thus allowing us to killing animals of every shape and color without being murderers or, in this case, hunters. In fact, the title Saber Interactive puts us on the heels of deer, elk, wild boar, alligators and bears in the middle of the wild North American nature, looking for large prey to hang on our virtual wall. Gameplay and arsenal The Cabela's brand has accustomed us to hunting experiences that are almost never fully successful although always capable of mixing fun and simulated hunting with a moderate effectiveness. But the latter is largely sacrificed with this chapter for Switch which takes the path of simplification, eliminating blood, the possibility of reclaiming the animals killed and a salient part of the sequences that show us a hit in slow motion. In fact, the radiographic details dedicated to the affected organs have disappeared, giving way to simple killing after which the animal's body quickly disappears. And it's a real shame not so much for the macabre details, which we can easily do without, as for those cuts that end up cutting off the legs of the gameplay, giving us back an extremely simplified action. Among other things, the suspicion that censorship has little to do with it becomes more and more full-bodied in the face of the elimination of the influence of the hunter's breath on aiming and the total renunciation of ballistic dynamics, both elements that would, if nothing else, guarantee a certain satisfaction after hitting a shot. And this is precisely the major flaw of a title that simply asks us to wander around following the tracks highlighted by luminous indicators and paying attention not to make noise and to the direction of the wind, given that such a distraction could reveal our presence at the nostrils of the animals. In all of this there are calls available to attract animals, complete with a quick time event attached, and scent traps, but it is easy to forget them given their uselessness. And the same goes for the rest of the arsenal, where we also find a 44 Magnum in perfect American style, with the exception of the silent bow which allows us to eliminate a prey without making any noise and is particularly useful when two coveted animals are at close range. And this is perhaps the flagship element of a gameplay that offers little else, excluding a useful quad-bike just to speed up travel and face racing races between hunters on revs. For the rest we just have to be careful not to kill animals for which we don't have permission, otherwise we will lose our reputation in the main mode. The Seasonal Hunt, in fact, asks us to explore a wild piece of the United States in search of prey that will allow us to accumulate enough reputation to unlock the next level, a whole new area where we can find a new legendary prey, a deer from trophy and a specific breed of deer whose first slaughter is weighed and ends up scoring on the scoreboard. Graphics, sound and plastic guns The ten wild areas in which Cabela's: The Hunt - Championship Edition is divided are also populated by animals less inclined to get killed such as bears, moose, coyotes, pumas and even alligators, quite common in the swamps of Georgia. And if we find them in our way, a mini-game can start that asks us to hit a series of pistol shots while the viewfinder shoots from all sides and the enraged animal charges at us or tries to tear us apart, often succeeding. But death has no effect on the experience and the making of the minigame is anything but exceptional, which we can also say about the challenges that we can activate by talking to some characters scattered around the game areas. Among other things, these negligible activities bestow too little reputation to be attractive and can be reached directly from the main menu, with a dedicated mode which among other things is the only one to enjoy multiplayer support. And it is a lack that is felt in the face of other gaps in the game. In fact, it would have been more pleasant to deal with human users, instead of being satisfied with hearing the shots simulated by the AI over the distance followed by the appearance on the digital scoreboard of the score accumulated by the opponents. Which - as if that weren't enough - rarely hit valuable prey and this, combined with the absence of a timer, leaves us plenty of time to roam the map in search of large prey, resettingor the challenge. Therefore exploration remains, even more free in the homonymous mode which closes an offer to say the least meager, however compromised by invisible walls scattered almost everywhere and by the lack of the jump which forces us to go around every rock. And it's a shame: some animals are animated quite well, the deer enjoy enough care to arouse the right compassion and the choice of colors is spot on, so much so that an obviously limited engine can give us some suggestive glimpses. For this we could even be satisfied, if the glance was always that of the lakes of Wyoming embellished with tons of reflections in real time. But this is not the case: behind every suggestive landscape there are tons of low resolution textures, completely bare areas of the map, extreme pop-ups and even slowdowns, children of a technical sector which, unable to reach 720p in portable mode, cannot it certainly lives up to the Switch. And if we add to this an audio department good only for the valid environmental samplings, we can only raise our hands in front of a title that stands out only for the choice of colors and for the use of the Joy-Con to aim at the Duck Hunt, an element that adds something to the experience thanks to the precision of the controls and hitboxes, but only makes sense with the additional controller: a shotgun included in the physical bundle that further raises an already high price for a title that loses substance compared to the previous ones , enamel and longevity.", "date": "2018-12-19", "grade": "S.V."}
