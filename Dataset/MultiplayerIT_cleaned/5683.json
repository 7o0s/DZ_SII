In most cases, these are structurally unchanged re-propositions of well-known games, perhaps enriched by some graphic adaptations and with the obvious adaptation of the controls to the new reality, therefore the value of the title remains more or less unchanged in absolute terms, obviously making the accounts with the different eras and expectations of the public. In general, the games that succeed best in this operation are the graphic adventures, whose value remains practically unchanged and which even manage to benefit (more unique than rare case) from the adaptation of the controls to the touch screen. More rarely it happens that the recovery results in a perfect relocation of an old game in the typical fruition system of mobile platforms, a result that emerges from an optimal choice of the starting title and from a deeper adaptation work than a simple dusting of the graphics : Tennis Champs Returns is part of this small group of games, and it's really a pleasure to rediscover it now. The original game dates back to the later era of the famous Amiga, released in 1995 but already characterized by a playability that rightfully placed it among the cult titles of the Commodore home computer. The mobile transposition was perhaps facilitated by the elementary and cartoony graphic characterization that was already present originally, enriched in the new version by three-dimensional grafts for the representation of the field and obviously by an increase in resolution but still rigorously pixelated and stylized, while a great was made by Uprising Games to adapt the control system to the touch screen, making Tennis Champs Returns a perfectly enjoyable game on mobile platforms. Tennis Champs Returns: from the Amiga era with fury, a tennis that fits perfectly on mobile platforms Arcade tennis It all starts with the creation of your own player, and the entire gaming experience is built around this character. The main mode is the Career, also because only single player is currently planned, even if the developers have reported that they are considering the implementation of online multiplayer. In any case, even dealing with Career alone represents a considerable commitment, considering the amount of events and matches to which we are subjected. In a rather realistic way, our player will have to follow a very precise calendar, choosing which tournaments to participate in and taking part in special daily challenges. Each match allows us to earn experience points to spend on the evolution of the character in its various stats and coins to pay for access to tournaments and which represent the element linked to microtransactions: without coins it is in fact not possible to access the various events if it remains in the free-to-play regime, therefore the solution is the usual grinding for the collection of money or the simple in-app purchase of the VIP package which for the modest expense of 99 cents essentially unlocks the game, freeing it from advertising and the need to manage coins, a frankly recommended solution, also considering the value of this title. Even off the playing field Tennis Champs Returns proves to be a rather deep game, with its almost role-playing management of the main tennis player and the various aspects to take care of, but it is obviously with the racket in hand that the magic is triggered. The control system is designed to be intuitive enough to remain in the arcade environment but also reveals itself to be very deep and multifaceted: there is a ~virtual analog stick~ on the left that moves the player and allows you to direct the ball when shooting and two keys used for normal and strong strokes, in turn with the possibility of applying modifiers given by the upward or downward movement of the finger, which determine effects such as topspin and slice. Pressing and releasing the keys also requires precise timing illustrated by two converging bars that appear above the character, determining the effectiveness of the stroke and applying an additional tactical layer to the gameplay. Described in this way it may seem like a cumbersome system and it cannot be denied that it requires a certain period of practice on the excellent tutorial present, however it is also extraordinarily intuitive and fun, capable of giving great satisfaction once it is assimilated to the fullest. also because the challenge rate always proves to be quite high thanksThose. to the remarkable artificial intelligence of opponents.", "date": "2016-02-27", "grade": "8.8"}
