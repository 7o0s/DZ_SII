{"name": "Dragooneer's Aria - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragooneers-aria-recensione.html", "text": "After the certainly not exciting debut on PSP with Blade Dancer, Hitmaker didn't lose heart and almost quickly started working on this new JRPG entirely focused on one of the most loved magical creatures by the public, dragons. The plot is as simple as you can imagine in a fantasy video game and to be honest it holds few major surprises along the way. The Dragoons are figures used to supervise the order of things by protecting the various dragons alive in the universe in which the story is set, with the custody of the Orb, the very heart of the creatures (if the monster is killed but the Orb remains intact then he can be reborn). These individuals also watch over a seal that prevents an evil dragon named Nidhogg from awakening and wreaking havoc on the world. Among the Dragoons, a young noble named Valen stands out in particular, who is the protagonist of the game. When the aforementioned little Nidhogg reappears by taking possession of the morally weakest and evil-minded ~guardians~, transforming them into Dragoneers, that is beings ~used~ to hunt and exterminate dragons scattered around the world, it will be the young man with the help of some companions to take matters into their own hands and start a long journey to discover and protect the remaining creatures. The war of dragons Dragooneer's Aria has a structure similar to all those of role-playing games: its gameplay winds through various locations to explore with your party, whether they are cities (three in total) or other more dangerous places, connected to each other others both naturally and through the presence of some teleporters, characters to interact with to collect info or assignments for the sub-quests, shops to visit to buy everything necessary for the missions, monsters, many, to be killed to make your way into the adventure and collect points. The group of heroes to be controlled is made up of four elements, but only one, as per the old role-playing tradition, will be visible on the map. However, it is possible to choose which of them to ~guide~ in the exploratory phases. This option does not have a purely aesthetic function: each character has his own particular ability, which can be activated at the cost of one hundred mana at each phase, useful in certain areas rather than in others. For example, Valen has his ~dowry~ in running, Mary in the ability to fill the explored areas with traps to block the movements of the enemies for a certain amount of time. And again Ruslan can teleport opponents to other random points in the area, while Euphe can heal injured comrades. These skills can also be leveled up by improving every aspect of them with constant use. Lusce and Orb Each character can equip one weapon plus three protective items. These Items require a certain level to be worn properly and exploited, and can have a maximum of two slots to be customized with the help of the Lusce. What are? Spheres very similar conceptually to the materials of FFVII and which contain various skills or attack or support spells (Resurrection, Purify, Fire Impact, etc). Their level increases at or near the same rate as the use made of them and the experience points of the character who uses them. Furthermore, every ten Level-Ups they grow in rank, up to nine: in this way, whenever you want to use the relative skill in battle, you can choose its power level, also in relation to the mana available (every time you you cast a spell, Magical Shot, for example, there is a certain consumption of this ~energy~). One of the most interesting features of the Lusce is that it allows the gamer to remove them from one character and pass them on to another, without losing the levels and grades achieved up to that moment. Different speech, however, for the Orbs. In this case it is the Pg who exploits its capabilities to increase strength using its technique. These are called Dragon Skills, and they are the only element of the game that is really effective in a battle. Because unfortunately, on balance, physical attacks are of little use in terms of damage inflicted on enemies. They are mostly useful for accumulating mana, since a certain amount of mana is rewarded for each successful hit. And the mana as mentioned above is very useful for spells and also for the execution of the same techniques present in the Orbs. Each of them contains two, one with which to hit all opponents and the other for a single objective, and they develop like the Lusce but without the degrees. When used in a particular order they can generate extra attacks, resulting in devastating combos. Battle system Battles are turn-based, but enemies are visible on screen first. Usuallythey roam randomly around the area and are characterized by the presence of the color red, in the names, for the more aggressive ones, and in blue for those who will not attack you unless provoked (as in FFXII). Once seen by an enemy or come into contact with him, the battle begins. The game therefore provides for the movement of the action to a battle screen where, after a relative skit, hostilities can begin. Party members do not appear on the ground simultaneously, but one at a time: it is therefore up to the gamer to decide the order in which they will have to ~appear~ and attack or perform actions. Then in relation to parameters such as agility, it will be possible to act first or suffer the move of the opponents. In the event of an initial enemy attack, Dragoneer's Aria provides a strange defense Guard command, whose operation is very reminiscent of the ~circle~ system used in Shadow Hearts: in practice, shortly after the adverse action it will be possible to quickly put the own Pg. At that point, a disk will appear made up of tiles of the same color, except for a few, usually blue. As in ~the wheel of fortune~ a luminous cursor will begin to rotate, and the user's aim will be to press the X key at the right moment, i.e. above the blue spaces. In relation to the percentage of success of the operation, the member of the party in question can take half damage or even zero. Interesting, even if not original. It's just a pity that everything happens so slowly that even the calmest ones get nervous. The title Hitmaker, in fact, perhaps due to an incorrect programming in the management of the polygonal models, provides for a continuous loading from the UMD, and this, combined with the fact that even the enemies are shown one at a time on the screen when hit, makes the long and boring experience. Graphics and sound The best solution appears immediately therefore to face, when possible, one enemy at a time. Growing in level is not complicated, and in a short time for each area explored you can become as strong as and more than the creatures present, apart from the Boss, usually among the most difficult ever seen in the history of RPGs. Graphically the game is one of those that could be defined without infamy and without praise. The characters are made discreetly with a good number of polygons, and also the surrounding elements, such as effects of spells or scenarios, ranging from the classic orc-infested forests to volcanoes, glaciers, deserts and so on and so forth, not I'm too bad, if we exclude some ~ballerina~ texture problems. All in 3D. The sound, on the other hand, leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. The audio, which boasts a fairly well-made dubbing but whose phrases often do not correspond to what is located in the subtitles, has effects that are certainly not up to par with other productions of the genre and a soundtrack that seems excessive to define as such: on balance the music is almost always absent Another annoying thing, especially in such a difficult title to play, is the impossibility of skipping the cut-scenes. Often, in fact, after long films you will have to face rather difficult battles, and considering that at least nine times out of ten you will initially end up being swept away and forced, after Game Over, to restart the session, here is that having to put up with the The above interlude can cause severe hysterics. Comment Difficult, at times frustrating, not very engaging. This is in broad terms Dragoneer's Aria, a title that could certainly have been discreet (but not a masterpiece, mind you) if only the developers had concentrated more at least on the plot and on the level of general difficulty, balancing in particular the number and the power of the bosses, too often not to be faced except after hours and hours of boring fights for the level-up of the characters. Ultimately a game recommended only to the most fanatical and somewhat masochistic fans of the genre. Pros: Nice setting. Some interesting gameplay cues. Cons: Difficult and slow fights. Uninvolving plot. Poorly balanced level-up system.", "date": "2008-03-19", "grade": null}
