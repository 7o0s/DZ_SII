{"name": "Kill It With Fire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kill-it-with-fire-recensione.html", "text": "Our review of Kill It With Fire is based on the mobile edition of the original action game developed by Casey Donnellan, which involves us in a real arachnid hunt in different scenarios. The game, which made its debut on PC in August 2020, winning the favor of many users, has also just landed on consoles, smartphones and tablets. The one available on the App Store and Google Play is a demoware version that allows you to try the first three levels of the campaign for free, and then decide whether or not to invest the 5.49 euros needed to unlock the full game. Small note: this sum, strangely, does not include the elimination of advertising, which costs another 2.29 euros. Gameplay Kill It With Fire, the fearsome hairspray transformed into a flamethrower. There are no tutorials in the early stages of Kill It With Fire, but in fact the formula developed by the developers is so simple and straightforward that it doesn't need much introduction. Using a first-person view, our task in the game will be to explore different locations in search of spiders to track down and kill by any means ... literally. We will start by holding a simple notebook with which to possibly crush the little eight-legged creatures, to then gradually unlock even rather sophisticated and crazy tools: lacquer cans modified to become real flamethrowers, frying pans, lawnmowers, flashbangs and even guns of various kinds, for a total of twenty-four different weapons. Kill It With Fire, one of the first levels is an apartment - where are the spiders hiding? On the gameplay front, the experience immediately reveals its basic mechanics, which consist of observing the settings, moving objects, rotating them, throwing them if necessary (anything we hold can be used to kill a spider), accessing to extra zones and finally score the number of kills necessary to exit the level. The campaign is not very long and by facing it head-on it is possible to complete it rather quickly, but that is not the purpose of Kill It With Fire, which spurs us to discover hidden secrets and therefore to spend more time exploring. The game obviously feeds on our (possible) broken reactions when a huge arachnid jumps on us after being discovered, or when crushing one causes swarms of small spiders to come out. This is why the streamers have gone to the wedding, after all. Technical realization Unfortunately, the mobile version of Kill It With Fire has a big technical problem, namely the touch controls, which are quite cumbersome. The virtual sticks reposition themselves on touch, fortunately, but the layout of the buttons makes it really difficult to perform normal actions and in the options it is not possible to move or resize them. Furthermore, the Bluetooth controller is currently only partially supported: with the Xbox pad, for example, the right stick is not detected. It's a pity, because in this way a real barrier is added to the enjoyment of the game. he experience, which despite its simplicity (also technical, see the stylized but well done graphics, although sometimes it slows down a bit on the iPad Pro) boasts several interesting ideas and can certainly entertain us for a few hours in a different way than usual. Unless you're really terrified of spiders...", "date": "2021-03-18", "grade": "7.0"}
