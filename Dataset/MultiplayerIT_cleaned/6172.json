Even the mobile world cannot escape this rampant flashback, and so here we are talking about Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle, a title for iOS and Android that retraces the most important strands of comics through the eyes of a special team of heroes who obviously he must defeat anyone who stands in front of him, becoming stronger and stronger, fight after fight. Dragon Ball also arrives on our phones: what will be its level of fun? Collect them all Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle is a game made up of many faces: in part it is a title in which you have to collect and unlock new cards and characters to create the perfect team (which can also contain very different characters, such as Frieza, Yamcha or Vegeta), is part puzzle game and part board game. All of this is obviously accompanied by fights and special moves that will excite fans of the series. The reason why our group can be made up of good and bad characters is obviously related to the Dragon Balls. A mysterious character has in fact used them to mess up space-time and practically reset what has happened to date, so it is perfectly normal that evil fighters capable of destroying a planet fight side by side with Goku's wife or the protagonists of the first stories. To set up our team we will be able to rely on more or less rare characters, who we will be able to unlock using some stones that are obtained by completing the missions of the main story or by purchasing them with real money. Fortunately, it is good to point out immediately that, even if the game allows us to spend money, it will never stand there with the hat in hand like a beggar and will allow us to enjoy the experience without ever opening the wallet. In fact, by completing the missions we will be perfectly able to fish more or less rare characters without any problem. Another way to get particularly powerful heroes and complete some more difficult quests, possibly in all three available difficulty levels. These special missions are events with an expiration date, for example we will have three days to complete the one dedicated to Goku and obtain his Super Saiyan 3 version, which are cyclically re-proposed by the developers. Each character is based on a main characteristic, chosen from agility, strength, wit, intelligence and so on. It is therefore important to create a team that can take advantage of each feature, but trying to make those who may have a bond of both characteristics and history fight together (for example: Goku and Krillin) to increase their attack potential. The Saiyan Goose game Once a team worthy of the name has been set up, there is nothing left to do but start a mission. At this point we will be faced with a sort of game of the goose in which the roll of the dice will place us from time to time in boxes with various effects. Sometimes our character's Ki will be boosted (which will therefore be able to launch the most powerful attacks faster), other times we will find useful objects to train him, or we will have to fight with the various minions of the final boss who awaits us at the end of the path. The clashes take place in a very simple but quite fun way, following the logic of a puzzle game. Each round we will see our character and that of the opponent on the screen, united by five rows of colored spheres of various colors. The aim is to choose the row in which the largest number of spheres of the same color are found, the more spheres we are able to use, perhaps corresponding to the fundamental characteristic of our wrestler, the stronger the blow will be and the more Ki we will be able to accumulate. Once used, the spheres will disappear, replaced by others at random, while the remaining ones will descend towards us. It will therefore be important not only to maximize the result each time but to use the spheres which, once they have disappeared, will allow us to make the most of the remaining ones, hoping that there are also many wild spheres, which can be used with any color. Once all the moves have been made, it's time to visualize the result, which will correspond to more or less powerful moves by us or by the opponent. If we manage to defeat him we will be gratified to see his face slamming against the glass of the phone, complete with a ~cracked glass~ effect. The surrender of the clashes is particularly gratifying, especially when we manage to unleash theand more powerful moves and makes the simple gesture of clicking on a small colored sphere much more interesting. The truth is that when it happens to get a perfect row, it's not so much because the enemy will take a lot of damage, but because of the exhilaration of seeing a perfectly executed Kamehameha or Big Bang Attack. To make things easier, it is also possible to use some objects that allow you to refill the energy bar, buff our characters or weaken the opponents, decreasing their defense characteristics. Once the fight is over, there is nothing left to do but collect the well-deserved loot of coins, experience points and, at the end of the quest, cards and any special objects. Each mission can be tackled on three difficulty levels that are progressively unlocked and which obviously allow access to better rewards. Unfortunately it should be noted that, in order to face the most demanding challenges, we will be forced every now and then to submit to the strict rules of grinding, trying to repeat the simplest fights over and over again, so as to level up and be able to reach the tougher fights. Back at the base we will be able to choose whether to use the dragon stones obtained to try to obtain even stronger characters or use the objects unlocked in the missions to train them and make them even more powerful, a bit like Pokmon.", "date": "2015-07-24", "grade": "8.0"}
