{"name": "Serious Sam 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/serious-sam-4-recensione.html", "text": "It took almost ten years to get the review of Serious Sam 4, the latest chapter in the famous First Person Shooter saga starring Sam Stone. In reality, the works had begun shortly after the release of BFE, in 2013, but they took another turn so as to give life to The Talos Principle, an acclaimed first-person puzzle along the lines of Portal. Croteam then focused on virtual reality, and only in the last two years the energies have been channeled for this new episode. Announced at E3 2018 and scheduled for last year, it's finally ready to be played on PC and Stadia; the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions will only be available early next year. Serious Sam is back Serious Sam 4 is the prequel of the prequel, that is, it tells the phases prior to BFE, which in turn retraced the moments prior to First Encounter. However, the timing of the events is relative, both because Sam, in this episode, seems more mature, and above all because the villain of the moment is as always Mental with all his endless extraterrestrial army. Even if it won't go down in history for its originality, the plot is really pleasant thanks to the heavy irony and the low-level jokes that are the trademark of the series. Sam, in splendid shape thanks also to the new sunglasses, is the protagonist of irresistible curtains, such as the one, which has already become a cult, of the Roman ~Grandma~ who shows him the way to the Popemobile 2.0. With the charismatic streak of the protagonist exploited like never before, the story unexpectedly represents one of the strong points of the game. To defeat Mental's armies, our hero will have to visit Rome, the excavations of Pompeii, the town of Carcassonne (it could not be otherwise, with that name) and Tunguska, the scene of the final battle. The design of the maps is one of the aspects that has undergone the most profound reworking: these are even more extensive levels than the past ones, and each of them contains crossroads that often lead to side missions. They are activities that do not vary the game schemes by an iota, but which add a further level of challenge and, in addition to representing an added value for longevity, they reward the player with delicious gadgets that will be fundamental in the continuation of the adventure, especially for more advanced difficulty levels. The reconstruction of the cities is rather arbitrary: while not lacking in distinctive elements (such as Vesuvius in the background of Pompeii or the Colosseum in the capital), we are far from the spectacular location of Doom Eternal. The future imagined by the guys from Zagreb sees nature regaining a leading role, with settings where there is no shortage of trees and meadows, along the lines of what we have seen, in recent times, with Disintegration. Most of the game takes place outdoors and the maps are mostly developed horizontally. Only some elements are destructible, while most of the scenery is ~impervious~ to the effect of weapons, with effects that are not always pleasant, such as when a cannonball bounces off a wooden box. Gunplay The combat system has always been one of Serious Sam's trademarks and over the years it has been subject to continuous refinements, without ever undergoing radical upheavals. One of the most important features introduced by the fourth episode is the Legion System, i.e. the ability of the graphics engine to reproduce literally hundreds of aliens on the screen at the same time; an even greater amount than the already impressive one of the previous chapters, so much so that more than once it seemed to us that we were playing one of the battles of Total War in the first person. With such a number of enemies, it goes without saying that the shootings, in addition to being frenetic and adrenaline-pumping as always, do not leave a moment of respite. In this regard, the same setting introduced with BFE has been maintained, i.e. the impossibility of sprinting and shooting at the same time: this forces you to move continuously, in search of the always scarce ammunition and the very precious medkits, given that health does not regenerate automatically . This is true for at least two thirds of the single player campaign, i.e. when you have not yet earned the skill points needed to unlock the use of weapons while running. Another of the innovations introduced by Serious Sam 4 is in fact a tree of ~perks~ which introduce significant variations, especially in the more advanced branches (for example when you can wield two heavy weapons at the same time), in the way of facing battles. Weapons and enemies are what we all learned at cKnown since the first Serious Sam, with secondary additions: we will find a total of fourteen means of offense, including the inevitable sawn-off shotgun, the portable cannon, the rocket launcher. The feedback is excellent and the risk of always using the same weapon is averted by the loot that requires you to range between the whole arsenal. Both slide (although some aliens can be fatally stabbed) and hand grenades are missing; on the other hand there are gadgets such as the unforgettable portable black hole, or the mini-atomic bomb, which however are very limited. Among the ranks of the bad guys there are, as always, the scorpions (red and yellow) with double machine guns, the gigantic minotaurs, the annoying skeletal rhinos and the ever-present headless suicide bombers. In total we have counted more than thirty, to which are added the end-of-level bosses, real mastodons that require certain attack strategies to be knocked out. Technical compartment Technically Croteam's game is presented in chiaroscuro; the Serious Engine, quite demanding, in some situations is afflicted by technical bugs, detailed in the dedicated box. The artistic direction is consistent with the bestiary that populates Sam's universe, but, as initially written, we would have expected greater attention to the overall quality: in some initial glimpses the recycling of the assets of Talos Principle is evident and there are not many moments when the theater of battle makes the jaw drop. The most spectacular scenes are given by the endless enemy hordes that blow up to the sound of cannon fire, grenades and various shots, in a riot of truly flashy explosions; the work on the animations of the monsters is also appreciable, especially evident in the comparison with the previous title. On the other hand, some Achilles' heels that are now characteristic of the saga remain, such as the ~skybox~ (i.e. the sky) which is still a two-dimensional ~wallpaper~, or the false quality of the cut-scenes, where the expressiveness of the characters and the quality of the textures are borderline acceptable. Overall, there is a lack of finishing work which can be easily remedied with future patches but which, in our case, did not affect the overall experience. The soundtrack is instead absolutely amazing: you will want to shell out the 10 euros more necessary for the Deluxe edition, where it is present in digital format. The sound effects are also excellent as always, with the inevitable screams of the kamikazes (so annoying that they will remain in your ears even after turning off the PC) and the clattering of rhinos. And what about the dubbing? The backbone is obviously the voice of John J. Dick, Sam's historic voice actor, but all the secondary characters are also convincing. Performance The requirements of Serious Sam 4 have also fueled a heated debate on our pages: the recommended system speaks of an 8-core processor and a GeForce RTX 2060 or, alternatively, an AMD Radeon RX 5700. While AMD users have this configuration has been available since the release of the first Ryzen 7 (March 2017), those who prefer Intel platforms must rely at least on the Comet Lake Refresh architecture, released at the end of 2018, an aspect that drastically reduces the fleet indicated as ideal by Croteam . Similar speech also for GPUs, both available for just over a year. Our reference system far exceeded the stakes set by the developers: unfortunately, due to known availability problems, we did not have the opportunity to test it with the new GeForce RTX 3080 (subject of a future study), but the 2080 still represents one of the proposals best performance that the market can offer at the moment. The Serious Engine is, as usual, extremely scalable, through a triple menu that allows you to act on the parameters assigned to the processor, graphics card and video memory. To make things easier, you can select from five presets for each voice, or let the program configure the system based on a hardware analysis. To all this must be added the support for three graphics libraries: DirectX 11, 12 and Vulkan. We conducted tests with the last two APIs, only to discard them both due to stability problems with glitches and frequent crashes. Probably an updated version of the NVIDIA drivers could solve the situation; however we have noticed that, from a visual point of view, there are no appreciable differences between the two DirectX; moreover the benchmarks that we have managed to conduct report the same frame rate regardless of the library used. Serious Sam does not have a real integrated benchmark, but gives the possibility to choose on which map it runsrehearsals, selecting a time interval. For our tests we chose chapter 8, ~Machina Ex Deus~ which starts with an invasion of the Ponte Sant'Angelo in Rome: we felt it was a good compromise between arenas full of enemies and more linear passages where there are fewer elements in movement. Single player The single player campaign is divided into sixteen missions. The game scheme is always the same: you start from point A, you arrive at a large clearing where the enemy horde begins, usually divided into several waves, at the end of each of which there is a few moments of respite to collect weapons and medicines, and continue in this way for another two or three areas until point B is reached. There are some nice variations on the theme that will see us driving a gigantic mech, or aboard other vehicles such as a motorcycle or a combine harvester(!). The size of the maps is really generous, a pity that you often run from one arena to another without dwelling too much on the ~outline~ which is only partially enhanced by the presence of secrets that are almost impossible to find. The degree of challenge becomes reasonable from the third of the five difficulty levels (even if some passages seemed too unbalanced to us), with the first two which we strongly advise against, due to the excessive weakness of the enemies. It takes about twenty hours to get to the end credits; at the end of each level a score is assigned which takes into account the degree of difficulty, the time taken and the number of bailouts used and secrets discovered. The replayability factor is (at the moment) mainly linked to this aspect, taking into account that to beat Mental at the ~Serious~ level you need an excellent skill. Multiplayer At the moment the multiplayer sector is limited to a cooperative with up to four players, although deathmatch support is planned in the future. We got to try it with a colleague from another magazine and we weren't impressed. Primarily because the same single player maps are retraced, which in some points are not very suitable for co-op; moreover, the number of enemies does not increase (perhaps their health level only slightly) and overall the challenge rate is significantly reduced. The penalties for death are laughable and we have not seen rankings of by number of kills.", "date": "2020-09-24", "grade": "7.8"}
