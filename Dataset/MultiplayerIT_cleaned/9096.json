With their strengths and weaknesses, the first three chapters of Mortal Kombat have made the history of fighting games and video games. If you are reading these lines it is very probable that we are dealing with you, old fans of the ultra violent Midway beat'em up, and we will illustrate to you at the end the reasons why you should blindly buy this collection that includes the perfect transposition from Arcade of the first two chapters, plus the revised and improved ~Ultimate~ version of the third chapter. We advise all the others to continue reading because they could still discover a pleasant retrogaming that has so much to teach young talents and lovers of the genre. A bit of history: Mortal Kombat is the first game to create high-level digitized graphics without sacrificing gameplay with slowdowns or dancing frames. The animations were at the time perfectly fluid and tied together, creating an absolutely satisfying suspension of disbelief for the time. Today the effect is no longer the same, of course, but the technique of filming real actors and feeding them to the graphics engine in the form of bitmaps fascinates the human eye even today. Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection was created by Other Ocean, already authors of the Castlevania conversion: Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live and the excellent Dark Void Zero on DSiWare, with the help of NetherRealm Studios, authors of the last chapter on next-gen consoles. The control system of Mortal Kombat differed greatly from that of the historic rival Street Fighter: in fact, a key specifically designed to block and parry was inserted, unlike the Capcom title in which it was used to press ~back~ on the directional cross (with the consequence that it was impossible to move your character backwards during an opponent's attack). This innovation brought a new awareness in the use of parries that became increasingly important for gameplay: it was in fact much more difficult to corner an opponent and fill him with combos, also thanks to the fact that in Mortal Kombat there is no ~stun ~, the stars to be clear. The main aspect for which the series will always be remembered, however, is certainly the extreme violence with which the fights are represented. Combined with the fact that the graphics were reproduced in a realistic way, it represented a real shock at the time, and still today it is one of the pulpiest and bloodiest games ever to appear on a home screen. The famous ~final moves~ then manage to further increase the horrorific effect of the series on the collective imagination: fatality, brutality, harakiri and other special shots represent bloody and absolutely impactful ways to close the match, certainly spectacular but totally useless for the purposes of the game because performed after the match has already ended. Xbox 360 goals This Mortal Kombat Kollection is also giving away the canonical 200 points to be unlocked through the same 12 objectives. Half of the points are obtained by simply completing all three games in offline mode, the other half by performing all the various finishing moves (fatality, babality, brutality and so on). 40 points instead are intended for online play: the longest and most difficult goal is certainly the one that requires 200 online wins. Pros and cons of this collection. So leaving aside the history of the series and the various characteristics inherent in the gameplay and in the spectacular (for the time) graphics of Mortal Kombat, we now focus on the reasons that should push (or not push) an old fan to buy this package. First of all, we can safely say that these are the best three Mortal Kombat conversions ever: uncensored, complete, perfect theater adaptations exactly as Midway conceived them in the early 90s. Over the years the series has undergone a series of cuts, modifications and censorships due to the extreme cruelty of its images: finally we can play the ~real~ Mortal Kombat without having to go looking for phantom retrogaming versions more or less faithful to the original. The screen is obviously cut for 4/3 as the graphics are exactly the original one. For each of the three titles in the Kollection there is an online mode that allows you to challenge up to 3 other friends via Xbox Live (or PSN) by recreating that wonderdares original 90s bar atmosphere where as a group we faced each other one at a time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ~switch~ from one Mortal Kombat to another but it is necessary to leave the room, change the game and recreate one every time you want to change the title. Even the online statistics, unfortunately, are disconnected from each other and there is no ~universal~ that encompasses all three games. It might seem unconventional to play - today - the classic Mortal Kombat, but for all those who want to delve into the birth of this genre, or for all those who are extreme fans, we strongly recommend the download and the experience, with all the strengths and weaknesses of the original Mortal Kombat from nearly 20 years ago. The experience is in fact faithfully reproduced: it is not a remake and therefore the series retains all its original characteristics, with strengths and weaknesses including the often ~suspicious~ AI and the dancing collisions.", "date": "2011-09-12", "grade": "7.5"}
