{"name": "Paperinik", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paperinik.html", "text": "It is frankly undeniable that Disney has accustomed us, with its Mobile division, to mobile video games of particularly high average quality. In fact, the US giant has well understood the potential of wireless gaming, and above all has kept in mind the fact from the outset that a Disney-branded product must be able to return the typical traits that have always been part of the company that is now synonymous of comics and immortal characters. And so, relying once again on the talented Living Mobile team, the house founded by the brilliant Walt this time brings Paperinik to the screens, the heroic ~superhero~ version of the legendary Donald Duck. The game in question is nothing more than an old-school platformer, decidedly classic both in mechanics and in the plot; the masked protagonist must in fact protect Duckburg from the evil intentions of the Banda Bassotti, putting an end to their programs of thefts and thefts. The plot is told in a more than pleasant way through real tables, which give the impression of actually being intent on reading a normal comic. On the contrary, the short sequences between the levels are only the preamble to the real action which, as already mentioned, takes place on the basis of the two-dimensional platformers of the past. The task is basically to cross the levels from left to right by collecting the scattered coins, eliminating enemies by jumping on them or with the gun provided, and solving very simple puzzles. There is also some more challenging fights against some bosses from time to time. Therefore, having to analyze only the playful component, Paperinik can be described as a well-packaged title, very little courageous or original, but undoubtedly capable of being appreciated thanks to a well-studied level of difficulty and a reactive and quite precise control system also through numeric keypad. However, what allows Disney production to make the leap in quality is undoubtedly the technical component, especially the graphic one, which underlines the progress that mobile video games are making in recent months. The detail and quality of the settings is in fact very good, and the comic strip (obviously) brings this video game very close to the original on paper from which it is based. But it is above all the animations that stand out, especially as regards the protagonist: numerous, well-designed and perfectly connected to each other, they make even just watching this Paperinik a little joy. Too bad therefore only for the longevity, a real Achilles heel which, with only 14 levels, allows you to reach the end of the adventure in a handful of hours.
