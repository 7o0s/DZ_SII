{"name": "KeyWe: la recensione di un gioco cooperativo allegro e leggero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/keywe-recensione.html", "text": "A couple of birds, a remote New Zealand post station and a lot of joy: these are the fundamental ingredients of KeyWe, a two-player cooperative game that challenges us to become the best postmen with wings ever. Let's see in our review of KeyWe if this adventure will be able to convince all palates. KeyWe kiwis KeyWe kiwis can be customized We are a kiwi, the bird symbol of New Zealand. We are a small and weak being, but - together with our friend - we want to become a great postman. A station is looking for new employees, of any size and species, at that very moment. All in all, our work is simple, if it weren't for the fact that the workstation is designed for humans and even just moving a package requires a lot of effort. However, all this will not stop us. The somewhat absurd but cheerful narrative premise is just an excuse by which KeyWe (get the pun?) creates a series of postal-themed levels that mix puzzle and platforming lightly. KeyWe will ask us to carry out various tasks within a series of timed levels divided by season. We talk about tasks like typing messages by hopping across the keys of a large keyboard divided into chunks, composing letters by pasting slips of paper with chunks of words written on them, packing various merchandise with the right labels, and sorting incoming and outgoing mail. These are simple tasks, just asking you to hop around a screen-sized level, with a handful of moving elements every now and then. These mission archetypes repeat over and over again, but the team varied the pace of the game as much as possible by inserting various disturbing elements, such as quicksand that causes us to sink, vines that press keys for us and capture us, or even huge insects that move the objects we need. From stage to stage there is always something new that will make it a little different (and more complex, but never too much) to complete the levels with the maximum score. Added to all this is a series of additional mini-games, such as a musical game in which you have to switch from one instrument to another while remaining in time with the instructions on the screen. Our aim is to stay within certain times and thus obtain stamps, a currency that allows us to purchase cosmetic items to personalize our kiwi. Co-op or single player? Levels add elements like water to give us a hard time KeyWe is a game designed for co-op and doesn't work without it. We specify, technically it is possible to play in single player, but it does not make particular sense. First of all, the game keeps the two characters, so you find yourself controlling both kiwis in turn. It is an addition that we suppose has been inserted to allow the most solitary to try the title, but clearly the experience is not designed for the single player. In reality, it matters little, because the real reason why you should consider buying KeyWe is the desire to play something light with a child or someone who is not very familiar with video games. KeyWe is extremely accessible and perfect for anyone. Also for this reason, don't expect complex mechanics and don't think you are dealing with a game that makes the cooperative the fulcrum of the gameplay mechanics. More than a ~cooperative game~, in fact, we should speak of a ~game that is played in two~: a significant difference. Let's explain: if we think of games like It Takes Two or Operation Tango, the actions of one player often have to go hand in hand with those of the other, to execute coordinated moves. In KeyWe each user can play for himself, carrying out a part of the tasks or even all of them if he wants. The second player serves to get to the end of the level as quickly as possible and get the maximum score. Only one or two actions really need to be done in coordination, but that's a very limited thing. This makes the game accessible, as mentioned, but also not particularly intriguing for a couple of seasoned players looking for a bit of challenge and variety. Graphics, sound and Italian language KeyWe offers a handful of level archetypes KeyWe offers a very simple and colorful graphic style, not technically advanced but in line with the requests of the reference public. The levels are visually varied and pleasing thanks to modifiers such as sand, animals and water, which will change the environment from stage to stage. Don't expect anything unique or memorable, however. Even the sound makes its own, with appropriate music and effects, which still leave no mark. A final note on language. KeyWe starts automatically in English, but in reality it also offers Italian. While it is true that you don't need a great knowledge of the Albion idiom to advance in the game (a few tutorials and two lines of introduction to the ~plot~ is all you will find), the transition to Italian lightens the experience and could be fundamental for The smallest. The problem is that one of the level archetypes asks you to transcribe sentences using a typewriter. In a stage one of the sentences includes an apostrophe, a symbol that is never used in the English version of the game: the developers have not inserted a key to write the apostrophe, so it is impossible to complete this level in Italian. We don't know how often this happens (we played in English before realizing that we could switch languages and after encountering the problem we switched back to English, just to be safe). Just know that you may be forced to revert to the Albion language from time to time, unless a corrective patch arrives.", "date": "2021-09-07", "grade": "7.0"}
