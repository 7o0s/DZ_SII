From what was still that raw agglomeration of temporary assets called Escape from Anathema Mines, the game has grown in form and substance, evolving first into a tepid experiment with an isometric view in the style of Fallout and X-Com, and subsequently into one that, according to the developer, it's the anxiety-inducing experience he wanted to get from the beginning. Although a lot of things have changed in the space of almost a decade, in Dynamite Jack the combination of light and dark has always remained a key element, but those who have followed its development were beginning to wonder if the transition to touchscreen devices would have been all anything but painless. We finally have an answer. A lost bomber Bringing us closer to the classic topdown action of the AmigaOS era, Dynamite Jack puts the player in the role of a fugitive space marine, whose goal is to escape from the mines of Anathema without being discovered and without leaving our pens. The absence of firearms encourages a more stealth approach, as the only devices that can be collected in each level are a flashlight and a detonator capable of blowing up bombs. Both objects soon prove to be double-edged swords. First of all, the torch, which if on the one hand is essential for orienting yourself in the numerous dark corridors, on the other hand risks attracting the attention of nearby enemies; to make matters worse, later in the adventure the player finds himself facing dangerous monsters that attack in the dark and flee in the presence of light, making it even more difficult to decide when is the most appropriate moment to use the flashlight. Here the weight of light and shadow on the game mechanics is evident, although the difficulty of the experience is smoothed by the fact that, unlike the original prototype, now the device's batteries do not run down over time and the enemies are no longer alerted by the ~ click~ of the switch. The only way to take out the opponents is to find the detonator and detonate a few bombs, and although the design again comes to the aid of the player by allowing him to use an infinite number of bombs, this time too a bit of strategy and attention is required again : An explosion can draw nearby enemies, momentarily pushing them away from a passage they were guarding or drawing them next to another previously planted bomb. Yet the detonator can also be useful in the exploratory phase, since the explosions, as in Bomberman, can eliminate part of the scenario, creating new passages and allowing access to otherwise inaccessible rooms. As you progress through the 28 levels that make up the main campaign, the complexity of the levels and the danger of the enemies increases, but Dynamite Jack never manages to offer a really high challenge due to two main elements. The AI of the enemies, to begin with, always remains on very predictable levels, following a fixed path and moving away for a few moments when something attracts attention. It is never difficult to guess what to do to get the better of it, but to make things even simpler is added the presence of numerous checkpoints within the environments, which, in addition to saving the player's position, represent a small refuge in which you are practically invisible to your opponents. On the one hand it is a clear compromise to prevent the protagonist from being eliminated immediately after an inconvenient respawn, but on the other it makes the solution of some passages almost trivial. The presence of collectibles and timed challenges aims to entice you to replay the old levels, but it is hoped that the community will be able to use the full-bodied integrated editor to create much more interesting missions than the original ones. Created maps can be shared online, but Phil Hassey has already confirmed that the best ones will be integrated into the campaign through future updates.", "date": "2012-07-11", "grade": "7.8"}
