They had just finished playing Dimps' mediocre Dragon Ball Xenoverse, tired of simplistic fighting games based on the exchange of energy waves and the like, and we knew Arc System Works' curriculum well, which boasts not only the very famous BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, Arcana Heart and Persona 4 Arena, but also a couple of brawlers based on the adventures of Goku released for Nintendo DS several years ago, namely Super Sonic Warriors and Super Sonic Warriors 2. Famous for his ability to use two-dimensional graphics and for the technicality that distinguishes its fighting games, Arc System Works seemed just the right developer for this mission, but there were still some doubts about the platform in question, a portable console that doesn't quite adapt very well to the frenetic gameplay and visual complexity of its games. The result is the most convincing video game incarnation of Dragon Ball Z in recent years, which perhaps could have said more... Despite some problems, Extreme Butoden is simply the best Dragon Ball Z fighting game No More Clones One of the first perplexities that arose following the development of the game, in the months that preceded its release, concerned the roster of fighters: Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butoden has twenty-four playable characters taken from all the series that make up the long saga, including the very recent Dragon Ball Super (or rather the two feature films The Battle of the Gods and The Resurrection of ~F~ which make up at least the beginning of the new TV series). Although the number of wrestlers is more than adequate - although it is far from the over fifty characters that can be selected in the Dimps games - their variety leaves a bitter taste in the mouth: the roster, in fact, proposes the same characters in multiple forms. The protagonist Goku, for example, can be selected in the normal version, Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan God and even Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. Even Vegeta is playable both in normal form and Super Saiyan, but perhaps the paradox is reached with Gohan, a character not much loved in Japan who, however, was proposed as a child, as a Super Saiyan 2 child, as a Super Saiyan adult and ~unleashed~ adult (i.e. in the super-powered ~form~ assumed during the Buu saga). At first glance, one might think that these forms are ~clones~, reskins of the same sprites and little more, but in reality the same characters share only a handful of combos or animations, while the special moves are completely different. However, the fact remains that in an attempt to economize on development (after all, between the ~unleashed~ adult Gohan and the Super Saiyan adult Gohan, the visual difference is only the color of the hair!) Arc System Works has actually set aside some characters that it would have been interesting to check, like Androids 16 and 17, Tenshinhan, Cooler or many others, preferring villains like Raditz and Nappa in their place, practically the most nerd Saiyans in the galaxy. Fortunately, the roster still features many of the fandom's most popular characters, including Future Trunks, Piccolo, Gotenks, Majin Buu, etc. Each character has been meticulously reproduced in two dimensions, employing the typical care that Arc System Works addresses to 2D graphics: the sprites are detailed and generously sized, the animations are very faithful to the animated series, the effects linked to their most famous special techniques are sufficiently spectacular. The developer has also played on the limitations imposed by the hardware, saving on some animation frames to make certain combos or some movements particularly sudden: they are deadlifts that catch the eye, but which do not annoy that much, and which probably limit the drops of frame rates that occur when the fights get too chaotic. In fact, fans of the franchise shouldn't despair: although they cannot directly control all of their heroes, they will find that practically every character invented by Toriyama (including Lunch!) exists in the game in the form of Assistant Z. Fighters and assistants Dragon Ball Z: Extreme Butoden reflects the ~casual~ approach that many developers are taking towards the fighting game genre. Instead of rosters filled with complicated combos and rotations, each character basically plays the same way: weak, strong, and energy attack combos play the same way, though the animations and ultimately how they interact change with the drinkwise, making each character more or less suited to melee combat, repelling airstrikes, and so on. Each fighter also has two special moves that consume a part of the inevitable ki gauge, as well as ~supreme~ attacks that consume almost all of it and conclude the combos, moving the fight to the sky or to the ground with one of the most famous special techniques and spectacular of the character. Although these few moves constitute the backbone of the combat system, we are still talking about a title signed by Arc System Works, and therefore full of maneuvers and mechanics that make it unexpectedly complex. Between animations that can be ~cancelled~ to continue combos, instant timed dodges, airstrikes and more, fans of series like Guilty Gear will immediately recognize the developer's touch, albeit perhaps sweetened to appeal to a wider audience. Nonetheless, Extreme Butoden is a pleasure to play. The control system - fully customizable - responds immediately to inputs and the fanservice is ensured through goodies such as chain teleporters, combo exchanges and clashes between energy waves to be won by repeatedly pressing a button. In this sense, Extreme Butoden distinguishes itself from many other Dragon Ball Z games precisely because it does not push the obsessive loading of the Ki indicator, which in any case recharges automatically with each blow suffered or inflicted: given the frenzy of the action, it is very more difficult to find a glimmer of time to stop and charge the Ki by holding down the appropriate key. Is it better to consume Ki with a special move, or save that 150% necessary to repel an ultimate technique that could cost us half our life? If this type of mechanic makes the flow of the fight much more strategic, it must still be said that the balance of the roster in a certain sense reflects the power imbalances of the cast. Goku Super Saiyan God is certainly much more powerful than Raditz, so selecting him costs much more Dragon Power, a numerical value that substantially limits the characters and Z Assistants that can be chosen. In fact, the player can select a combination of fighters and Z Assistants that respects the Dragon Power and the ~space~ granted to his team. Fighters instantly switch by tapping their portraits on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS - because, yes, there's a tag team in Extreme Butoden too! - while the Z Assistants make their own story. In fact, they actually represent the fully customizable special moves of each character. By tapping on the selected Assistant Z's portrait, that character will appear on the screen to perform an attack or bestow a bonus on the player. Yamcha will leap on the opponent with his Wolf Claw, Goten will fall from the sky on the enemy's head, Chi-Chi will shout at Goku by obscuring the screen with a huge balloon, Tapion will generate a temporary impenetrable barrier around the player, and so on. There are a hundred Z Assistants and they have different effects, and the player can use them to defend themselves or attack, perhaps by linking their blows to their own combos to prolong his assaults. It's a shame that the action inevitably slows down whenever too many Z Assistants appear on the screen, especially when their intervention is accompanied by spectacular effects that cover the entire screen, but for fans it will certainly be a small price to pay for see their favorite heroes in action. The 3D effect The three-dimensional effect is modest: it ~detaches~ the interface, creating a depth field that adds nothing to the gameplay. When fighting in the air, it emphasizes the distance between fighters and the polygonal background backdrop, but risks further degrading the frame rate when using Z-Assistants. It's not a visual novel Arc System Works' fighting games are also famous for the emphasis placed on the single player experience, often enriched by long and frantic stories narrated like a visual novel between one fight and another. Extreme Butoden in a certain sense adapts, but does not fully succeed. Everyone knows the story that it should tell by now, so the developer preferred to retrace it both through the Story Z mode and in its alternative version, the Adventure mode. The first simply offers a series of famous fights in which you have to control specific characters, summarily following the storylines of the manga and anime, starting with the arrival of the Saiyans: once all the chapters are completed, including those dedicated to the villains, you unlock Broly as a playable character. The Adventure mode, on the other hand, racconta - completely in Italian, incidentally, but using the original names of characters and techniques - a kind of gigantic ~what if~ in which parallel universes meet and collide while Goku searches for the Supreme Dragon Balls: in this case we move to a kind of map reminiscent of some Super Mario Bros. and you choose which battle to face. By satisfying certain requirements, the various Z Assistants are unlocked, but we found the requests in question a little too strict, which makes the experience quite frustrating at times, especially if you want to collect everything. Luckily, with each fight you earn zeny to spend in a virtual shop to buy various temporary and non-temporary power-ups which, in theory, should make life easier. To these two modes is also added the World Tournament, where Extreme Butoden perhaps expresses its full potential: the player faces a series of battles of increasing difficulty, and if you win all of them, Bills, the god of destruction, is unlocked as a playable character. In this mode, the artificial intelligence is very high and the opponents ring together very long and ruthless combos that you have to learn to counter using every mechanic of the game. It's just a pity that the use of particularly strong characters significantly lowers the level of challenge, especially if the Z Assistants are sacrificed for a ~dream team~ made up of the most powerful characters in the universe. Finally well, there's practically nothing else. The player can choose to fight against the ~computer~ or a human opponent, strictly locally: beyond the fact that you can't play online, Arc System Works initially forgot to implement a training mode that will be added in the future with a patch. The absence of online, however, is what really weighs on Extreme Butoden: nowadays, the competitive scene is the heart of the longevity of every fighting game, but it is very difficult for us to gather around a fire to happily beat each other to the sound of Kamehameha. We would also like this mode to be implemented with a retrospective update, but at the moment it is very unlikely, despite the fact that the developer has promised new content in the form of DLC.", "date": "2015-10-14", "grade": "8.3"}
