{"name": "Days Gone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/days-gone-recensione-pc.html", "text": "The review of Days Gone for PC represents the confirmation of how a different policy has taken hold at PlayStation, which does not see the Windows platform as an enemy and rather wants to seize the opportunity to bring the most important franchises towards a user base new, as extensive as it is passionate. An operation that began last August with Horizon Zero Dawn and is undoubtedly destined to continue, as some recent news demonstrates, in the context of the most traditional of win / win situations: a substantial increase in collections for the expensive PlayStation exclusives, but also great news for PC users. History Days Gone, the protagonist Deacon St. John holds a gun. It is a story of desperate and survivors, the one that is told to us by Days Gone, in a way that more than two years after the original publication on PS4 is still solid and convincing. A work of narrative interweaving, between flashbacks and side quests, which outlines very well the figure of the protagonist, Deacon St. John, and of a troubled and contradictory humanity two years after the events that changed the world. The spread of a mysterious virus, in fact, has transformed most people into Furiosi, creepy zombie-like creatures that move in endless hordes and attack human beings. Their sudden appearance has set cities on fire, wiping out society as we know it and giving life to a world of violence and selfishness, in which the law of the fittest applies. Days Gone, Deacon and his friend Boozer. In this scenario Deacon manages to move with relative shrewdness due to a past in the army and then in a motorcycle gang: the only choice he has never regretted, he says. Constantly riding his motorcycle, together with his close friend Boozer, the man makes ends meet by completing assignments for the settlements in the area, but a dramatic event forces him to reconsider everything. The dirt and ruthlessness of the plot of Days Gone can count on a very valid ally in the Italian dubbing of the game, which despite being spoiled by some volume level out of place betrays an ambitious cinematic soul right from the start, which we find in the excellent interpretation by Francesco Rizzi and the rest of the cast. Gameplay Days Gone, an exploratory stage way in the middle of a mass grave. The open world of Days Gone is, in the end, the real protagonist of the game. The map, clearly inspired by that of Oregon, complete with some of its most representative landscapes, constantly reserves surprises thanks to the many missions that are gradually unlocked. This, moreover, without lacking hidden areas and secrets to discover.Navigating between these locations on board Deacon's motorcycle, which at the beginning of the campaign will be stolen from him and which he will have to rebuild from scratch, buying new components to enhance it, practically reveals himself immediately a pleasant experience, arcade but with some simulative grain in the rendering of the asphalt and dirt roads, as well as in the management of the spectacular jumps. Days Gone boasts some really impressive landscapes. The need to find fuel in order not to run dry in a place full of possible pitfalls and the general shortage of ammunition somehow constitute a survival component capable of adding depth to the game, which takes its time and offers a very cadenced, in which it is impossible to be the Rambo of the situation. At least during the first few hours. From this point of view, the combat system works decidedly well, making it possible to face opponents (whether they are marauders, repugnant or furious fools) moved by an artificial intelligence, in our opinion, which respects well the roles and try to take advantage of the surroundings. It will then be up to the player to decide how to approach, whether to look for engaging melee, with edged or blunt weapons picked up around, or to use a whole range of firearms that include pistols, rifles, machine guns and explosives, such as Molotov cocktails . Days Gone, an almost infinite horde of Furiosi. The latter prove to be fundamental when it is necessary to burn the nests of the Furiosi: a practice not to be faced lightly, because from those flames the monsters will come out even more ferocious and determined to kill us. It therefore goes without saying that adequate preparation and careful management of the inventory represent unquestionable rules of survival. Multiply what happens with a nest by a hundred and you will get the chaos of the hordes. These are special missions in which it will be necessary to eliminate literally hundreds of Furiosi who move in unison, for a show ofi explosions, flames and adrenaline. It is true that after a couple of times even the Hordes become monotonous, but they are videogame moments that will remain etched in our minds for a long time. The mix of all these aspects, which also include an unlockable skill tree and the possibility of stealth movement for avoid being identified by the enemy, perhaps hooking rudimentary silencers to the guns in order to silently eliminate the bulk of the targets, creates the picture of a gameplay that also in this PC version is confirmed as solid, engaging and not too subject to the typical repetitiveness of many open games world. The PC version Days Gone, some of the characters we will interact with throughout the story. Let's get to the point: how does the PC version of the Bend Studio title run? If you have read our tried of Days Gone, you will know that the preliminary impressions were excellent and we can only confirm that judgment. On the test configuration the game totals 75 fps with 2160p resolution and all effects on ~max~, it grows to 125 fps if you decide to go down to 1440p and even to 160 fps opting for 1080p. There are no problems even during more agitated phases, with hundreds of Furiosi moving on the screen: it seems that the game is going to allocate the necessary resources at the start (always keeping the GPU on edge, it must be said) and therefore has all the necessary margin to manage any situation, without slowdowns or episodes of stuttering like the ones we encountered with Resident Evil Village. Days Gone boasts a large open world that can be explored on board a motorcycle. The merit of these performances clearly goes to the effects, inevitably the weak point of the Sony production, which uses simple cubemaps to simulate reflections on water and puddles. However, it is difficult to complain about the overall visual impact of the game, which can count on excellent polygonal models and above all on dense and evocative landscapes. The comparison with the original PS4 version is obviously merciless, while with the PS5 version the competition is relatively open. but the higher resolution and many enhanced graphics options on PC make all the difference. All things that giving the image greater sharpness, in all situations. Added to this are also the loads, which with a normal SATA SSD take just 15 seconds to take us from the startup screen to the last save. The abundance of adjustments also ensures a great degree of scalability of the experience on mid-range configurations. In fact, there is a scaler to change the effective resolution, an option to unlock frames, an adjustment for HDR, one for the field of view and the ability to increase or decrease the quality of lighting, geometry, foliage, shadows, clouds , fog and textures. You can play with mouse and keyboard, again with a whole series of customizations, or use any compatible controller. The one for Xbox gives rise, for the moment, to a small glitch linked to the symbols of the keys, a problem that does not arise using a DualSense, also supported in the movement of the touchpad to navigate between the map, inventory, missions and skills.", "date": "2021-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
