{"name": "Ace Racer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ace-racer-recensione.html", "text": "The genre of arcade driving games for mobile devices is going through a rather particular period, the result of the lack of real innovations and developers capable of crafting experiences with a strong personality. It is therefore no coincidence that Asphalt 9: Legends is still taken as a point of reference on iOS and Android. Well, NetEase has tried to have its say by bringing its latest title to the West, an immediate and spectacular racer that leverages turbo and special maneuvers, as well as a series of gacha elements, to win the attention of an audience that appears increasingly distracted. How did it go? We tell you about it in the Ace Racer review. Style and structure Ace Racer, a racing sequence Let's start immediately by saying that stylistically Ace Racer relies on aspects that today appear largely outdated, see the exaggerated sexualization of some characters and a tone that, starting from the introductory sequence, seems out of place and out of time. Who knows, maybe certain stereotypes are still strong in China? Everything is possible. Fortunately, setting this approach aside, the game shows its cards and seems to be able to count on a very rich structure, which includes a practice mode, a career that will see us face increasingly complex races within nine different scenarios, the classic Time Attack, a competitive component and even a section dedicated to Gran Turismo-style ~licenses~, with short but intense tests and multiple-choice quizzes in which, uh, we will be asked about the characteristics of the game. Inevitably, the basic system is seasoned with an enormous amount of free-to-play mechanisms, which are revealed in the thousands of rewards to be cashed every time we reach some goal, as well as in the grinding we have to deal with when a race is too much difficult and urgent an upgrade for the car which, however, can only be done if certain resources are available. of new cars and new modes, but in reality during the first few hours we didn't even realize the presence of a ticket system that regulates the fuel needed to participate in the races, since it is reset in abundance from time to time. In short, you can play for free without too many worries. Gameplay: between turbo and drifts Ace Racer, the car launched in drift At first, Ace Racer's gameplay appears largely inconsistent and insipid, but fortunately it is only an initial sensation, which fades when the challenges become more demanding and the driving system is therefore able to express its peculiarities. Definitely arcade in all its aspects, the NetEase title focuses on the use of turbo and drifts. The Career, which constitutes the fulcrum of the single player experience, alternates races in which you simply have to cross the finish line within a time limit races with checkpoints or challenges in which the goal is to collect coins along the way, so there's quite a variety. The touch controls don't involve the use of the accelerometer and with the standard layout (but there's also a simplified one) the gas is automatic, you steer using two arrows placed on the left side of the screen while on the right we find the buttons for drifting and three different types of boost. Too bad that the support for the controller in our case did not work: maybe with the next updates it will be fixed. Ace Racer, the various boosts are essential for the race The fact that the brake does not exist gives a good idea of how much the experience aims to be immediate and spectacular, and in fact the final result is a bit like a synthesis of the various arcade racing games, with an absolute emphasis on drifts, which must be performed in order to load the various power-ups, to be activated promptly as soon as they are available in an attempt to beat the time and reach the finish line before the countdown ends: a formula that is anything but original, but which in the case of Ace Racer works quite well. Clearly the many real cars that make up the fleet, to be unlocked by playing or making in-app purchases, and which in the same way must be upgraded, do not present any peculiarities on the track that make one vehicle preferable over another, but this is a limitation of many markedly arcade productions. Technical realization: between SEGA and fanservice Ace Racer, a snowy scenery As mentioned at the beginning, Ace Racer indulges in itching out of time massimo, with some touches of fanservice that do not go well with the genre and are generally out of place, but beyond this aspect the technical realization is very solid and presses the accelerator on the iPhone 14 Pro, bringing the terminal to limit where the graphic settings are set to maximum quality at 60 fps. The adjustments, in any case, allow the experience to be scaled up for older terminals and therefore to obtain an adequately fluid gameplay without ending up with the mobile phone overheating within few minutes. Having said that, the graphics work a lot in terms of quantity but the artistic depth of the game leaves a lot to be desired, and in fact the numerous scenarios available do not give great emotions, not like the ones we told at the time of the Asphalt review 9: Legends. Ace Racer, a dirt road that is so SEGA Rally A general feeling of aliasing and clipping of the polygons over the distance, together with the frequent references to the sun and the sea, reveal how the developers of NetEase have clearly drawn inspiration from the great SEGA classics, with the result, however, of finding themselves in their hands a game of ran visually devoid of thickness, which lacks personality. An approach that is also reaffirmed with regard to the sound effects and the dance-style musical accompaniment, really frivolous and insignificant.", "date": "2023-04-02", "grade": "7.5"}
