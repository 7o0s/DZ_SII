Therefore, the historic game designer wanted to fill this gap with the present Party Wave, a title that deals with the discipline of surfing, letting go of any ambition for realism and proposing an extremely casual gameplay ... perhaps even too much even by iOS standards . Abnormal wave Fragmented into stages that take a few minutes to complete, Party Wave offers a game structure basically divided into two parts, with the first requiring the user to guide the surfers on duty towards the wave to be tackled: facilitated by a visual bird's eye view, you need to drag your finger across the screen to push the character to the desired place, making sure you arrive in time for the arrival of the mass of water and paying attention to the obstacles that become more numerous as you go . Once in position, the camera switches to a more appropriate frontal shot, and here you have to tap on the surfers before they reach the bottom of the screen to make sure they don't crash and continue riding the wave until it stops. propulsion. All this while carefully avoiding touching turtles, jellyfish and other marine animals that would cause the characters to fall, and perhaps trying to make some simple evolutions to increase the score. Party Wave is basically all here, and considering the references of its creator and the price at which it is offered, it is easy to understand how there is really too little meat in the fire. Already after the first five or six internships, one can say that one has experienced everything that the Mistwalker product has to offer, given that the playful mechanics only allow for some very slight variations on the theme described above: the result is that a game equipped with a potentially valid structure suitable for short games becomes a boring reiteration of the usual two-three moves, due to an uninspired design that fails to capitalize on the starting ideas. A situation that is certainly not relieved by the graphics sector, which indeed contributes heavily to giving the idea that Party Wave is made up of a couple of stages repeated endlessly: all right, it is difficult to show off any particular variety when all the game is set in the middle of the sea, but at least as regards the sprites of the protagonists and the animals on the screen, it could have been done much better than those four specimens on the cross, however, moved by elementary animations. In short, we must hope that Sakaguchi wrote the concept of the title with his left hand and that he produced it by investing the proceeds of the coffee machine of the Mistwalker offices, otherwise it would not be possible to explain such a structural poverty and so much production values exact. The game also tries to offer an element of challenge, forcing the player to obtain several perfect scores in order to unlock the more advanced levels, but the charm of the gameplay is so limited that many will hardly try their hand at the enterprise.", "date": "2012-07-30", "grade": "5.0"}
