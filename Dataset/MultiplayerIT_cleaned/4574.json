The dealer is the same as in the first chapter, but now even more treacherous With Hand of Fate 2, Defiant Development restarted from that experience, trying to make all the criticisms received its own and to capitalize on the success of the original, which was greatly appreciated by critics (including us) and gamers. The game structure has remained identical: our destiny is in the hands of a dealer who, card after card, guides our growth and reveals our history. Hand of Fate 2 is divided into twenty-two quests, each of which has its own unique cards. And here we already see one of the major differences from the previous episode: the greater care for the narrative side. Not that the differences between the missions were missing in the first Hand of Fate, but they were less emphasized and were expressed above all in small alterations of the rules and in some special cards. Here the work of differentiation is evident right from the selection of the missions themselves, which now takes place on a map, but is expressed more strongly in the gameplay, where the special cards have a much greater importance than in the first episode and where the narrative cards are much more structured, with often complex multiple choices and with the support of a whole series of systems that enrich what were previously simple interlude phases. Quests and exploration But let's stay on the map and on the cards. If you recall, in the first Hand of Fate some events required the extraction of a card, from a pile of four, to decide its fate. This system has remained unchanged in the sequel, but others have been added to it: in some cases to be successful it will be necessary to roll three dice trying to obtain a certain amount, for example to help a woman in difficulty, while in others it will be necessary to be able to stop a self-propelled hand on a light bar, perhaps to unlock locks. Even in terms of generic cards there are some small novelties. We have already mentioned one: the individual cards are much more structured than the old ones. Now monsters and special equipment have their own presentations From here derives a second one: the presence of real chains of missions. In short, once some cards linked to tokens have been resolved, others are unlocked which continue what was done in the previous ones. From this point of view, the cards linked to followers appear particularly rich (another novelty which we will discuss in more detail in the next paragraph), which present very articulated quests, with crossroads and exploration possibilities that sometimes go beyond the indicated objective. Still speaking of cards, compared to the first chapter, a greater variety should be noted in how the dealer arranges them on the game board: in Hand of Fate linear schemes prevailed, while here greater freedom is often allowed, thanks to more complex or more broad. In order not to repeat situations too much, several variants have also been provided for the same type of paper. Small stuff that doesn't change the rewards you receive, but effective in not creating situations in which the same actions are repeated over and over again without a minimum of tension. In some cases, extra options also appear depending on the companion you are carrying, which add an extra touch. Combat system If the exploration mechanics linked to the cards can be considered refined, rather than renewed, the combat mechanics are a completely different matter. Here Defiant has done a great job of responding to all the criticisms received. The fights are more varied: more enemies, more equipment, more beautiful scenery Of course, we are not dealing with a perfect system, but the improvements are still evident: collisions between weapons and characters are greatly improved, the execution of techniques is much more precise, there are more enemies, and the equipment is more varied. If in Hand of Fate there were configurations to pursue that allowed winning in practically all fights, greatly increasing repetitiveness, here it is necessary to better study the characteristics of each single piece (finally clearly visible in the initial selection phase) and relate them to the mission that will be undertaken. For example, if the opponents are the corpulent men of the north, it is not advisable to select a two-handed weapon, which slows down the character, but it is better to focus on a more agile one-handed weapon, perhaps with specific anti--north. In the selection phase, the special power of each tool must also be considered, which is activated after a certain number of hits have been achieved without suffering any. These vary from a simple concentrated attack from the basic weapons, to a flurry of slashing blows from a pair of knives, to a stunning slash from a warhammer. Some schemes can be very complex From all this it follows that even the choice of equipment cards has become more delicate and important, with some weapons and armor taking on greater weight depending on the circumstances. Another big news is the presence of the aforementioned followers, i.e. the characters who help us in combat (and not only). Each follower has his own card, which must be selected at the beginning of the missions. For example, we can carry around a wizard capable of throwing magical projectiles and protecting ourselves with a protective shield, or we can focus on a berserk warrior, who increases our damage. A renewed formula, but with some falls Hand of Fate 2 improves on the original, but still has its own problems. The first is definitely originality, given that we are dealing with an improved production and nothing more. It is true that demanding from independent developers what is no longer asked of triple A studios is a bit hypocritical, but given that one of the most appreciated features of the first chapter was precisely its freshness, it was hoped that the sequel would dare a little moreover. Another note we can move it to the combat system: it is better than that of the previous title, but far from perfect, with some inputs that occasionally fail, especially on parade, and with the main character who can fail for indecipherable reasons. The equipment must be adapted to the opponents The followers' AI isn't great either, and is often found to be more useful for their passive abilities, which we manually activate, than their prowess in battle. Graphically however, the step forward is clear, with better and more complex models, a greater variety in every aspect, especially in equipment, and with battlefields that are perhaps smaller, but better characterized than those of the first episode. Of course, here too we are faced with a work of enrichment, which has nothing revolutionary about it. It matters little, given that Hand of Fate 2 is an overall fun and successful game, a worthy heir to its predecessor.", "date": "2017-11-06", "grade": "8.9"}
