{"name": "Valkyria Chronicles - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valkyria-chronicles-recensione.html", "text": "Episodic War The development of the game is rather schematic, with an episodic flow of events: a narrative part and an organizational/managerial section precede the battles which are the fulcrum of the game. As the title of the product explicitly declares, the chronicles of the events of the war for Gaul represent a good fifty percent of the gaming experience, a series of cutscenes and dialogues accessible from the diary which serves as the main menu, as a hub for moving around the within the various sections of the title. Before each battle you must therefore manage your troops, spend the acquired experience points and develop new weapons and upgrades for them and for the tank. The fighting does not only involve the three protagonists but also the other soldiers of their platoon, about twenty. It is therefore necessary to choose which ones to bring into battle, based on their class, each with its own peculiarities and with their personal attitudes. We find 5 different types of soldiers: the scout, the sniper, the stormtrooper, the engineer (ie the deminer/doctor and ammunition carrier) and the anti-tank, here called Lancer due to the strange weapon it carries. Their characteristics are entirely functional to the particular development of the battles. First of all, they rely (too) rigidly on a Chinese scribe system to express their strengths and weaknesses. The Lancer, for example, is entirely devoted to hunting armored vehicles, with the result that it is not very effective with foot soldiers. The assaulter is infallible over short distances and completely useless beyond a certain, even not excessive, number of meters, the sniper, on the contrary, is the ultimate killing machine from long range, while in the automatic counterattack phases he will refrain from shooting at enemy stormtrooper who appears in front of him in a straight line at a proverbial stone's throw. Then to expand the catalog of differences there is the amount of Action Points that can be spent each turn, or how much a soldier can move on the battlefield. For example, the scout can travel long distances, which, for example, the tank or stormtrooper cannot. The heart beyond the obstacle All these peculiarities have been implemented according to the battle phases, in which after choosing which soldiers to use, we can manage them one by one in turn, carefully choosing where to move them to look for the right shelters and optimal lines of fire. Each battle is divided into phases and shifts, with the former representing the moments of our and the enemy's action and the latter representing the number of movements that our soldiers can perform. In each phase the number of movements/actions is given by the Command Points available: the soldiers use one at each turn, the tank instead burns two; once finished the ball passes to the enemy and so on until victory or defeat. The rounds, which are unlimited in time, are limited only by the movement of your alter ego and a single available attack: move, shoot and, if there are enough Action Points, seek cover, this is the winning strategy for progressing in the game. Once the soldier is positioned, the action abandons the third-person view of the movements to display the viewfinder of one's weapon like an FPS; those who feared a bland and excessively static rhythm can rest assured, in the key moments you have to dodge the blows and seek shelter, it being understood that once you switch to fire mode the enemy stops waiting for the enemy's salvo of bullets. Everything is extremely fun, complex and profound, lightly moving a soldier without taking into account the order of how far he can travel, any shelters, hidden snipers and in general units that represent the nemesis for that chosen one, leads without half measures to death . This definitive departure since if the soldier gasping on the ground is approached by one of the enemies he disappears completely, there is no doctor who can save him. However, the game is not too punitive towards the player who leaves his soldiers in the open after an incorrect calculation of the movement in the light of the fact that, within the phase, it is possible to choose the same pot several times in a row, however at the price of a smaller amount of Action Points each time. The premature death of a fellow soldier, if on the one hand perhaps takes away a particularly efficient soldier in the city or near a tank (each soldier is endowed with subtle bonuses or malus depending on his social, physical and cultural background), however, does not involve the loss of the experience accumulated by the same since the latter is related to an entire class and not to a single infantryman. What is the point of choosing which uti soldierswhether the level advancement relates to an entire class? Why kill someone if then this loss is mainly only emotional? Covers discovered and scripts known The combat phases also suffer from other critical issues, in addition to the one already mentioned above, which concerns caveats that are too rigid and inflexible in the attack and defense bonuses relating to the class in use. The system doesn't seem to tolerate inconsistent use of soldier peculiarities, so you have to be very careful in choosing who to use and how to use them. But what really turns up their noses is a use, at least bizarre, of the covers. During an attack turn it is good practice to crouch behind sandbags, both to stabilize the aim and to limit the enemy's line of fire. In addition to these defenses, the arenas are full of barrels, crates and other obstacles, which however do not allow you to take cover, with the result that in the first clashes you remain under crossfire because it is believed, erroneously, that that shelter is ~usable ~. As a result, another Command Point is forced to be used to bring the unfortunate person to safety, provided that he/she has the necessary amount of movement to bring home the skin. After the first skirmishes we notice a decidedly scripted and not very adaptive artificial intelligence. It almost seems that the decisions taken by the opponents have been written upstream, that they take little account of the opponents' movements, endlessly repeating the pre-set script of the mission. This does not mean that everything can be resolved with pigeon shooting, given that in any case incorrect choices are paid dearly. However, the lack of any multiplayer mode stands out above all these critical points, an entirely unjustified absence given that the title would lend itself to online use, with decidedly strategic matches in the name of the weighted choice of orders, and which would have greatly lengthened the longevity of the title, despite the inclusion of the Skirmish mode unrelated to the main part of the game. Covers discovered and scripts known From a purely technical point of view Valkyria is appreciated more for the artistic direction than for the application of the same in coldly technological terms. There are neither particle effects nor HDR, the polygonal modeling does its duty without excelling, the scenarios, although well done and rich in detail, are decidedly meager in terms of the amount of objects and things shown. However, one is amazed by the quality of the cel shading implemented, everything seems drawn and colored by hand using pastels, complete with lines left by the tip of the pencil. This choice is also linked to the story, given that the protagonist Welkin is presented in the first moments of the game intent on portraying fish in a stream. More generally, an artistic direction that does not clash with a rather realistic representation of war, with urban scenarios devastated by the conflict and rivers of refugees fleeing, without blood, but with superimposed onomatopoeias like the old Batman television series. Also appreciable is the inclusion of Japanese speech, along with the English one set by default. Comment Valkyria Chronicles is a decidedly well done game, graced by an excellent graphic sector and with the valuable characteristic of being immediately usable and very fun, without however going to the detriment of depth, an essential feature for a tactical jRPG. The mechanics of the clashes are intriguing and complex, as is the managerial management of one's arsenal and troop. One remains perplexed by a certain rigidity in the management of bonuses / malus in attack and defense, an artificial intelligence too tied to some basic directives and some choices in terms of gameplay that clash with the general setting of the title. For the rest we are faced with a game that manages to satisfy everyone, both experienced experts in tactical clashes and those who are approaching this genre for the first time. Too bad for the absence of a multiplayer mode, which castrates the longevity of the game in the long run Pros Very high artistic level Deep, complex and immediate Cons There is no multiplayer Some gameplay choices clash with the underlying ideas Artificial intelligence too scripted", "date": "2008-10-29", "grade": null}
