{"name": "Jump! Superstars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jump-superstars.html", "text": "Celebrity Death Match Where to begin to describe the bizarre idea behind the entire gameplay of Jump! Superstars? Ah, here: from the Jump! world. Jump! World is, technically, the main game mode in Jump! Superstars. In a sort of huge map (divided into four islands) we will virtually move from one mission to another, gradually unlocking the next ones. The missions are nothing more than fights against one or more opponents, but each one has multiple objectives: ranging from the simple knock-out of the opponent to being able to survive for a minute and a half. Sometimes you have to throw your challenger out of the ~ring~ a certain number of times, sometimes you even have to avoid being hit. There are missions in which we are asked to repeatedly kick a chest or a box, others in which we have to win without using a certain key. In short, there is everything and even more: there is no shortage of variety, the missions are many and in the long run even quite difficult (try not to get hit by JoJo and her Star Platinum). But these missions are not there for pure enjoyment, there are the rewards: the ~Koma~. Jump! Superstars is all based on the ~Koma~: these are real cartoons taken directly from the original manga, and which we will obtain by completing the various missions of the Jump! world. Mainly through the aforementioned method we will obtain two types of Koma: the Help Koma and the Serif Koma. The former are small squares with the portrait of one of the countless characters in the game and taken from the various manga: they work like power-ups in battle, recharging our energy or increasing our damage for a few seconds. Serif Koma, on the other hand, are cartoons of two or seven blocks, but of two or three of these... empty. We only see a dark image and a balloon that serves as a clue (for those who know the original manga or can read Japanese, of course) to understand which Help Koma we will have to ~drag~ using the touch-screen and place in the empty space. If the combination is right... the Serif Koma will magically become a Support Koma or a Battle Koma. Rewind. We have two more types of Koma. The Support Koma, once touched on the touch-screen, will activate a particular animation in battle: perhaps the character represented will appear out of nowhere to attack our opponents (such as Usopp, armed with his slingshot) or he will give us a dish to regenerate our Jump ! Soul (as in the case of Sanji, to stay in One Piece theme), and then it will disappear. Finally, the Battle Koma are nothing more than the fighters, the characters that we use directly during the fight: the more blocks their corresponding Koma is made up of, the more powerful the character will be... and the less Koma we will be able to equip. At this point, having explained the Koma and their function, everything will be clearer: the Koma unlocked by proceeding in the Jump! World and successfully matching Help and Serif Koma will be archived and accessible through a menu. Here the player can indulge himself, placing his Koma in a sort of page divided into twenty blocks (4x5), and creating real ~teams~ of heroes to be used not only in Jump! World, but also in multiplayer against one or two or even three friends. There is only one rule for placing Koma: there are no rules. Twenty blocks and a total of 650 Koma to choose from to fill them: now it's up to your imagination and common sense. Each Battle Koma is associated with a sort of characteristic (Friendship, Effort or Victory) and as in ~Scissors, Paper and Stone~ each of these characteristics is stronger, neutral or weaker towards another: it is therefore good not to keep characters of the same characteristics in the same team. Or again, up to four Battle Koma can be placed in the same team, but this will affect the placement of useful Support Koma (two to three blocks in size). Some Koma will influence each other depending on their position in the grid, and there are also three particular 1-block Koma which, if placed between two specific Battle Koma, will allow the execution of devastating combined attacks in pairs: you can take advantage of the spectacular fusion of Goku's Genkidama and Naruto's Rasengan or watch Kenshin and Zoro use their deadliest sword techniques simultaneously, but you'll have to give up three blocks in the grid. The decision is up to you. Add a seat at the table Here is the list of all the series that appear in Jump! Superstars. Dragon Ball Z Dr. Slump & Arale-chan Shaman King Naruto One Piece JoJo no Kimiyo na Boken YuYu Hakusho Hunter X Hunter Bleach Death Note Black Cat Hikaru no Go Rurouni Kenshin Yu-gi-Oh! Busou Renkin Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo Slam Dunk! Steel Ball Run Eyeshield 21 Ichigo 100% Mr.Fullswing Kochi Kame Prince of Tennis Gintama Dr.Gray-man Katekyo Hitman Reborn!Pyuu to Fuku!: Jaguar As Mitsuru Adachi said... Touch! How to fight in Jump! Superstars? It's very simple: one key to jump (and jump in mid-air), one for weak blows, one for strong blows, one for the two special moves available for Battle Koma (one is done by pressing this key plus another of the D-pad). The lats are used to block. Fine, with so few keys available it is possible to perform a multitude of combinations. Even more interesting is the fact that the various characters do not have specific ~fighting styles~ ... no ~simple~ punches and kicks, you press a key and Jotaro will emit his Stand to hit the opponent, and perhaps by pressing the same key Goku will fire a barrage of energy projectiles, while Zoro will swing his sword. In essence, the attack is always of a certain type, but the animation and its actual usefulness change from character to character. You jump with a button, because the various arenas, actually large magazine pages, are full of platforms, stationary or moving: like in Smash Bros. or Power Stone, you fight by jumping from one to another and using them intelligently. Page borders can be destroyed, at which point a knocked-down enemy is instantly KO'd. As for the special shots, they consume a special bar which is recharged by beating your opponents or by collecting the various items that jump out of the crates scattered around the ring, once destroyed: not all of them are benevolent, others can damage, such as bombs or poisons. But what does the Touch Screen of the DS have to do with all this? The magic screen is not only used to build our teams by dragging the Koma back and forth from the mighty list, but also to activate the Support and Help Koma during combat, or to change characters on the fly. Move your finger quickly and touch the related Koma, and it will activate: with a little practice it is possible to combine your attacks with offensive Support Koma. And not only that, there are also the Dream Combos. Your team has Goku and Naruto and you are using the former. Touch Goku, then Naruto, then Goku again, quickly: the two heroes will use their special shots in sequence, performing a very powerful combo. In short, the Touch Screen is more than a display, it is a real additional ~controller~, even if a little awkward: to touch it you obviously need to move a finger from the directional cross or from the four main buttons, and this is not simple , if not after a little practice (and maybe a suitable positioning of the various Koma). An animated manga The desire to imitate the original manga as much as possible is also the excuse that justifies the total absence of screams and shouts, in a game where the protagonists are some of the craziest heroes ever. Don't hear Goku yell ~Kamehameha!~ sorry a bit, but it must be said that each special shot is accompanied by huge balloons and onomatopoeias which, if nothing else, mimic the original cartoons in an almost perfect way. After all, how could such a large sampling of digitized voices be reproduced? That's a small price to pay for this little gem. And in any case, we can't complain about the audio: in addition to the many and suitably chaotic sound effects, we can listen to excellent musical tracks, perhaps a little few, but varied and excellently composed. Graphically, however, Jump! Superstars is a two-dimensional fighting game that doesn't cry out for a miracle in terms of overall realization, but does its job very well: lots of excellent animations, bright colors (note that as a character loses energy, it becomes black and white), a large fantasy and variety in the rendering of the various characters, whether they are Battle or Support Koma. However, nothing particularly striking, except for the fact that even in the most chaotic situations (four characters summoning as many characters to each other by filling the screen with explosions is pure chaos, believe us) there is not the slightest slowdown, making the experience always enjoyable. For the rest, the manga are the same, and the characters (albeit with some graphic tricks) are the same ones you loved, or hated, in their pages: if you liked them on paper, you'll love their digitized counterpart. One word to define Jump! Superstars: Addictive. No one would have bet a penny on what was clearly identifiable as the commercial operation of the summer of 2005, yet Nintendo amazes us with a... fighting game... or party game... or how you want to identify this game, which entertains like few other videogames, recently, have been able to do. Of course, the fundamental condition for being able to appreciate Jump! Superstars is being passionate about the manga or anime featured in the cartridge, and some are practically scKnown in Italy, but the funny thing is that the gameplay is so simple, varied and fun that even those who don't know Goku or Naruto will be able to appreciate it. However, the Japanese language represents the greatest obstacle: the various menus and the objectives described for each mission are obviously in ideograms, making the simplest operations difficult. You need a notebook, an online guide and a lot of patience to navigate the various menus to understand what to do and how to do it, but very little practice and a scant hour of play are enough to learn the basic commands. Separate discussion for the Koma: if you don't know Japanese, and are therefore not able to translate the clues in the Serif Koma balloons, you find yourself trying hundreds of combinations in order to unlock the relative Koma, a decidedly tedious operation . But to imitate a well-known advertisement... beating up Yugi is priceless. Too bad he's one of the strongest characters in the game. Pros: The most famous manga in a single cartridge As funny as it is varied Original and innovative gameplay You can beat it ... ok ok, we already said it Cons: Completely in Japanese In the long run a bit repetitive Total absence of digitized speech Have you ever dreamed of beating up the unbearable Yugi? Or maybe it was the terrible Vegeta or the evil Dio Brando to do it for you? Let's say you're nicer, and you would have preferred that Monkey D. Luffy or Yusuke Urameshi filled him with punches. Don't be ashamed of these thoughts... certainly not because they are all based on beating up Yugi (a good and right thing) but because for a manga and anime fan they are more than legitimate. Not a fan of manga and anime? Then you could also stop reading and go back to the home page but, trust me, go all the way. You may have some surprises. Crossovers are not new to the gaming world. To the most experienced and Japanese connoisseurs of video games, Tales of Fandom might come to mind. But in reality, especially if we talk about comics, we cannot fail to mention the Capcom fighting games that saw the very American Marvel super-heroes and the protagonists of the most famous Street Fighter mother's video games collide. If we remain in the context of ~Japanese comics~, instead, we may perhaps think of Toriyama's appearance, in a comic version, in Tobal#2 by Square. Jump! Superstars, however, is a completely different thing. It's not a real fighting game, let's say it's more reminiscent of Nintendo's Smash Bros., let's say it's a fighting game sprinkled with party-games. Say what you will, but the reality is that this game is a momentous event for manga fans. Jump! is a weekly magazine that has been publishing the episodes of the ~shonen~ comic series in Japan for years, before they are collected in volume. ~Shonen~, manga for boys, that is, above all action and adventure manga. Manga like Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto and JoJo, which are also very popular in Italy. Well, take the main protagonists of these series, slam them into an arena and make them fight with their most famous secret shots: you will get Jump! Superstars. And no, there is no Kenshiro...", "date": "2005-08-29", "grade": null}
