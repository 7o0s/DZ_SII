In our opinion, it is no coincidence that the total sales of Dementium and Dementium II have been ungenerously poor. Yet it was a very valid experience, a white fly in the playful offer of the dual-screen portable console, all puppets and cartoons, which shone especially with the second chapter, decidedly more mature than the debut episode in terms of direction and plot. Three years later, here is another courageous project: bringing Dementium II to PC, using the traditional ~remastering in HD~ which however, in this specific case, meant practically redesigning the entire graphics sector, with polygonal models and settings they had to go from the original 256 x 192 pixels to 1920 x 1080 and beyond. A far from simple job, which in fact landed on Steam with many problems, so much so that after a few minutes the desire to close the application due to its manifest unplayability and the many bugs was great. Indeed, the graphics have indeed been redesigned and adapted to the new format, but we are still talking about a visual impact that even ten years ago would have been branded as dated, and which does not even hold a candle to the comparison with titles such as Half Life 2, which as we know is released in 2004. On the desktop PC (a Phenom II X4 955 with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 video card), the frame rate was so high that controlling the pointer was impossible, even more so if you tried to use the Xbox 360 controller, supported very bad. We therefore took a break, took a deep breath and installed the game on a notebook, where fortunately the experience proved to be more easily usable; albeit here too mediocrely optimized, given that we are talking about a configuration on which Left 4 Dead 2 runs without any problems with maximum details at 60 frames per second, while Dementium II HD struggles despite moving a tenth of the polygons ( if not less), covered with textures that define grainy is an understatement. Dementium II was a great survival horror for the Nintendo DS, but the PC HD version is bad For what it's worth In short, the game is really bad to see, beyond its horror nature. Is this enough to close the case? Almost. The ~remastering~ was done not let's say with the feet, but with the heels, by people who evidently don't have the slightest idea of what the video games currently available on PC are like. And we are not referring to triple A productions, because there are many independent teams with the skills and talent necessary to do very well even with reduced budgets, see the excellent Hard Reset, which you can take home with pennies, or the promising Nether, which we will deal with shortly with a trial of the Early Access version. So it would certainly have been possible to convert Dementium II to PC in a more than decent way, give it a current cosmetic and let the excellent ideas of the original for Nintendo DS do the rest, putting us in the shoes of a certain William, a psychiatric patient who has to escape from the hospital in which he was confined to save his family, through dimensional openings which, similarly to what was seen in the episodes of Silent Hill, allow him to explore the scenarios in a different way, finding passages on a plane of reality which from on the other hand they look like barred doors. Collecting clues, weapons and objects, the man has to face armed guards on one side and horrible monsters on the other, chasing a mad doctor who seems to play the role of puppeteer and who engages in monstrous experiments inside the structure. True survival horror Turning a blind eye (but also both) on the graphics and letting yourself be carried away by a sound capable of creating a great atmosphere (even if the ~breaks~ from one situation to another are not always elegant), inexplicably lacking in the discreet Italian dubbing that we had instead appreciated on Nintendo DS (unfortunately replaced by practically unreadable subtitles in our language), the experience of Dementium II HD soon gets into gear and, despite the simplicity of a product born to clear first-person survival horror on a portable console that never had seen, manages to involve. The woodiness of the movements makes Resident Evil so much, the ammunition of firearms is scarce and it is often necessary to make do with the knife or the clubs, learn to read the movements of the enemies and attack them using the right timing ... all elements to which fans of this kind they had almost given up, lost in the vortex of that fashion that seems to have transformed the most representative franchises into such senso in simple third person shooters; beautiful without a soul, or at least devoid of what made us fall in love in the early years. Renegade Kid's work, net of the ignoble conversion, therefore has its own dignity and a story worth telling. Maybe when the price will be appropriate to the technical quality of the conversion...", "date": "2013-12-24", "grade": "4.0"}
