And). In any case, there is a case that the friend suggested that he let it go. And we suspect that Chris Tolworthy also paid for the skepticism of his companions when he decided to start Enter the Story, a project that already has ten years of development behind it and which requires another twenty to complete, unless some kind soul decides to give a hand to Chris. On the other hand, visionaries have always been opposed by common sense. For Chris it all began when he decided to solve the problem of poverty in the world. Having to finance this titanic enterprise, he chose to create and sell video games based on literature. Visit the official website if you want to read his manifesto, we don't make judgments about people here. Rather we try to frame his creations, which we prefer to consider interactive illustrated books. The virtual volumes of Enter the Story are better appreciated by avoiding the comparison with video games. But if we really want to find a genre for it, Enter the Story would be a series of graphic adventures. To date Chris has succeeded in the heroic feat of making the playful adaptation of four grandiose texts: Les Miserables, A Tale of Two Cities, The Divine Comedy and Theogony. Chris has connected the worlds of these novels following a personal philosophical and humanistic path, which starts from the original texts to provide new and stimulating interpretations. You can agree or not: all opinions are legitimate. On the other hand, Chris wants to dialogue with his readers-wayfarers. So let's see what emerges by ~browsing~ the screens. Deus ex machina The structure is the same for all four games, so we only consider Les Miserables, which of all the works is the most accessible and well-known, since unfortunately the Divine Comedy often remains a dark memory of high school. In the games of the Enter the Story series we take on the role of a character outside the story: we are not Jean Valjean, for example. Our character is called Peri, and it is the same in all the works. In the case of Les Miserables, Peri is the ghost of a poor child who died due to the appalling conditions in which the Parisian population lived in the historical period during which Victor Hugo's masterpiece is set. Right from the start we have the entire map of Paris and its surroundings available, with lots of places to explore. Even if all we can do is select a character and then select another person or object again. In most cases we discover interesting thoughts of secondary figures, which add depth to the setting. But if we guess the right action, the story goes on. The search for the correct association is the backbone of the game, the only obstacle in our path. Unfortunately, the gameplay is meager and soon boring. In the game of Theogony there are time trials, similar to mini-games, but nothing that would excite a gamer. Furthermore, there is no indication of which path to follow and we find ourselves too often wandering aimlessly or asking for help from the spirit guide, which in the case of Les Miserables is Victor Hugo. The visuals are rough, similar to animated sketches, and detract from the gameplay experience. Only the beautiful soundtrack comes to the player's aid. However, it must be considered that it was all done by one person and that literature enthusiasts might love a second dive into the pages of these masterpieces. Likewise, playing one of the Enter the Story titles could stimulate reading of the original work, which no game can ever replace.", "date": "2010-09-24", "grade": "S.V."}
