After even arousing the interest of Congress, the federation had to set up an at least controversial anti-doping control system, which has little to do with the nature of its shows. Not to be outdone in terms of hypocrisy compared to the USA (where people are scandalized by steroids but always keep at least one gun at home...), in Italy the WWE has disappeared from free-to-air programming and therefore its programs (Raw , Smackdown and ECW) are now viewable via satellite only. A move that on the one hand ensures broadcasts an indisputably better technical treatment (if only for the presence of the original audio in English), on the other undermines their popularity among the general public. A speech that closely concerns Smackdown vs Raw 2008, just released for all systems. Arrive. Raise hell. leave. The PSP version of the game boasts an identical structure to that of the PS2, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, therefore from the starting screen we can choose whether to play a quick game, organize an exhibition (choosing the wrestlers, the scenario and the type of match) or access 24/7, Tournament and Hall of Fame game modes. Also in this 2008 edition there are options relating to the creation of wrestlers, moves, events and championships. There is also an online game mode via Wi-Fi, thanks to which you can create a game or join someone else's. The 24/7 mode is the big new feature of Smackdown vs Raw 2008, and is playable either by choosing a single wrestler or playing the role of general manager for one of the three WWE rosters, namely Raw, Smackdown and ECW. This last option, also present in the last edition of the game, sees us manage one of the sub-federations from every point of view, to win the ratings war with the other two. It is therefore necessary to organize the meetings in the best way, creating rivalries to be carried on over the weeks until they culminate in the pay-per-views. Success is achieved by combining popular characters and encounters of great interest, but a large number of factors must be taken into account: every time a wrestler loses, his popularity drops and therefore his encounters will be less followed, therefore it is necessary to balance successes and failures to not ~burn~ a superstar. Furthermore, all the characters have a fatigue value: when it is too high, even serious injuries can occur, which will keep the wrestler away from the scenes for a different period depending on the extent of the damage. The calendar is managed in a precise way: on free days you can choose to train some wrestlers to improve their skills, or organize a large number of events or even access a skill enhancement system. On the evening of the show, we can decide to simulate all the matches or to play the ones that interest us the most, especially if we want them to go a certain way. Playing the 24/7 mode from the point of view of an individual fighter, things work almost identically as far as the schedule is concerned, only there is a storyline that develops in the background and you have no say in the organization of meetings. However, to ~complete~ the game in this sense it really takes months. If you smell what the Rock is cooking As already mentioned, the 24/7 mode, played first from the player's point of view and then from the general manager's point of view, guarantees incredible longevity on its own and can keep us busy for a long time. However, there are equally interesting side situations: the tournament mode, for example, allows us to participate in a particular event to win a title and has a structure that unlocks the items as the game is completed. And then there is the Hall of Fame mode, that is a list of objectives (complete with precise historical references) that we must achieve in order to enter the WWE ark of glory, together with characters of the caliber of Hulk Hogan, Dusty Rhodes, ~Rowdy Roddy Piper, Bret ~The Hitman~ Hart etc. Finally, there is the usual series of numerous extras: characters to ~purchase~ (the usual ~The Rock~, ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, Mick Foley to which are added novelties such as Jim ~The Anvil~ Neidhart, Eddie Guerrero and Sgt. Slaughter exclusively for the PSP version), tournaments to unlock and so on. Ultimately, in terms of longevity, this Smackdown vs Raw 2008 really has nothing to learn from anyone, and on PSP it probably represents one of the products with the greatest ~life expectancy~. As long as you appreciate itThe gameplay, it is clear: the ~feeling~ of the game has remained almost unchanged compared to the 2007 edition, with only the addition of fighting styles to mix the cards on the table to a minimum. In practice, when choosing a wrestler you have to select his style of behavior from the two available to each one: there are the ~flyers~ who love aerial maneuvers and are always quick in their movements, the ~brawlers~ who get excited in scrums detriment of technique, the ~powerful~ who manage to inflict powerful blows and easily prevail over their opponents, the ~technicians~ who execute every move with ease, the ~showmen~ who manage to exalt the public and finally the ~disloyal~ who they produce in every impropriety to achieve victory. In a nutshell, each fighting style has unique characteristics in the form of special moves. For one thing, the disloyal can hide behind the referee and then push him against the opponent, or perform some incorrect but very effective maneuvers. For the thousands in attendance, for the millions watching at home... Beyond the introduction of styles, the game itself has remained unchanged. On PSP, this translates to moving the fighter with the d-pad, hitting with the Square, grabbing with the Circle, using X for the general action and Triangle for the special move (as soon as the relative bar is full). The actions that can be performed are so numerous, however, that it is necessary to use combinations to be able to perform them all: the back buttons are used to run, but also to get on the post and to perform countermoves. By holding down the backbone R together with the Circle, you can access the Ultimate Control moves, or maneuvers that must be performed using the analog stick to obtain various results, which differ according to the area of the ring in which we are. Let's say that the substance of the control system does not change much compared to what was seen on the ~major~ consoles, with the d-pad instead of the left analog stick and the only analog stick to perform the actions that on PlayStation 2, for example, they are activated with the right stick. Having exhausted the numerous advantages of Smackdown vs Raw 2008, it is appropriate to highlight its defects, which are unfortunately also numerous. Beyond the specific realization of the PSP version of the game, in fact, the action has remained deadly slow: the fights are extremely static and the execution of the moves at the beginning is not very simple, but more than anything else the problem is that there is no 'was no real improvement over the 2007 edition. Leaving the difficulty at the normal level allows you to defeat your opponent without suffering anything at all, while switching to the ~hard~ or ~legend~ level ends up getting burned by the fact that no move is successful and you have to resolve the match in other ways, certainly less fun and spectacular (not to mention when you end up on the mat and the opponent starts keeping you there forever with submission holds...) . All this is absolutely not normal, and if on the one hand it is not possible to revolutionize what in the end is still the best wrestling simulation currently available, on the other hand it would be appropriate to take a few steps in the direction of the classic fighting games to find the freshness and frenzy that this production lacks. Technical realization Unfortunately the PSP version of Smackdown vs Raw 2008 disappoints when it comes to graphics. From the point of view of fidelity to real wrestlers, we are at levels of excellence, nothing to say: the entrances are reproduced down to the smallest detail (although the rendering of the ~fireworks~ could be much, much better: the entrance of Batista is ~castrated~, in particular) and the characters are identical to the real ones. But it doesn't take much to notice the simplicity of the polygonal models, which in the case of women (horrible!) show all their weaknesses. If you were looking for an environment that guaranteed a stable frame rate in all situations, the result has been fully achieved. But at what price? The audience is among the ugliest ever seen, with shapeless and pixelated masses that move making one think more of a horror film than of rowdy fans, and this only in the front rows because the rest is made up of a simple texture low definition. As far as the sound is concerned, there is the usual good quality signed soundtrack, which however does not boast large numbers and gets boring after a very short time (also because the music is always present, both in the menus and during the meetings...) . The effects, on the other hand, are very well done and supported by an enormous amount of speech, moreover recited by the real wrestlers as well as by the WWE chairman, Vince McMahon. Even the match commentary is excellentlevel and is entrusted to the various Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, etc. The game boasts a complete translation of the screen texts into Italian, both for the menus and for the dialogues. Comment Smackdown vs Raw 2008 is, right now, the best wrestling game available for the PSP and will probably only be surpassed by the next episode of the series. Huge in numbers, modes, customizations and dialogues, it can really guarantee months and months of entertainment if we are WWE fans. If our interest in this sport-entertainment is not of an absolute level, however, it will take little time to stumble into the limits of a product that does its best to make the action varied, but is anchored in problems of pure and simple gameplay: the action is slow and, in general, the combat system should be widely revised to be more fun and less monotonous. To this we must add excellent graphics as regards the wrestlers, but absolutely mediocre for everything else, with approximation peaks rarely seen (but perhaps someone will be able to explain why the photos of the characters appear ~blurry~ in the selection screen, among the other things). Ultimately, if you love wrestling madly and only own PSP, the new Yuke's product is essential. Let's just hope that, in the run-up to the 2009 edition, there is an effort to get more out of the PlayStation Portable, and changes to the gameplay that could make the action faster and more engaging.
