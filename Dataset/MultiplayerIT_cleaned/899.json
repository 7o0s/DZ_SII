{"name": "Recensione NARC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-narc.html", "text": "Narc, the tough world of drugs Initially the atmosphere and plot actually seem to recall the glories of the past with a plot involving two anti-drug agents and drug dealing as the obvious protagonist. The core of Narc consists in the possibility of choosing our path through numerous missions, which aim to arrest drug traffickers and neutralize a vast drug trade. Between arrests, interceptions and shootings we find ourselves in the possibility of choosing which approach to face the hard life of a narcotics agent and we discover that it can be tempting to make a career and at the same time perceive illegal acts through requisitions or connivance with the underworld. On the other hand, we can decide that moral integrity is priceless and that justice, despite the horrors that surround us, still has a value. Committed to this tough choice we are faced with Narc's first real flaw. In fact, being an upright cop proves to be downright boring and turns Narc into an impoverished True Crime clone. Being an upright cop, in fact, turns out to be downright boring Narc, the tough world of drugs The game becomes a repetitive series of arrests and recoveries based on an action structure devoid of innovations and decidedly spartan in its implementation. However, from the crooked cop point of view the title definitely earns some points. This opens up the possibility of making violent arrests, of establishing relationships with the underworld and above all of selling and using the confiscated drugs. Furthermore, the use of drugs produces a series of effects that manifest themselves directly during the game. The drugs available are numerous and start from the stimulants, which slow down the surrounding world or increase the reactions of our character, to the hallucinogens that distort voices and perceptions and cause waking nightmares. Even in this case, however, the game structure, which could have been much wider and full of ideas, stops at the status of a pale shadow of GTA. Even the extra missions that are unlocked as you progress through the game closely resemble the bonus actions featured in the Rockstar title. An example that indicates the little effort put into the making of this title is the proceeds made from our torts that cannot be used in any way. Notes on balancing Guided by a non-existent artificial intelligence, the attackers in Narc do nothing but take up their weapons and attack. Overcoming some sessions against particularly aggressive enemies means saturating the area with lead, hoping to knock down all the targets before they can take aim. Moreover, the use of drugs as power-ups makes the title extremely easier and, consequently, even flatter. The controls are slow and imprecise and the selection of weapons, considering that we are in an action title, is cyclical and far too slow, so slow that sometimes it is better to fight in close combat with a sniper rifle rather than change weapons. The technical realization Even technically Narc settles on decidedly low standards. The models of the passers-by can be magnanimously described as Spartan; the towns are anonymous and extremely small compared to how other titles have accustomed us. On the texture side it is practically impossible to pronounce and you don't even see the shadow of visual effects. the towns are extremely small in size compared to what other titles have accustomed us to The technical realization The audio sector, fortunately, is average. The sound effects, albeit anonymous and already heard a thousand times, do their job adequately and the soundtrack carries with it the name of groups such as Cypress Hill and DMX. Unfortunately the choice of exclusively techno/rap songs and the small number of them contribute in any case to increase the halo of repetitiveness that surrounds Narc. The dubbing, albeit well interpreted, fails to save trivial texts that would disfigure even in a B-series TV show. Comment Like many other arthouse remakes, Narc fails loudly both as an attempt to collect a precious legacy and as a title for its own sake. The idea of turning drugs into power-ups deals the final blow to the balance and elicits a sad smile as an attempt to amaze the audience of 2005. I recommend the purchase of Narc, due to the low price and the possibility to replay the 1988 classic, only for those who want, at all costs, to play the role of the corrupt policeman. Pros: Less than 30 Euros Allows you to play the old Narc Cons:Poorly calibrated difficulty. Non-existent artificial intelligence Antediluvian graphic compartment Way back in 1988, Narc fell on the then young community of gamers unleashing one of the first disputes on electronic entertainment content. In fact, Narc narrated obscure police affairs, drugs and corruption and policemen with dubious moral integrity. Leaving aside Narc's pedagogical judgement, often used as a mere tabloid pretext depending on the categories involved, we recall the interest he aroused in the videogame community which was confronted for the first time with the possibility of choosing one's social behavior in a plausible situation and definitely current. After seventeen years, the contents proposed by Narc are still largely current, but the videogame market has metabolized them increasingly up to the extreme freedom of action of Grand Theft Auto. Midway and VIS Entertainment have decided to recover the old Narc formula and insert it in a three-dimensional world that closely resembles the structure of Rockstar titles.", "date": "2005-06-28", "grade": null}
