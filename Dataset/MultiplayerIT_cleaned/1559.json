{"name": "WRC 9", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc9-recensione-versione-switch.html", "text": "In recent years, the WRC rally game series has built a reputation for providing arguably the most accurate representation of the sport. The official games of the World Rally Championship continue to maintain a balanced approach to a discipline that has nothing to do with the chaotic 12-car racing of Dirt and has always been about two people, a driver and his navigator. Unfortunately, while the franchise has gained recognition on other gaming systems, it struggles to find a foothold on the Switch due to a series of technical issues that recur again this year. Let's see how in the WRC 9 Switch review. The experience in brief A beautiful sunset ride For those who aren't used to the genre, WRC 9 is simply the official game of the FIA World Rally Championship. This chapter is technically based on the 2020 championship, but due to real-world events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been updated. In reality, the 13-round season was suspended after just 3 rounds, leaving her stuck in limbo for six months. She then came back with a couple of previously unplanned rallies in Estonia and Monza, which for obvious reasons are not in this game, went on for a while longer, but was eventually canceled after just 7 rounds. This means that four rallies (Australia, Catalonia, Chile and Corsica) have been removed from the previous chapter and the three new rallies originally planned for this season (Japan, New Zealand and Kenya) have been included; this resulted in having fewer tracks in WRC 9 than in WRC 8. Of course, one could argue that it's not the development team's fault - we're sure licensing issues prevented them from keeping some of the other tracks, even as an option to play them outside of the main season. However the result cannot be glossed over, although this is somewhat offset by the addition of some extra stages in the Finnish and Portuguese rallies, meaning that the total number of races is still even higher (108 this time to 102 in last year's game), although the diversity of the scenarios has decreased slightly. Game modes and gameplay Beware of invisible walls As in the previous game, there is a full career mode in WRC9, allowing you to manage everything from the team offices and control various aspects behind the scenes, such as planning the next calendar, hiring and firing staff members (taking into account their total salary) and use the game's massive skill tree to develop the performance of the car and entourage. In short, nothing new from last year, where the career mode made its debut in this capacity. Of course, if you're not interested in any of these ~role~ components, there's also a Season Mode where you can simply tackle the demonstrations without ever having to see the inside of an office. Games like this, however, thrive on road experience. The learning curve is very steep, but that's not necessarily a criticism - anyone who's played a good rally game in the past (realistic, not something like Sega Rally) knows that you can't just pick one up and start swinging the car around corners like the ghost of Sbastian Loeb. We understand that these games take a long time to master and the fact that Career Mode gives you the option to start in the WRC Junior class is helpful, as it gives you a little more getting used to the extremely sensitive handling of the controls, so much so that sometimes it can feel like driving a shopping cart with locked wheels. Take the time to not only master the car but also learn the structure of each track and you will see that the hard work will pay off. That said, there are still elements that - while again not the fault of the development team - make playing WRC on Switch much less satisfying than other systems. Most obvious is the lack of analog triggers - by default the game puts throttle and brake on the ZR and ZL, and while that may be fine for arcade games, when the title revolves around the idea of blasting your way through extremely narrow and dangerous landscapes, throttle control can be extremely helpful. There is a way around this, by going into the options menu and assigning acceleration and braking to the right stick, but that too has its pros and cons: not only will you have to reassign (or more likely abandon) the controls to move the camera, but you'll also have to reassign the handbrake to mI hear you don't have to lift your thumb all the way off the right stick to press the A button. Also, if you really want to go overboard and think like an absolute rally nerd, putting acceleration and braking on the right stick means you can't brake with your foot sinister like some rally drivers actually do. The frame rate, which stops at 30 frames per second like on other platforms, is a little more stable than in the past. There are still times where it can't hit the 30fps lock, especially when playing in handheld mode, and there are a handful of scenarios where it can bust dramatically (Wales during a storm in that sense is to be avoided like the plague, the which is good advice in real life as well as in this game), but, in general, it feels more stable than before. To succeed in the enterprise, however, the graphics sector was sacrificed even more, which is bad news for a game that already seemed a bit lackluster. Better or worse than the previous one? If you compare WRC8 and WRC9 you will notice that some environmental details have been removed. It's a very subtle difference, but in places like Finland some trees have been removed, for example; nothing that would affect the gaming experience but certainly not the expected improvement. Only if you play exclusively in TV mode, as the 30 fps in WRC8 were not always achieved, you will notice any difference. Far more disturbing is the engine's constant struggle to keep up with the environment. Some shadows don't appear until you're within a few meters of them, drawing themselves as you run as if you were chasing some sort of ghost. Then there are assets pop up with an alarming frequency, while some trees have a really distracting reverse fade effect. Rally games are a special case, because it's you against the track, and if that track is constantly struggling to load and its trees suddenly appear by the roadside, it can get really frustrating.", "date": "2021-04-14", "grade": "6.0"}
