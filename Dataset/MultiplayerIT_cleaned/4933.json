After having achieved success with the first season of The Walking Dead, an indisputable masterpiece of narrative, direction and smoothness of the gameplay, it has pigeonholed one franchise after another, although it never managed to reach that pinnacle of quality again. In recent years, the company founded by some historic former employees of the golden age of LucasArts has been able to move easily between strictly videogame franchises such as Minecraft or Borderlands and television and multimedia intellectual properties such as Game of Thrones and Jurassic Park. Even more recently the development team has managed to bring home a double collaboration with the two most important companies in the field of comics. And so if 2016 was the year of Batman: The Telltale Series, in collaboration with DC Comics, 2017 is marked by an intense partnership with Marvel that has allowed us to give birth to Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series. When the second chapter of the film adaptation of this franchise is just a week away from the arrival in Italian cinemas, and just over ten days from the American distribution, we had the opportunity to get our hands on the first of the five episodes (monthly? ) that make up this new series of adventures. Series which, exactly as has already happened with the third season of The Walking Dead, arrives exclusively on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, completely missing out on the now obsolete old-generation platforms, but still maintaining distribution on iOS and Android, markets that evidently from a numerical point of view still deserve the full support of the Californian company. So follow us in this analysis of the debut episode of a production that will keep us company at least until the autumn of this 2017 and rest assured that, as usual in our reviews, we will be careful to reduce the risk of spoilers to zero. The first episode of Guardians of the Galaxy is fun and really well packaged A new universe? Let's start immediately by saying that, although they intersect in some narrative areas and above all by presenting certain characters (and above all antagonists), this Telltale series of Guardians of the Galaxy is not directly interconnected or based on the two films with Chris Pratt but is decidedly more linked to the original Marvel Comics. In particular as regards the physical representation of its protagonists. In fact, leaving aside Rocket and Groot, since for quite obvious reasons they are practically identical in all their appearances, Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax are much closer to the features shown in the comics than in the cinema. In the case of Peter Quill the reasons are probably linked to a licensing issue related to the American actor, while for the two green aliens Telltale has probably opted for a solution of convenience to maintain a certain consistency with Star-Lord and achieve a more strong just with the cartoon. In fact, it is no coincidence that, as we also glimpsed in the official trailer, this first episode will really start in a sparkling way making us meet Thanos, Nebula, the Kree and even Yondu practically immediately even if the most predominant narrative arc will revolve around the phantom relic called The Eternity Forge. An intelligent choice that has allowed the software house to play with fans of the first and last hour of the Marvel franchise who perhaps have all the issues of the comic series, or have limited themselves to going to the cinema to get to know this anomalous group of ~ superheroes~, and will then be able to enjoy all the references and winks, but also to meet all the players who don't have a clue who the hell the Guardians are, but who can still follow an enjoyable story that does not he has to deal with the historical legacy of the characters. A story that, exactly as per Telltale tradition, will keep us busy in this first episode for a maximum of two hours, excluding crossroads that may perhaps stimulate more than one person to repeat some game sequences, making different choices. The gameplay is in fact the classic one invented and refined over time by the software house: multiple choice dialogues that will lead to various consequences both on the attitudes of the supporting actors and on the scenes that can be faced (on very few occasions) and a truly basic gameplay where the few exploration sequences properlyte adventure are interspersed with quick time events that mark the more action phases. What happens on the screen is still able to keep us glued for the duration of the episode, despite a central phase with less bite that follows a truly bubbly prologue and anticipates an epilogue that perfectly respects the Telltale style, including the final cliffhanger. Playstation 4 trophies The series offers a total of 31 trophies. Aside from the platinum that is unlocked by reaching the epilogue of the entire series, all other trophies are earned simply by completing the individual chapters of each episode. In other words, there are no references to the choices to be made or to specific elements to be achieved. As per tradition? Despite having dismissed the gameplay in a few lines of text just above, in reality this Guardians of the Galaxy even manages to break some of the recurring elements of the software house's productions. We meet the main novelties during the sparse adventure sequences where we will have, for example, the possibility of using the small jetpacks mounted on Star-Lord's feet to explore the scenarios even in height. In reality their use is confined within a specific section but the result is still interesting given that it adds a new degree of freedom during the exploratory and puzzle solving phases. Secondly, while walking through the rooms in search of points of interest with which to interact, it is possible, by pressing the left trigger, to call three of the four members of the guardian team on the radio (Groot is excluded) to chat with them through a handful of run-out sentences. It is a very interesting solution to dampen that sense of loneliness that otherwise surrounds some of the sequences of this first episode given that due to various vicissitudes we will very often find ourselves alone in Peter's shoes. Let's not hide that we would have liked to be able to manually switch from one character to another, a bit like it happened in the old LucasArts graphic adventures (or in the very recent Thimbleweed Park) since the structure of the team could perfectly justify this option, but in reality it switch takes place only during the quick time events in an absolutely automatic way. There is even the possibility of using Star-Lord's two Kree pistols semi-automatically and allying with a faction towards the end of the game, a choice that will definitively distance us from other options but which suggests some macroscopic interaction in the next ones episodes. Technically, as happened with the third season of The Walking Dead, abandoning the old platforms has benefited the graphic aspect of the title and its stability since the version we tested never showed any bugs or crashes. All the elements on the screen are presented very well with an excellent polygonal count as regards the protagonists, also helped by much more related and understandable facial expressions than seen in the series based on the disturbing universe of Robert Kirkman. Too bad, however, that the scenarios are decidedly more sparse and often anonymous. The soundtrack is absolutely exceptional also thanks to a licensed main theme really suitable for the style of the Guardians of the Galaxy. It is also important to point out at this juncture how, once again, our language has been completely snubbed, including subtitles. So if you know absolutely nothing of English, be careful: you risk missing out on a series of jokes and all the typical irony of this franchise.", "date": "2017-04-18", "grade": "8.5"}
