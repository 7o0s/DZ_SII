{"name": "Dr. Mario &amp; Germ Buster - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dr-mario-amp-germ-buster-recensione.html", "text": "Comment Dr. Mario & Germ Buster is a great classic from the past that entertained and amused us many years ago. Older Nintendo fans may already know it and feel a strong sense of deja-vu, finding this remake (albeit well-reproposed) a game with evergreen but already thoroughly tested mechanics. Moreover, it is yet another puzzle-game, a genre that seems to be very popular among the Wii lineup, a factor that makes it slightly less attractive than it deserves. However, the innovations introduced are very appreciable. The online mode breathes new life, allowing even friends who have not purchased the game to try it for free. The Germ Buster mode, designed to take advantage of the remote control, works well and is a good news, while maintaining the classic gameplay unchanged. The use of Miis instead of Super Mario is nice, for a game that deserves to be downloaded especially by those who have never tried it in the past. Or by die-hard fans.Pro Online game via Wi-Fi Connection A new mode designed for remote Immediate, fun and exciting. Today again. Cons Despite the improvements, it is not an original game Visually very simple Another puzzle-game on the Wii could be tiring Dr. Mario is a great Nintendo classic that first appeared in 1990 on the NES and Game Boy. As for its gameplay, pure arcade-style, simple and fast, it can easily be compared to Tetris. The aim of the game is to destroy all the viruses that are inside the bottle displayed on the screen, trying to match them with the same color of pills that we throw at them. There are three types of viruses: red, yellow and blue. To combat them we have to use six different pills (which each have two active ingredients): yellow-yellow, red-red, blue-blue, red-blue, red-yellow and blue-yellow. These colors must be aligned horizontally or vertically with the viruses on the screen: once a row of at least four elements is obtained, this will disappear making even the little animal, represented with paws and mean eyes, vanish. Before starting, you have to choose the speed at which the drugs fall, the amount of enemies and the background music, all well done in full Nintendo style, well characterized and never annoying. One of the novelties present is the possibility of replacing Mario with our Mii, who dressed as a doctor will throw all the active ingredients from his briefcase. The aim of the game is to destroy all the viruses that are inside a bottle, trying to match them with the same color of the pills that we throw at them The very simple graphics are made up of the playing area and some unpublished outline elements, such as our character and the three polygonal viruses that hop around during the games. This is not a real restyling, but the addition of a few surrounding elements. However, the real novelty is the online option, which allows you to play against a friend via the Wi-Fi Connection: everything takes place through the management of the codes, just like in Mario Kart and other Nintendo games. It is also possible to challenge a friend: by synchronizing a second pad you can choose between classic and flash mode (whoever eliminates all the flashing viruses wins), and with the split screen you start the versus game. Also via the Wi-Fi Connection, you can also send an invitation to a friend to download the game demo, and then challenge him online even before he buys the game. The novelty that ennobles the game as WiiWare Germ Buster is a nice Dr.Mario diversion, specially designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the Nintendo Wii remote control. The substance of the game remains unchanged: destroy viruses by aligning pills of the same color. Rather, it is the control system that changes: no longer the classic directional cross with the keys, but directly hooking the elements on the screen with a mobile cursor and dragging them to the point where we want to insert them. The design of the game changes slightly: the classic transparent bottle can now be seen more closely, and so are the elements it contains. The ~zoom~ was necessary to allow better handling of remote control, which otherwise would have been more complicated with the small bitmaps of the original game. Germ Buster is a nice Dr.Mario diversion, specially designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the Nintendo Wii remote control The novelty that ennobles the game as WiiWare Once the game options have been set, the same as for Dr. Mario, the action starts and the news immediately catches the eye: a mobile cursor starts from the lower part of the screen and follows our movements, and on which apex there is a viewfinder that ~hooks~ the pill. To take them, just select them and hold down A or B, after which we can move them wherever we want, releasing them together with the key. To make them rotate, the same buttons are used, but giving them a sharp tap. Germ Buster, as well as Dr.Mario, is drawn with a very simple, cheerful and very colorful graphic design (even if from a rather limited palette), with some three-dimensional elements added in the margins. Unlike the original game, however, there are no online modes and leaderboards here. Dr. Mario, as well as its Germ Buster variant, is still very fun and playable today, both for its purely arcade nature and for the simple but challenging game mechanics at the same time.", "date": "2008-06-04", "grade": null}
