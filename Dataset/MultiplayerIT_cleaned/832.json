{"name": "Recensione Delta Force Black Hawk Down", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-delta-force-black-hawk-down.html", "text": "Leave no man behind Two years later, therefore, the landing on personal computers, the Novalogic title arrives on our consoles, a mix between tactics and pure action with the possibility of being played by 50 users simultaneously on Xbox and up to 32 on PlayStation 2. The game is really set in Mogadishu of that period with all the tensions, the dead and the guerrilla warfare. Initially we will have to choose a profile that will accompany us in both the single player and multiplayer campaign. We will then choose a class among the four available: sniper, medical gunner and CQB, that is a soldier specialized in close combat in the city. Each class obviously has its own peculiarities and winning characteristics, but unfortunately in the 16 missions that characterize the Campaign we will have almost no incentive to use the specializations of the various classes. For example, the sniper, obviously able to strike from afar, in a city environment like that of the Somali capital will very often find himself having to fight like a rifleman or an assaulter, almost hand-to-hand. The missions will be of the most varied but with a basic constant, kill as many enemies as possible. There will be no moments of reflection or waiting, just action, lots of action. There will be no moments of reflection or waiting, just action, lots of action Leave no man behind Obviously we will have to try to stay alive and to do so we will be able to count on the help of our fellow soldiers, usually guided in a very simple but often effective way by the CPU, to whom it is still possible to give some orders both via the pad and with the xbox communicator via voice recognition, which performed well with almost all orders in our tests. The encounter with General Aidid's guerrillas will always be traumatic, and in order to be able to face the various ~hordes~ we will have to make the most of the collaboration with our teammates, and thus oppose the organization and tactics to the superior number of rebels . A variant of the city missions is given by the levels aboard the war helicopters, in which armed with fixed machine guns we will have to shoot at everything that moves, fun but only up to a certain point, also because the ammunition is unfortunately virtually infinite, resulting thus penalized to the maximum the realistic component of the Novalogic stock. From a purely technical point of view, the title clearly shows the signs of the path taken to get to our consoles. The environments are particularly vast but the textures have undergone a drastic downgrade, especially in the PlayStation 2 version, and certainly make the whole setting lose its realism. The virtual world responds only in a predefined way to what we do on the battlefield, to give an example it is enough to say that by shooting from the helicopter only some things will explode, while the walls of the houses and the ground will not be touched in the least by our shots. The buildings for the rest are a bit too squared and not very similar to reality, we would almost say ~scholastic~ in their construction. As for the Xbox version, the game still supports 480p resolution for those who have a television capable of exploiting it, and the visual improvement given by the higher resolution is fully perceived. Multiplayer is the juiciest part of Delta Force Black Hawk Down, in fact games of up to fifty players are hosted on the Novalogic servers for the Xbox version and thirty-two for the PlayStation 2 version Multiplayer is certainly the juiciest part of Delta Force Black Hawk Down, in fact the Novalogic servers host games of up to fifty, I say fifty, players for the Xbox version and thirty-two for the PlayStation 2 version. Individually, however, each of us will be able to create match up to thirty-two participants. The modes available are the classic ones: deathmatch and team deathmatch, team king of the hill, search and destroy, attack and defense and capture the flag. The connection during our tests performed well especially with Novalogic servers, however a clear system of icons indicates which of the available servers have the best bandwidth speed. The tastiest part of the Black Hawk Down online is certainly the fact that the use of tactics for the purpose of victory is taken into account, a nice incentive that makes the title deviate a bit from the frenetic shoot-and-shoot that is the Solo campaign. Too bad for the vehicles which, unfortunately, are not present in the game, and when they are, exclusively in the larger maps, they behave like large buses with a set route and what's more they are also indestructible. Good news for those who don't have an ADSL connection, in fact the developers didn't dforget about the possibility of playing via split screen up to four players in both cooperation mode and versus mode. Comment Delta Force: Black Hawk Down is a title that leaves us somewhat dumbfounded, it certainly suffered from the transition from the PC world, in which it appeared as a precision shooter, to the console world, in which it was instead reincarnated into a frenetic shooter. The graphics sector has also been affected, which unfortunately has been significantly reworked. The only real positive note is given by the possibility of online multiplayer matches, matches that are particularly satisfying even if much closer to a Rainbow Six than a Ghost Recon. Concluding our analysis, the Novalogic title fails to establish itself among the countless fps that populate the Xbox world, perhaps as regards the Sony home console there is some more hope, but certainly we must come down to a really strong compromise regarding the graphic section of the game. Pros Multiplayer online and offline Fair single campaign Cons Technically to be reviewed Do not exploit the various classes properly In 1993, American soldiers belonging to the Rangers and the special Delta teams of the army were sent to Somalia, in order to carry out some strategic missions to try to restore peace. The most important of these was to capture or kill General Mohammed Farrah Aidid leader of the Somali militia. In one of the missions aimed at capturing the general, two Black Hawk war helicopters were shot down and eighteen American soldiers lost their lives. The whole situation has been accurately described in a book and in the beautiful film by Ridley Scott, Black Hawk Down, which was followed by a good video game which appeared in 2003 on personal computers and which now lands on Xbox and PlayStation 2.", "date": "2005-09-29", "grade": null}
