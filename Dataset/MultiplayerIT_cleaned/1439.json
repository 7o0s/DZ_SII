{"name": "Pirates of the Caribbean", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pirates-of-the-caribbean.html", "text": "A forgetful captain ~It was a dark and stormy night...~ ah no sorry that's another story, let's simply say that, it had been, a dark and stormy night, of which we survived but stunned, the one that will be scanned, through the report introduced to us during the early game tutorial, by one of our most loyal sailors. A much more than welcome tutorial, given that the manual certainly doesn't help us, being in fact very meager and unclear, not to mention the language (and not only) inconsistencies present in it (in fact, I remember that the manual is in Italian, but the game is completely in English). The way in which this tutorial is carried out is partially perplexing, given that our poor captain, Nathaniel Hawk, in addition to having to be reminded of the planned plans for the day, does not seem to even remember where he left his personal items, i.e. in the trunk located punctually beside his bed, and his sword, promptly deposited before his still somewhat sleepy eyes. Yet the most traumatizing part was just collecting these objects, given that Pirates Of The Caribbean adopts one of the most uncomfortable control systems I've ever had to deal with, where to interact with the surrounding world the keys to be used will vary according to non-standard canons. properly rational and obvious, between the space bar, enter and F3 (paradoxically even worse than what we saw with Gothic). Continuing with the tutorial, our sailor friend will kindly invite us to hold his accelerated saber course, since he would not like to see us skewered before time. And so once the first combat session is completed, we will be able to sadly realize how we can continue to repeat the training sequence several times, continuing to gain experience until the next level increase, thus finding ourselves, with a greater number of skill points to be assigned in addition to the initial ones, when our guide decides that the time has come to give us some tips on how to spend them. It's just a pity that he too seems to suffer from amnesia, given that once he has finished assigning the points available to us, he will stubbornly and insistently continue to repeat his precious yes, but tiring in the long run, advice on which skills should be chosen. Once we have overcome the verbal jam in which we were unfortunate, and having appealed to the precious choice of dialogue to skip forcibly to the next part of the tutorial, we will finally be able to discover that we are docked in port, where we will have to recruit other replacement sailors and repair the hull, to repair the damage caused by the storm that had hit us the previous day. Once off the ship, accompanied or not by our guide, according to our preference, we will find ourselves getting to know the main buildings in the city, such as the tavern, where we will be able to recruit the crew we need if necessary, and possibly earn even the services of some officers, available to follow us for far from modest figures, at least at the beginning of the game. There will then be a shop in which to sell the cargo of our ship, or where to buy it and then resell it elsewhere, given that trade will be one of the simplest methods for obtaining good profits in a relatively short time, based on the simple principle of cities that import and they export certain goods, as shown on the map, and thus making it very easy to carry out these tasks, finally there will be the shipyard, where we will be able to implement changes and repairs to our sailing ship, or buy a new one. Once our errands are over, it's time to start exploring... Solar, lunar and star graphics As soon as we set sail we will be introduced in one go, via an animated sequence, in the middle of the actual story, and we will soon find ourselves having to set sail in a hurry to escape certain death. It must be admitted that the graphics immediately carry out their job much more than admirably, when between the roar of the cannons that open fire against us, we are surrounded by the splashes of water caused by enemy projectiles crashing on the sea a few centimeters from the hull, to then notice how the following ones tore the sails of our boat, which barely manages to take off, leaving the wake of its passage on the sea, among stupendous effects of light, and reflections of the sun on the water .. .probably the most realistic and best-crafted game to date. Evening falls, and the moon takes its place high in the sky, the starry sky is mirroredon the surface of the water, and the show that presents itself to us would be very suggestive, if it weren't for that intrusive zoom button, pressed almost by mistake, which reluctantly shows the interior of the ship in detail, or rather, the absence total of them, and above all of our fifty and more sailors, represented by a few and haggard men who desperately wander up and down the hull like Dantesque souls in pain (and in the manual he speaks of a crew that realistically reproduces the sailors' duties). I quickly restore the previous view and try to drive out of my mind what my eyes had witnessed, after all I'm a captain, and I have much more to think about and dreams of glory to aspire to ... also I have to be tolerant, not I haven't even paid my sailors yet, it was natural that they weren't very motivated to get busy on board... but while the serious hypothesis of a possible mutiny (which in the game corresponds to the premature end of the game) finally I see the coast in the distance... and it seems somehow familiar... As soon as I go ashore I realize how much more than familiar it is, given that the city I landed in is practically the same one I had abandoned. Solar, lunar and star graphics Initially the different architectural style could be misleading, but the reality is quite different, and it reveals to me how cities are almost always predefined and summarized in a simple scheme of this type: the more or less similar classic port, a wild area approximately the same size as that of the other cities and with possible poachers, which can in any case be ~cancelled~ by leaving the area and subsequently re-entering it or vice versa (certainly not the maximum of realism, probably one of the effects of luck, present among the choices of ability of the character that we can increase, and which evidently can be easily manipulated), a beach area where the ship can be moored nearby to avoid having to dock in the port (in case for some reason we need to remain hidden from prying eyes) , and the city itself, made up, with few exceptions, of houses that are totally identical to each other, both internally and externally (they really seem made with copy and paste, probably to save resources), and above all the usual services, also identical between them, with the same recycled models for the various shopkeepers and tavern keepers. However, the thing that leaves us baffled is the so-called invisible wall that blocks the explorable play area, also assisted by the absence, and we are in 2003, of the possibility of allowing our poor and crippled character to be able to lift himself into the air by sketching something that remember a jump. Well yes, often the outdoor areas are deliberately designed to create a sort of difference in height, which makes it impossible for the player, lacking any means to climb in any way, to climb even the lowest of the montarozzi, which serves as so from an invisible wall and forces us to follow the path predefined by the developers, really frustrating, as if we were caged. But already that we have talked about the models, we also specify that they are reduced to about ten, repeated for all the inhabitants of the various cities, it must be said that they are also poorly rendered, above all in the animations which appear to be cumbersome and unnatural, if not too evanescent in the case of the protagonist. The music is initially catchy, but in the long run it tends to become anonymous, nothing to do with the musical tones of a Morrowind, Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate. Same thing for the sound effects that do their job, but nothing more. Fencing masters As explained above, on some occasions, both on land, in the form of thieves and brigands, and during an assault on a ship, we will be able to draw the sword and fight. Unfortunately, however, the combat system is also poor, leaving room only for monotony and repetitiveness after a few attempts, as these are simply reduced to parrying the enemy blow, quickly launching a counterattack, to parry again, and so on, without no sequence of offensive movements or any type of aimed strike. There is a key to dodge back blows of course, just a pity that due to the narrowness of the environments in which we will find ourselves fighting, we will often end up finding ourselves with our backs against the wall, or when we suddenly realize that the bad camera system , not compliantigurable, not being able to retreat further it will dramatically enlarge the view on our character, activating a huge circle of semi-transparency that will make it impossible for us to distinguish the enemy's blows, while in other cases it could even happen to accidentally exit from one of the access points to that area without realizing it, and then returning, to find one's opponents dissolved. The famous strafe is also totally absent (and here we are even talking about the times of Doom), or the lateral swerve, which would have allowed in those cases to escape those disadvantageous positions and above all to dodge the opponent's blows even laterally. As things stand, the fights vary from tedious to frustrating if the adversaries are clearly superior in numbers, which is practically always, even if with one or more officers in your service, who will also follow us on land, just hold down the button parade all the time until our subordinates have extinguished the enemy threat, or vice versa brashly attack each enemy while they are busy attacking the officers. It is also possible to use a pistol, initially single-shot, with the possibility of buying or appropriating better models later on, but even in this case it will be enough to simply press the button to fire, aiming and reloading are automatic, and in any case it can only be used at a very short distance, making it practically almost useless, except in the very few cases of combat against a single opponent. In this way the player's skill becomes practically irrelevant for the result, also partly due to the AI of the enemies who limit themselves to walking towards us similar to zombies, and attacking us relentlessly, never trying to parry our strike or retreat, but adopting a kamikaze style, i.e. attacking incessantly until death, without taking into account the obvious problems in pathfinding both of our allies and enemies, who tend to get stuck at the first obstacle Naval vicissitudes The navigation periods are better than those on land, but still end up being disappointing at times. Initially fine-tuning your ship, upgrading the cannons, selecting the type of ammunition to be used according to our guerrilla strategy, and all the necessary preparations, turn out to be interesting, but at the first encounter you realize how the maneuverability of the ship is almost totally arcade, although there is an option to make it more realistic, which is still not entirely satisfactory. The difficulty is mainly given by the very awkward interface, which forces us to use the keyboard to perform all the ship's functions, and at the same time the mouse to vary the view, not to mention that without making changes to the controls, the system adopted on land would rely mainly on the mouse, making it easy to get confused, gun aiming is automatic, and while we will basically dictate the direction from which to fire by moving the ship, we have no credit for the accuracy of the guns, or lack thereof, at the time to open fire, if not changing view, and choosing to aim in first person, an unintuitive system that makes us lose control of the situation. Sinking the enemy ship then almost always turns out to be the worst choice, as we often end up receiving damage, and losing experience and the ship, with loot attached, which we would have conquered if we had decided to take it by storm. The map allows us to quickly move our ship to scale, thus guaranteeing us greater visibility of the whole, just a pity that it is awkward to control, and that we can easily come across storms and enemy ships, pirates or other states, which they will prove to be difficult to avoid, as they will appear suddenly. If then, as happens especially at the beginning, we had not managed to avoid a collision with an enemy ship, we will not be able to re-access the map until we have managed to take possession of it, sink it, or escape from its view, which is extremely long and difficult even accelerating the passage of time using the appropriate key. Not to mention when we will be able to secure an allied ship, which can be given to us for a special mission or because we have conquered it, and the idea would seem excellent, if it weren't for the command menu relating precisely to the orders that we can give these allied ships, which not only turn out not to match those report", "date": "2003-12-23", "grade": null}
