Wallace and Gromit are in fact as we left them on the big screen: the first intent on designing machines that should make everyday life easier - and which instead turn it into a chain of troubles - and Gromit on the contrary patient, silent and ready to fix it against Wallace with frowning pity. Cheese is also involved in all of this. How, you'll find out during the first episode, but with Wallace, on the other hand, cheese always has something to do with it. As befits an adventure that winks at short films, let's start immediately from the heart of the problem; just the time to serve breakfast to Wallace to understand the commands and we are ready. From then on, events precipitate, forcing the duo to produce honey on an industrial scale. Unfortunately for them, they will have to do it by evening, or the damage that Wallace's mechanical mouse has caused in Paneer's shop will invariably be contested. It is here that, unfortunately, the paths of the two protagonists divide. Walking with WASD Wallace and Gromit work well as a couple, but taken individually they lose the ability to give life to the comedy made up of looks and gestures that has distinguished them on the big screen. For technical reasons, since this is a point-and-click adventure, we'll have to take control of it at different times during the game. Gromit is definitely the more fun to follow of the two. His expressions are priceless and he doesn't wear out with Wallace's endless speech. Tellate has decided for a cinematic cut of the narrative that does not allow you to choose questions and answers during the dialogues, but which enhances the unsettling humor of the duo, especially when Wallace takes over the reins of the situation. From this point of view, an acceptable compromise has been reached. Instead, it is the controls that cause perplexity. The characters move only with the keys, while for the selection of the objects you can choose between the keyboard and the mouse. We are thus faced with different combinations, except the most sensible and desirable, and that is the complete control via mouse. Also because several times it happened that we didn't quite understand in which direction we were proceeding, waiting for the game screen to provide us with a better perspective - especially in the garden outside the house. Whether such inattention is due to haste, or to the involvement of a console in the production of the series, we don't know for sure, but the impression of neglect remains. Added to this is also a curious fact, because it doesn't often happen that you have to struggle to understand how to save a game. Suffice it to say that the ~Save~ item is instead ~Your game~. Episodic release Fright of the Bumblebees is the first in a series of four episodes dedicated to Wallace & Gromit and developed by Telltale. The software house has undertaken to release them on a monthly basis and Multiplayer.it will follow them promptly with a complete review. s-e-m-b-r-a q-u-a-s-i s-t-o-p m-o-t-i-o-n After the beatings, here comes the candy. Wallace and Gromit is a classic adventure, with the interface simplified as much as possible: just think that it is not possible to combine inventory items. Despite this, the puzzles follow one another with logic and common sense, in an exciting crescendo that doesn't skimp on memorable moments. The gag with the newsagent, who we have to help compose an offense suitable for her grumpy husband, choosing verbs and nouns from the headlines of the newspapers, is one of the pearls of ingenuity present in this adventure. At the end there is also a mini-game that integrates small action sequences with coordinated puzzles, rushing towards an ending that sees the protagonists - and us with them - involved in a daring escape. There are dozens of titles that we would have liked to conclude so worthily. And it didn't end there. The British accent of the voice actors is essential to fully enjoy the series, but without even the Italian subtitles, many users would have been left out. On this point, Telltale takes the plunge: Wallce & Gromit comes already equipped with subtitles in four languages, including Italian. Other than that, the theme music is perfect, even if the audio-voice mix of the version we tested left a lot to be desired. On the contrary, the animations are impeccable, as are the character models, on which the effect of plasticine, used to create cinematic ones, intended to be animated with stop-motion, has been reproduced very well. It's a pity only for the defects we have mentioned, which leave a sense of peripheral sloppiness, as if someone had closed everything in the box.a few days ahead of schedule. Comment We had a lot of fun with this first episode and we are sure that others among you will share the same experience. The jokes are fresh, the puzzles engaging and the whole adventure flows away in a flash, thanks also to the charisma of Wallace and Gromit and the cast that accompanies them. Technically we are also above the standards on which most graphic adventures rest. Only a pebble in the shoe pricked us all the time: it must have been the unrefined control system, the logicless saving procedure or the audio mixed really badly at times, but a sense of neglect remained to tarnish the experience by and large. Let's give Telltale credit though; there are still three episodes left before the curtain falls.Pro Wallace and Gromit were beautifully rendered Fun puzzles Subtitled in Italian Brilliant to the end Against Wallace and Gromit spend too much time apart Inelegant controls Logical save system PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Operating System: Windows XP / Vista (Vista 64 not supported) Processor: 2.0GHz RAM: 512MB Video Card: 64 MB DirectX 8.1 compatible DirectX: Version 9.0c or higher Sound card: DirectX 8.1 compatible Recommended Requirements Processor 3.0 GHz or higher RAM: 1GB Video Card: 128 MB DirectX 8.1 compatible Test configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 RAM: 2GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GT Operating system: Windows Vista", "date": "2009-04-03", "grade": null}
