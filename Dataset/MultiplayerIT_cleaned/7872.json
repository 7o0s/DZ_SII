History seems to repeat itself with the Fish Out of Water present here, which takes up certainly not new concepts and places them in a more social gaming-oriented context: this time, however, not all things seem to have gone the right way. Neither meat nor fish As per the best Halfbrick tradition, Fish Out of Water presents a concept that can be assimilated in a very few moments, so much so that the tutorial is limited to a couple of text screens. The aim of the game is to obtain the best possible score from a jury of crabs who express their evaluation on a scale of one to ten by showing a card, as in rhythmic gymnastics competitions. And the object of attention of the crustaceans above is none other than the user's ability to throw fish as far as possible, accumulating meters and number of bounces over three distinct sessions. The procedure is very simple: you select one of the six creatures splashing around in the water that makes up the main screen, and by holding your finger down on the touchscreen, you draw a line that defines the trajectory of the launch. From here on you just have to observe the progressive exhaustion of the inertial motion of the fish, which can be prolonged by emptying the appropriate turbo bar, which can be activated by pressing on the screen and which can be partially restored by collecting the yellow orbs scattered randomly along path. A few games are enough to realize that it is luck that is the most incisive referee of Fish Out of Water, even if Halfbrick certainly did not spare itself in elements with an evident strategic component. To begin with, the six protagonists all have different characteristics, ranging from the dolphin that leaps in and out of the water to the puffer fish that bounces on the waves, to be exploited according to your style of play and the results of previous launches: each in fact, the creature has a different balance between the distance it is capable of traveling and the average number of jumps it can guarantee. Furthermore, we must take into account the weather conditions and the direction and strength of the wind, all elements that can alternatively favor or worsen the results of a launch. As we said, however, in the end it is more a question of luck, which certainly does not facilitate the longevity factor of a title already penalized by a very slender play structure. The simple aim of aiming for the maximum score is not adequately supported by convincing side elements: of course, there are objectives to be met that allow you to level up and earn pieces of crystals with which to build amulets that give certain benefits during a cast but it's a small thing. Paradoxically, if on the first try a user gets a perfect 10, his experience with Fish Out of Water could easily be considered over, given that the only further incentive is represented by the possibility of joining a league of users, comparing the own exploits with those of others or aiming for the top of the world rankings determined by adding up all the scores of the members of a group. In short, it almost seems that Halfbrick has limited itself to the homework this time, without wasting too much in the production of content nor even pressing on the accelerator of the technical realization, given that in this respect Fish Out of Water is a pleasant title to see and nothing more.", "date": "2013-04-26", "grade": "6.6"}
