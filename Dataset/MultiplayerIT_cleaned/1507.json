{"name": "TRON 2.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tron-20.html", "text": "TRON 2.0. Well, here we go: Tron 2.0 is finally real. Let's briefly mention the story, so as to give a first smattering but without taking too much away from the pleasure of discovering it from time to time on our own. Remember Alan Bradley? No? Well, actually bad: Alan was the inventor of the Tron program, which twenty years ago helped the courageous Kevin Flynn, trapped in digital reality, to defeat the evil MCP program. Today, Alan Bradley has perfected the technique for digitizing a person inside a computer, creating Ma3A (it reads Matra but mysteriously in the Italian version it has become Ma-tre-a), a prodigious artificial intelligence capable of memorizing the entire fingerprint a man's genetics, transfer his mind into a virtual avatar and then bring him back to the real world. Naturally, like any other sensational discovery, it ends up tickling the throat of a sinister corporation with shady intentions: Future Control Industries (fCon), which is preparing for an unlegal takeover of Alan Bradley's company. The story takes on more dramatic implications with the mysterious disappearance of the scientist, creator of Ma3a, and it is at this juncture that Jet Bradley, his somewhat reckless and genius son, decides to investigate the matter. At this point, of course, the only thing that could happen was Digitized! The digitized world of Tron 2.0 is not very dissimilar from that of the original film, even if the inevitable graphic updates have been added because otherwise it would have been too bare for us demanding players of the new millennium. The scenarios all look like big lysergic neon nightmares, immense fluorescent deliriums suspended in thin air, but you can be sure that the graphic quality is not penalized at all. The effects are worthy of the latest generation video cards and overall the result is very accurate and exciting. Jet Bradley is ~swallowed~ into the digital world and begins his adventurous journey towards the discovery of the truth, but first he will have to meet virtually real characters who are none other than those entities that we all know well, in our boundless electroludic passion. Then we will meet (now we have identified ourselves with the protagonist of the story) ~known faces~ such as Anti Intrusion Programs (PAI - like chips) who are a kind of binary policemen, we will get to know none other than the Kernel itself... sorry in code and strings, we will face corrupted programs, viruses, digitized hackers (DataSpettri) and other more or less shady characters, in their fluorescent outfits. In short, we will find ourselves face to face with the ~alive~ version of those things we deal with almost every day, some of which will be very bad and others will prove to be friendly or, in any case, not hostile. Digitized! The plot, in fact, does not differ much from what we would have expected and will develop before our eyes both through the many filmed sequences and by collecting clues and advancing in the game. Our task will become to discover the hidden presence of which the corrupt programs are the emissaries and, at the same time, to protect Ma3a, which will be in grave danger. Indeed, in Ma3a we will find a very precious ally (also because it was she who sucked us into her world!) and during our wanderings we will also meet new friends, first of all that great funny guy Byte, the enhanced version of that Bit who had helped Flynn twenty years earlier. The graphics engine is the usual, highly decorated, LithTech Engine, in its new, shiny, incarnation, the Triton System, and it does its job perfectly, just like the Jupiter had done with NOLF2. Oh... of course we're talking about an FPS, so a first person shooter and so the heart of the whole game is focused on action and exploration, it's certainly not a game of mahjong we're talking about! Returning to Jet Bradley, we can reassure ourselves about his/our state of health because to protect him there will be not only the Ma3a entity, not only possible and assorted companies, but above all a considerable quantity of weapons, which however this time we will find in a more strange form , almost evanescent. Here, then, that we will finally be able to give some healthy satisfaction to the most combative part of our... EGO: E-GO! Our virtual self will certainly not be any naive little program, but a complete and perfectly thinking person, apart from the small detail that is made of bytes instead of flesh and blood. And so also the objects with which it will be able to interact will beThey can be disassembled into binary arrays and equally reassembled according to different shapes and colours. The weapons are nothing more than programs capable of creating the binary equivalents of rifles, cannons, cannons, hand grenades, tric-tracs, stinky vials and atomic corkscrews out of nothing, but without a doubt the most charismatic weapon of the film and of all the game is the puck, which will be one of our most precious allies during the fights. There are no ammunition in the world of Tron, but there is a single reserve of energy, with which every program is equipped, and which runs out as certain operations are performed, including the use of weapons. Not only do weapons have a cost in terms of energy, but also performing certain actions, such as downloading a program from the system to update our alter-ego, will serve to further shorten our energy bar, so we are faced with a first change, not too radical, in the gameplay: now fights and exploration draw on the same common resource and we will no longer be able to separate the two. A dilemma that will force us to balance our intentions well in the future, even if not too radically. In any case, there are filling stations around, both for health and for energy. EGO: E-GO! Fortunately, then, the disk comes to meet us, which we will be able to use freely without paying the cost in terms of energy. But let's see better how the game system works and in particular the management of points, because if you haven't figured it out yet, there are points in the game, points that we can accumulate in various ways. They're called build points, and they're the simplified equivalent of RPG experience points. In Tron 2.0 a player growth system borrowed directly from the one already seen in NOLF2 was used therefore, by carrying out various activities and completing certain tasks, we will be assigned these points which will indicate a real upgrade of our virtual self. Other times, however, we will find them around in containers, called build notes, ready to be collected. Of the latter there are 100 in all. As soon as we enter the digital world, which is none other than the computer network of the company where Alan Bradley works, Jet will be identified as Jet v1.0.0 and as we conquer these points, we will see our version number increase, as if we were recompiled from time to time. Every hundred points will increase the first digit and then we will be able to increase our characteristics by spending a certain amount of... credits? In short, whatever it is, we will be able to distribute points to our characteristics, which are more or less always the same: health, energy, efficiency of weapons, etc. Indeed, the possibility of updating our alter ego gives that extra touch of class that manages to make the game stand out from the crowd. Seeing that little number up there increase, from time to time, gives a nice feeling of growth, of expressing one's potential, especially when we then go on to put our hands on the characteristics as we like. But in addition to collecting points, we will find ourselves collecting much more substantial utilities, through which we can obtain effective benefits, therefore we will find from the more traditional armor up to subroutines capable of increasing the damage inflicted with our weapons, up to antivirus, various upgrades and etc. But the weapons themselves are actually real subroutines, so forget about picking up everything you meet on the way, forget about carrying an entire arsenal with you, like in Schwartzenegger's films, because Jet will only be able to take charge of those weapons that will fit into its free memory blocks! EGO: E-GO! The first few times, the personal management screen will be a bit cumbersome to understand, above all because we will not only limit ourselves to allocating points and moving subroutines, but we will also have to proceed with subsequent optimization operations: to ensure that the low-level routines are updated, to defragment the free space in memory (yes, we will use DEFRAG!), to disinfect and recover infected or corrupted procedures, but above all to decide what to keep in memory and what not, given that the space available (at least initially) it will not be enough to contain all the improvements that we will find. At this point, then, we must recognize that we are dealing with a title that goes beyond the usual shoot-and-shoot without too much brains and offers an above-average level of depth. And this thing can only do him credit, especially given that, in the end, it is always a first-person shootera, but less ~ignorant~ than many others. And now that we have extensively presented our binary alter ego, let's put the chatter aside and move directly to Seeing with closed eyes. Digitized in the network, Jet will be able to see what his eyes would never have allowed him before and what he will find will go far beyond any of his most daring imaginations. Let's put on his shoes, then, and try to look from behind his virtual pupils... As already mentioned, the graphics engine used is the famous LithTech Engine, now in its latest incarnation: the Triton Engine. It is a software capable of supporting the effects contained in DirectX 8.1, including the infamous shaders, cross and delight of every player with a not too old video card, and the ubiquitous bump and environmental mapping. Whether they are really present in the game is not known for sure, but certainly the mapping effects are convincing and very beautiful to see. But, beyond the purely technical side, overall all the work done by the Monolith designers is of excellent workmanship and the scenarios offer highly original ideas for reproducing the classic solutions of this kind of game in a 'digitized' key. The fluorescent lines, the flashes and the considerable amount of luminescence have been exploited in a wise and elegant way to highlight the main architectural directions and delimit buildings and constructions, but without ever falling into the tacky or being tempted by the 'wireframe' effect, which would been too trivial. Sure, the ~energetic~ design hardly hides the essentiality of the textures, which are neither ultra-detailed nor particularly elaborate, but the final result is what counts and it's certainly a great look, both for the number of polygons and for the level of detail present. The world of Tron is a big luminous circus, a grotesque but fascinating amusement park, a rollercoaster made of neon images, procedures and binary dreams. Seeing with closed eyes. We will not find the type of texture we have been used to so far, no reference to reality but only similarities. Instead, we will find a world made of data and lack of data, buildings are structures that contain procedures, algorithms, archives and programs, corridors are information flow lines and, if we look up, we will not find a sky that bursting with stars, but a space of data stacked, suspended or transported in great columns of light. The world where Jethro Bradley was sucked in is a world where you can let your gaze wander and feel enraptured by an alien but at the same time familiar beauty, it is not a place to watch a sunset with your girlfriend, but it certainly has an equally disruptive force and able to stun the senses. It is for this, then, that we must recognize the skill of the developers, because it is not easy to create a lively and suggestive world, with credible and never monotonous scenarios, using only small neon bricks. The characters are very well characterized and the polygons distributed carefully, favoring the faces, while the lines of the body are angular for script requirements. The animations are fluid and very convincing, with a gesture, especially in the cutscenes, that borders on cinematic quality. And if watching Jet argue animatedly with Mercury is a feast for the eyes, even better is the spectacle offered by the faces and facial movements. Already in NOLF2 the models were well animated and had very characteristic and convincing expressions, here the result is even better, above all by virtue of the greater number of polygons used in the faces. In short, making Tron 2.0 was certainly a challenge, above all because it is difficult to create such a world without making it boring and monotonous and carefully avoiding the repetition of scenarios that are always the same, but the Monoliths succeeded and ventured into the binary universe of Jet Bradley it is certainly a new and rewarding experience. And if Tron 2.0 is beautiful to see, it is also beautiful to listen to, thanks above all to the splendid music that will accompany us in every moment of the adventure, capable of increasing our already great wonder, while the sound effects are placed halfway between good realization and the masterpiece. But let's change the subject, now, because the time has come to ask ourselves: REBOOT UNIVERSE (Y/N)? Let's talk about serious things, let's talk about gameplay and to do that let's start right away with the baddest part: the weapons!
