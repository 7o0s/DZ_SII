{"name": "The Witcher - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-witcher-recensione.html", "text": "For years now, the Christmas market has seen the early release of the best games in the period from September to November, with paradoxically few titles released during the last month of the year, during which software houses prefer to reap the benefits of their own efforts rather than firing their own cartridges, therefore anticipated with respect to the past. Even the platforms, indirectly or otherwise, are battling it out to try to keep their aficionados as close as possible to their increasingly exclusive shots: if Xbox 360 users are forced to wait a month for the release of Mass Effect, in better conditions are the PC ones, whose potential killer application is arriving in stores in these days, that is to say the long-awaited and desired The Witcher that paradoxically risks generating around itself; too much hype, with all that for better or for worse it can ensue. The literary origins of this title have been widely discussed during the opportunities we have had in recent months to taste small portions of the game: those who stick to the point should know that The Witcher is nothing more than a series of books written by a Polish author, Andrzej Sapkowski, and translated practically throughout Europe, except almost only our country, where therefore Geralt, the protagonist of the story, arrives in the role of a perfect stranger. RPG, hack'n'slash or adventure? To a superficial observer The Witcher might seem like one of the classic RPGs with beat-complete quest-beat style game mechanics, which the title developed by CDProjekt is not: to make sure that the player keeps the attention even in moments where which typically lacks concentration, the Polish team has well thought of introducing a combo system into the fights, thanks to which it is possible to obtain moves that are as spectacular as they are harmful to the enemies, depriving them of the possibility of effectively facing the Geralt attacks. The animations, available in large quantities, are activated by pressing the left mouse button at the right moment, i.e. when the cursor on the screen turns yellow. To complete the picture of hand-to-hand combat there are finishing moves, with which the player can obviously finish off the opponent; but the melee battles in The Witcher are also made up of something else: there is, in fact, a differentiation between iron and silver swords, to be used depending on the enemy you are facing (typically, for example, a vampire will be faced with the silver weapon) and this diversity also affects the system of talents, which we will discuss later. The fighting styles introduced by CDProjekt are particularly useful during the game to allow the player to face all situations: by quickly pressing a button it is possible to activate one of the 3 available modes, namely strong, rapid and group, to face powerful enemies, agile respectively and resolve melees against multiple opponents. Signs, potions and talents From good genetically modified organisms, the Witchers are able to use magic to their liking, manipulated what within the game are called signs, within which we find Aard (a telekinetic power capable of throwing enemies to the ground and breaking barriers), Quen (protection barrier), Yrden (a kind of ~magic trap~), Igni (use of fire) and Axii, a kind of force manipulation used by Jedi Knights in Star Wars to persuade other people. Given that no Witcher is born with infused science, least of all Geralt who finds himself without a shred of memory, the signs will have to be learned and enhanced as you progress within the game, using the Places of Power that you will encounter gradually and using your talents wisely. The time has therefore come to analyze the character growth system within the game, developed through a total of 10 levels and the use of 3 types of bonus points to be spent within the skill tree , namely bronze, silver and gold. Initially we only have the first ones available, to then have the possibility of using the others as we progress within the adventure: through a system that closely resembles the one seen in World of WarCraft we will basically have points to spend in the trees relating both to Geralt's attributes (strength, dexterity, vigor and intelligence), and to the enhancement of the learned signs and to his ability in combat with the 2 types of sword. All this translates into a greater immediacy compared to the classic distribution of points between various attributes, while at the same time leaving the player fulldecision-making space on the orientation to be given to the character. As in any self-respecting RPG, also in this case the use of magic is not free, as it affects one of the 3 bars on the screen and related, in addition to the resistance, also to the vitality and the degree of toxicity present in the body of the Witcher: if there is practically nothing to say about vitality as you can easily imagine what it is, the level of poisoning is instead worthy of attention, as its growth is determined by the amount of use who makes potions, which therefore on the one hand constitute a very valid ally to obtain particular bonuses such as the accelerated regeneration of vitality and resistance, but on the other hand they must be used with extreme caution as they could cause the opposite effect in Geralt. If desired, it is also possible to create your own potions by collecting alchemical recipes and collecting ingredients around the world, both on defeated enemies and by taking herbs, of which, however, it is necessary to know the characteristics thanks to the books obtainable during the course of the game. Decisions and consequences One of the slogans that accompanies the promotion of The Witcher is ~there are no good and evil, only decisions and consequences~, a phrase repeatedly taken up by the developers to highlight what is the main feature of the game's plot: during of the adventure Geralt finds himself having to make various choices, of various nature and importance, aimed at changing the course of events even after hours of play, which total according to CDProjekt amounts to more than 80 hours with a high level of replayability thanks to the feature just mentioned, together with the possibility of specializing the character in a different way through a different use of talents. But the decisions don't only concern the ~serious~ events of the game: one of the various minigames, probably the nicest and undoubtedly the hottest, consists in being able to take the kind damsels you meet on the street to bed (always beautiful and buxom we must say, blessed Geralt!) thus collecting a series of cards depicting the conquered ~prey~, and it will largely be up to the player to be able to obtain the favors of women by making the right choices. Since we have introduced the subject of minigames, it is worth dwelling for a moment on the remaining ~games within the game~ present within The Witcher: in addition to poker with dice, having in fact all the rules of the popular card game but with the difference that in the fantasy world in which we find ourselves it is practiced with dice. Another delicious mini-game is the drinking contest, thanks to which Geralt can also manage to make the others reveal valuable information that cannot be obtained otherwise: the reverse of the medal consists of a malus that we will find on us when we have raised too much elbow, combined with an annoying effect composed of a blurring of the shot, accentuated in proportion to Geralt's drunkenness, which will proceed even staggering. The last minigame that we find within The Witcher is bare-handed combat: swords and signs cutlery, Geralt will find himself supporting a healthy fistfight with the challenger on duty, with whom he can bet to get money, precious or other objects still important to the main story. Download the patch! The habit of releasing fixes immediately - if not simultaneously as in this case - with respect to the release of the game does not spare even The Witcher, whose first patch was released yesterday, October 25th, thus anticipating it; the arrival on the market. The download is therefore a must to enjoy the best gaming experience possible. All perfect? Judging from what has been said so far, the answer to the title of this paragraph is undoubtedly yes, but unfortunately the technical sector brings us back a little down to earth, for which the discussion is slightly different: if from one on the one hand we have in fact a graphic level that we can without hesitation define as excellent even without counting on the notorious DirectX 10, on the other there are some smudges that affect the usability of the game, on some occasions even in what should be the strengths of The Witcher. For example, in the options it is possible to select whether to play with a third person view, closer to titles such as Oblivion or KoTOR, to use the classic isometric RPG or even a hybrid mode between the two just mentioned: well, after a few tens of minutes passed to try the 3 views available, the best one will turn out to be the isometric with movement of the character on click of the mouse, as the keyboard controls rthey appear too slow and cumbersome, especially in the presence of obstacles against which Geralt often crashes, even if they are not bulky things; a jump key would certainly have improved the situation. Even some shots, including those in the dialogues, are sometimes snookered by objects of the scenario. As far as the audio is concerned, on the one hand we have the excellence of a soundtrack that if it were from a film would probably win an Oscar, and on the other a dubbing that represents a weak point of the game, not so much in the normal dialogues, but for some flaws (such as what happens with the graphics): for example we note the absence of a slightly altered voice when Geralt finds himself tipsy after a drink.", "date": "2007-10-26", "grade": "9.0"}
