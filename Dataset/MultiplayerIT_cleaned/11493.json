{"name": "Bubble Bash!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bubble-bash.html", "text": "When a video game is a great success, imitation attempts flock. In the field of puzzle games, in particular, over the years we have witnessed the production of dozens and dozens of clones, more or less valid, which tried to ride the wave of popularity of the titles from which they were inspired. These were almost never products capable of improving the original mechanics. Bubble Bash! can easily be defined as a clone of Puzzle Bubble, after all it shares the setting and main rules with the title Taito: from a device placed in the center of the screen, at the bottom, balloons are ~shot~ which go to ~hook~ to those placed at the top of the screen. Balloons of the same color, in groups of three or more, explode. The aim, generally, is to eliminate all the balloons present in each stage, which gradually increase in number to make things more difficult. There are two game modes available: a full-bodied ~arcade mode~ and the ~crab fever mode~, the latter a sort of ~survival~ in which you have to eliminate as many balloons as possible in a given time to set records. The arcade mode sees us access ten areas of the island, each consisting of ten stages plus a boss fight. The progress of each level is not always the same: in some cases you just have to blow up all the balloons before the platform on which the characters are located reaches them in height (therefore you go up, not down as in Puzzle Bubble), in others cases it is a matter of passing skill tests of various kinds (exploding at least a certain number of balloons within a time limit, etc.). There is one important difference from the classic Taito that Bubble Bash! is inspired: in this case, the balloons are linked in groups to larger balloons, which keep them raised, therefore the stage can also be solved by simply eliminating the elements higher up, if there is the possibility. As for the boss fight, we have a different enemy each time that moves from left to right at the top of the screen. To hurt him we will first have to blow up some balloons to free the biggest balloon, which must hit the boss as it rises. Once the opponent is knocked out, we will have to hit him directly with our balloons to bring down his energy. There are different types of balloons, we will find some that explode, others that change color, etc. From their explosion different types of objects can arise, which we will collect and which in some cases will give us the possibility to customize the appearance of the characters. The technical realization of the game is really, really good. Gameloft is one of the most representative companies when it comes to mobile gaming, and in the case of Bubble Bash! proves to be able to work very well: the general design is very successful, with fairly detailed sprites and with good animation. The colors are the masters, of course, with a contrast between the lighter shades of the backdrops and the brighter ones of the balloons. We are faced with a mature work, in short, made with care. Also as regards the sound, moreover: good music accompanied by fairly well-made effects, which work well together but have the defect of generating slowdowns. PRO One hundred internships! Technically excellent Immediate and varied gameplay AGAINST It is a clone of Puzzle Bubble Sound effects produce slowdowns Pointer management could be smoother", "date": "2008-04-11", "grade": "S.V."}
