Blazkowicz after the daring events of The New Order. The American soldier had awakened, after years in a vegetative state induced by a near-fatal wound, to a world where the Nazis won World War II and control the entire planet with an iron fist, eliminating all opposition with unspeakable violence . A scenario that ~Blazko~ could not tolerate and which prompted him to get back into the game, organizing resistance together with a handful of survivors, until he hit the regime hard, in particular the cruel Dr. William ~Deathshead~ Strasse and his aberrations technological. At the end of the last episode, the protagonist had decided to sacrifice himself to blow up a Nazi headquarters, but we discover in The New Colossus that he survived, rescued by his friends at the very last moment and transported aboard the submarine that the group had managed to steal from the enemy army. Awakening after a few months due to his serious injuries, Blazkowicz finds himself once again in the midst of the roar of battle, with the difference that he can't stand up, has atrophied legs and some internal organs compromised, but he has to fight anyway. also because his partner, Anya, is about to give him children. Could he ever leave them alone in such a world? Gameplay and structure - a gem of a shooter It is the ideas that strongly characterize the experience of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, the situations that the authors set up to create memorable sequences, whether they are real action or simple cutscenes. In the very early stages of the campaign, for example, we find ourselves fighting aboard a wheelchair, with all that goes with it, while a few minutes later Blazkowicz comes into possession of the powerful Da'at Yichud armor used in The New Order by Caroline Becker and manages in this way to recover strength and mobility, as well as the ability to repel bullets and break through small doors. In the second part of the story, the situation changes further, when three devices are introduced that the protagonist can use to acquire the ability to destroy doors and barriers while running, cross narrow passages or leap and reach platforms placed at great heights. Each setup is reflected in the management of the character's health, increasing or decreasing the maximum value of vital energy and armor, while on the arsenal front there is the important novelty of the two weapons held simultaneously, this time also of different types. We will therefore be able to hold a machine gun in the right hand and a grenade launcher in the left, so as to obtain the best possible result in terms of damage and precision, also and above all against armored enemies. The latter release the usual special weapons once they are defeated, with the addition in this sequel of further out of the ordinary tools, which also depend on the choice we are asked to make at the beginning, through the expedient of a flashback, and which resumes the events of the prologue of The New Order: did we sacrifice Fergus or Wyatt? The presence of one or the other character also produces some differences in terms of narration in this case, given that the two find themselves the protagonists of specific sequences that undoubtedly push one to complete The New Colossus twice to see them all: it is certainly worth the penalty, for the interludes of Fergus and his crazy mechanical arm or for the funny descent of Wyatt into the tunnel of hallucinogenic drugs. In both cases, to surround the campaign, which lasts about twelve hours, there is also a set of extra missions that are unlocked by collecting certain codes from the bodies of Nazi captains and deciphering them with a special machine to identify the position of new officers to eliminate, returning within certain scenarios. On balance, the work done by MachineGames with the game is excellent, especially on the narrative and direction front, characterized by perfect timing and supported by an excellent dubbing in Italian, very heartfelt and convincing. Something more could have been done regarding the management of the weapons or the variety of the arsenal itself, although in any case a smaller number of rifles, however equipped with a precise personality, is preferable rather than an anonymous abundance. It was also reasonable to expect a greater effort for the bosses, whose design appears renouncing and devoid of bite compared to the previous episode of the series. ThereNintendo Switch version There is no doubt that Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a slick single player shooter, a benchmark for the genre and a product capable of demonstrating how such a tragic yet open story can be told in an intense and engaging way some concessions to brilliant, cinematic humour. But how does Wolfenstein 2 run on Nintendo Switch? The development team that took care of the porting is the same as DOOM, Panic Button, and the solutions adopted to carry out a reduction that was as close as possible to the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the title appear quite similar, to the obviously net of much less powerful components. The frame rate also in this case passes from sixty to thirty frames per second, with impeccable pacing only until the situation on the screen becomes complicated: when there are so many enemies and the battle is raging it is impossible not to notice some uncertainty and a few shots too many. The same inconvenience also occurs during certain cutscenes, and this is actually very annoying: we hope it is a problem that the team can quickly fix with a patch. The general visual rendering appears noticeably lower than the other platforms, it is clear that the surfaces have been covered with textures at a lower resolution, but there are moments in which the graphics are a bit too ~blurry~, almost as if they ran into a craziness due to dynamic resolution, which drops more than it should regardless of the computational load. You can see it well in the image we captured, below. However, all in all, these are acceptable sacrifices, if we consider that it has been possible to bring such a spectacular shooter to a portable console, without distorting it or making cuts in terms of content. In this regard, however, the proverbial donkey falls a bit, because the Switch edition of Wolfenstein II does not natively include the three single player DLCs of The Freedom Chronicles, which will be released separately, for a fee: a pity, also because not indeed, these are essential contents. Returning to portability, it undoubtedly appears as the most significant feature of this version, which also in terms of controls does things right immediately. In fact, it is possible to use the traditional commands, trying to compensate for the poor precision of the right analog stick and its excessive dead zone by moving the character with the left stick and hoping for the support of semi-automatic aiming, or activate the motion detection to be able to aim with the Gyroscope built into the Joy-Con. It is a system that fans had clamored for for DOOM, only being satisfied after a few months, and which actually turns out to be nice and functional, whether you hold the entire console or play in docked mode. aiming the weapon with the right Joy-Con like in the days of Wii shooters. The ability to adjust the sensitivity of movement allows you to use different approaches, assigning the gyroscope only the aim of precision or even the changes of direction: the right stick, in any case, continues to work.", "date": "2018-06-28", "grade": "8.4"}
