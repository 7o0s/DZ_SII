Titles of decent workmanship, but which lacked that ~something more~ to be able to aspire to an audience that went beyond that of just the avid fans of the manga created by Eiichiro Oda. The One Piece: Unlimited World Red project was therefore born to enrich and embellish the formula of the previous tie-ins, indeed following a somewhat particular process: the game was originally published only in the Nintendo 3DS version, only to then turn into a multi-platform production in conjunction with the landing in the West. The plot sees the crew of Monkey D. Luffy grappling with a new, fearsome opponent. Immediately after landing on the island of Trans Town, where the rubbery pirate makes friends with the innkeeper Yodaya, always looking for strong arms that can put the city back on track, the various Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Robin etc. are mysteriously kidnapped and must therefore be saved. The mission, however, immediately takes on very strange connotations: the places where Luffy's friends have been imprisoned are the same ones that the merry gang has visited in the past, lands controlled by formidable warriors with which we will once again have to measure ourselves. But how is it possible that some of them have come back to life? The truth lies in the fearsome power of illusion, held by Count Red and his little aide, and we will discover it in the course of an unoriginal but certainly compelling story, to which Oda himself contributed to writing. Let's go to Trans The starting island serves as a traditional hub for missions, is freely explorable (you can also climb the roofs using Luffy's powers, even if the ~narrow~ view doesn't help) and can be enriched by building meeting places and shops, the latter full of items to buy or create, such as healing potions to use in battle when our energy is almost exhausted. The possibility of building an inn or not depends not only on the money available but also and above all on the materials we have collected during the missions, an element that forces us to hit every crate, every trunk and every bush to get hold of extracts, pieces of wood and iron useful for carrying on our entrepreneurial action. The way in which this system was developed by Ganbarion appears in many ways ~old school~, in the sense that we can know the requirements for the construction or expansion of each building, but the identification of materials depends exclusively on our memory or from a note we made while visiting a particular scenario, since each location contains resources related to the context. When the expansion of Trans Town becomes an obligation, about halfway through the adventure, the fearsome specter of backtracking appears and it is necessary to return to places that have already been widely explored to collect the objects we need. Fortunately, the developers have not insisted in this direction, and have indeed managed to pack a fairly full-bodied campaign, which takes about eight hours to complete. One Piece: Unlimited World Red is a beautiful adventure, enjoyable and fun, a must for fans Arena mode Accessible from the starting screen, the Arena mode of One Piece: Unlimited World Red proves to be much more than a minor addition, proposing an alternative storyline to the campaign and catapulting us into a series of fights that can initially be tackled in two ways different: a sort of boss rush with single clashes of a certain level or a ~melee~ with multiple standard opponents. The victories multiply our score and allow us to rise in a ranking divided into three leagues, A, B and C, each with final fights that act as an ~exam~ to move on to the next category, while the roster of available characters gradually increases. enriches. In the end, the Arena constitutes an addition of weight compared to the totality of the experience, extending its duration by a couple of hours and putting on the plate a welcome variation of the traditional missions. Minigames, what a passion The developers of One Piece: Unlimited World Red have given great importance to the objects in the game, and clearly there is no shortage of rarer ones, which guarantee access to new constructions or special bonuses. To get them you have to bring a net and a fishing rod with you, then try your hand at simple minigames when we try to catcha prey, guessing the commands that are quickly displayed on the screen to successfully complete the operation. One, two and three When you leave for a mission, you have to compose your team based on the roster available at that moment, reaching a maximum of three characters. Two of them will be controlled by artificial intelligence, throwing themselves headlong into the fray during any fight and even taking some enemies out of our hands, in a way that is actually a little too aggressive, while we will control the ~captain~ by default, with however, the possibility of switching from one member of the team to another by simply pressing the Select key. Faced with a single character, the experience of One Piece: Unlimited World Red turns out to be anything but trivial and indeed quite demanding, so much so that we could even be eliminated by a gathering of standard enemies, given their tendency not to stop during a attack (not even if hit) and to surround its prey, targeting it even from a distance. Maneuvers that we will be able to respond to by pressing the Circle button at the right time, an operation that gives rise to a dodge or a counterattack, depending on whether you play the role of Luffy, Zoro, Sanji or any other member of the crew. Evasion then becomes fundamental during the boss fights, given the amount of energy that these powerful opponents manage to steal from us with each successful hit. For the rest, the combat system appears rather traditional: a combination of Square and Triangle produces the various combos available (not many, which inevitably makes the gameplay repetitive), while pressing the four main buttons together with the backbones gives life to the moves special, capable of solving a fight that was perhaps going badly. Playing with two or three characters, as mentioned above, unfortunately takes away consistency from the ~normal~ clashes, transforming them into a mere sequence of the usual attacks, but it is of great help in the confrontation with the bosses. The optimal size for this particular balance probably lies somewhere between the two approaches. Playstation 3 trophies One Piece: Unlimited World Red offers a total of 57 Trophies, obtainable by completing individual episodes and producing ~numerical~ type achievements: perform one hundred dodges with Luffy, obtain thirty objects using Robin's reading ability, eat one hundred take to the Trans Town restaurant, break three hundred boxes, and so on. Dinghy dinghy... dinghy! It must be said that the transition from Nintendo 3DS does not seem to have undermined the technical success of One Piece: Unlimited World Red in any way, given that the graphics we appreciated on PlayStation 3 are really well done; in particular as regards the cutscenes, which abound in fan service (read ~boobs~) and sometimes even manage to surprise in their spectacularity. The in-game visual quality generally tends to drop, as is normal, but the use of cel shading often gives life to solutions that are very beautiful to look at, with some undoubtedly evocative scenarios, with a watercolor-style aesthetic, which however juxtaposed with unguessed locations in their desolation. In all cases, unfortunately, the interaction is missing, which is limited to the traditional crates to break, while the exploratory element, initially promising, ends up being strongly limited by the presence of numerous obstacles and invisible walls. The realization of the protagonists is excellent as regards the design, faithful to the anime, but flaws in the fluidity of the animations, while for the opponents we have to make two separate speeches: the standard enemies are very repetitive not only in appearance but also in behavioral routines , while a good job of characterization has been done for the bosses. The fact that the graphics are supported by a sound sector that is up to the task certainly represents an advantage for fans and non-fans, considering the excellent quality of the music and the presence of the original voices in Japanese, with subtitles in Italian.", "date": "2014-06-23", "grade": "7.0"}
