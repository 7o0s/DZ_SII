The infinite planets of No Man's Sky? The epic plots of Mass Effect? Or perhaps you already dream of the adventures of Starfield to the sound of battles and customization of your hero? Well. Delete everything, because around here you have to move a ladder and - trust me - it's more interesting than it seems. Let's talk about Mars First Logistics, the Shape Shop game arriving on PC on June 22, 2023 and of which we had already proposed ours tried at the beginning of the year. Controlling a rover on Mars you will have to take care of moving a variety of objects from one point to another on the Red Planet and thus create a series of Martian bases for the astronauts. To find out all the details on this new sandbox adventure, continue reading our review of Mars First Logistics. LEGO but not really The idea at Mars First Logistics is simple: lift, move, deliver The idea is very simple, especially on paper. We have a set of pieces and we need to create a rover that is capable of not only moving on the red soils of Mars, but also grabbing and carrying different objects. We are talking about metal beams, satellite dishes, beach balls, a basket of oranges, a bag with a goldfish inside and more. The ~what~ is very important, because grabbing an oxygen tank is not like picking up a robotic turtle. At our disposal we will have extendable pistons, motors for rotating, various types of hooks, pincers and more, without forgetting normal connecting pieces and wheels. With an easy-to-use editor we will have to create the rover, making sure it is able to take the object of the moment, but also hold it all the way. Furthermore, in general, it is also important that the vehicle is in balance and that it has the driving force to move its own weight. It's actually not an overly daunting task and Mars First Logistics is very well calibrated in terms of its difficulty curve. First of all, Mars First Logistics never wants to seriously punish the player. Objects do not break, for example, and at any time you can restart the mission, in the rare case in which you end up in a point where it is impossible to recover the transported product. Furthermore, when a particularly new challenge is proposed, the game has probably provided new pieces and a ready-made rover model through the previous mission which is precisely used to solve the new objective. This shows how to use the new tools available. Furthermore, the adventure is divided into main missions (longer and more complex) and simpler secondary events which however allow you to obtain currency and some additional pieces. These non-mandatory missions change from time to time so that you don't risk getting stuck on some too complex for us. This is important because on several occasions we may find ourselves needing currency, necessary to purchase new copies of the various rover pieces. Some engineering ideas were quite brilliant, but very elaborate, so the side missions - as well as taking a breather from the longer challenges - ensured the funds necessary for advancement. The Mars First Logistics editor is simple to use and allows you to save more than 20 creations Most importantly, however, there is never just one right solution. There is a better, faster and more cost-effective method, but no one is stopping us from creating the most absurd and uncomfortable rover in the world: if our idea convinces us and we manage to get the package to its destination, that's great. The consequence is that we will feel stimulated on a creative level and in the end always satisfied because we made it with our own strength. We then add the fact that nothing prevents us from starting the mission in one way and, having reached an obstacle that we cannot overcome with our configuration, change the rover, raise the object again and start again. Once we completed a section filled with dunes by practically pushing the object, because we felt like doing it and because it was faster than finding a way to lift it while it was tilted. In terms of variety, Mars First Logistics offers more or less the same experience from the first to the last second, but at least the new unlocked pieces change the way of creating rovers and the first prototypes will become children's toys in the advanced stages. It should also be noted that Mars First Logistics is a slow-paced game: creating a rover is easy, but an idea rarely works first time and there are always adjustments to be made. It's not unusual to spend at least 10 or 15 minutes experimenting before even transporting the object even one meter. The movements themselvesi require a good handful of minutes and sometimes it's more about figuring out which is the best route to not get stuck. If you are in a hurry and want to solve everything in a few moments, Mars First Logistics may not be for you. Mars, progression and future A section of the Mars First Logistics map - the darker the color, the higher the terrain Up to now, however, we have not specified a detail, which perhaps is important for someone. Why do we have to move packages around Mars? Mars First Logistic doesn't actually have a storyline. It has more of a progression, based on the fact that with each package delivered we create some structure, such as a greenhouse, a resort, a Rover League Battle Arena (the reference is obvious) and more. These places don't really serve any purpose, but they at least give the impression that the Martian mission is leading to results. Also, we don't have to count on having a real world to explore. In order to go further it is necessary to reach radio towers from time to time which increase the signal and in practice unlock pieces of the map, but these serve more than anything else as reference points to understand in which directions to go and thus activate new places for the missions. There are no items to find or game events around the world. The lands of Mars only serve to complicate life (in a good way) and push you to create rovers capable of navigating steep dunes, stony areas and more. In Mars First Logistics, delivery is also a challenge, that beam must be placed vertically Mars is also somewhat repetitive on a visual level: it is a deserted land and not much can be done to create variety. The night/day cycle is at least used to change the colors of the sky (obviously) and the sand, which continues to go from red to orange and purple. The graphic style, beyond the limits imposed by the planet, is very pleasant and always legible. The soundtrack isn't very varied either, with a handful of enjoyable tunes that kick in when the game realizes you're not being particularly challenged. In the more elaborate moments, however, silence falls: the use of a dynamic system is an excellent choice. The sound effects of the rover's various moving parts are also very good. Finally, we emphasize that the developers offer Mars First Logistics as an Early Access game. The pack feels like it's already complete in terms of mechanics and content, but the team wants to keep introducing more zones and activities for free, so you can expect long-term support (they're talking about a year to get to version 1.0, which would also include procedurally generated content). What matters is that Mars First Logistics is already optimized, so don't be afraid to find yourself faced with a game with bugs (except for the fact that it doesn't unlock Achievements, at least before launch) or performance problems. Finally, we point out the presence of a cooperative mode for up to four players. There is no matchmaking and it is only possible to invite someone from your friends list and therefore we have not been able to test it, but on paper we believe it is something very interesting, which expands the creative possibilities quite a bit.", "date": "2023-06-21", "grade": "8.5"}
