Get excited? Intrigued? No it's oh well, better than being chosen by some deity to save the world or being a bubble-shooting dragon who has to save the world, or being a professional skater who has to save the world (I've already heard this history of the world who knows where). many PC gamers were quite annoyed to see the new Unreal Engine running at its best on a console first This plot of impressive complexity serves to introduce a third-person action / puzzle game, full of puzzles based mostly on physics. Our task will be to activate the cannon by loading it with giant projectiles, activating the cooling system, activating the electrical system, calibrating the radar, aiming the lasers and sending them barrels full of fuel; all to be carried out by overcoming six levels (one for each task) divided in turn into three sub-levels, the third of which is always the clash with a noide (the name of the enemies) bigger and more resistant than the others, which must be killed by studying the battlefield layout. Obviously we will not be alone in our enterprise. To give us advice and essential equipment, there will be another robot attached to the ceiling of a sort of basement, with which we will be able to communicate continuously, which will also explain our tasks in the different levels and tell us how to overcome stalemate situations (a kind of in-game solution that can be deactivated at any time). Ordinary screws extraordinary bolts Initially the protagonist will be equipped with a rather scarce equipment which includes his mechanical arms, with which to grab objects and launch rather weak close-range attacks, and a stun ray rifle with which to send the circuits of enemy robots into a ball. By collecting the credits scattered throughout the levels, it will be possible to buy weapons, armor and other improvements of various kinds (for example a double jump that allows you to reach higher platforms or an engine that accelerates movements). In addition to this, after passing a few levels, our robot friend will provide us with the key weapon of the game: a belt that allows us to launch magnetic spheres with which to create magnetic fields between objects (object / object or object / wall - floor) . The usage system is very simple: you throw a sphere towards an object (for example a chest) and you throw a second one against what you want to attract it towards (for example another chest) and that's it: thanks thanks to the highly advanced physics engine present in the game, we will see objects magically attracting each other in a realistic way, both in terms of movements, speed and impact. The same weapon, by acquiring a further upgrade, can be used in another way: by throwing a sphere and holding down the launch button, the protagonist's body will be attracted by it, thus allowing him to reach otherwise off-limits areas. Action All these features have been exploited by the level designers to create intriguing and very fun puzzles with which to engage the players' brains (try not to use the aids ... otherwise there is no taste) in a decidedly intelligent way. For example, in one of the levels, it will be necessary to deflect lasers by placing reflective boxes in front of them (all strictly by hand) or, in another level, we will have to rotate mobile platforms using magnetic spheres. Obviously there will be some shooting against enemies who will be shot down with laser bullets, missiles or implosive grenades. Action Roboblitz is at its best in boss fights, where the frenzy of an action game meets the ingenuity of a puzzle game, creating a remarkable mix. As already mentioned above, depending on the level you are in, you will have to fight the boss on duty in a different way. For example, in the level where you have to reactivate the ventilation system, we will have to make the black ball angry (noids are big black balls with eyes and a mouth... don't look at me with those amazed eyes... and don't let the journalists read this of Panorama... otherwise who knows what they'll come up with...) who, red with rage, will throw themselves at us. By dodging it and making it end up against spikes we will bring out its weak point which we will have tothen strike with our laser. In another level we will have to jump from the top of magnetized towers by hitting the boss with an electrified pipe. Obviously the tube will have to be gripped properly with the mechanical arms and the jump will have to be as precise as possible. Each fight will be divided into different phases in which we will mainly have to figure out what to do to damage the enemy. Sometimes the solution will be obvious, other times instead, we will have to demonstrate a good glance to understand how to move (obviously this does not apply if we use the advice of our robot colleague). The pivot that holds up the world The use of such an advanced graphics engine is not justified if one simply considers the immediate visual impact: the textures are not very good as are the three-dimensional models. A couple of levels are nice to look at, but nothing that would make your jaw drop. Even the lighting system is little used and can only be glimpsed in the reflections of the robot protagonist. Apart from that, the physics engine is really perfect and that's no small thing given that it's the core of the game. Of course, apart from the puzzles, there aren't particularly spectacular situations in which to test it, but it's already truly remarkable thanks to the precise control system that allows you to perform every action without having to go crazy (this isn't as obvious as it seems, given the freedom of motion offered by realistic physics). The pivot that holds up the world RoboBlitz's biggest flaw is the brevity of the individual levels and the general brevity of the game. Let's say that with five hours you should be able to finish it... using the aids, however, will take much less. The levels are quite short and it's not even enough to collect all the hidden credits to stretch the soup that much (the really difficult ones to reach can be counted on the fingertips of a Barbapapa's hand... and often it's just a matter of having the right upgrade), also because after a while (let's say after half of the levels) the things to buy run out and the further collection of resources will therefore have perfectionism as its only motive (which also limits the desire to replay the levels); if you think about it, it's not exactly the ideal way to involve a player. Another defect, this time of a technical nature, is the sound. Frankly it is unbearable. The sound effects are repetitive and rather annoying while the music is anonymous and generally insipid. You find much better in smaller productions: something more could have been done. Conclusions RoboBlitz is fun and well done. It certainly deserves the amount it costs (about fifteen euros), despite the poor longevity. The general fluidity is very good, even on not too modern computers... but don't be fooled: as mentioned in the article, the Epic graphics engine is exploited in a partial and non-explanatory way of its general heaviness. Keep it in mind if you are looking for an original and challenging pastime, without being frustrating. Pros Physics is used perfectly Great playability Balanced Cons Short No visual miracles Sound from quickly turning down the volume Expectations Recently released on Steam, Valve's Digital Delivery platform, RoboBlitz is best known for being the first full game for PC using the third incarnation of the Unreal Engine for its playful features. In fact, if it could not boast this primacy, its release would probably have gone unnoticed and only indie circles would have talked about it. That would have been a shame, because this little game has a lot to offer but only to those who can forget the graphics engine that makes it move. It seems strange to say it, but it's true: what should be its strong point, is actually the main source of some big prejudices that accompanied its release. In the first place, it is absolutely necessary not to make comparisons with Gears of War, in comparison to which RoboBlitz comes out destroyed. In truth, it was rather silly to expect to see wonders in terms of polygonal models and ultra-defined textures from such a limited production. Let's face it (and here we come to the second point), many PC gamers were quite annoyed to see the new Unreal Engine running at its best on a console first, and they dreamed of a kind of redemption perhaps they would have preferred a technical demo that showed amazing effects rather than a visually pleasing game and nothing more. That said, and specifying that to squeeze your two GeForce 8800 you'll have to wait for more, we come to us starting to play with a clear mind.", "date": "2006-12-04", "grade": null}
