In this third chapter, the dark hero, a disreputable guy who rips the bones from the body of enemies to make himself an armour, obviously arrives there transformed and complete with everything. Let's talk about the powerful sets, the related tests, the dialogues that help us outline the new champion and a handful of extras that include a faithful animal, special wings, banner, portrait, two character slots and two inventory expansions. All this costs 14.99 euros while the rest of the new features of patch 2.6, which includes eight new areas and new challenge gates to be tackled with a pre-set character, are automatically available even for those who don't intend to spend a penny. The Necromancer Diablo III's Necromancer is a Nefilim who seems to represent the very essence of his race, born from the union between demons and angels, finding himself in the role of the extreme defender of balance. Acolyte of the Priests of Rathma has been sent into the field to set things right and is convinced that the power of death can reach where the champions of the Light cannot. With this intention, supported by a calculating and implacable brain, he is once again facing the long road to Malthael, looking for a confrontation that gambles entirely on the power of death, albeit used for opposite purposes. And that of the Necromancer is undoubtedly positive, despite the gloomy aura that surrounds him and which is reflected in the numerous dialogues added to the campaign. An acolyte on a mission, he is aware of his human forefather who appeared in Diablo II, but has no ties to him except in terms of abilities. Cold and devoted to his mission, he is a hero who can sacrifice his blood, absorb life energy, know every secret of the bones and dominate armies of creatures. All this makes him a sort of multipurpose character that differs from the shaman even if the developers didn't think much about this aspect during development. The decisions, at least according to Blizzard, were made with the sole purpose of creating a fun character to play and consistent with that image inevitably linked to the equivalent of Diablo II. The result is a character suspended between Diablo II and Diablo III, a peculiar champion that stands out from the others in terms of character and gameplay, thanks to the addition of a previously non-existent dynamic that is based on the possibility of manipulating corpses. Equipped with rather effective defensive skills, surrounded by creatures and capable of inflicting a lot of damage from a distance, the necromancer is probably the most versatile character on the roster, with this DLC arrived seven characters, of Diablo III. And in the preview we left him like this, capable of fighting at short and medium distances, robust and equipped with the ability to detonate tons of bodies thanks to the explosion of corpses which was one of his key skills also in the second chapter. What we lacked, in terms of gameplay, were the objects that we know are capable of radically transforming the functioning of a configuration. Initially useless or almost useless, the suits have become a cornerstone of the Diablo III gameplay and, combined with some key objects, can increase damage and resistance exponentially, allowing you to face Nephilim Gates that far exceed the maximum difficulty of normal modes. The Necromancer can count on four sets, like the other classes, to which are added over thirty legendary class objects which, when combined with the suits, can exponentially increase their effectiveness. The numerous possible configurations, mostly fun and rightly challenging, often include damage reduction, life regeneration and the sacrifice of the same. All elements that fit well with the Trag'Oul set which dramatically increases vitality and enhances the damage of the skills which, with the appropriate rune, sacrifice it. The Pestilence set, on the other hand, plays on damage reduction and the bone spear, combining resistance and damage that becomes decidedly high with a couple of side objects. For summons, then, there is Rathma, which enhances both temporary and permanent creatures, paving the way for a summoner build that sees the player in a decidedly active role. Finally, Inarius' outfit relies entirely on bone armor which, in addition to protecting the necromancer, and we are talking about hundreds of millions of fortitude points, can cause great damage while increasing those caused by other skills. make usle to use, it is an already popular configuration, but also the others, first of all Pestilence, allow you to face rather high level passages provided, of course, that you also have the surrounding objects and the related powers well combined in Kanai's cube. The equilibrium price To everything we have just talked about are added the novelties of patch 2.6 among which we find eight new areas including the dark and foggy Fosca Moor and the Temple of the Firstborn which embodies the spirit of the Necromancer, putting us in front of pools of blood , corpses hanging on the walls and macabre details. There in the middle, the new champion is undoubtedly at ease between guts, undead and an overall look that undoubtedly takes us back to the times of Diablo II. And it's all taken care of starting from the animations of the golem, some really amazing, to get to the curses that perhaps don't have the space hoped for in the game dynamics, but between sound effects and graphics they have a pretty good impact on the overall look of Diablo III. A look that is enriched with new monsters, a new boss that is also added to those that can be faced in the Gates and six multidimensional areas, made up of different pieces of the setting fractured and recombined with each other. These, like the two previous areas, field new assignments and boast an enviable variety, even from the point of view of the monsters, but in hindsight they do not add anything new and given the arrival of the Necromancer we would have expected something more. Instead, the rest of the patch deals with balancing the new character, making it a little more functional than the beta, and limits itself to adding an undoubtedly interesting but limited type of Gate. Let's talk about the already mentioned Challenge Rifts which are based on the use of a predefined champion in a unique dungeon for all. The aim is to beat a certain time, get a prize chest and possibly aim for the absolute record before the arrival of another predetermined character restarts the carousel from the beginning. In competitive terms, this is a not bad addition, but like the other new features, this one too has nothing striking and closes the news of a patch which, in addition to suffering from some slowdown in the new areas, leaves the balance of the other classes almost untouched . But it is, as we said, free content. Those with payments gravitate exclusively around the Necromancer which costs a good 14.99 euros. Let me be clear, the new champion was made with care, is impeccably characterized, is decidedly versatile and is capable of distinguishing itself from the others in a clear way, even for the bloody and dark tones which, together with some skills and the Temple of the Firstborn , take us back to the days of Diablo II. But let's go back to those 14.99 euros again. We're talking about half the price of Diablo III plus expansion, not at a discount, for a single character since the extra content that accompanies it is patch-related and is automatically available to everyone. Of course, integrating a new hero into an already established structure is not easy. Between rehearsals, story and dialogues there was a lot to do. Plus there's the matter of balancing with dozens of new abilities, three new sets, and new items, all to be fine-tuned for rifts, trials, and the regular campaign. But we must also consider that although Blizzard support is record-breaking and Diablo III has grown considerably, we haven't seen any noteworthy gameplay-related news for some time and there would be a need. Many players still throw themselves in pursuit of the seasonal objectives, but the desire drops quickly and this is not surprising given that it takes very little, thanks to the cube and the Major Rifts, to dress a character and maximize, or almost, the effectiveness . This leaves the Blizzard title without a real endgame, both in terms of object search and multiplayer, added badly and left as a useless side dish. And things don't change with the arrival of the Rise of the Necromancer DLC which can be really expensive unless you want to set records and run in pursuit of the perfect equipment.", "date": "2017-06-30", "grade": "7.8"}
