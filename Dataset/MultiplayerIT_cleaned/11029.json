{"name": "Left 4 Dead - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/left-4-dead-recensione.html", "text": "A story told on the walls Although devoid, like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike, of a ~story~ properly so called, considering Left 4 Dead the classic multiplayer title all gameplay and no narrative depth, would be a mistake. The game places the four protagonists in as many ~acts~ unrelated to each other, each made as a sort of short film - complete with a poster - in turn divided into sections that end when the next ~safe zone~ is reached: barricaded areas against the 'intrusion of the zombies, where the survivors can rest and refuel, waiting for the new path towards the coveted goal, be it a helicopter, a ship or a military plane. In Campaign mode, each player - and it is highly recommended to experience the game online right away - is entrusted with the role of one of the four survivors: Bill, Zoe, Francis and Louis. The first a pragmatic ex green beret now in the autumn of his years, the second an energetic student, ironically passionate about horror films; they follow a good-natured biker covered in tattoos and a lanky black computer analyst, in a shirt and tie who have seen better times. Initially absolutely nothing is known about them beyond the names, but the gap is intentional and the beauty of the absolute lack of a structured narrative in Left 4 Dead forces the player to imagine their stories. The four ~acts~ - each with its own characteristic theme, from the hospital in No Mercy to the airport in Dead Air - are not so much in themselves, as each an integral part of a hypothetical horror film of which they represent the classic sequences of action that accompany the vision up to the final climax. The premises of the story are not expressed, from the first moment the bullets fly, but for the more attentive observers - and listeners - the game provides a quantity of details and cues (writings and messages on the walls in the safe zones, comments and bickering exchanged between the characters) which help to get an idea of both the extent of the crisis and the character of the protagonists. A sort of extremely brilliant indirect storytelling full of irony and black humor as well as genuinely disturbing gimmicks, which goes perfectly with an action title, stimulating the player's imagination. United to survive A praiseworthy feature of Left 4 Dead is its ability to push the player to develop real emotional affection for his companions, derived directly from the most sincere and primordial of sensations: fear. Being alone means certain death, and it's hard to recall other titles in which the uncomfortable awareness of one's own vulnerability and dependence on others is so palpable. The obvious reason in this case is that there are several dangerous situations that a player can find himself in that require the intervention of at least one other to get out: if you are knocked down and seriously injured by a crowd of zombies for example, it is possible to get up until a companion arrives to help us. The same goes if you are attacked and incapacitated by a Hunter or a Smoker (two of the special undead we will talk about later) or if you lose your balance on the edge of a precipice: in all these cases it is essential that someone does clean sweep of the hostiles and lend us a helping hand to get us back on our feet. To end up knocked down under the tearing claws of a Hunter, without the possibility of reacting, while we can still see the silhouettes of our unsuspecting companions who are climbing the stairs ... pure terror! Beyond these explicit mechanics, the entire gameplay is invariably built around the idea that collaboration is essential to survive: if in fact very few hits are enough to put the average living dead back to sleep, none of the survivors is remotely able to face alone a whole horde of screaming zombies attacking him from every direction, both for the technical impossibility of hitting so many targets and for the forced complementarity of the different weapons. In addition to the ~service~ pistol that serves as a secondary weapon, everyone can carry one and only one firearm, choosing between medium-long range automatics (Uzi and assault rifle) or close-range attacks (shotgun and combat shotguns). While the former are great for clearing a horde rooftop below before advancing, they're also far less effective against a direct assault from multiple directions. Conversely, the latter, while devastating, force you to let enemies approach before firing and the few shots and slow loading condemn you to certain death if you suffer too many attacks. Only the useThe combination of different weapons - including grenades, Molotov cocktails and the rare but very useful sniper rifle - ensures enough versatility for the group to handle any situation. Being alone is the best way to panic and start moving frantically, ending up in the inevitable ambush prepared by the diabolical Director, the artificial intelligence system that dynamically organizes the size and frequency of the spawns of the enemies and their position, as well as that of supplies of health, weapons and ammunition, all depending on the level of difficulty and the conditions in which the players find themselves. United to survive What makes the collaborative mode of Left 4 Dead a long-lasting and always fresh experience is precisely the fact that each level of each act is never played in exactly the same way: the Director always manages to shuffle the cards and surprise us, working from good ~director~ to give an epic cut in the climax points, with sound effects and subtle color changes in our view. Finally, to multiply the sensation of being hunted prey and not a light-hearted group of defenseless zombie slaughterers, the variables decided by the Director also include the identity and position - always different - of the game's ~bosses~. In fact, there are five types of special zombies (four of which are playable in versus mode) that are distinguished from the conventional horde by intelligence, resistance and special abilities. Among the relatively more common ones we have the Hunter, a fragile but very agile screaming predator, which moves on all fours and is able to jump enormous distances, landing on the protagonists and incapacitating them, to then proceed to the slaughter. It follows the Smoker, tall, lanky and possessing a very long tentacle tongue that can catch a player from enormous distances and silently drag them to their hiding place if not stopped in time. Then it's up to the gruesome Boomer, a huge obese zombie, full of fluids and gases, which in addition to exploding in a riot of offal, loves to cover the players with his vomit, thus calling an instant invasion of the living dead, attracted like bees by the honey... The circus of horrors is closed by the two most dangerous undead, who as such can only appear once for each section of an act: the Tank is a huge zombie with hypertrophied muscles capable of sustaining immense damage and causing frightening both with punches and by hurling machines and boulders. Finally, the Witch, a skin and bones creature apparently defenseless, but which, if disturbed by loud noises or torchlight, unleashes a very sharp murderous fury with lightning speed. To be avoided! Do not forget that all these lovable creatures (with the exception of the Witch) can be played in Versus mode, where four Infected will oppose the survivors, trying to take advantage of the NPC zombie hordes to prepare ambushes and traps, deciding from time to time which point to appear. Good looking apocalypse Now four years after the release of Half-Life 2, the Source graphics engine is showing its limits, but thanks to its modernization and in part to the excellent level of art direction of Left 4 Dead, there are very few things to we can complain. Certainly the scenarios suffer a bit from the relatively low number of polygons used, which is particularly noticeable in the vicinity of cars, pipes and other objects rich (or lacking, you see) curved surfaces. Even the animations of the characters and the interaction with objects are not exactly state of the art: the new procedural element - which changes the inclination of the character when he changes direction while running or when he climbs a hill - is noticeable and not noticeable , while it is very clear how the ladders are still ~divinely ascended~ while the actions of healing oneself, replacing a weapon and so on translate into a great whirling of empty hands... At the same time the characters are made with absolutely impeccable care, as well as the zombies and their animations, among the most convincing and scary ever seen in a video game. The open spaces are also excellent, in particular the misty countryside outside the city, where the cinematic effects such as the ~film grain~ give their best in defining the atmosphere and in general the introduction of normal maps, the excellent lighting system and the great quality of the textures make it difficult to criticize the graphics sector, especially if we consider the excellent support even for older hardware. The audio is also very enjoyable: good effects, exceptional voices, verses and gurgles of the zombies. Even the music is spot on even if they are certainly not numeroded and the motif performed in the safe room at the beginning of each level is a real monument to tension. Comment One could complain that Left 4 Dead is objectively a bit sparse in content and that after all, four acts are few and can be played quickly. This is certainly true and can be a problem for those most eager for news, but with this multiplayer gem, Valve has found a recipe for immediate and genuine, and moreover lasting, fun. In this sense, after the first few games, we recommend dedicating yourself exclusively to the advanced, demanding difficulty level, but still within anyone's reach, while playing Normal was far too easy for our tastes. And if all this were not enough for you, the Versus mode with the playable Infected adds further variety, fun and dark black humor, while at least we can expect the arrival of further maps in the coming months - strictly free, at least as regards the PC version, on which the game probably represents the better deal. Left 4 Dead is an innovative title whose basic idea, simple and original, required an execution of great quality and precision because all the elements - collaborative gameplay, atmosphere, irony, graphic style - fit together perfectly. Luckily for us, that's the way it is, and whatever your thoughts are on the game, make sure you at least try out the demo. You won't find anything remotely like it out there!
