The futuristic driving game developed by Psygnosis feared no rivals in terms of visual impact, in fact, and even gave the feeling of being faced with a console equipped with technical capabilities superior to those it actually had. The similarities with Riptide GP, from this point of view, are not few: even the title created by Vector Unit takes on the connotations of a ~test of strength~ (first for Android terminals and then for iOS ones), it is set in a better specified future and bases its appeal on the precision with which the tracks are tackled, but it is jet skis rather than spacecrafts equipped with exaggerated aerodynamics who do battle. This difference turns out to be far from subtle, given that the very presence of water adds an unexpected thickness to the experience, which benefits from optimizations for the real-time calculation of wave physics on the most recent Apple devices. We tried the game on an iPhone 3GS and on an iPhone 4S precisely to evaluate these differences, which immediately appear clear: the low-definition version manages the water surface in the traditional way, almost like a ~board~ on which the vehicles and only slightly refracts the scenery surrounding the track. On the iPhone 4S, however, the water takes on a life of its own, the feeling of being able to cut its waves is much more marked, there are continuous upheavals (also dictated by the behavior of our opponents) and finally the reflection of the settings is of excellent quality, all within the framework of a graphic resolution four times higher, which also moves more fluidly. Deeper waves Can we therefore say that Riptide GP stands as a simple tech demo, created more to show the capabilities of developers and devices than for recreational purposes? Absolutely not, because behind the graphics the game is everything and you don't even save money in terms of quantity. From the start screen you can in fact access the single race mode, a time attack and a championship consisting of six different cups with increasing difficulty. All progress must be unlocked by placing first in the races and thus earning gold medals, and the discussion extends to the six jet skis and the same number of circuits, the total of which however doubles and reaches twelve since each one is also available in mirrored version. Finally, there are three possible levels of difficulty, marked by the engine size of the vehicles: the 250cc class is the simplest and is perfect for getting familiar with the control system and the nature of the races, given that the degree of challenge is low and it is possible to cross the finish line first even if you bump into a wall a couple of times. The 500cc and 1000cc classes are clearly more difficult, and in this case to win races you have to memorize every corner, take the best trajectories and take advantage of the boost whenever we have it available. Speaking of boost, the relative bar must be filled by performing aerobatics after having hit a ramp: the bike hovers in the air for a few seconds and by drawing lines on the touch screen, we can make our rider perform various spectacular tricks. The Riptide GP controls also use touch for the brake (just touch the left side of the screen) and for activating the aforementioned boost (touch the bar on the right), but the main role is played by the accelerometer as the bike ~steers~ when we tilt the iPhone. It is a very well implemented solution, which turns out to be very precise and whose sensitivity can also be freely adjusted.
