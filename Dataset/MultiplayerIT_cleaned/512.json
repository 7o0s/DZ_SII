{"name": "Winning Eleven 10", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-10.html", "text": "As always, from the main screen you can access the traditional and numerous game modes that distinguish the series (many of which, like the ML, have been updated with some small novelties), plus some unpublished ones, the most important of which appears to be the new ~International Challenge  which will allow you to play the entire qualifying round for the World Cup with your favorite national team, and obviously the same in the event of a qualifying round. On the other hand, the ~Random Selection Match~ is nice: in practice with this ~option~ you can quickly have the CPU create your dream formation before a match. For example, if you want Del Piero, Shevchenko and Adriano to play together, just select Juve, Milan and Inter for the CPU to create a team made up of the best players from these teams. As in the previous episode, also in this new chapter of the Konami football saga all the licensed clubs can boast rosters, logos and official jerseys of the football season still in progress. Ditto for the championships in which they participate, namely the Italian Serie A (the curious absence of only Cagliari, replaced for the occasion by a mysterious team in purple jersey ...), the Dutch Eredivisie and the Spanish Liga. For the Bundesliga and the Premier League, on the other hand, once again we will have to wait for another occasion to be able to taste them in the ~real~ version since here KTYO has not acquired any official license, except for Bayern Munich only for the German tournament and the usual Chelsea and Arsenal for the English one. However, we can console ourselves at least with a DB updated to the current season, complete with finally recent transfers (those of January 2006 - Ed -) and which will therefore allow you not to have to fiddle with the appropriate editor for whole days to make all the changes to the case. The various Di Vaio and Vieri are in fact already in Monaco, Cassano at Real and Maxwell at Empoli, just to give some examples. The list of teams participating in the various trophies has also been updated and therefore the newly promoted and national teams not available in the previous edition of WE but which this year will participate in the World Cup, such as Trinidad and Tobago, are present in the game. Returning instead to the discourse related to licenses, it should be noted that in Winning Eleven 10 there are finally also some national teams complete with official uniforms and brands thanks to the agreements reached by Konami with some international federations. We are talking about England, Italy, Spain, Holland and Argentina. But more than the tinsel, the logos and the kits, what makes the difference in WE is, as usual, the playability. The first impact with the new WE, once you take the field, is deceptive. In some ways ~terrifying~. The match begins and everything seems easier, the passages are largely successful than in the previous episode, the players move more fluidly and the gameplay appears simplified. What happen? A KTYO step back from the saga with a wink to a game system that is a bit more arcadey? A sudden involution with a consequent change of course towards the style of FIFA? None of that. Don't worry. After the first moments of bewilderment, in fact, when the competition gets underway and you get used to the novelty, the mystery is revealed. No arcade element in the gameplay, no real simplification, but only, so to speak, yet another technical masterpiece by Konami programmers. It is the control over the players, made even more sophisticated, total, that almost gives you the feeling that the game has been made simpler. The fact that players respond more reactively and immediately to your commands now more than ever, and the numerous new animations, so varied that with every single movement of the pad, our virtual heroes will move some part of the body (inner-outer foot, ~free~ bending of the body depending on the position assumed at that moment by the athlete, etc) end up generating the above illusion. In short, it seems that the KTYO guys have managed with some magical alchemy to take people, shrink them and electronically insert them into their game, such is the near perfection of the visible movements on the pitch. Spectacular in terms of animations those of the goalkeepers, simply by Oscar. The best way to evaluate the artificial intelligence of WE10, and consequently the degree of playability of the title, is always to analyze separately the two main phases of the game, the offensive and the defensive. In both cases it must be said immediately that one cannot fail to notice the umpteenth upgrade, upwards, of the AI of the CPU which manages both our companions not controlled directly by us, both opponents. When attacking, players without the ball move well, their movements, their overlaps, follow ~human~ logic. Which facilitates, like the animations we were talking about earlier, the construction of effective actions. Especially if you are good at mastering the passage management system. As already in the previous chapter, depending on the length of time you will spend pressing the key, the power with which the pass is made will vary in intensity, as well as based on the position assumed by the player you control at that moment and the keys used you can make him make a long throw rather than a low cut in the desired direction. Thanks to the improved physics that manages the movements of the ball and the even more valid intelligence of the attackers, it is also possible to better realize the dangerous situations that we will be able to develop in the offensive phase. The multiple shooting solutions once again allow the user to decide ~in toto~ where and how to kick the ball, i.e. whether inside or outside, toe or full neck, with the simple pressure of the D-pad on the right spot. It is interesting to highlight how the shots on the net on high balls have been improved, especially in headers, which in WE9 appeared a little too complicated to execute and above all were almost always rather lopsided. Now if you manage to soar high with your man better than the opposing defender, you will be able to perform more precise headers, provided that in this case too you know how to direct the ball where the goalkeeper cannot reach. The extreme defenders, at least the best, are very smart and difficult to overcome. The teams controlled by the CPU in turn move in a very credible way, according to the schemes adopted by their respective real counterparts (Arsenal, for example, play exactly as it happens in reality and are difficult to deal with, especially if they start on the counterattack - Ed -) and the situations that occur during the race. And again based on the players who make up the squad. A Milan will try to impose its game by taking advantage of its scheme, but above all the high technical rate of its men, while a Lecce will tend to cover itself to try some sorties forward at the right time. In the defensive phase both our men and the opponents managed by the game react more convincingly to the dangerous situations that appear in front of them compared to the previous title in the series. Defender AI is close to perfect at times. Attentive, skilled in anticipating and reading the opponent's offensive action, these last bulwarks between the ~bombers~ and their goalkeeper act rationally, blocking themselves in front between you and the ball if necessary, without committing a foul, or pretending to go to close on your ball carrier and then dash towards the attacker who has just disengaged. Note how also in this phase, as well as for shots, when you control a man, depending on his position and the point of the D-pad that you press, you can stretch your foot to move the ball to your opponent, intervene in semi - slip, elbow, hold. But watch out for fouls. Speaking of which you will be very pleased to know how the referees, WE9's ~Achilles heel~ with their constant boos that literally tormented the gameplay, have been ~recalibrated~ at the AI level in their judgment metrics on the various episodes, and now they finally behave on the field in a more credible way, whistling only when necessary and not at every physical contrast, correctly applying the rule of advantage where necessary. We forgot: if you want to quickly resume play immediately after the referee's whistle, just press the R1+L1 keys simultaneously to cause the player closest to the ball to throw it on the ground and kick it forward towards a teammate. Just like it happens in reality. Moving on to the purely technical side, the television cut given to the entire game setting by KTYO, from the stages of the presentation of the match to those of the interlude between one action and another during the matches, to the cheering public framed in the foreground intent on cheering scarves in the wind, the maniacal care for the official uniforms, for the stadiums, the lights, the choreographies in the corners, make the title in question still visually very valid. While using the WE9 engine (and from here the need to see the series on the next generation appears even higher...) and therefore not being able to make striking aesthetic changes, the Konami graphic designers have once again managed to retouch here and there pretty much everything editable and adding those touches of class as only they can. From thepoint of view of the physical characterization of the athletes, for example, the players represented on the field are perfect, identical to their respective real counterparts in all respects. The defects of some not particularly similar faces have been visually smoothed out, such as Cannavaro, Ibrahimovic or Zanetti, rendered by the graphics finally equal to the players they represent, dozens of new faces have been added such as those of Zaccardo, Barzagli, Blasi, Barone and Chiellini, just to stay in the national arena, or that of Barcelona's new Argentine phenomenon Leo Messi. The polygonal models that compose them, but also those that structure the bodies of the fans taken in close-up, appear rounder and more refined, thanks to a better use of the textures that cover them, which are in turn very bright and clear. Too bad the same quality cannot be found in the audio sector. Once again the sound effects, buzzes from the audience and various atmospheric background sounds sadly echo against the absolutely poor choirs and not up to such a well-finished production. Luckily good old Kabira never betrays us, assisted this time by a third voice in his commentary, namely that of the correspondent on the sidelines, a certain Iwamoto. Every year it's the same story: Konami never ceases to amaze us and leave us flabbergasted. At each seasonal appointment with the Winning Eleven saga, the Japanese softo manages to improve what seemed unfeasible until a moment before, creating one great title after another, as if it had discovered the Holy Grail of programming. In fact, the tenth chapter of the most loved football saga by gamers from all over the planet turns out to be worthy of being the last episode in the history of this game on Ps2. And as the wise man says, in life there are very few certainties. One of them is Winning Eleven. Pros: Gameplay always of the highest profile. Improved and faster player control. increasingly sophisticated AI. Cons: Absence of licenses for some leagues. There is a need for superior hardware. For the poor editor of a magazine, every year that passes it becomes increasingly difficult to be able to review a game in the WE series without repeating the same things over and over again, risking falling into absolute monotony. Some of our readers might even have the impression of re-reading exactly the same article from a year ago, as if the wretch above had limited himself to a mere copy/paste of the previous work to write the review in question. In reality, of course, this is not the case. The fact is that everything in the universe is constantly changing, and there are very few things that remain almost the same over the centuries. One of these is the very high quality of the Winning Eleven series. Surprisingly announced just over a month and a half ago, when no one would have bet a penny on seeing another episode of the saga on Ps2, the Winning Eleven saga returns to delight us with what should be, this time for real, its last appearance on the Monolith before passing bag and baggage on Xbox 360 and later on Ps3. Dedicated mainly to the next World Cup which will take place in just over a month in Germany, without however neglecting the various national and international club tournaments, Winning Eleven 10 presents itself to our ravenous eyes full of novelties both in the database and in the Game modes and in gameplay.", "date": "2006-05-03", "grade": null}
