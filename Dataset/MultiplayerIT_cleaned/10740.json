We are talking about Escape from Butcher Bay, the first chapter of The Chronicles of Riddick series: a raw, violent, at times even sick game, but terribly compelling and well packaged by the capable hands of Swedish developers, embellished by the charismatic figure of Riddick who thanks to the features of the actor Vin Diesel he staged a charm that is difficult to match. Since then Starbreeze have continued their artistic/professional path in the next-gen with The Darkness which, despite being a new ip, continued to follow in its own way the stylistic path characterized by darkness, violence and black humor introduced with the previous work, although not reaching its qualitative peaks. Now the time has come back to impersonate that good guy who made us have so much fun on the first Xbox and on PC, and the return of the new chapter of the Chronicles of Riddick has been programmed in a big way with a particular eye on the fans of the old episode. An old acquaintance This new The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is presented on store shelves with a truly exceptional offer, containing the new chapter of the series (Dark Athena, in fact) and a reissue of the original Escape from Butcher Bay. Despite the past time, today playing the first unforgettable appearance of the well-known space criminal remains an exhilarating and over the top experience thanks to a granite gameplay that does not accuse the weight of the years and a characterization of characters, dialogues and scenes that are still attests to excellent quality standards. The partial graphic restyling that attenuates the aesthetic gap between the original Butcher Bay and the new Dark Athena who now share the same engine as The Darkness also contributed to reviving everything. In truth we are not dealing with a real all-round remake, the settings have not undergone particular technical upheavals, while the character models are directly borrowed from the new episode, so as to offer a more up-to-date modeling and texture detail with the times. In addition to these small but important adjustments, the game has remained in all respects the same as in 2004 and given the caliber of the product in question, we do not feel like considering it a defect. In light of this, we can only deem Starbreeze's choice as positive and commendable, as they offer the entire Riddick adventure in a single product, allowing those who haven't played it at the time to fully enjoy the potential of a saga that has proved to be able to age well. Predictably, even after the eventful escape from Butcher Bay prison, the good Riddick certainly could not stay away from the action and it is precisely from here that the events of Assault on Dark Athena begin: from the freedom regained by the protagonist with still the penitentiary complex standing far behind him. But the heart of the game is hosted inside a huge spaceship called Dark Athena, a place that will not make you regret (so to speak) the inhospitable Butcher Bay. The dark figure of the Athena initially appears as a ship of mercenaries with a far from reassuring appearance, but Riddick's uncomfortable and hidden presence will immediately reveal much darker and more terrifying aspects that gravitate around his crew and above all to his commander. We will soon be faced with a harsh reality when we will discover that the Dark Athena practices piracy actions by boarding other ships encountered in the galaxy, then kidnapping their crew and locking them up in detention cells awaiting a cruel fate that is to be transformed into drones without of will. The same fate obviously happens to Riddick's ship which, thanks to its abilities, escapes capture by concealing its presence, finding itself, in fact, in the condition of being an uncomfortable stowaway. Starting from these premises, the game comes alive, Riddick finds himself having to act inside the Athena trying to find an escape route and at the same time to derail the plans of the mercenaries. To achieve his goals he is forced to interact with various subjects, many of whom are prisoners, who can help the hunter achieve his goals. Given the extreme situation in which one acts, no one offers the protagonist his indispensable services, except in exchange for favors and this represents the backbone of the whole adventure: satisfying the requests of third parties to then get what you want and be able to continue, it is the logic of self-interest that dominates the twisted minds of the characters with whom aWe'll have to deal with, all unsavory people with an over the top personality. welcome at board The Athena ship certainly does not shine for variety and originality of the spaces, the predilection of the Starbreeze for gloomy and hostile atmospheres shines through but its realization will certainly not go down in history as a worthy alternative to those offered by the most famous space sci-fi sagas, Halo in head. What really makes the visit on the ship and the whole experience so unique is the excellent script that will be appreciated above all by those who have a predilection for a certain cinematic trend characterized by arrogant heroes, often with redundant and strong-impact personalities. In Assault on Dark Athena every line of dialogue (especially those of the protagonist / Vin Diesel) is memorable and imbued with a black humor that often also flows into the grotesque without sparing numerous so-called ~colorful~ expressions. What is surprising is that, despite the fact that these aspects have been heavily influenced, the final product is still credible and consistent with the representation of human degradation that lives in Dark Athena. The gameplay offered by the new unreleased chapter largely follows the one already appreciated in Butcher Bay. Riddick profits from being circumspect, aided by his ability to see in the dark. Acting in the shadows, in fact, it will be possible to eliminate opponents quickly and silently (or highly spectacular and violent), also thanks to an excellent hand-to-hand combat system which, despite the first-person perspective, maintains an enviable sense of physicality and dynamism enhanced by the large number of edged or blunt weapons available. As you may have already understood this The Chronicles of Riddick is not a traditional fps as appearances would have you believe, the use of firearms will not always prove to be the best choice and often you are forced to face interesting and successful platform sections. Riddick is able to perform a considerable amount of actions often contextualized to whether or not he is in stealth mode (such as moving corpses or using the drone's weapon arms as a mouth of fire while remaining covered behind their body) and even physical clashes can be tackled by performing diversified moves thanks to the skilful use of the right analog stick. It is surprising (but perhaps it was to be expected) how everything works perfectly while remaining essentially a five year old structure, even from this point of view time seems to have stopped. Xbox 360 goals We're talking two games in one, so Riddick certainly isn't being generous with his points release. It will be necessary to complete both adventures for the first few hundred points, many other objectives are intended for contextual actions to collecting documents and multiplayer. There are also many secret objectives. In the darkness I shine The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is based on the same graphics engine of The Darkness, renewed and evolved for the occasion. Substantial progress has been made above all for the lighting which appears divinely created here, even if one often has the feeling that it has been exaggerated from an artistic point of view in the exploitation of light sources which in some cases alter the perception of some textures . Technically speaking, Assault on Dark Athena appears in better shape than the reissue of its predecessor even if it inherits a certain tendency for bare and easily forgettable environments, a sensation accentuated by a frequent use of backtracking sessions. If in the face of certain furnishings one notices a poverty in the polygonal load, this does not happen with the models of the characters, excellently made and animated, especially in their facial expressions. the textures that cover the game, on the other hand, are always discreetly defined and boast many applied effects that give depth to the general rendering. On balance, the engine seems to show its age slightly, revealing a slight aliasing and a framerate that (albeit rarely) admits some uncertainty. The audio sector is exciting as regards the dubbing (in English, but subtitled in Italian) where the voice of Vin Diesel dominates, lent to Riddick for the occasion, while on the music front there is a step backwards if one thinks of the splendid column soundtrack of The Darkness. Taking advantage once again of the comparison with the previous work by Starbreeze, here too a clear accessory nature of the multiplayer component is denoted which certainly does not represent the heart of the offer, which is already very rich given its dual nature.", "date": "2009-04-27", "grade": "8.3"}
