Man has always wanted to be able to fly - give him a pair of wings and he will be happy - although of course this reality is precluded from him. On the other hand, it has the ability to learn language and communicate by nature. Flying and communicating: what is the connection? He craves a thing, but cannot have it; the other has it, and often doesn't know how to use it. Yet another demonstration of how curious life is sometimes. Put them together, however, make both work, make man fly and make him communicate with his fellows, and you have obtained Sky: Children of the Light. An indie title that perhaps (or at least hopefully) you have already heard of, which got bored of the limits of mobile platforms and decided to land elsewhere, on Nintendo Switch for example. He accompanied us for hours and hours: it was not possible to change his mind about human nature, but at least it is now possible to tell you about the quality of the porting. The conversion to Nintendo Switch First we have to tell you about the conversion on Nintendo Switch, in technical jargon, therefore, about porting. In fact, Sky: Children of the Light is not a new game: it was the summer of 2019 when Vincenzo Lettera had to review it on iOS. Then in 2020 it also arrived on Android (it took several months, however), finally now, in the summer of 2021, it also landed on Nintendo Switch (and it took more months than last time, a whole year for the 'accuracy). The good thing is that the price has remained the same, that is, it doesn't exist: Sky: Children of the Light is free, not bad, since nothing is thrown away for free; you can also synchronize the save of your smartphone, so as to recover all the contents of the account. On the other hand, the bad news is that most of the defects (but not all, be careful) already noticed by the good Vincenzo on mobile devices have in turn been transferred to Nintendo Switch. Sky: Children of the Light visually speaking you really don't miss anything The nuisances we have just mentioned practically always manifest themselves as small technical problems. Incorrect interpenetrations between the game avatar and the surrounding world, for example, or between the protagonist and the other players present (Sky: Sons of the Light is a very social title, we will mention it later). Minimal smearing in natural environments; but above all there are slowdowns, a little too frequent for our tastes. Be careful because we have always noticed the slowdowns, both in portable mode and in TV mode (Nintendo Switch, you will have noticed, it is a hybrid console), but also regardless of the game mode you have selected. There are in fact two options: one designed for graphics, the other for performance. With the first the game world is more defined, the resolution improves a bit, but you play at 30FPS; with the second the first elements are slightly sacrificed (no abrupt change though, especially in portable mode) and we move on to 60FPS. Sky: Children of the Light lets you take a friend by the hand and lead them along The frame rate, were it not for those random slowdowns that crop up from time to time, would also be rock solid, which is a shame. Because this time there isn't even the excuse of the mobile world and smartphones anymore: here we are on consoles. If a video game converts well, it runs well; if you convert it wrong, it runs wrong. Sky: Children of the Light has been converted into a sort of middle ground, but more could certainly have been done, also by virtue of its obviously small size. However, we do not doubt the arrival of future corrective patches, given that Sky: Children of the Light will inevitably have to continue to receive updates, given that the introduction of real seasons and new islands is expected. Sky: Children of the Light offers seasonal events Seasonal events or special occasions will not be missed, nor have they ever been missed. In fact, the collaboration with The Little Prince, a story by Antoine de Saint-Exupry as well as one of the most widely read literary texts ever in the world, begins today: each new season provides for the introduction of new limited-time areas to explore, with exclusive cosmetic items. In the past, Sky has proposed other variations of this type at intervals of a few months: the summer event dates back to last July 2020 (to be played at home, in complete safety, on mobile devices), while the solidarity initiatives have been more recent (one for Pride Month, last month, the other to raise funds in times of pandemic). The contents: an adventure in company The contents of Sky: Children of the Light for the moment are the same as you probably already havegutted on iOS first and then Android, or on one or the other of the two and that's it. Seven kingdoms to visit, a temple high in the sky to reach, many spirits to free, a single journey to complete: the experience of the pilgrim heading towards his destination, but on a journey where far more important than the destination itself are the stages mark the path itself. We often stop, in Sky, and reflect: first on the surrounding environment, then on our own person, and on a more, so to speak, spiritual order. For those who like shooting, shooting and running between many enemies, this is simply the most wrong gaming experience you could think of; and it's a pity really, because (but the player doesn't know it) it's this one he needs, not the others. Sky: Children of the Light offers an intense and exciting journey The main adventure of Sky: Children of the Light is certainly not marked by longevity, in the way we are used to thinking about it: four hours, maximum five, taking it easy with all the calm of this world and the other, but in the end the story ends, even with an ending a little different from all the rest, and on which we must remain silent. Of course, nothing prevents you from being able to start over with all the good things about cosmetic objects that have been obtained in the meantime: indeed, you have to do it, because the second soul of the production is precisely the social one (in short, social, in the sense of the sociality that arises with others present). Sky: Children of the Light and the social component Precisely because Sky: Children of the Light was conceived as a journey, both as an emotional experience (an expression that is too complex in the face of a title that is all in all so simple), but above all as an adventure to be enjoyed in company. In company means: with strangers or acquaintances, online. Be careful because words are not needed in this case, although the game chat is present - upon request, only in the main hub. Verbal communication, in Sky, is more for the expectations of the public than for structural necessity. The characters don't talk, nobody talks: you communicate with gestures, with actions, and above all with candles, which are also the main currency. A candle is offered to the other player, and he can accept it; you can make friends and join hands, as two children would do, and one of the two, in a leap of trust, lets himself be guided by the other. No competition, no weapons, no scores: we move forward together. If this is not the fundamental soul of every human experience, we would not be able to say what humanity is. Sky: Children of the Light was already beautiful to look at, now it's even more comfortable to play Finally, a mention for the controls, which on many occasions had made players suffer on mobile devices. If you want, you can also use them on Nintendo Switch, it's the beauty of having bought a hybrid console (obviously only in portable mode though); and it is undeniable that at least navigation through the menus is particularly intuitive via the touch screen. If, on the other hand, you have longed for the use of a controller, this is the right moment: the writer has used the usual Pro Controller, but all the other available configurations are supported, except for the single Joy-Con. After all, the controls have been adapted in a very intuitive way: you light the candle with Y, you call the main objective with A, you jump with B (twice to fly) and so on.", "date": "2021-07-07", "grade": "9.0"}
