{"name": "24: Special Ops", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/24-special-ops.html", "text": "It often happens that successful films and TV series are transformed into video games, and the world of wireless gaming has always been attentive to this phenomenon. In the case of 24: Special Ops, however, things are different than usual: the game is based on a TV series based on an innovative idea, in which events occur according to a real timeline and each episode corresponds to one hour of the twenty-four total, making up a season. The tie-in created in 2006 presented itself with an effective structure, based however on a functional technical realization and nothing more. For this ~second episode~, Digital Chocolate tries to do things in a big way, looking above all for fidelity: each stage is introduced by sequences identical to those seen in the TV series, with dialogues between Jack and his support colleagues, while the game itself has three different settings that alternate: action, driving and puzzle. The action game-style sections, which represent the majority, see us controlling Jack in an isometric context, therefore with the character moving along diagonals (which on the joystick, fortunately, translate into the four standard directions) and must explore small locations full of enemies. Our agent is armed with a pistol and can possibly pick up a machine gun or grenades, or he can shoot at explosive bins capable of defeating even out-of-reach opponents. We will have to deal with a very simple combat system, which allows us to open a firefight head-on or to assassinate silently, with an automatic action that starts when we reach an enemy from behind. To shoot, you must hold down the 5 key as soon as an opponent is within range: a ~circle~ will appear around him which represents the effectiveness of the shot, deadly if the circle closes. It is not necessary to fight always risking being injured, for this there are elements that you can take cover behind, and then attack at the right time. The driving sections are much simpler, you simply steer a car while avoiding traffic and applying the brake if necessary (the accelerator is automatic). Finally, as regards the puzzles, we will find several and each with a peculiar system: in some cases we will have to decipher messages (a rather difficult and not at all fun practice), in others we will have to force mechanisms or rotate circuits to let the current pass (a bit like it happens in Bioshock). The technical realization of the game is divided between ups and downs. Clearly, the action sections are the best ones, with fairly well-made sprites, with decent but a little jerky animations. The driving phases are much more approximate, in particular they show a very uninspired use of colors, which makes the vehicles all very similar. In general, one cannot cry out for a miracle, the developers have done their job discreetly but without going beyond the average of the genre. The same can be said for the sound, made up of the usual selection of MIDI music that doesn't disturb but doesn't excite either. The control system performs well in every situation, with an immediate response to inputs and without any problems: you need to get used to the issue of diagonal movements, but it takes just a few minutes for everything to go the right way. PRO Very faithful to the TV series Technically discreet Fun action sections... AGAINST ...but too short Mediocre driving stages Short lived", "date": "2008-03-11", "grade": "S.V."}
