Well, the Finnish developers of Rovio Mobile do not agree with this assumption, and Angry Birds embodies their interpretation of birds: short-tempered, vengeful and determined. The protagonists of the game of the moment, at the top of the sales rankings on the App Store, are in fact combative little birds, who don't take it well if someone dares to annoy them and are ready to do anything to gain respect... even turning into kamikaze attackers from the overwhelming destructive power. Let's face it: the Rovio product looks terribly like Digital Chocolate's Crazy Penguin Catapult, also available on the App Store at the same price (79 cents), however there are some differences that make the two titles ~side-by-side~ rather than alternative to one another. In Crazy Penguin Catapult it is the penguins who carry out kamikaze attacks and their targets are large polar bears, but the ~launch~ phase is set separately from the ~impact~ phase and therefore the ~trajectory~ element is not taken into consideration nor is there a physical and inertial context to take into account to regulate one's shots. In Angry Birds we are witnessing a unification of the two phases, with the birds that are launched using a large ~slingshot~ and depending on the trajectory and the strength of the maneuver they can hit their targets or not. The latter are made up of green pigs who often take shelter behind constructions made of different materials, more or less resistant to attacks, whose reactions are regulated by different physics. For example, the ~basic~ redbirds can break wooden boards but not stone ones, which resist multiple hits. In any case, an apparently incorrect launch can have repercussions in the following instants: perhaps the impact with the structure in which the piglets are barricaded may have caused a movement of the walls, which then end up collapsing on the occupants. Birds on the verge of a nervous breakdown The numbers of Angry Birds are certainly exciting: a total of one hundred and five stages, divided into five settings that each culminate in a sort of ~boss fight~, in this case a particularly complex level in which victory must be achieved through an inevitable series of trials and mistakes. The piglets gradually become more cunning and resistant, they wear protections that make them harder to eliminate and they take shelter inside even rather complex structures, the walls of which can only be demolished if the right strategy is implemented. The birds at our disposal are not all the same, on the contrary: by advancing in the stages, new types are unlocked which can ~split~ in the air to widen the impact area, make ~sprints~ which increase their starting point, release real bombs or explode themselves. It is not possible to decide the launch sequence, so we find ourselves having to manage the battery that the game makes available to us every time: the first bird can be used to quickly eliminate an isolated target, the next one can be used to make the most of the damage due to its unique abilities, and so on. The ~slingshot~ must be activated by dragging it with the fingers, and each launch leaves a trajectory on the screen which can then be traveled again or which can serve as a reference point to hit targets higher or lower. It is also possible to zoom out on the scenario to get an idea of the distances and its composition, while in case of wrong launches you can reset the level and start it over (but clearly the trajectories already marked will disappear). The technical sector of the game is excellent, with essential but spot on audio and lively and colorful graphics, which make the sympathy of the ~angry birds~ its strong point.
