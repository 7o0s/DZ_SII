Well, this is precisely the story from which Apocalypse Meow: Save the Last Humans starts: in a more or less distant future, the feline troops organize themselves to carry out a devastating attack on humans and destroy the planet. They are their all-time enemies, the dogs, the only ones to oppose and try to save their masters, now adrift in space. On board a ship piloted by the agile Laika or by the robust Maverick, our goal in the game will be to face a fairly long single player campaign capable of offering a consistent challenge, within nine levels whose contents change dynamically thanks to a procedural generator. In terms of structure, the references to Sky Force 2014 are immediately evident, given that the progression is managed in the exact same way, namely through an achievement system based on four objectives that must be completed to collect the stars needed to unlock the next mission. However, succeeding in it will not be easy at all and it will be necessary to play and replay the same stages to collect the minerals necessary to buy upgrades. In fact, once we take the field, we will only be able to obtain momentary upgrades for the fire frequency or energy restoration kits, useful but not decisive for success. Also considering the presence of different degrees of difficulty, it is clear how the developers wanted to emphasize each individual level rather than risk offering an ethereal experience, unable to leave a mark. Apocalypse Meow: Save the Last Humans is an excellent ~old school~ shoot'em-up, albeit with some flaws Purrrfect? Apocalypse Meow: Save the Last Humans boasts a good technical sector, albeit not at the level of the aforementioned Sky Force 2014 (in particular the music, which we have often found not very suitable for the context), and an immediate and rather precise touch control system, with the possibility of passing from absolute to relative reference: in the first case the spacecraft moves exactly following the position of our finger on the screen, in the second case it draws the same trajectories, however leaving us free to move our hand. Unfortunately, there is no sensitivity adjustment that can improve responsiveness to inputs, which is not always very punctual and indeed marred by minimal latency, which however becomes noticeable during the most agitated phases of the action. This factor also forces you to often lift your finger and ~drag~ to be able to cover the entire width of the scenario, although this practice is made more interesting by a ~bullet time~ which occurs precisely when we release the pressure, in order to better manage situations criticisms. Secondly, the problem that afflicts many vertical scrolling shooters for smartphones and tablets remains: the lack of a ~free zone~ in the lower part of the display where you can place your fingers to avoid covering portions of the view, which is not exactly desirable when from every corner could come from enemy vehicles, projectiles or asteroids. Speaking of these elements, the achievements we mentioned above revolve around the destruction of hostile ships and space rocks, as well as the recovery of adrift human beings, who will then be delivered to a large support unit before the end of the mission and any boss fights. The latter use the traditional ~compartment~ approach, with large enemies characterized by various points to hit and as many mouths of fire as they become more precise and dangerous. The entire experience can be enjoyed completely free of charge, provided you have a little patience for the inevitable initial grind and the high cost of certain upgrades. Starting from the third mission, the freemium mechanisms are then manifested, with an in-game shop that allows you to buy credits or eliminate advertising (however not very invasive): an intelligent way to allow anyone to try the game and understand if they like it or not. less before investing some money.", "date": "2015-08-15", "grade": "7.8"}
