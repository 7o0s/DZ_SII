{"name": "Neverwinter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121401-neverwinter-i-giorni-di-neverwinter.html", "text": "The Realms are a very dear setting both to fans of paper role-playing games, those who have rolled a die on the table at least once by playing the part of a Dungeons & Dragons character, and to gamers who in the last twenty years have been able experience the incredible adventures designed especially by BioWare, Black Isle Studios and Obsidian Entertainment in their Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights. With the latter, the most recent effort of Cryptic Studios does not share only part of the title. Strengthened by the experience obtained at the helm of the mediocre Champions Online and Star Trek Online, the Californian developer has embarked on a new path that combines some of the most ~in~ features of the moment: microtransactions, to begin with, but also an editor that allows players to generate their own content. What's more, Neverwinter is completely free to play. Just register on the official website and download the client to venture into the lands explored by mythical characters such as Drizzt Do'Urden and Bruenor Battlehammer. But is it also a good MMO? What is beautiful is not beautiful... Let us immediately remove this pebble from our shoe: the technical sector. Compared to the competition, Neverwinter comes out with broken bones. He has incredibly evocative locations on his side: the ramparts of Neverwinter beyond the introductory areas of the game; the Cloak Tower looming above us under a full moon; the peaks of Icespire projected towards the sky. The glance is always over the top, and some dull textures are forgiven here and there when contrasted by an enormous amount of detail, especially indoors, and a minimum of interaction with the environment: a characteristic quite atypical in the MMO market, this one, and of no practical use, but which increases the sense of immersion and interaction with the surrounding world. Chests and furniture are often swept away by our sword blows, drapes and sheets fold as we pass. From a purely visual point of view, the Forgotten Realms have been reconstructed with great care, and fans of the universe created by Ed Greenwood will surely appreciate the work done by Cryptic Studios. The problem, more than anything else, is everything else. The character models, to begin with, which despite the variety of races are all united by a low polygonal count and a general rough and unpleasant modeling. The fair amount of customization options don't make it easy to create characters that look like they came out of a PlayStation 2; the jerky animations by stylistic choice do not make their woodiness less evident; the disappointing variety of gear worn throughout much of the game doesn't incentivize looking for new loot. And despite the sobriety of light and particle effects, with a strong predisposition for lens flare, the fights tend to generate a lot of confusion. The fault lies above all with the high latency generated by the location of the servers outside Europe: if this problem is felt above all in the city during the busiest hours of the day, still allowing you to play without particular problems in dungeons and instanced areas, the real pains are felt when facing other players in PvP. We will come back to it later, that of the lag is just another of the technical flaws that frame a barely sufficient technical sector, in which the postcard backgrounds and the engaging soundtrack composed by Kevin Manthei that evoke those of the old-fashioned western RPGs stand out above all. Who needs dice? Since we played the Guardian Warrior and the Control Mage in the Beta phase, we played as a Heavily Armed Warrior and a Devout Cleric for the release: the Trickster Rogue remained out of the game, but unfortunately Neverwinter allows you to create a maximum of two characters, unless you start shelling out money for additional slots. The classes are few, it is true, but sufficiently differentiated: we did not have the feeling, for example, that the Guardian was nothing more than the ~tank~ counterpart of the Heavily Armed Warrior, but a class on its own, characterized by completely different mechanics . For those expecting the traditional role of the healer, the Devoted Cleric class particularly struck us for its emphasis on attack rather than healing, produced through less direct means. It's a shame, then, that Cryptic is still on the high seas when it comes to class balancing; some appeared to us to be markedly more versatile than others, with the Devout Cleric playing the factotum and the Trickster Thief overly lethal andespecially in the PvP field. The possibility of acquiring a CPU-controlled companion who accompanies us everywhere, just like in Star Wars: The Old Republic, is certainly appreciable, also because from the twentieth level onwards the game gets much harder and we find ourselves quaffing potions continuously ; in this sense, for practically every class the choice of the first companion falls on the cleric, a choice that kills the imagination of the groups a little but which proves to be very useful. The fully action combat system will make RPG purists set in the Forgotten Realms universe turn up their noses. In this case, Cryptic has worked on the ideas already proposed with its previous MMOs, drawing not too cryptic inspiration from what has been seen in recent action titles such as Guild Wars 2 and TERA. From the latter, Neverwinter borrows the ~viewfinder~ control system, which during the first few minutes is a bit uncomfortable, mostly due to how every other element of the interface is managed via keyboard and shortcuts. Our character attacks in the direction towards which the crosshair points (and an interesting routine provides to hit the target when he ~understands~ what our target is) and the player finds himself pressing the keys like a madman: those of the mouse are dedicated to normal attacks, a few keys on the keyboard govern special attacks, daily abilities, ~at will~ abilities, and a few more. The final result is convincing for an action game, a little less so for an MMORPG: the skills that operate during a fight are objectively few, and the usefulness of many is decidedly questionable. Mostly, as you progress through the levels, you replace the ones you learned at the beginning, and you practically never use them again. A minimum of RPG component is perceived with the distribution of some bonus points between the statistics and the choice of a specialization that underlines our style of play, but otherwise Neverwinter is a real third-person action game where you furiously press the mouse keys and you dodge enemy attacks, anticipating them based on their animations or danger signals projected on the ground. Fun, but in the long run decidedly repetitive, also because the enemies tend to follow all the same attack patterns, divided by category or species, including bosses: the latter prove to be absolutely disappointing, not too different from any more harmful and hardy, defended against waves of henchmen. There are few truly original or complex mechanics in these patience exercises; the dynamics of World of Warcraft, Rift or Star Wars: The Old Republic encounters are definitely on another planet. Users to the rescue And that is precisely the biggest weakness of Neverwinter, an endgame consisting practically only of the continuous repetition of the various dungeons in search of new equipment to keep for oneself or to sell at auction. The PvP alternative is to be excluded until Cryptic has carried out a painstaking work of balancing the classes: if the first matches may even seem fun, by investigating the question one realizes the poverty of the maps in which one fights and above all the imbalance of forces that are created on the field due to classes with builds that offer far too many advantages in terms of damage and crowd control, also due to a superficial management of both the interactions between the negative effects of skills and dedicated equipment especially for PvP. The absence of a real purpose relegates Neverwinter's PvP to the corner of simple pastimes, together with an interesting crafting system in management not dissimilar to what was seen in Star Wars: The Old Republic (invisible NPCs working on behalf of the player, who limits himself to choosing the desired product and waiting for the minutes necessary to produce it) but not particularly useful or captivating in terms of results and in the quality and quantity of craftable objects, almost always lower than what can be obtained through dungeons. Dungeon farming is pretty much all a player can do to complete character growth; a rather tedious procedure, above all because the dungeons, however evocative they may be from a graphic point of view, are long labyrinths punctuated by repetitive fights and without surprises. It's a stark contrast to the leveling experience, which we found much more rewarding. While not telling a particularly original or cinematic story, Neverwinter takes the player by the hand and leads him through a series of areas where the missions proposed by the NPCs in their little quest-hubs don't seem like the usual quests of an MMO tany heme-park, but part of a larger design that often leads us into instanced mini-dungeons, skirmishes and areas full of monsters to complete small objectives that repeatedly recall the atmospheres of Dungeons & Dragons. In this sense, the areas divided by loadings (the world of Neverwinter is not seamless) and not exactly generous in size tend to make the experience linear, but no less fun and carefree, characterized by small details such as cutscenes, dubbed texts and allies well-characterized temps who do their best to immerse us in the world of the Forgotten Realms before the wall of mundane endgame and microtransactions rises in front of us. It's at that point that the community steps in, thanks to the pack's feature that we found most interesting: the Foundry mode. Already experienced by Cryptic in its previous MMOs, the Foundry returns in a revised, corrected, expanded and enhanced version to provide players with all the means necessary to design a mission on their own. It takes some time to learn how to use it, but the results are guaranteed and with a few hours of practice you can design real dynamic missions divided into multiple stages complete with bosses and final rewards. Once the work is completed, everything is loaded and the judgment of the players is awaited, who through a convenient interface can scroll through the list of published Foundry missions at any time and participate in one of them, perhaps commenting on it and even evaluating it once it is finished . The imagination of the players, in this case, is boundless: we go from epic missions that far exceed those proposed by Cryptic itself to amusing antics peppered with quotes and pop culture. There is no shortage of room for improvement, of course, but the Foundry system is definitely the beating heart of the game, full of potential especially for videogame role-playing lovers who will truly find in it the possibility of role-playing in the face of dedicated servers in other MMORPGs. Neverwinter has a lot of good ideas, but hard work will have to be done to improve the PvE and PvP endgame Pay to win? To conclude, it is appropriate to say a few words about the microtransaction model adopted by Perfect World. With a first expansion arriving in August, Neverwinter is already trying to dispel the myth that free-to-play games are inferior in quality to those with monthly subscription; the game developed by Cryptic Studios is free, as we said, but it is obvious that somehow the staff has to earn. Hence the decision to offer an e-shop accessible at any time from the game interface, just like it happens in many other MMOs such as Guild Wars 2 or The Secret World. The solutions adopted by Cryptic, however, have left us rather perplexed. We would like to underline that throughout the leveling phase we have never felt the need, not even once, to put a hand in the wallet: the game offers all the means necessary to reach the maximum level without spending a penny, while perhaps tempting the player with some paid facilities that you can do without anyway. On the other hand, the management of the multiple currencies necessary to buy this or that is confusing: there are silver and gold coins with which basic necessities such as potions and basic objects are bought; there are various types of coinage with which to buy special items, mostly aesthetic, including a slightly insane one that resets if you don't connect once every twenty-four hours; there is Zen, the currency into which real money is translated, which can be spent both to buy comfort items and to transform them into astral diamonds. The latter are the main currency of the game, which often replaces the mint and which can be earned in many different ways: by completing daily missions, dungeons, etc. Almost everything that is ~cool~ costs astral diamonds, but the real problem is that it costs so many and the most innocuous bonus can take hours and hours of farming. The horrific conversion rate between Zen and Astral Diamonds doesn't help: Neverwinter has no competitive PvP or PvE scene yet, and the market suffers the consequences. Scattered here and there, then, there are small pitfalls designed to appeal to the most reckless player: you should pay to successfully perform a spell at maximum power, otherwise the process will fail; one would have to pay to instantly complete a crafting that would take hours; you would have to pay to maximize the mount's speed or recall your companion from a training phase that would last a little too long; we got the idea.
