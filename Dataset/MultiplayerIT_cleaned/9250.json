Alongside this particular jumble of playful modern antiques, a sort of mini pinball machine was often proudly displayed, equipped with a small steering wheel intended to move a plane anchored inside it; the surface, full of holes, must have been crossed by a sphere, whose movement was precisely managed through the movements of the plane thanks to the small steering wheel. While it is now unthinkable to find such obsolete entertainment pearls, the concept behind this machine has practically given way to a playful video genre, the ~ball-roller~, a subset of the puzzle one and which had as an illustrious precedent, among others, the legendary Kula World for PS One. In Gears however, in the universal version for iOS, it will not be only the spheres that move quickly ... Turning of gears Once Gears has started we will find ourselves driving a ball towards a ~rescue funnel~, through a whole series of corridors, passages, suspension bridges but, above all, gears. The whole game environment is in fact alive, responds to physical laws and actively participates in the path of the sphere: in particular, the ever-moving cogwheels can have a positive or negative influence on crossing a portion of the journey, carrying the ball with them by simple centrifugal force. Given the particular nature of the title in question, it is easy to imagine the importance of a control system up to par: however, from this point of view the situation reflects a curious ambivalence. In fact, if you choose to guide the ball using your fingers (with a kind of virtual push), everything seems easier and less frustrating, thanks to the almost unnatural ~obedience~ that the ball has towards the player's fingertips; however, by activating the accelerometers, the situation changes radically. The first consequence of the change of input is in fact the impossibility of fully playing the title while lying down or in any case in a more relaxed position, due to the need to keep the device parallel to the ground; moreover, the governability of the protagonist sphere drops drastically, managing to become almost frustrating. There are essentially two types of approach: with the fingers, sacrificing ~realism~ in favor of manoeuvrability, and with the accelerometers, closer to the physical sensations from which the game draws its inspiration but experiencing almost dramas to always keep the movements under control. check. Bonuses of various types and other categories of obstacles are scattered along the way, such as tunnels or trampolines on which to bounce to reach the highest points; finally, there are also mobile platforms, with strategic holes to avoid or unsafe, guaranteeing a more than discreet variation on the theme. However, the element that manages to give that extra pinch of frenzy (and, in some cases, anguish) in tackling the various levels is certainly the inexorable passing of the stopwatch, which forces you to waste as little time as possible to pass an internship , under penalty of a very low score; as easy to imagine however, haste is a bad adviser and falls due to the desire to arrive first will be inevitable, often right close to the finish line. Luckily a checkpoint system helps to reduce cursing in case of multiple falls, but not the passage of time: consequently, even after reaching the checkpoints, once the stopwatch is reset the only option is to restart the scheme from the beginning. However, where Gears deserves a special honorable mention is in the technical sector, which manages to be perfectly adequate depending on the devices on which it is installed: the Crescent Moon Games title in fact supports both the Retina display and the new power of iPad 2, working but equally excellently also on 3GS and on the first iPads. In general, the graphics are very colorful and very defined, with the three environments of the 27 levels well characterized (ranging from a classic Steampunk style of the first world inside a volcano in the second, ending with beautiful underground caverns of the last ); no framerate problems, good music and full Game Center support conclude the features of this particular puzzle game.
