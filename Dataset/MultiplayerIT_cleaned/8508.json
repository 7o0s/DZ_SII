In the film, the character played by Will Smith suddenly finds himself dealing with alien criminals, only to discover that large numbers of mostly peaceful extraterrestrials have been residing on our planet for decades now and are being controlled by special forces above the government. , the Men in Black. The plot of Men in Black: Alien Crisis is very similar in the sense that it once again presents us with a ~rookie~ who joins the MIB during an emergency and has to prove that he can handle certain situations. This time, however, the protagonist is not a policeman, but a professional thief, Peter Delacoeur, who carries out the theft of a mysterious Egyptian artifact on behalf of a shady businessman. The coup is successful, but the client proves unwilling to conclude the transaction amicably, and so Peter ends up in the crossfire of alien troops who seem to want to recover the object at all costs. For what? What secret is he hiding? The charming agent C and the tiny agent F (the talking carletto) will explain it to us during a series of levels characterized by a structure similar to that of rail shooters, interspersed with investigative sections in which we will have to find the clues necessary to route investigations in a particular direction. The title, developed by Fun Labs for Activision, features a story mode and some ~virtual missions~ that take place within the Men in Black simulator, and can be played using the Wii-mote and Nunchuk freely or by inserting controller in the Wii Zapper or in the Top Shot Elite, two adapters that increase the degree of involvement of the experience by allowing us to literally hold a rifle, but which from the point of view of precision and ergonomics present very few differences compared to the default setting . Hide and shoot As mentioned above, the gameplay of Men in Black: Alien Crisis basically takes up that of rail shooters, while adopting a third-person view and allowing us to move the character to make him move from one shelter to another. The internships consist of a sequence of more or less long and demanding shootings, in which to fund our arsenal by taking up some of the weapons also seen in the films, which can also be upgraded using the experience points earned. It is possible to change weapons using the d-pad of the Wii-mote, and do the same (holding down the C button on the Nunchuk) to change the special power among the four available: a barrier that momentarily protects us from enemy fire, a device capable of lock up the opponents in large bubbles and make them harmless, a freezing ray and an anti-gravity grenade, which once exploded makes the aliens rise so that they can be targeted in complete tranquility. The ambush system is active, in the sense that you have to press a button (A) for Peter to take cover, then act on the analog stick to bring him out to place some shots. Some tools also have a sniper mode, the activation of which is, however, at least cumbersome: you have to give the Nunchuk a ~hit~, and unfortunately this maneuver is not always implemented correctly, on the contrary. Collision detection also leaves a little to be desired, given that sometimes you have the clear sensation of having hit an enemy but this remains standing, as if nothing had happened. In some levels these mechanics are enriched by the stealth element, forcing us to disable the surveillance cameras in a certain way and only then to eliminate the aliens, under penalty of game over. Fortunately, the checkpoints are very numerous and the degree of challenge, in general, particularly low. Extraterrestrial, take me away The firefights of Men in Black: Alien Crisis sometimes culminate in a boss fight, and in this case the opponents are distinguished by an exaggerated resistance to blows, which makes these sections longer and more demanding than one might expect. One of the first bosses, the carnivorous plant, is particularly difficult to beat, for example, while on other occasions it is the view management system (which depends on the aiming reticle and, therefore, on the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote) that create most of the difficulties. As written at the beginning, however, in the game you don't just shoot and there are at least two variations on the theme: the first is represented by chases aboard the MIB flying car, with the vehicle having to avoid traps and mines (by tilting the controller ) while trying to take out enemies; the second, indeed extremely flat and boring, sees us explore certain scenarios, make dodgesoni looking for clues and try our hand at dialogues that almost irritate the eye to the adventure genre, even if it turns out to be a trivial expedient to lengthen the broth. The technical sector is bad: beyond a discreet dubbing in Italian, the Activision product has little to brag about. The graphics, in particular, make use of simple, angular and badly animated polygonal models, which move within excessively anonymous and lacking in detail scenarios. Not to mention the frame rate, which maintains a certain fluidity only in calm situations, ending up visibly collapsing when different characters appear on the screen.", "date": "2012-05-31", "grade": "4.5"}
