That is why, despite the feeling of being lost, we always find our way. We could call intuition into question, while in reality the fluidity of the action is due to the careful arrangement of the elements. Shapes and lights suggest visual cues that our eyes send to the mind for quick decoding. Thus, without realizing it, we know what to do. Yet the game immediately informs us that Lucy is lost, whereas Lucy is probably us. We got lost but we naturally find our way through the alien architectures of NaissanceE. How come? Perhaps the meaning should be sought in the title of the game, which suggests a birth, a natural process written in the genes of women and the creatures they carry. So the path we have to take, sometimes familiar, sometimes incomprehensible and scary, could be a way to suggest the trauma of coming into the world. A section of the game is in fact called Breath Compression, and is made up of tubular tunnels: could it be a representation of the vaginal canal? Not to mention the previous section, Going Down. It all comes back. Or maybe the meaning is to be found elsewhere, simply in the gaming experience. It's not the why that matters, but the how. If you want to experience the restlessness of an exploration that disorients and stimulates the imagination, NaissanceE is an excellent choice. Especially if you love bold architectures that often recall the designs of M.C. Escher, with structures full of stairs and arches that run after each other. Almost all environments are formed by solid three-dimensional structures, devoid of texture and mostly in white, black and gray. The exception is a large outdoor section, which is very reminiscent of the Journey screens. But it is just an exception. Lights and shadows, cold and square shapes are the norm. No game interface; only, from time to time, the name of the new section we are entering that appears on the screen. Apart from the rare textual communications, therefore, we are left with geometric shapes and splendid music. These in particular seem to be an expression of their surroundings, and at times one gets the impression that the tone of the melody interprets the moods of a higher will mocking our efforts. However, it is useless to try to escape: when nature calls, the body responds. So, let's get started. An alien architecture, an incomprehensible project: will you find the exit of NaissanceE? To the exit The aim of the game is to find the right path and progress in exploration, nothing more, at least in terms of structure. Usually the visual clues take the form of a white light in the distance, or a departure of the architecture from the forms seen up to that moment. As we said in the first paragraph, it is not difficult to guess the path, even if sometimes there are dead ends and even large sections that lead nowhere - always in terms of gameplay, because the feeling of being faced with a great mystery that give rise to these dead-end digressions certainly cannot be defined as ~nothing~. Sometimes the game is openly diabolical, such as when it draws us under a half-open door to lead us along endless floors of descending stairs: after no less than forty-five landings, all identical, we have the doubt that we have ended up trapped and, rather than go back up, we thought it best to reload, thus discovering that that section was called coincidentally Dumb Choice (stupid choice). The structures vary greatly in form. There are stacks of cubes that defy gravity and immense cities that you build on the void, populated by masterless mechanical systems that repeat their task endlessly. There are tunnels, black ziggurats, vast deserts, skyscrapers, interiors reminiscent of space bases and fans shot through by luminous discharges. But also heaps of geometric foam that look like large crawling worms to ride in an exciting crossing at dizzying heights. The arrangement of the elements and the architectural conception of NaissanceE are the result of meticulous work, and in fact a large part of the pleasure of the game derives from stopping to admire the panorama and delving into its geometries. It's called labor for a reason But this alien world is also hostile. There are then sections with dangerous suspended platforms and puzzles to solve. While on the one hand it makes sense to think that a reality different from ours offers natural obstacles, on the other hand the progression of the game does not justify the constant interruptions. Some sections of platforms, it should be said, feel a sense of vertigo a beneficio of exploration, but unfortunately most of them only cause burning frustration, because the first person view is the most uncomfortable for this kind of mechanics. The problem mainly derives from the fact that the control points are very distant from each other and you cannot save at will. In addition to the blind rage that takes every player forced to repeat a passage dozens of times that offers no tangible reward, other than being able to continue, there is the added fact that dying so often interrupts the flow of exploration. However, a few days ago (with respect to the publication date of this article) a patch was released that fixes some bugs and mitigates the severity of the platform sections, especially in the two more sadistic levels. A welcome improvement, no doubt, but the fact remains that these mechanics could have remained marginal. We suspected that they were introduced more for the desire to make the game last a few hours longer, perhaps for fear of the silly criticisms of the duration of video games that fall on every title regardless of the context. In short, however you want to see it, coming into the world is not a walk in the park, and this must be taken into account. As for the puzzles, however, things are much better because, in addition to being rarer, they are also quite simple. For example, the writer, who doesn't like puzzles very much, managed to overcome them without difficulty, thanks also to the fact that sometimes a little random evidence helps to find the solution. One last comment on the ride. With such vast spaces in front of us it's natural to run, and thank goodness Lucy doesn't get tired. But we could get tired, intent on waiting to get to the end of a very long corridor with a key pressed. Here then a mechanic as simple as it is brilliant comes to our aid. In order not to run out of momentum we must press the mouse button in time when a circle appears on the screen. Lucy's breath thus keeps up with the pace of the race, and we don't just sit around with our hands folded. It seems like a small thing, but instead it's a touch of class in the design of a game that owes everything to its superb structure.", "date": "2014-02-25", "grade": "8.0"}
