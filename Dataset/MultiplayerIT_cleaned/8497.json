In fact, the player controls the Salvation spacecraft, with the task of reaching the main cities of the planet and offering the survivors the possibility of being brought to safety. Not an easy operation, given that the aliens will understand when we are about to land and will appear from every direction to attack us and kill the people who try to escape, and who will be able to say they are safe only once on board. The game provides us with three different locations (New York, Frankfurt and Shenzhen) and a substantial achievement system that records our performance and allows us to unlock prizes as well as participate in world rankings, organized by region, similar to what happens in twin analog shooter for PlayStation 3 Dead Nation. However, these are only side elements to the actual action which, as mentioned, takes place with a first-person view and sees us commanding the turrets of the Salvation to eliminate any threat that appears around the landing area, possibly before this launch your own attack and/or kill one of the survivors running towards our position. Defend your homeland, save the world The control system of Razor: Salvation is typical of FPS on iOS devices, with the important difference that we cannot move but only shoot, and therefore the command to open fire is independent and can be operated precisely, according to must. With the right thumb we can therefore move the viewfinder 360 degrees, frame the enemies and then eliminate them by pressing the ~fire~ button with the left thumb. In these terms, the interface immediately reveals itself as the best possible, provided you increase the sensitivity of the movement, which by default forces you to perform numerous ~drags~ to make the view go around completely. Problems come when you have to manage the rich arsenal available to the ship. This is because the gameplay itself, based on the promptness in eliminating the opponents, also due to a thin shield system devoid of any defense, prevents us from wasting time, even more so when a few minutes pass and the threats multiply; all in the tradition of a survival approach that we have never frowned upon and which, in the specific case of the title developed by Blowfish Studios, we consider really out of place. Two of our weapons have infinite ammunition, in this case the minigun and the auto-cannon, but you have to reload them manually before the bullets in the barrel run out or you have to put up with rather long reload times, with all that this may entail. All other weapons have limited ammunition, which must be purchased by spending the money earned on the mission, which can also be spent on essential upgrades. The problem is the way you switch from one weapon to another: you have to touch an icon on the right side of the touch screen, then touch the weapon you want to use from those in the list. During this operation it is impossible to defend yourself, which soon leads us to not care about the equipment and use only the minigun and the auto-cannon in alternation. Too bad there are also problems with the ~reload~ button: tiny, not very visible and really difficult to press correctly. On the technical front, however, nothing to complain about: the musical theme is really beautiful and in line with the atmosphere of the game, even if it is limited to the starting screen, while the graphics show a high level of detail and an unprecedented interaction with the scenarios , which change their appearance according to the weapons with which we hit them.", "date": "2012-06-14", "grade": "6.2"}
