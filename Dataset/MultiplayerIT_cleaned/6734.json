Start from the bottom and avoid the many obstacles, climbing tooth and nail in an attempt to climb higher and higher, until you find your place among the stars. And it is precisely from the stars that, four years later, Mrgan and Comi wanted to start again, with a much more ambitious project than The Incident. Space Age: A Cosmic Adventure took three years to develop, and is an old-fashioned graphic adventure based on space travel, alien planets and mysterious civilizations. Space Age is an adventure that harks back to 50's science fiction and point and click games by LucasArts and Sierra We are no longer in Kansas When we say Space Age is an ~old-school~ game, we mean it in two different senses. First of all, the Big Bucket adventure openly refers to the old point and clicks of LucasArts and Sierra, drawing inspiration for style and humor from classics of the caliber of Beneath a Steel Sky, The Dig and Monkey Island. The mix of light dialogues and space adventure recalls the Space Quest series at every level, while the cast of characters, each with their own role within the equipment, seems to wink at all listening Trekkers. Unlike the graphic adventures just mentioned, however, Space Age opts for a bird's eye view and scenarios that are almost always obscured by a sort of fog of war. As you move through the environment, the darkness that covers it gradually thins out, making previously hidden areas and details visible. This idea clearly taken from the real-time strategy classics, not only emphasizes the aura of mystery surrounding an alien planet, but above all stimulates the player to explore every corner of the map, especially if you want to complete some secondary objectives (absolutely optional) proposed for each level. However, Space Age is also ~old school~ in the way it tells the space epic of the protagonists, with the somewhat naive history and technologies that characterized the films and stories of the 1950s. Among the various references, the inevitable space rocket that refers to the Aggregate missiles, references to RX-M Destinazione Luna and even a cameo by the robot Robby from the film Forbidden Planet. The plot features a soldier from Kansas who in an alternate 1976 lands on the planet Kepler-16, in order to search for life forms and collect an alien mineral called Nucleum. From here on, an adventure that is not too long (it took us just over three hours to finish the fourteen chapters) but varied and rhythmic enough to never get bored until the credits screen. The developers have interspersed the story with black and white flashbacks, journeys into the depths of the protagonist's psyche and interactive hieroglyphs, but Big Bucket's attempt to keep the experience fresh lies also and above all in the different gameplay ideas inserted here and there between the levels. For example, in one chapter you have to drive a small means of transport in an attempt to search and collect the Nucleum; in another you have to infiltrate an alien base without being discovered by armed guards; in yet another, you defend a structure from waves of enemies by guiding different units through a tactical system that the developers add to games like Cannon Fodder and Commandos. It must be said that, although many small ideas certainly make the experience more varied, it is also true that each of these is only hinted at. Environmental puzzles or puzzles in which you interact with the inventory can be counted on the fingers of one hand, as are stealth sequences or firefights. For the latter we would almost say ~fortunately~, since they are probably among the least successful moments of the game: selecting and moving characters within the map is an operation that collides with pathfinding that is too inaccurate, and which in many occasions is the cause of annoying game overs. In short, Space Age fails to propose truly memorable situations or complex challenges, but Mrgan and Comi make up for it largely thanks to an engaging atmosphere, thanks also to the excellent and full-bodied soundtrack by Cabel Sasser, with dozens and dozens of songs that deserve to be listened to via headphones and a hilarious final song to say the least.", "date": "2014-11-24", "grade": "8.0"}
