{"name": "ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/espn-winter-x-games-snowboarding-2002_a.html", "text": "Unfortunately, or maybe not, ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding 2002 is practically identical to the original and for this reason we must expect the same strengths and weaknesses. To begin with, I tell you that, unlike SSX, ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding 2002 (henceforth simply ~Winter X~) is oriented towards the more simulative aspect of snowboarding even if there are certainly more spectacular aspects of a sport that has been made famous by acrobatic evolutions and tricks that defy the laws of gravity. To underline Konami's desire to give us a title that is above all realistic, here comes the license/sponsorship of the American sports channel ESPN which inserts the game in a television context of great scenographic effect. Winter X gives us the opportunity to perform in competitions of pure speed (Time Attack), stunts (Big Air/Halfpipe) or others that combine both disciplines (Slopestyle). We will be given the opportunity to play the role of the most acclaimed snowboard champions or to create one ourselves from scratch and make him go through the stages of a glorious career. By winning the competitions, it will also be possible to get hold of extra boards or new clothing to show off in the competitions. It seems that nothing is missing... Winter X, due to its ~simulation~ nature, brings with it all the drawbacks that this choice entails. First, forget the immediacy and ease of control of SSX! Whether you are an expert or not, your skill and patience will be put to the test by the pitfalls of the routes and the control system. The latter is perhaps a little too difficult to master, but if you arm yourself with patience, you will be able to get away with it quite easily after the first few hours of play. The routes are generally quite short and far from the variety of those admired in Amped. Nonetheless, there will be obstacles in our path and each of these will turn into an opportunity to perform tricks, grinds and whatever else our technical skills allow us. The career mode, at least initially, is far from accessible as our boarder's reduced skills and experience will make it difficult not only to perform tricks but even to remain standing after a jump. And so, between tumbles and rookie foolishness, our apprenticeship phase will end as soon as we have conquered a certain number of points useful for enhancing our skills. However, the doubt that occurs to me is that not everyone could find the patience necessary to achieve better results. From a technical point of view, if ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 could be considered an average title with regard to the PlayStation 2, the situation changes completely on the Microsoft console which has already hosted decidedly more refined games of the same genre. The graphics engine performs its task with considerable confidence but it is to be believed that such speed and fluidity is guaranteed by the lack of details or objects on the screen. XBox has accustomed us to very different standards... Things are definitely better as regards the sound, which manages to be exciting with rocking music of great vigor accompanied by other more alternative ones and with very realistic sound effects. ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 is certainly not a bad game but the problem is that the competition in the genre is too strong to allow room for a game of good simulation depth but perhaps too difficult for the regular player. Snowboard lovers will probably find the gaming experience offered by Amped more satisfying or the frenzy and spectacularity of SSX Tricky which, although more arcade-like, deserves to be tried at least once. My advice is to give ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 a chance only if you are a fanatic of the sport in question, in which case you might have found bread for your teeth. Pros: Fair number of modes Good simulation depth Good music and sound effects Cons: Difficult control system Not for everyone Graphically not up to current standards Materials: Screenshots A hot summer sun makes the days of this beginning of July scorching, millions of Italians leave for Italian and foreign shores and even our consoles enjoy their well-deserved holidays... in the snow! A few months after the debut of XBox in the world of video games, the predilection of the Microsoft console for the snowboarding genre seems increasingly clear, as evidenced by an already rich lineup of ~winter~ titles. After Amped, SSX Tricky and Dark Summit, this time it's Konami's turn to wearre suit and boots, and embark on a new descent on the snowy slopes of ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002. Once again we are faced with the conversion of a game for PlayStation 2 and it is therefore legitimate to wonder if any improvements have been made to the more than decent title appeared a few weeks ago.", "date": "2002-07-17", "grade": null}
