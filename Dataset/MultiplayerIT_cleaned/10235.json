{"name": "Auditorium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73841-auditorium-leleganza-della-musica.html", "text": "As far as the rhythm game genre is concerned, so far we have seen practically everything: games in which you have to keep the rhythm, others in which you have to compose a melody, still others in which the goal is to identify and ~draw~ a round of battery. Apple devices lend themselves naturally to this kind of applications, thanks to an operating system that makes graphics and sound work in synergy and without any problems attributable to some incompatibility with the software. Well, when a trend becomes ~inflated~ two things can happen: you continue undaunted to offer the same product, perhaps dressing it in a new dress every time, or you try to go further. Auditorium, which actually winks more at the puzzle game genre than at that of rhythm games, crosses the boundaries of mobile gaming in search of a more intense and, in some way, ~elevated~ experience. With its five acts, divided into thirty total stages, the title published by Electronic Arts is certainly not the longest-lived and most enduring of the video games available on the App Store, yet it strikes you right from the start for the combination of style, elegance and solutions as essential as they are effective, able to caress sight and hearing with a single, delicate gesture. Everything flows The game mechanics behind Auditorium is very simple: we have a black background, a certain number of ~containers~ and ~deviators~, therefore a white or colored flow that follows its own trajectory, undisturbed. Our goal in each stage is to divert the flow by dragging the devices on the screen into the right position, thus making the ~drops~ of this sort of luminous torrent pass through the containers. Once filled, these will emit different types of sounds, basically notes played by a piano. What we have to do is fill all the containers at the same time: when we've succeeded, even for just an instant, the game will reward us with an arpeggio full of atmosphere and a pass to the next level. The developers have included a series of mechanisms useful for making the game action more varied and full of depth. For example, it is possible that there are fewer devices to divert the flow than we believe are needed to complete the stage, or that the containers are located in difficult positions to reach. Or it is possible that the containers are distinguished by a particular color, for which it will be necessary to divert the flow in order to first ~color~ it through a specific area of the screen, then guide its movement up to the container. Everything works thanks to a control system based exclusively on the touch screen (no accelerometer, therefore, even if perhaps it would have been good), which even provides multitouch functions for organizing the diversion devices, which can be ~expanded~ or ~narrowed~ to change their effectiveness and energy deflection angle accordingly. As previously mentioned, Auditorium bases its charm on a series of technical solutions that are as essential as they are elegant. The visual impact is therefore not characterized by quantity or particular effects, yet the result still manages to be spectacular in its fluidity. The sound compartment accompanies alternating silences and arpeggios, literally making itself desired and then returning a great atmosphere.
