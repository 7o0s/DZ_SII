{"name": "Sky Warriors: Guerra Aerea", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sky-warriors-guerra-aerea-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Sky Warriors: Guerra Aerea turns the spotlight on a genre that is very little represented on the App Store and Google Play Store, that is, that of multiplayer-based air shooters. In fact it is a trend that does not find great correspondence even on PC and console, if we consider that for several years now a title like Ace Combat, moreover focused on the single player component, has no competition. The developers of Wildlife have therefore thought good to intercept the enthusiasm of fans by creating a freemium experience that has just concluded its period in soft launch, essential for building a solid user base to support matchmaking, and officially debuted on iOS and Android devices with a structure that currently boasts a good number of aircraft and two modes. Gameplay Sky Warriors: Aerial War, our plane approaches a cargo to shoot down A short and simple tutorial introduces us to the gameplay of Sky Warriors: Air War, placing us precisely in command of a fighter within two types of online multiplayer matches: Payload, in which you are asked to destroy or defend cargo planes; and Skirmish, in which we will have to try to eliminate a number of targets higher than that of the opposing team. There is therefore always a PvE component, perhaps introduced to limit any shortcomings of the netcode in direct confrontations, which however are still present during the games. By moving the plane with the left and right virtual analog stick, and adjusting the speed using a lever, we will be able to fly with a certain degree of agility and quickly intercept enemies. Sky Warriors: Aerial Warfare, a dogfight in the skies At that point we will be able to use the missiles that we have equipped, different in functionality and power depending on the weapons unlocked up to that moment, or the machine gun to inflict sufficient damage to destroy the target. If we are hooked by an opponent, we will be able to try evasive maneuvers or launch countermeasures to avoid being hit. In short, the formula is decidedly close to that of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (here the review), to give a recent example, but if you have spent dozens of hours with the Bandai Namco title, the structure of the only two modes available, to which only six players can participate to stage a three-on-three match, it could immediately appear rather repetitive to you. Of course, there is a progression system typical of freemium games that tries to keep the interest high over time: the inevitable prize boxes to be opened by waiting for a while, the double currency, a certain amount of planes which however we will be able to buy only with a lot of patience or by putting our wallet and gradually higher experience levels. As already mentioned, the soft launch has certainly served to create a solid user base, and in fact the matchmaking of Sky Warriors: Guerra Aerea is it always proves to be very quick and efficient, able to find us a room within a few seconds and without problems due to excessive latency or sudden falls. Graphics and sound Sky Warriors: Aerial Warfare, a scene from the introductory sequence The technical realization is certainly not the strong point of the title developed by Wildlife, which indeed makes use of an all too essential graphics, with generic assets and devoid of effects that can somehow enhance the surfaces, but at the same time heavy to be managed with maximum details and 60 fps activated on an iPhone 12 Pro. If we think that back in 2013 we were playing with a title like Fractal Combat X, which visually was decidedly ahead of Sky Warriors: Guerra Aerea, it appears clear and evident that the authors have not worked hard enough to equip their game with an adequate technical sector, with the only exception of the short introductory sequences.", "date": "2021-10-18", "grade": "7.0"}
