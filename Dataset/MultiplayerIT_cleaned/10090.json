{"name": "Band Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76210-band-hero-se-la-banda-sta-in-tasca.html", "text": "It has always taken a lot of imagination to accept the various portable versions of musical instrument games, starting from when in the living room there was ~only~ the plastic guitar of the first Guitar Hero (or Konami's Guitar Freaks for the true pioneers such). The evolution of these productions, with the advent of sets of drums, basses and microphones, have therefore made this distance even more strident, making in fact the reductions on handhelds little more than pastimes for all-round fanatics. With Band Hero for Nintendo DS, Activision tries to reverse this unpleasant trend thanks to a precious ally: plastic. Peripherals at will And the plastic is obviously that of the peripherals, because inside the voluminous package you can find both old acquaintances and new entries. In the first category goes the extension to replicate the guitar, practically identical to the one already offered in the past with Guitar Hero: On Tour; it is a kind of handle to be inserted into the GBA slot of the DS, with 4 colored buttons to be pressed in an absolutely similar way to the ~real~ plastic guitars of the main series. Picking, on the other hand, is performed by touching the console screen with the stylus. The evaluations regarding this solution remain the same as we had the opportunity to express on the occasion of the On Tour review; it is an interesting addition that certainly improves the gaming experience compared to the normal keys, but which lacks in ergonomics, making long gaming sessions a real hotbed of cramps and soreness in the wrist. Furthermore, the exclusion of the GBA slot from recent versions of the Nintendo portable, and therefore from the DSi and DSi XL, represents a significant problem considering the growing diffusion of these latest revisions. As far as the news is concerned, Activision has decided to bring a little joy also to portable drummers by creating a further solution to play this instrument; in this case it is a sort of silicone cover for the lower part of the console, to be inserted so as to cover the directional cross and the keys and then replace them with four large buttons, replicating cymbals and toms. Also in this case we are obviously talking about an object shaped on the dimensions of the DS Lite, and therefore incompatible with the other DSs. Operation is good, with sufficient reactivity, even if unlike the guitar grip it is not essential to be able to play the relative instrument; in this sense its function becomes less incisive, even in the face of the fact that the presence of the cover precludes the perfect closing of the console once the game is finished, thus adding a minimum factor of inconvenience to the whole. Lastly, voice detection via the integrated microphone should be noted, so as to allow you to sing on the available songs; however, the modest quality and sensitivity of the console hardware makes this part probably the weakest of the lot, even in the face of the need to hold the console very close to the face to get some results. As for the pure and simple gameplay, this is based entirely on the mechanics by now known to everyone: it is a question of playing the note when the colored indicator reaches the bottom of the screen. The only, but fairly interesting addition is linked to the minigames; activated by playing any instrument by pressing an icon next to that of the star power, they offer brief parentheses within the normal course of the song with amusing situations in which one is called to do crowd surfing, throw gadgets to the public and things like type. The track list, made up of 30 very pop songs and all by decidedly well-known artists (Avril Lavigne, Coldplay, Mika, Maroon 5, Gorillaz and so on), is perfectly apt for the target of the game and more generally for the console, even more that on the occasion of the two chapters of Guitar Hero: On Tour; unfortunately there is no possibility to expand the list via the online store as on living room systems, but this is a recognized limitation related to Nintendo hardware and therefore not attributable to Activision. However, where Band Hero on DS disappoints is in the available modes, which are far too limited; in fact, in single there is no career option, thus leaving as the only possibility that of tackling the single songs without particular gratifications or sensations of progress in addition to the earning of money to spend on objects and clothing for one's group. There would be Fan Requests, 50 challenges via mini-games capable of offering something more in this sense, but their release forcibly requires the connection to the versionand Band Hero's Wii. Therefore, only multiplayer remains, which however requires friends with DS and a relative copy of the game, making everything not exactly within anyone's reach.", "date": "2010-04-08", "grade": "S.V."}
