{"name": "Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-twin-cypriens-chronicles.html", "text": "The protagonist of the story is little Cyprien, a boy with a difficult character, who, after the death of his parents, found himself facing his difficult childhood in an orphanage. Cyb's life continues with many difficulties until the age of 14, the day when Cyb refuses a birthday party offered to him by his friends and after arguing with Lenny, talking teddy bear and his best friend, suddenly finds himself in a alternate world, in another dimension, where he is informed of the abduction of Lenny by the terrible Master. Who can save Lenny? Obviously Cyprien, and this is where our adventure begins. Although the basic idea is still quite interesting, the original aspect of this game could promise much more. Considering the potential of the PlayStation 2, graphically speaking, much more could certainly be done. The animations of the characters are decidedly sparse and the number of polygons can be constantly counted on the fingers of one hand without risking losing count, the frame rate regularly settles on 30 fps, which however, as we know, is not a prerogative by Evil Twin. The textures are no better, which despite a fair variety are at too low a resolution. As if all this were not enough, there is also the bad management of the game view which in most cases will be uncomfortable and out of position. Another aspect that is unfortunately not taken care of is the control system which, certainly thanks to the unfortunate vision given by the game camera, is almost always inaccurate. The gameplay is that of most platform games, that is, jumping with your character from one platform to another, collecting bonuses of various kinds such as additional life or additional energy that will allow little Cyp to transform into SuperCyp with very effective powers more devastating. Every now and then you will meet some character to face or to talk to. The enemies can be knocked down thanks to an effective slingshot that you can use with your character even with a first person view that will make the task much more pleasant and fun as well as effective. The dialogues are in English with Italian subtitles. Unfortunately, at a time when PlayStation 2 masterpieces are wasted and in particular after the arrival of Jak & Dexter, I don't know if there will be much room for Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles. Perhaps if this game had come out earlier when the 3D platform genre was completely forgotten, Ubi Soft's work would certainly have been seen in another way. , Pros: Beautiful music Original idea Cons: Poor graphics Difficult controls Awkward game view A new platform arrives on PlayStation 2, it is produced by Ubi Soft while it is developed by the willing French guys of In Utero (let's avoid jokes please). Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles is a 3D Platformer which, I announce immediately, turns out to be a half-disappointment. Despite the great effort of the developers put into the story, the game itself falls short in many respects. The characterization of the characters and the settings, certainly highly sought after, are undoubtedly the main characteristics of Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles. The environments are gloomy dark and seem vaguely taken from a Tim Burton film and the characters are satanic-looking children with strange powers that give the game a decidedly horror look.", "date": "2002-01-02", "grade": null}
