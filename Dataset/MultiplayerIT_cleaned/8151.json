{"name": "Little Inferno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111422-little-inferno-il-dolce-tepore-dellinferno.html", "text": "Little Inferno, what will the new game from the author of the exceptional World of Goo be? Can we tell you the truth? The risk inherent in describing it is to lose it. Who might be interested in a kind of fireplace simulator, actually very simplified, in which the aim is to buy toys to set them on fire? Yet Little Inferno captures as only the warmth of a fireplace lit in the middle of winter can do, and not only for its mechanics. The incredible thing is that in the slenderness of its concept it manages to tell a story that becomes more and more intense as the game progresses, even being dramatic in the finale, and then flowing into a beautiful and unexpected lyricism. Don't worry, we won't tell you anything about the plot (at least here) so as not to spoil the immense final twist, where everything turns into... something else (we won't tell you anyway, don't make those eunuch faces at the bunga- bunga). Let's just say that having seen the ending and rereading everything that has been done in the course of the game backwards, the attention paid to making every single element of the gameplay functional to the narration, be it a piece of the interface, a simple decorative element or the repetition of seemingly insignificant mechanical actions. Everything that happens on the screen seems to prophesy the sense of daze that one feels when playing, the desire to continue burning toys even without a precise reason and, above all, the incredible charm of the flames that envelop everything until they fill the entire area of the fireplace. The frost inside The Little Inferno is, precisely, a model fireplace built by the Tomorrow Corporation. The world is in the grip of the deepest frost and winter seems to never end. Human beings are locked up in their homes and spend their time burning toys in their hearth/screen. Which is exactly what the player has to do: buy the various trinkets available in the catalogs of the Tomorrow Corporation, the developer's factory of the same name, wait for them to be delivered, put them in the fireplace and set them on fire by lighting a flame with the left mouse button. Toys have a special feature: once burned, they make more money than they cost. So the more you burn, the more expensive items you can buy. By performing combos, i.e. burning two or three objects linked by a common theme defined by the authors (there are ninety-nine in total), you get coupons that allow you to shorten shipping times. As already mentioned, toys must be purchased from catalogs (rest assured, there is no freemium content). The first catalog is obtained by burning documents from the Little Inferno package, the others must be unlocked by burning all the objects in the previous catalog and spending a sum that increases as the level of the volumes increases. The purchased items end up on a shelf placed in front of the fireplace. If you want, you can spend money to enlarge the shelf so you can buy more items at the same time. As you progress through the game you receive letters, the tool with which they will tell the story of the plot. The letters may contain requests or gifts. The latter are unique objects, not present in the catalogues, which have their own specific function which we cannot tell you about. The human soul This paragraph contains huge spoilers about Little Inferno. We have included it because without talking about the plot it is really difficult to understand the true beauty of Tomorrow Corporation's work. Read it only if you have already finished the game and know the unfolding of all events. We also put a double space to give you the opportunity to escape and read the comment right away. As we specified in the previous paragraphs, the heart of Little Inferno is not just the fireplace. It's not the burning. It's not the beautiful fire VFX. Its heart is the story that is told while spending time burning things like there's no tomorrow. The fire that destroys everything envelops the toys giving them melancholy features. Of all that slips into the hearth, often with a certain sadism, only ash remains. During the mechanic, always repeating the same gestures, the letters break the rhythm and tell a story of rare and minute poetry. We will soon discover that some of the letters are sent by a mysterious girl in our same condition, who will turn out to be our neighbor. Little by little you become attached to his increasingly crazy words, written in such a way as to create a strong progression towards the grand finale, unexpectedly placed after some highly dramatic and emotional moments. This is where the game transformsin a mini graphic adventure where all the gameplay elements find their narrative outlet. We will thus discover that behind the delivery of parcels and letters there is a human being, that some of the toys hid real people and that freedom exists only beyond that screen that kept us tied to its coils of fire. If we wish, we can interpret all of Little Inferno as a large metaphor for a certain way of playing videogames, alienating and with pathological traits, which traps with no escape and which can only be freed by finding a flaw in the system, in this case represented by a special combo of toys that one becomes aware of thanks to the sentimental relationship one had with the neighbour. It is this ability of the texture of the gameplay to touch the deepest recesses of the human soul and to generate reflections usually the preserve of great art that make Little Inferno an experience to try at all costs.", "date": "2012-11-30", "grade": "9.0"}
