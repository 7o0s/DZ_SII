By now a point of reference for lovers of niche Japanese RPGs, the publisher who made Disgaea famous in the West also seems to have decided to translate most of the wackiest jRPGs into understandable language (if you know English, of course!) developed and published in the land of the rising sun. Among these stands out Mugen Souls, a franchise born a few years ago and brought to Europe at the end of 2012: even then we had noticed the similarities with the aforementioned Nippon Ichi series, from the absolutely bizarre characters to the crazy leveling and the special shots that would be the envy of Gurren Lagann. All this was mixed with that all-Japanese risqu humor that we have lately encountered in similar productions with frankly disturbing frequency. Mugen Souls Z increases the dose, but fortunately there is more. Mugen Souls Z is too similar to its predecessor, for better or for worse Ladies at the wheel... Returning from Demon Gaze and Conception II, we begin to wonder how it is possible that Western publishers have not yet understood that this type of humor, so folkloric and common among the Japanese, cannot take root in our society in the same way. Enduring double meanings, naughty jokes and sexual references is, needless to say, highly personal, but there are two very important factors to consider. Firstly, the excesses, which in Mugen Souls Z, with its extremely childish character design characters, appear... well, excessive. Secondly, the script, because if you want to sell spicy dialogues you must also know how to write them or, in this case, translate: the rhythm is important and, unfortunately, Mugen Souls Z is practically missing completely. The first hours of the game, for example, are very tedious. They act as a tutorial and offer us the new narrative context, introduce us to the old and new characters and explain the combat system and the numerous features that characterize the gameplay. The story picks up shortly after the ending of Mugen Souls, with the divine Chou-Chou dying of boredom after having conquered the worlds of the prequel: her new plan, therefore, is to take control of a new galaxy, but an inconvenience immediately arises brake on her ambition, transforming her into a miniature version of herself. At this point, the protagonist in a certain sense changes and becomes Syrma, with Chou-Chou as her supporting character. The goal remains the same, namely to conquer the galaxy by subjugating all its inhabitants and transforming them into minions of Chou-Chou, while enhancing his personal transformer, the G-Castle. The plot, as in the case of the predecessor, is absolutely insane and at a certain point it even becomes difficult to follow, made up as it is of endless dialogues entrusted to a large cast of protagonists and supporting actors, one more absurd than the other. It elicits more than a few laughs, and that's good, but at a certain point you get overwhelmed by so many quotes and subplots that you lose the thread of the storyline, while its importance completely vanishes. The English dub, by the way, is acceptable, but we're sure true fans of Mugen Souls - and of the specific genre - will be happy to be able to select the excellent, and characteristic, Japanese track as well. Playstation 3 trophies To unlock platinum you will have to sweat: Mugen Souls Z offers no less than forty bronze, six silver and three gold trophies. In addition to having to complete the various chapters of the story and perform some basic actions, it will also be necessary to score various amounts of damage and complete complex secondary objectives. Hundreds of trillions of damages Mugen Souls Z sets a table full of particular mechanics, bizarre features and special functions that enrich a game system that is anything but obvious and trivial. The problem, more than anything else, is that we have already seen everything in the prequel and this episode just improves some aspects without adding anything really new. There are twelve worlds to explore and our goal will be to witness an endless series of dialogues before finally being able to move to reach a particular destination. Most scenarios are populated by hostile creatures; just one contact is enough to start the fight, during which we will be able to control a maximum of four characters at the same time. It's all quite traditional: each character has various abilities based on his class and can attack with different weapons that can also be upgraded, taking into account the interactive elements on the battlefield that can be used to your advantage or used against the enemies themselves, turning every fight into a sort of puzzleapo. The special shots, especially the more advanced ones, are spectacular and inflict literally millions of damage, as indeed the level cap is even set at 9999: the nonsense does not end there, since for example it is possible to create your own party members and dress them up with ever more ridiculous or embarrassing clothes and objects. The possibility of ~seducing~ enemies through the Captivate system is also back, improved compared to the previous one since it allows us to evaluate the reaction of the target in advance, thus preventing us from wasting precious time and attempts. Between one story mission and another, then, it is possible to train the party and improve the equipment in the Mugen Zone, made up of many floors and mostly optional, even if its exploration is necessary if you want to unlock the best endings. From a content point of view, in short, there is nothing to complain about. From the technical one, however, the criticisms are entirely justified. Mugen Souls Z is pleasant, but graphically it seems to belong to the first generation of PlayStation 3 video games. The polygonal models of the characters are approximate both in detail and in textures, the variety and environmental complexity are decidedly scarce, the graphic effects seem to come out of a PlayStation 2. As if that weren't enough, the frame rate inexplicably slips and from time to time we have experienced freezes that we thought were the fault of the console, only to discover - after a quick tour of the forums - that apparently they are really a problem with the code . We are a step above the previous Mugen Souls, also thanks to the much faster loading, but after two years, and in 2014 too, a technical realization of this type leaves a lot to be desired.", "date": "2014-06-19", "grade": "7.0"}
