Tormented scenes, waking nightmares; esoteric material, in short. Fortunately for him, and in contrast to his tamarro ways, he is also a fine painter, who sublimates the torments of the mind in art. And in any case he can console himself with Lara, his splendid wife and respected agent of the agency for the recovery of stolen works. All is well between them, the events of the first Memento Mori are long gone and the couple is enjoying a holiday in South Africa. Unfortunately, a theft of figurines from a local museum and a distressing vision in Max's mind sets the usual hustle back in motion. Lara wears tight pants and has her red hair tied back like almost all graphic adventure heroines, Max is a bit of a braggart a bit of a heartthrob, like almost all graphic adventure heroes. Together they will have to travel around the world to investigate a story that mixes historical news, stall esotericism and typical thriller mechanisms. The attempt to dress everything up in Hollywood graphics probably squandered the scarce resources of the independent development team, which neglected to take care of the dialogues, the voice acting, the pace of the narration and the design of the puzzles. Sadly Memento Mori 2 is the sum of its parts. There is a lack of original quality that leaves its mark beyond the individual flaws, so that we are forced to average the defects. We've tried really hard to like it, because it's not an adventure to be flung, but with Broken Sword back on the scene, Telltales on the loose, and Daedalic Entertainment more prolific than ever, it's hard to advise anyone to find the time and inclination to finish the latest effort of Centauri Productions. So let's go back with a little nostalgia to that initial theft and try to figure out what didn't work, despite all the good will of Max and Lara and their creators. Memento Mori 2 is an inspirational adventure that sinks into the swamp of clichs Investigating is not a game Memento Mori 2 makes a titanic effort to make us experience the illusion that we are conducting a realistic investigation. The sequence of forensic puzzles is very long, only rarely interspersed with more common puzzles, such as using the bar to reach an object. Although the gimmicks are often solid, ranging from the study of fingerprints to the reconstruction of a crime scene complete with the right angle of the shadows, the reward for the results obtained is absent. After having done a lot to indicate the points of interest of the photos taken in an office meeting, having read dense reports drawn up by colleagues and analyzed writings faded by time, we just want to see the story take off and feel the impelling curiosity to know what happens next. Instead Memento Mori 2 is very trivially a boring game. Only when we arrive between the sixth and seventh acts, and therefore one step away from the end of the game, do we finally manage to focus on the story. At that point there are many questions and interest finally awakens from the torpor in which it had sunk, but it is too late. Looking closely, there's too much of everything. There was no need to have us examine a cigar cutter just to unlock the safety, or unjam the office printer. Probably the developers wanted us to feel part of a real investigation, with all the necessary details, but the ordinary details of life are just what we want to save ourselves in fiction. Furthermore, two paths cannot be pursued at a time, so if we get stuck with a puzzle, we are forced to rack our brains over just that one until we solve it. While traditional puzzles are almost always very simple, mini-games and situations that require calculations and assessments can seriously stump the less determined player. And unfortunately these steps cannot be skipped, as is the case in modern adventures. In Memento Mori 2 there are no help systems of any kind, except for a button that shows the sensitive points of the screen. Purists will also be against any suggestion, but giving the possibility to even less experienced players to enjoy the game is not a bad choice. If we then include corrupted save files, sudden crashes and, at least in one case, a puzzle that cannot be solved if an object is used earlier than expected, it is clear that Memento Mori 2 puts even the saints to the test. Too bad because when the game works, in its rare moments of inspiration, all the wasted potential is glimpsed. There are extra points to accumulate for brilliantly solving the investigation without ever going astray, a choice that encourages reading the many documents provided by the game, and even narrative crossroads that change the unfolding of the adventure and the ending atwhich we go into account. Unfortunately, the desire to start over to find out how things would have gone by making different choices collides with all the defects listed above. So there are good ideas, but the structure that should support them creaks like a mummy's neck. Avenue of the sunset The cinematic dreams of Memento Mori 2 are shattered by the performance of the voice actors, who fail to instill some passion in their characters. In partial defense of the actors we must say that the writing does not spark. The dialogues are many, and always soporific. The jokes are obvious and in line with the stereotype embodied by the character who speaks them. Once again it's a real shame, because there are three main characters and lots of supporting characters, all very well done, at least until they speak and don't move. In fact, the three-dimensional models have excellent textures but bad animations, and we can dream of the synchronization between lips and speech. In part this problem is compensated by the screens, rich in detail and very evocative of the geographical area they reproduce. The game is all three-dimensional, therefore we can closely examine some portions of the scenario, moving the camera with a scroll bar, so as to frame the object of interest from different angles. A pleasant effect, but which should be the finishing touch of a good job, not the handhold to cling to to plug the leaks. And indeed despite the productive effort to create an adventure with a great visual impact, Memento Mori 2 fails to capture the attention and keep the interest alive. At least for two-thirds of the game. Then, if you have held on, something starts to mesh, but with difficulty and out of time. The risk that this second chapter is the last of the series is high. Let's just hope that if the developers decide to continue, they keep in mind what their limitations are and focus more on the fundamental aspects of the genre they have chosen. It's not a pang, because with all the content this game has to offer, it earns a pass, but it's a shame to know what it could have become and not be able to see it realized. Five or six years ago he could have had his say, but today graphic adventures are young again, and there is no longer any place for clumsy throwbacks.", "date": "2014-06-04", "grade": "6.5"}
