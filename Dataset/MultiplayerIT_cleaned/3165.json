It must be said that the characteristics of the title in any case make it as far away as possible from the profile of a high-ranking product: Path to Mnemosyne is in fact a dreamlike puzzle, which stages suggestions that are very difficult to grasp by wrapping them in a truly graphic style. particular. If these premises intrigue you, read on to find out if there is more than appearances. Memory and forgetting To say that there is a plot behind Path to Mnemosyne would be an exaggeration: that of DevilishGames is a work that thrives on hints, often very cryptic, but without being able to count on a real story. The protagonist is an anonymous and silent girl with black hair and a white dress, who we find at the beginning of the game inside a cave. A voice-over tells her to calm down, that she's here to try and regain her memory. From here begins his and our adventure, a dreamlike journey into the maze of his mind visualized as an apparently infinite corridor dotted with objects, structures and symbols whose meaning lies entirely in the user's interpretation. In fact, nothing is explained in Path to Mnemosyne, and part of its charm lies precisely in the fact that everyone can have their own vision of what appears on the screen. Certainly it is not an approach suitable for everyone, and it cannot be excluded that more than one person could even find himself annoyed by this total absence of a real common thread, but at least the developers must be acknowledged for their courage in staging something so atypical. Equally ~extreme~ were the choices made by DevilishGames in audiovisual terms. The graphics of the game are in black and white, with some rare concessions to color, made in a style that makes it look almost like an unhealthy cartoon from the 30s, complete with visual noise effects: the use of perspective is even more particular infinite, which gives the progression a hypnotic effect which, in competition with the disturbing figures present at the edge of the path, give Path to Mnemosyne a unique look to say the least. Even the sound, albeit with very limited elements, does its part in building the atmosphere: the reverberation of the protagonist's steps, her heartbeat and the few effects are the only accompaniment in addition to the occasional off-screen comments of two apparently conflicting voices between them. If from this point of view the work of the developers can only be considered excellent, moving on to the gameplay front, the different edges of a product so uncompromising in conveying one's ideas inevitably emerge. The long corridor that represents the game world is in fact a sequence of puzzles of various kinds: there are keys to press in the right order, images to align in the correct way, teleportation portals and so on, plus some forks allow you to rotate the entire scenery to reach other paths. If on the one hand it is admirable how in DevilishGames they have managed to make everything quite understandable even without inserting even a single line of text or tutorials into the game, on the other hand this limitation has led the puzzles to err on the side of variety, resulting always pertinent to the meager handful of models we listed above. The control system, then, clearly demonstrates that it was not born with touch devices in mind, proving to be unresponsive in managing the girl's movements and lacking in precision when it comes to rotating some element on the screen. The original sin of Path to Mnemosyne, however, lies in its very narrow longevity: in two hours you can get to see the end credits, too little for a product sold at a price that is also quite high by mobile standards. If we add to this the absolute lack of factors that stimulate replayability and an ending that leaves more perplexity than satisfaction, it is evident how difficult it is to recommend Path to Mnemosyne to anyone.", "date": "2020-03-29", "grade": "7.0"}
