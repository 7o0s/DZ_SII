{"name": "Enter The Matrix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enter-the-matrix_a.html", "text": "Cultural-Videogame corner The theory at the basis of the Matrix, namely the existence of a simulated reality, which we think we live but which in truth is transmitted directly into the brain by a supercomputer, through the controlled stimulation of our sensory organs, actually has deep roots philosophical, having already been raised by the American Hilary Putnam in the book ~Reason, truth and history~ in the famous essay ~Brains in a tub~, in turn a contemporary reinterpretation of Descartes' ~Metaphysical Meditations~. We therefore recommend that all those interested in the subject read these works, as well as a very interesting discussion on the Matrix website, by following this link. Welcome to the Real World First of all, a necessary premise: Enter the Matrix is not a title that tries to make us relive the events of the 2 films firsthand, but rather stands in a complementary way with respect to the cinematographic films, as a further and necessary element for understanding the complex universe of Matrix. The same choice not to propose Neo, Trinity or Morpheus as protagonists, opting instead for the two ~followers~ Ghost and Niobe, is certainly a clear indication of the desire to propose an alternative point of view to the events. Moving on to the description of the actual game, the good David Perry and the Wachowski brothers have opted for a mechanic that closely resembles scrolling fighting games, but with some small variations on the theme: how can we not mention, for example, the inevitable presence of the Focus mode, a sort of ~bullet time~ a la Max Payne (which is a bit of a contradiction, given that this mode of the Interplay game was clearly inspired by the first Matrix), in which we will have the possibility, for a short time of time, to slow down the action and execute even more loyal and devastating combinations. Too bad, however, that the implementation of an absolutely ridiculous artificial intelligence (but it would be better to say artificial stupidity), combined with the bizarre idea of making the energy bar and the focus bar recharge by themselves over time, heavily mini l experience, reducing it to a continuous succession of head-on attacks and waiting hidden in some ravine waiting for the energy to recharge, all without the CPU-controlled enemies working convincingly to stop us. Furthermore, in an attempt to slightly vary an otherwise excessively repetitive game mechanic, the programmers have well thought of inserting some missions aboard a car, and precisely driving if you have decided to play with Niobe and as a passenger in charge of the clashes in focus if you chose Ghost; unfortunately here too the results were evidently not the ones hoped for, but rather the poor management of the physics of the car (especially as regards collisions) makes these missions by far the worst and most frustrating. What is the Matrix? If the first two films (and there are no reasons not to think that the third will be too) are a real monument to computer graphics, the same discourse unfortunately cannot be extended to this videogame excursion of the saga. Assuming that the Ps2 version of the game is probably the least well-finished from this point of view, the judgment is mainly made by the settings, made too anonymously, covered by textures with fluctuating quality (mostly tending towards mediocre though) and decidedly lacking in detail. The polygonal models convince a little more, especially if we go to consider those of the main characters, however the bad realization of some animations condemns the title without possibility of appeal. Instead, the speech is completely different as regards the sound sector, certainly the strong point of the game, embellished by a soundtrack borrowed directly from the film (and which therefore borders on perfection) and by excellently made, very varied and extremely well-finished effects. Small mention also for the splendid dubbing (completely in English), both as regards the characterization of the voices and for the interpretation. Longevity appears guaranteed by the possibility of undertaking the game in a different way using either Niobe or Ghost, even if, on balance, the extreme repetitiveness of the gameplay will hardly convince you to start the adventure again with the other character. The abundance of unlockable extras is interesting, but honestly we would have preferred greater care in the making of the main game Comment Here is yet another title that fails to escape the terrible curse of tie-ins. Mind you, this Enter the Matrix is not aterrible title, indeed its complementarity to the plot of the films makes it a product that is hardly negligible for all lovers of the saga, however from a purely playful point of view the game does not offer enough ideas to become the masterpiece we all hoped it would be. Repetitive, technically poorly cared for, with evident problems in the artificial intelligence and gameplay in general: our advice is therefore to carefully evaluate the purchase, especially if you are not a die-hard Matrix-fan and can easily resist until November (date of release of the third, and last, film of the series in American theaters) to re-enter the world of Neo & companions. Pros: Complementary to the films of the saga Excellent soundtrack Cons: AI disheartening Graphically wobbly Repetitive and undemanding The term ~tie-in~ should be sadly known to every gamer with a minimum of experience: if history teaches anything, it's that almost every title that leverages a cinematic background ends up being a mediocre product (not to mention worse), to the point that by now every game belonging to this category is seen with a thread of skepticism by enthusiasts, mindful of too many past disappointments to let themselves be taken by easy enthusiasm. However, this is not an absolute dogma, but it may indeed happen that from the meeting of a franchise that lends itself well to a videogame transposition, a talented game designer and sufficient motivations (especially economic) some decidedly valid product can be born. These were precisely the premises for Enter the Matrix, the first title based on the multimillion-dollar Matrix universe, developed by David Perry's Shiny under the direct supervision of the Wachowski brothers, directors of the 2 films: you can therefore imagine how, in the face of such charisma, the expectations they had become feverish, in defiance of what was said only a few lines above. Now the title is finally in our hands, and the time has come to find out if our expectations will be satisfied, for once....", "date": "2003-06-11", "grade": null}
