Our ninja does the dirty work Economic issues Confirming what we said earlier, there is also the choice of the development team to include both access to CoH and CoV within a single monthly fee: with 12.99 per month (in case you want renewed every 30 days) it is therefore possible to take part in one of the two sides or if you feel like it in both, without additional costs. As often happens in the world of MMORPGs, it is also possible to pay for 3 or 6 months together, obtaining a monthly fee of 11.66 and 10.83 respectively, thus saving a few euros, which never hurts. To this figure must be added only the one-off purchase of CoV, equal to 39.99 for the basic edition and 64.99 for the one commonly called collector's edition. Inside the normal package we find the DVD with the game client, the card with activation code including a free period of 30 days, a map of the Rogue Isles (the archipelago that forms the background to the game) with poster on the back and an interesting trial code for CoH, through which you can take part for 14 days. In addition to this, what is noteworthy within the  64.99 edition consists of a special activation code with which to obtain a special emblem of Arachnos to use on your clothing, an artbook of the game and an additional code test CoH to pass on to a friend: it's up to you to evaluate whether or not everything is worth the approximately  25 difference, especially based on your passion for the ~City of~ series. Finally, the last consideration to be made, the packaging and manual are completely localized in our language but unfortunately as regards the game we are still forced to rely on foreign languages. uhm... good sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss One of the VFX that comes from buffs Character creation The way of the wicked Becoming a respected superhero, as well as a feared supervillain, is not a simple thing, especially in a world where the rest of the inhabitants are endowed with supernatural abilities that are the same or in any case as important as ours. To embark on the path of crime, we are initially faced with a tutorial within the game itself, which in addition to providing us with the first elements of the plot behind CoV also offers us the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the controls and the game system in general : once the character has been created we find ourselves inside the Ziggurat, the prison of Paragon City, on which an attack has been brought by the powerful organization Arachnos in order to make all potential followers escape to the court of Lord Recluse and the his henchmen. This first part will also include a series of simple missions through which to get the hang of using your own character, and then take off towards Mercy Island, the first of the islands making up the Rogue Isles, an archipelago located in international waters of which Lord Recluse appointed himself absolute head, establishing there the headquarters of his own criminal organization. becoming ~someone~ within the game will not be a real walk, especially in the early days where you could find yourself struck by the classic bewilderment within MMORPGs The way of the wicked As you can understand, therefore, becoming ~someone~ within the game will not be a real walk, especially in the early days where you could find yourself struck by the classic bewilderment within MMORPGs. Initially we will find ourselves freeing Mercy Island from the threat of men-snakes up to killing the boss, with a series of missions that are actually a bit boring and repetitive, but the situation still tends to improve as the levels go on. Another point, very often delicate in all online role-playing games, is represented by the death of the character: setting aside, as increasingly often happens now, the definitive loss of items in the Ultima Online style, the CoV development team also invented something to inflict a penalty that is not too heavy. Basically up to level 10 dying will represent absolutely no loss, while from that level onwards death will cause the accumulation of experience debt, which will make the accumulation of XP slower and more difficult and, consequently, the transition to the next level. In any case, after losing his life, our character will be transported to the hospital, from which point we will resume playing. characters and archetypes Before going on with the other aspects of CoV it is advisable to take a step back, precisely to the character creation phase, since the one creatingcreated by NCSoft is probably the most varied system for generating physical models for game characters: in fact, it is possible to choose from various options all the aesthetic details of the new character you want to create, from the type of dress to a series of variations based to this choice plus other gadgets and options that bring the chances of seeing another player like us practically close to zero. The types of Origin (basically the source from which our superpowers come) have not changed and have therefore remained the same as CoH: science, magic, mutation, technology or nature, for those who have not undergone any type of intervention or trauma but been destined for a super-life since birth. The Archetypes (the class) at our disposal have instead completely changed, with the introduction of five new figures that we are going to examine below: -Brutes The Brute The figure of the brute corresponds in its traits to the classic one of the ~tank~: many hit points, close-range combat characteristics and the possibility of increasing one's fury during combat, which offers the possibility of taking advantage in case the fight must continue over time. Its weakness is the lack of ranged weapons and is therefore vulnerable in case its opponent is equipped with them. -Stalker The Stalker The stalker is characterized by a good balance between attack and defense since it has the same resistance as the brute but is able to do more damage to its opponent in a short amount of time. He cannot attack from a distance, like the brute, but he has the possibility of walking secretly by acting by surprise and using very strong opening blows. -Mastermind The Mastermind The mastermind is probably the most interesting and fun archetype in the game: thanks to his ability to summon followers (choice among zombies, ninjas, mercenaries and robots) he has the possibility to take part in combat only from a distance, leaving the summoned creature in the close combat. However, it has low hit points, making it doomed should the follower fall in battle. -Dominator The Dominator This is one of the classic support classes, often necessary within a group but which in turn require a party to best express all potential. The dominator is able to control the will of the enemy, blocking, slowing or even stunning them. It has low hit points like the mastermind so care must be taken in close combat. -Corruptor The Corruptor If you like to attack from a distance, then this is the archetype for you: the corruptor's specialization consists precisely in the high damage inflicted on the enemy through shots carried out from afar, plus a series of ~buffs~ that go to improve some powers of companions within the party. Although they also have few hit points, they have on their side the fact that they take part in combat very often from a distance. One of the perfect couples is the brute-corruptor one. Once the origin and archetype have been chosen, we move on to the groups of primary and secondary powers, which will further differentiate our way of playing over time, above all thanks to the use of enhancements, i.e. the bonuses to be applied to the various powers: we will be able for example choosing to increase the damage caused by an attack or reduce its cost in terms of endurance (a kind of mana bar), but all in a manner bound to the number of slots available for upgrades for each individual power. [C] One of the NPCs in the game, dressed in a very fetish way The snakes will keep us company at the beginning of the game I'm not Superman! [/C] The PvP What the player sees engaged in clashes with other human beings is probably the most interesting and engaging aspect of CoV: like any self-respecting MMORPG, at some point it will become practically essential to join a guild, which here takes the name of Supergroup. Each of them has its own Base where you can meet other guild members and build objects thanks to the loot received in combat, but also plan and launch raids towards opposing bases, whether they belong to supergroups of heroes or other ~villains~ : if the bad guys are really bad then they must be bad to each other too! A large part of PvP (but also of PvE) revolves around the so-called Objects of Power, which can be obtained by a Supergroup through tiring missions reserved for guilds: if kept inside the safe in their base, they allow all members of the own clan to get bonuses of various kinds. PuToo much, given their considerable importance, enemy raids within our bases will often be aimed at stealing these objects. Having introduced the villains on duty with CoV, however, the epic battles in the open field cannot be missing, where you can compete against the heroes of CoH. To do this, NCSoft has decided to open three common areas for PvP by making the basic areas of the two factions inaccessible. Each of these three places, accessible at levels 15, 20 and 30 of your character, will offer the possibility of tackling PvP in a different way, such as conquering certain areas or stealing the launch codes of a missile system. Management of power upgrades If you want you can; broaden the field dramatically Vir ;sea quant & egrave; Handsome Technical compartment After having previously mentioned the incredible variety of models available to the player to customize his character, we can appreciate the quality of textures and models that appear very satisfactory even on machines not equipped with the latest hardware, with the possibility of effectively scaling the detail graphic. It is no coincidence that the minimum game requirements include a 800MHz CPU, 256Mb of RAM and a GeForce 2 or ATI 7500: we have not tried the game on this configuration but on an Athlon 1700+ with 1GB of RAM and an ATI 8500 going down a bit ' according to the various options (but not so much) CoV was fully playable at 1024x768. The combat animations convince enough, while a little more could have been done on those of movement such as running, jumping and the like. Wanting to find fault, the cases in which the polygons merge with each other are not rare, as shown in one of the screenshots just below. From the sound point of view, all the music contributes perfectly to the creation of the ~villana~ atmosphere and the audio effects do their job, while remaining generally average. For the new character we have completely changed the aesthetic choice! The brute certainly doesn't let himself be prayed for Whops, I think I melted Final comment CoV arrives with the declared aim of integrating and adding some nice innovations to its predecessor, in order to make the clash between superheroes and supervillains as fun as possible, even if perhaps for those who have already played CoH the novelties of this title may not apply the additional expense. For those who have never entered Paragon City, CoV represents a valid alternative among the many now on the market, with a fairly good game variety and a PvP system among the best, at least on paper. However, getting passionate about an MMORPG is a matter of time and the various balances that determine the success of a game are determined by very often unstable equilibriums, therefore it would be good to make the most of the trial period before paying the monthly fee: it will not be a World of WarCraft, but City of Villains ranks among the first of its kind. Pros Finally the bad guys! Suitable for casual gamers Cons May not be worth the money for existing City of Heroes owners A little too much lag on European servers In this world of thieves Ever since City of Heroes peeped out on the shelves of the United States about a year ago, questions and anticipations about its possible ~sequel~ have followed one another until today, that is, at the time of the release of City of Villains (which now later we will call CoV). After all, it was evident that a human counterpart was missing within the game system, which consistently opposed the handful of superheroes that populated the various servers: NCSoft didn't ask for anything, offering the whole group of CoH enthusiasts, but even to those who have never played it, the possibility of passing from the dark side, to put it to George Lucas. If you read the word sequel in quotation marks just now, it is because probably the most suitable term to define CoV is complement, or at least a sort of mix between the two (~follow-up~ or ~completed~, you choose): buy this new title without in fact, having CoH available does not affect anything that may include a large part of the life of a supervillain, while if you should already have it, you will be able to enjoy everything that the development team has studied to brighten the hours spent in front of the pc.", "date": "2005-12-02", "grade": null}
