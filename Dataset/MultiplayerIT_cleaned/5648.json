Are you mainly interested in the story, the structured missions and the narrative curtains or are you crazy with adrenaline, who like to freely vent their extreme impulses, who in comparison Bodhi from Point Break seems like the protagonist of a melodramatic silent film? We for one do not believe in categorical divisions, especially as regards proposals such as the Avalanche Studios series, which often and willingly knows how to embrace the two orientations simultaneously, without breaks, in the name of a crackling sandbox freedom. If you lean more towards the former, then this DLC probably isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you were waiting for nothing more than some good reason to go back to setting the world on fire in the name of the grappling hook/parachute/wingsuit trinomial, Sky Fortress could be the bread your teeth were craving, even if the filling is not the most abundant, to the point that, as you may have anticipated by scrolling the page to the bottom, it is an additional content that in an absolute sense we do not feel like recommending. Our review of Sky Fortress, the first mini-expansion of Just Cause 3 Supersonic Sky Fortress pits Rico against the eDEN Corporation, a ruthless multinational that after some tragedies that occurred years ago seemed to have disappeared forever and instead returns to threaten Medici with its army of drones and the intention of not looking anyone in the face to achieve its ends , even if it were to cause an ecological disaster. Trying to stand up to us, at least verbally, is her managing director, Eden Callagher, who, although 100% embodying the clich of the career woman with dictatorial vocations heard and resented dozens of times, still knows how to entertain with Rodriguez adequately sparkling repartee , representing a pleasant background presence to the action. The operational center of this evil empire is a huge helicopter, the Sky Fortress which gives its name to the expansion, reachable thanks to what is the undisputed protagonist of the story: the Wingsuit at the Bavarium, developed by the usual Dimah. A gadget capable of rewriting the syntax of the base game formula, blurring the line between the mechanics of crossings, those of combat and those through which to express creativity, both acrobatic and destructive. This particular type of winguist is first of all equipped with a propulsion system, thanks to which it can take off directly from the ground, at any moment, and perform powerful accelerations as a result of which it can continue to fly, potentially indefinitely. To counterbalance, there is an aero-brake, through which you can make soft turns and land like on velvet. Not only that: Rico can also fire homing missiles and use a gatling gun. The consequences are easily imaginable: in fact, you find yourself in control of a character who by now almost transcends the human being, resembling a living fighter jet. And in this sense the possibility of avoiding the missiles, dodging, complete with notification of the enemy's engagement, as if you were in control of the Afterburner's F-14, appears as the icing on the cake. From people who chew the emerging gameplay for eons to spit it out pulled to the extreme, Avalanche has been able to create an ~airy~ themed declination of Just Cause that really works: intoxicating as never before and refreshing at the right point. And he has been able to build a playground around it, the Sky Fortress, which enhances its characteristics, as we had already explained in detail in the preview phase, making it fun even if faced a second time, as in the case of the writer. Take? Maybe it's better to leave Unfortunately, however, Rico's amazing flight ends up resembling that of Icarus, reaching its peak prematurely, precisely with the very first missions of the expansion, which soon comes to an end. Compared to what we tried in the preview phase, where we wondered what the other contents could be through which we could have had an idea of the overall picture, there is only one main assignment, which however appears only after returning to the ground to brush a couple of generic outposts, puffing things up with some backtracking. In other words: in just three hours, everything that Sky Fortress has to offer has been done. At the most, if you intend to upgrade the Suit at the Bavarium properly, you can calculate extra time (about forty minutes for us, who were content to take seven Mods out of ten). And here we return to the starting pointof the article: if it is the story-driven proposal and the specifically studied game situations that tease you the most, in our opinion this mini-expansion is not worth the 11.99 euros requested. It will probably make more sense for you to consider purchasing the entire Expansion Pass when the Air, Land & Sea project is complete, in case it demonstrates some organicity (and the way the story ends, far from original but tantalizing, bodes well in this sense). If, on the other hand, you are the type to lose your head following the rankings or you rejoice at the idea of being able to use the winguist at the Bavarium and a couple of other gadgets even in the base game, having fun around Medici feeling like Tony Stark, do as if below there is a green dot instead of a red one.", "date": "2016-03-14", "grade": null}
