{"name": "Summoners War: Lost Centuria", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/summoners-war-lost-centuria-la-recensione.html", "text": "In case you haven't noticed, gacha RPGs have practically invaded the mobile market in recent years and after saturated the environment they are finally slowly starting to retreat, but this does not mean that publishers intend to abandon them altogether: the positive thing is that, if nothing else, now we try to introduce some different features in the usual gameplay, as this review of Summoners War: Lost Centuria demonstrates. The Com2us game was presented several months ago and already launched in beta at the end of last year, finally arriving in complete form these days, also thanks to the numerous feedback collected from users which, to tell the truth, have only been accepted in partial way. The result was a rather refined game in terms of mechanics and very engaging from the point of view of the actual gameplay, but which is still penalized by a monetization model that inexorably pushes towards pay to win: this drift was visible right from the beta and was reported to the developers, but the business model adopted evidently hasn't changed that much, contrary to the excellent implementations made on the front of the game itself. Summoners War: Lost Centuria focuses on PvP combat between two players, each managing a party of 8 fighters and 3 spell cards We start from the base already set by Summoners War: The Celestial Arena more than five years ago and also in this case we are dealing with a game set specifically on PvP multiplayer, in which the clash takes place between two human players and this already determines particular attention to the construction of the combat system. There are single player elements, modes and secondary missions, but these are mainly used to accumulate some experience points and additional bonuses, however the crux of the matter is always the direct confrontation in PvP and to face it it is necessary to be prepared and focused on the moves to be made. There is no auto-play in Summoners War: Lost Centuria, nor idle gameplay to be taken lightly while thinking of something else: it is essentially a card-based RPG, in which party building and strategic choice of moves and counters is essential to winning, which is already a big departure from the norm of the standard gacha RPG. Conversely, this competitiveness that characterizes the game also involves the high risk of pay to win, which actually emerges in the long run. A bunch of heroes The story tells of an epic fight against the forces of evil involving warriors and creatures of various shapes, but all this remains very much in the background in Summoners War: Lost Centuria, also because the single player element is decidedly secondary compared to simple PvP , which also allows you to unlock most of the rewards between power-ups, currencies, spells and characters. Everything therefore takes place on the battlefield, where two groups of fighters collide within a time limit, during which it is necessary to study every single move well. Players must select 8 characters between heroes and creatures to be deployed in battle and three cards corresponding to general spells, managing everything as a sort of trading card game. The clash takes place in real time between the two players and is all based on careful mana management, which represents the energy to be spent on each move, as well as on the timing in the use of attacks and defenses. The strategic planning of the group and of the spells to be deployed in battle is essential, as is the correct management of the mana, but the timing with which to make the moves is also of great importance, because a countermove applied at the right time can turn the tide of the battle . Based on what the opponent is about to do, we can decide to deploy a defensive maneuver or a counterattack which in some cases can cancel the negative effect or obtain priority in the casting order. Summoners War: Lost Centuria requires careful preparation of fighters before battles There is a great deal of attention placed in the strategic management of the party, which goes far beyond what we usually see in gacha RPGs. Here it is not so much a question of progressing mechanically by accumulation of heroes and equipment, but of carefully choosing the best combinations between the various classes of characters and creatures, in order to build a team that is as balanced as possible or in any case responsive to a certain style of combat . In addition to the division into classes, which sees the usual subdivisions between ranged attackers, tanks and support elements, the elemental characteristics must also be taken into considerationwings of everyone, because earth, water and fire interact with each other in different ways according to the classic principle of ~paper, stone, scissors~. It is also important, especially as you advance towards the higher levels, to know how to best arrange your group between the frontline and the backline, in order to predict which units will suffer the most attacks and which ones will be freer to act in the rear. To all this is added the choice of the three cards corresponding to the spells to bring into battle, untied by the individual characters and each usable once per round. In Summoners War: Lost Centuria there is obviously great attention also for the evolution of the fighters To all this is added the possibility of increasing the power of the fighters with the equipment. Each character can have skill stones and runes that can increase stats and attack and defense powers, which is an important part of the preparation, also because the game pushes you to personally take care of every single loadout instead of automating the process. This is also a feature that demonstrates the attention to the strategic construct of the battles, but it is also the element that can most lead to pay to win, together with the inevitable imbalance created by the power of the rarest (and most expensive) characters.", "date": "2021-05-20", "grade": "7.0"}
