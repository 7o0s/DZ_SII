{"name": "Resistance: Fall of Man - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resistance-fall-of-man-recensione.html", "text": "Sergeant Nathan Haie! The story that revolves around the game should by now be known to all, and tells of an alternative beginning of the twentieth century to the one that saw the two world wars as its protagonist, in which almost all of Europe was conquered by an alien race , called Chimera, which is also preparing to invade Great Britain with its armies, often composed of genetically modified hybrid humans. It is in this context that you begin, Sergeant Nathan Hale, sent by the American army to help the British contain this invasion and perhaps counter-attack. Just Hale will be one of the first to be infected by the alien cusps, which will implement some internal transformations that will allow him to acquire superior skills, such as the automatic regeneration of his energy after a certain amount of time passed without being hit. The missions to be tackled in single mode are about 30, and they are all set on British territory, the development is rather linear, but there will be diversions and moments of interaction with vehicles such as tanks, jeeps and futuristic alien robots of which we will take control in certain situations. Sergeant Hale's movement uses the classic configuration with the two analog buttons for movement and view, the front buttons for jumping and ducking and the back buttons for accessing the primary and secondary fire of one's weapons. Precisely the latter are an indication of the excellent work done by Insomniac on the variety and entertainment side, thanks to the introduction of some absolutely new ones or with particular fire modes, which at the same time prove to be very useful. Let us mention for example the Auger, which releases shots that also pass through walls and which allows you to release a shield that for a few moments protects the player from frontal shots, or the Sapper, which produces a series of gelatinous mines that can be chained each other and also detonate remotely with the L1 button. Even the classic bombs enjoy an excellent variety, thanks for example to the Hedgehog grenades, which release spines in all directions, or yet another type that creates a radial field within which one is invincible from enemy blows, which are deflected in all directions with an appreciable graphic effect. As if that weren't enough, once the game is over, it will be possible to restart the main campaign with the possibility of accessing further weapons, which remain in line with the excellent variety of the initial ones. Sergeant Nathan Haie! The development of the action, as already mentioned, is rather linear, in fact it is a question of dealing with tunnels, alien bases, open fields and various Chimeras who act as bosses along the way. Even if facing some levels proves to be a rather static experience, where the only purpose is to continue making your way through the opposing corpses, there are instead interesting situations with large-scale fights, as in the case of Manchester or Nottingam, which they turn out to be quite fun to deal with and increase the level of challenge, with the Chimera applying a minimal encirclement strategy and not plunging headlong without cover towards you. Another factor certainly in favor of the game is the above average length of the main adventure which, even at the lowest difficulty level, will last well over 10 hours. The graphics engine that drives Resistance: Fall of Man was developed from scratch on PS3, and the results are good, with some reservations. The defects are to be found in the alternate quality of the textures, in an often only sketchy lighting system and in the physics that is not always applied properly in all situations. In other cases it is instead possible to destroy and interact with a good part of the elements present on the scenario, and in these cases the engine appears much more convincing, together with the numerous variants of ragdoll implemented. However, the strengths of the game lie in the extreme fluidity of the action, even with dozens of characters on the screen, in the often large and detailed maps, and in the particle and atmospheric effects, with a truly convincing realization of rain and snow. Last notes go to the sound sector, which does its honest job and which stands out for some very atmospheric musical tracks, and for the dubbing, entirely localized in the texts and in the speech and more than valid. Multiplayer mon amour Insomniac had assured this during the development of the game, and we can confirm that the multiplayer mode of Resistance is the best that has come under our hands in recent times, especially as regards its completeness. It starts withthe possibility of playing in co-op with two players, unfortunately only on the same console, via vertical split screen and also in this case the engine accuses very few uncertainties, even with many enemies on the screen. The real highlight, however, is represented by the online mode, which provides very large maps capable of hosting up to 40 players simultaneously, a number rarely seen in other games of the genre. If we add that almost all of the times the lag turns out to be absent, we can only praise the excellent work done in this sense. Multiplayer mon amour There are eight game modes, with the well-known Deatmatch (all against all) single or in teams, and Capture the Flag, up to less common modes such as Fusion, in which it will be necessary to capture and defend some nodes of the opposing team, Breccia, where instead you will have to destroy the reactor of your antagonists, to get to the one called Conversion, in which each player starts with only one life and once hit will transform into a Chimera hybrid, which in a ~berserk~ version is equipped with the possibility of sprinting and to see human life forms through walls; obviously the last player left alive wins. In conjunction with the European release of the game, the developers have also introduced two new modes, the first of which proposes Team Conversion, while the second takes the name of Assault, which aims to defeat the opposing base by first weakening its defenses, represented in the form of nodes scattered in different points of the map which, once conquered, will act as a new starting point in case of premature death. All these options are accompanied by the possibility of watching the games by following a particular player or by moving freely on the map, and by the inevitable voice chat, which allows you to interact with other players without taking your hands off the pad. But that's not enough, in fact it is possible to acquire different medals for each goal achieved and participate, thanks to the excellent matchmaking system, in free games, in which it is possible to enter at any time, or in rankings, which will place the player in an online ranking both for single and team modes, thanks to a really well implemented clan support system and which is completed with the myresistance.net site, full of information, rankings of all types and support forums. To close the series of good news on this component of the game, Insomniac has thought about it, announcing that a new game update will be released within two months, which will allow you to play on two new maps and introduce the unification of game servers , allowing European users to challenge those who also own the American or Japanese version of the game. The only flaw is therefore represented by the lack of an online cooperative mode, but everything else is done with all the trappings of the case. Comment Resistance: Fall of Man does not let you cry out for a miracle in terms of novelty and originality, but everything it does, it does very well. A long and enjoyable single player adventure, seasoned with an excellent variety of levels and weapons available, a graphic sector with ups and downs but which always offers fluid action, a convincing multiplayer mode, with many options available and a excellent clan management system. All these elements make RFOM a complete title and the beginning of a series that will surely be very successful among PlayStation 3 users, and that already in its first incarnation is a candidate for the best launch title of the console. Pros: Fluid and with several appreciable ideas from a graphic point of view Excellent variety of levels and weapons Excellent multiplayer mode Cons: Sometimes fluctuating technical sector Game mechanics with few original ideas First-person shooters are not a genre that has developed enough on PlayStation 2, either for users that are profoundly different from those of PC extraction, or for the intrinsic technical characteristics of the machine, which often clashed with the creation of a good FPS. Fortunately, the trend seems to be starting to reverse, and the first to try are Insomniac, the same as Ratchet and Clank, with Resistance: Fall of Man, which is presented at the launch of PS3 in Europe also with two new modes related to multiplayer.", "date": "2007-03-19", "grade": null}
