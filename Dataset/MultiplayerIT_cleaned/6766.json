Made up of only two people, the studio is known for the creation of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, a game that actually already arrived on PC in 2011, receiving quite positive opinions. A success that led the duo made up of Pietro Righi Riva and Nicol Tedeschi to create a version of the same title also for the iOS platform, from which Fotonica has recently made the transition back. Thanks to the publication on Steam through the Greenlight program, the Santa Ragione game now has the opportunity to enjoy a new youth, taking advantage of the stage offered by Valve to expand its user base: to do so, the new release of Fotonica brings with it some new content, added by the developers to a basic system that we have already had the opportunity to appreciate at the time of the game's release on iOS. The new opportunity was good to play a few more games on the PC version of Fotonica, rediscovering the game through the eyes of those who see it for the first time, without however ignoring those who have already had the opportunity to play it in the past. The very Italian Santa Ragione are making a comeback on PC with Fotonica, now on Steam Rhythm and speed The idea behind Fotonica is quite simple: you have to run, run and run again, making use of the single button that makes up the game's control system. A concept that on PC could seem almost blasphemous, but which after a few games proves successful in representing the frenzy of execution without any frills, on which this title points in a rather clear way. The gist is this: holding down any key will make the protagonist of the game run within the track in front of him, while interrupting the pressure causes him to jump. Once in the air, it is possible to press the button again to accelerate the ~landing~ operation, then resuming the run in the way just described, thus continuing until the end of the level or indefinitely. The game modes available to us are the same seen in the past, with some additions here and there that are certainly pleasing: the main one is the Arcade one, in which the player must navigate through eight different levels to try to get the score maximum. A task that may sound simpler in words than it actually is. Fotonica also reserves an extreme speed phase for the player, which can be activated after having successfully completed a series of evolutions without incident. While on the one hand you need to make the most of these moments to get a record score, at the same time you need to pay the utmost attention to the jumps to be made and the paths to cross: although you run in one direction only, the levels in fact offer a series of vertical forks, between which you must choose to get more points. The same also applies to the purple spheres that are scattered throughout the various levels, to be collected to increase the total of one's score. Even though it doesn't have an exceptionally high number of levels, Fotonica therefore offers a continuous trial and error in search of the perfect track, able to keep you busy for some time thanks to the four degrees of difficulty proposed. The second mode, called Endless, puts us in front of the most classic of endless runners, through three infinite levels where the goal is instead to last as long as possible in the race, without falling off the platforms. The last type of game is instead the local multiplayer one, called Versus and for the occasion expanded by the developers: the two-player split-screen seen in the old PC incarnation in fact leaves room for up to four players simultaneously on the same screen, thus opening up possible evening challenges with your friends, even more engaging. Minimal style As you may have already seen from the screenshots that populate this page, Fotonica presents itself as a very special experience also from a graphic point of view, which inevitably leaves the player displaced on his first approach. The choice of the guys from Santa Ragione to give everything a minimal touch makes the game phases something bordering on the dreamlike, with shapes and colors that take shape as we progress through the levels: a kind of daydream in the world of Tron, composed of naked and raw polygons that bring to mind Rez, to which Fotonica has been repeatedly compared. The excellent soundtrack, with music belonging to the electronic genre, was created jointly by Michael Manning, Nicol Sala and the composerJapanese author Baiyon, to perfectly accompany what you see on the screen.", "date": "2014-11-12", "grade": "8.0"}
