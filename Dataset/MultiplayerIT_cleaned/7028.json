So imagine the surprise when the Japanese house revealed that it had created nothing less than a rhythm game using some of its most representative characters and a selection of music taken from the various KOF, Fatal Fury, Metal Slug and so on. Songs like ~Big Shot!~ from Fatal Fury 3, ~Fairy~ from The King of Fighters '96 or ~Mojo~ from Art of Fighting 3, to name a few. A rich and multifaceted crossover, therefore, which leverages a gameplay based solely on touch controls and interaction in time with the music. In fact, in the central part of the screen there is an ellipse on whose trace appear, strictly clockwise, ~notes~ proceeding following the rhythm of the piece in the background, arranged in a more or less complex and more or less dense way depending on the stage difficulty. Our task is therefore to touch the touch screen (in any area) when these ~notes~ are perfectly centered by an indicator that works according to the timing, perform vertical or horizontal gestures where indicated and try our hand at the traditional continuous pressures in the presence of long sounds. Nothing that rhythm game enthusiasts don't know, mind you. The difference is that while we try to faithfully reproduce the ~score~ that the game gives us from time to time, possibly wetting our ears in a sea of memories from old-fashioned gamers, the on-screen action shows the character we have selected and his opponent to give them a good thrashing, sinking the blows or avoiding them according to our musical precision, all using sprites, animations and scenarios taken from the SNK fighting games. The Rhythm of Fighters is a light and fun game, but the song selection could have been better The fight... oh, yeah The playful offer of The Rhythm of Fighters is fairly full-bodied, considering SNK's policies regarding mobile games and a very popular selling price (just 89 cents, both on the App Store and on Google Play). The campaign is in fact made up of fifty increasingly complex levels, and to it is added a free mode in which we can select characters, stages and music at will. From the options screen it is also possible to adjust the timing if we feel an inaccurate response to the inputs with respect to the rhythm. That said, the gameplay is immediate and fun, especially when the challenge becomes more consistent and the ~notes~ require a certain glance because you can quickly understand how they follow the music. In reality, however, also thanks to the support characters and their bonuses, it is rare to find yourself in great difficulty, even more so since in many of the stages the goal is simply to avoid the KO until the end of the song, and to do this, just don't combine real disasters, missing entire sequences of touches. This type of inconsistency prevents The Rhythm of Fighters from standing out within a genre that is not particularly well represented in the mobile sector, and goes hand in hand with a selection of songs that we consider below the potential of the SNK franchises, full of iconic musical themes and of extraordinary quality that could have been drawn upon. Of course, it was necessary to leave some space for the inevitable in-app purchases, which in this specific case allow you to buy extra characters (Iori Yagami, Terry Bogard and Nakoruru, who join the already present Kyo Kusanagi, Ryo Kusanagi and Athena Asamiya) priced at 2.69 euros each, packs of support units and extra music from The King of Fighters '96, Fatal Fury 2 and Metal Slug 2, also at the price of 2.69 euros each. In-app purchases not essential to play, but which you will certainly feel the need to increase the variety after a certain number of games.", "date": "2014-07-03", "grade": "7.0"}
