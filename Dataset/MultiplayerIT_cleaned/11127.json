{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2009-recensione.html", "text": "The survival of the most traditionalist Let's start from the new options, where the most interesting mode is certainly ~Become a Legend~, which was initially thought to be a revisitation of the one called ~Be a Pro~ by FIFA but in reality it is nothing more than the evolution of ~Fantasista ~, introduced in Winning Eleven XI and therefore prior to the last EA production. ~Become a Legend~ allows you to take control of a single emerging player in order to make the most of his career, starting from small squads in the suburbs up to playing for big clubs and being called up for the national team. In this mode, the view moves dynamically framing the field based on the area in which the game takes place, to always offer a global view from the point of view of the only impersonated player. Once you become familiar with the camera (however modifiable at will) and get used to the fact that you spend a good part of your time as passive spectators, this mode certainly offers satisfaction and a very different perspective than usual. In fact, starting from the age of 17 (with extensive aesthetic personalization of the player) for a career that can last up to 35, you have to be hired by a first team and therefore participate in training sessions, and then wait for the call-up to the bench, as owner and perhaps in national. There is no control over the line-up put on the field or substitutions, it is your coach who decides when to call you up and in which position to put you (obviously sticking to, but not 100%, the preferred position chosen) and the only way to ensure presence is to receive good grades and respect the position on the pitch. The additional keys used are R2, which must be pressed twice to call for the ball (but which will only work when the pass is actually possible) and L1, which in non-possession situations will help the player to cover the field position most congenial to his role. There is no shortage of a complete set of statistics such as the player of the match rather than of the world, the possibility of improving the characteristics of the player according to six different parameters and a whole ~scenic~ part with news and photos on his football career. Last but not least, the players created for ~Become a legend~ can be used to play online against other opponents, in fact adding a new mode for playing against other human opponents. Another big news is the hoarding for the next few years of the license for the Champions League, which has translated into the possibility of reliving in all respects the most famous international club competition, complete with music. official logos and subdivision of the groups, with matches always played at night and an atmosphere capable of perfectly recreating the walk to victory in the cup, something that will surely please the most passionate of this sport. For the rest, the other modes are the same as always, which is not so obvious given the inexplicable shortcomings of last year: we find friendlies, league, cup, training (complete but without minigames) and of course the evergreen Master League, for the occasion revised and corrected in some small details. The editor is interesting, improved in practically every aspect and certainly the most complete on the market for options and the possibility of intervening on the players' parameters; in particular, the option that allows you to import a photo or capture it with the webcam to give the players the faces of anyone you want is really nice: yourself, a friend of yours, Pippo Baudo. Finally also included the possibility of saving the highlights on the hard disk, exactly like a normal replay and that of being able to use MP3 tracks on your hard disk, to be associated with the various competitions rather than menus. The licensing chapter is a bit confusing. We immediately clarify that from this point of view Pro Evolution Soccer still fails to match the overbearing dominance of Electronic Arts, even if as mentioned in this edition we find interesting news such as the full Champions League license. The English league is still out of the picture: although the players' names are all faithfully reported, the only teams to appear with official names, flags and uniforms are Manchester United and Liverpool. Same fate for the Spanish Liga, with some teams covered and others not. Full license for Serie A (excluding Lega Calcio logo), Edervise and Ligue 1 Orange. Among the new stadiums we find the new Wembley Stadium, a completely redone version of the Stade de France and the Olimpico in Turin. Those who don't dare often escape It is established that the offline sector is certainly valid in terms of optionsoni (we'll talk about online later), what does PES 2009 gameplay have in store for us? The speed of play has significantly decreased compared to the last edition, and if we still can't talk about simulated football, we have certainly returned to human levels that allow a minimum of reasoned play and setting up the maneuver. The physics of the ball seems almost perfect, certainly the best in circulation today: the ball is heavy at the right point, and both in the case of throws and rebounds, rather than in rainy conditions, the behavior is convincing. Even the physicality of the players is rendered quite well in the tackles and impacts, returning a sufficient feeling of ~heaviness~ for the players. Unbeatable responsiveness to commands, absolutely perfect. As already mentioned, however, what could make many turn up their noses is the strong link with past editions, from which now historical defects are inherited for whose resolution it seems that the necessary effort is not made on the part of the developers. In fact, the game is still entangled in the schemes and plots that every enthusiast now knows by heart, with few novelties and rare exceptions. Too often it happens to see identical situations repeating themselves in the same circumstances, too often we are still trapped on invisible tracks, where the players don't care about the commands given (for example, in the case of throws or through balls it often happens that they stop for an instant or even go towards the ball, even if with the joypad we try to push them in the opposite direction). To mitigate these effects, the ~super cancel~ returns, which on paper allows you to free yourself from the tracks and direct the player in the desired direction, but the results are not always the desired ones. Years later, the technique of the ball on the wings is still more lively than ever, allowing you to get to the cross in seconds. It is precisely the through ball that has improved slightly, while the automatic passes (those with X on PS3 or A on Xbox 360, to be clear), in some circumstances need to be reviewed. The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled players has instead improved, especially in the case of defenders, as well as for goalkeepers, who seemed to us to be the right compromise between being very strong or completely useless. Fortunately, dribbling has also improved, which, although far from the simulation rigor of the competition, is now less foolproof and more realistic. Finally insert a couple of new feints. Graphics and sound Graphically, rather visible progress has been made compared to the 2008 edition and although the title cannot boast the same number of obsessive details present in the EA house, in some aspects PES 2009 manages to be clearly better than its rival. One of these is immediately evident: the vast majority of the players are really very similar to their real counterparts, which instead does not happen in FIFA 09. The animations are not particularly different from what has been seen in the past, and have a fairly high average quality, revealing the flank only on some occasions (see the type A race). The spectators in the stands are still rather mediocre, but the stadiums are more than fair, many of which are new or totally refreshed. The lighting and the effects on the 3D models are not particularly exciting while all the bugs of the last edition have finally been eliminated, with a fluidity always anchored to sixty frames per second and in any condition, which finally makes it pleasant to watch the replays and appreciate the particular action. The commentary deserves a separate discussion. The two commentators are well matched: goodbye finally to Civoli (undercover) and Sandreani, welcome to Gianluigi Pardo, who guarantees that touch of professionalism that never hurts, and to the legendary Jos Altafini, who colors everything with his bizarre ways of say and his evergreen enthusiasm, admit! The result is finally positive and capable of rivaling the other pair of Sky Caressa-Bergomi, a pity that there is a lack of bite in the most agitated actions, where instead the legendary John Kabira, who for many years accompanied the various Winning Eleven gave its best, giving that involvement and fun are perhaps the basis of the very concept of this type of video game. Comment Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 is not the revolution promised by Konami, but it still manages to get the series back on track. A discreetly packaged game, pleasing to the eye, immediate and fun, which however pays the price of introducing very few new features and relying on mechanics that have been dragging on for years now without substantial changes. Ultimately who wants more immediate fun and spensirato is oriented towards Pro Evolution Soccer 2009, those who prefer simulation and greater freedom can also turn to the competition. To date we have two almost complementary games on the square for which it is not possible to clearly pronounce who is the winner and who is the loser, if not by putting options and online on the plate, which hang more elsewhere. The total renewal heralded by the nice rogue Shingo Takatsuka has therefore remained a vain promise, but this does not mean that we are talking about an unenjoyable game. Still unbeatable in its immediacy, Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 nevertheless manages to give long hours of entertainment to both newbies and regulars. Hell, hell of a SeaBass.

The online game, this unknown who perhaps also represented the biggest flaw of the last edition, returns in a much more appropriate and desirable guise, starting with the ~Become a legend~ mode, where, as already mentioned, it is possible to challenge other created players with your own player from human opponents. Once logged in online (with the Konami ID for PC and PlayStation 3) we are presented with a screen for selecting servers on a national basis, to then be able to choose the lobby, each made up of a thousand people. In this sense, nothing is missing, with the room and public chat, the text one with predefined phrases (updatable) and the vocal one, the possibility of inviting users on your friends list also on PlayStation 3, of creating private rooms, of challenging other opponents of a similar level to your own (the so-called matchmaking) to end up with a good number of statistics and the possibility of blacklisting users. What is missing, however, are the online modes, which do not go beyond the classic single-player classified match up to 2 against 2, without any tournament or other more specific and fun in terms of longevity. As for the much hated lag, we experienced much less of it during our games than in the past, although we weren't entirely free, based on who was online and who we were playing against. So we are far from the havoc of the 2008 edition, but we are not completely satisfied yet, above all looking at other people's houses.", "date": "2008-10-16", "grade": null}
