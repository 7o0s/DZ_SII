{"name": "Chi chiamare quando una casa va a fuoco?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/emergency-4-recensione.html", "text": "Who knows how many of you readers have dreamed at least once, as children, of becoming daring firefighters, or brave policemen or even heroic doctors: it will be for the fascination of saving lives, it will be because not a year goes by television doesn't fool us with fictions about how cool it can be to do one of these jobs, it will be because they have a huge bite on the fairer sex... Be that as it may, despite the fact that reality is not quite rosy like the one we are told or shown, Emergency 4 has, despite the evident low budget production, a large dose of charisma that will make the player turn a blind eye to some gross flaws and, in some cases, even cry out to the masterpiece. Fortunately, as often happens, the truth lies somewhere in between... The gameplay Emergency 4 falls within the strategy titles, putting you in charge of a center that takes care of intervening in cases of more or less serious emergencies: it will be your task to manage teams of firefighters, police, workers and doctors, in as many lives as possible, in the shortest possible time and without causing excessive collateral damage. The main game mode introduces an interesting novelty: in addition to the classic natural disasters, ranging from a fire on the high seas to the flooding of a town, your game session will be interspersed with a town map where, in a completely random minor accidents such as a heart attack, a small fire from a cigarette butt, or a traffic accident will occur. Your task will be to manage multiple teams at the same time to deal with these minor problems, taking care to prevent the situation from escalating into a real catastrophe (we imagine you know that fires spread): once you complete one of these micro-missions, you will be given credits with which to upgrade your units or, if necessary, buy new ones. It is, without a doubt, a rather interesting novelty, which substantially links the main missions to each other, represented by the already mentioned catastrophes of enormous importance: unfortunately, in addition to a certain repetitiveness of the events, the game shows what is its defect always, namely excessive rigidity in the structure of the game. This means that, substantially, you will not be free to decide which upgrades to buy or which units, but you will necessarily have to choose between a champion that the game will allow you to choose and which, generally, you will find yourself having to use in the immediately following mission: this is not such an excessive sin, given and considered that, once all 30 units available in the game have been unlocked, your choice will also expand, which was so limited during the first missions. Depending on the funds at your disposal, it will be up to you to decide whether to send a tank fire engine or a classic fire brigade vehicle, with all the pros and cons of the case: the tactical choices are, in the end, rather limited, but despite the city session is rather limited in terms of variety of missions and possible approaches, the discussion becomes decidedly different as regards the main missions. tactical choices The main missions, also known as catastrophic events, represent the real backbone of Emergency 4: in these you will basically have to face a biblical misfortune and except for some mandatory steps, it will be up to you to decide how to face the mission assigned to you. This means that, in addition to having to choose between the vehicles and personnel at your disposal (and, in some cases, even their equipment), the pre-established budget that will be assigned to you will be free to invest it as you wish: to put down a revolt do you prefer to deploy a few police patrols, or send in an armored car of special forces? To smother a fire, is a tanker better, or is it better to call the mighty Canadair, as effective as they are expensive? The choice, of course, depends on your personal assessment of the situation and you will have to make an effort to consider, as far as possible, even the unexpected, which could make the situation degenerate into something so colossal that you will not be able to deal with. All seasoned with a decidedly frenetic pace: no boring timers at the top of the screen, but rather your one and only goal, which is to save lives; needless to underline the fact that, in the event that the deaths begin to take on worried dimensions, you will be quickly taken to the game over screen, forcing you to start the entire mission again. You will therefore have to be skilled strategists and moreorganize your actions in a simple and effective way, always working on several objectives at the same time and keeping the work of your men under control who, it must be said, rarely show any spirit of initiative. The defects In fact, speaking of defects, Emergency 4 shows all the signs and defects of economic productions, starting from a decidedly old-fashioned graphic, which despite making the title usable even for those who do not have a particularly up-to-date computer, on the other hand will enrage those who have invested hundreds of euros in a video card that will pretty much go dormant the whole time. However, even though it is not such a relevant aspect, the most annoying errors are a poor artificial intelligence, for which you will have to accompany your men, hand in hand, through every single, tiny action, and a general repetitiveness of the situations during the micro -routine missions, which most of the time will ask you very little initiative and repeat the usual sequence of actions: to save a poor fallen old man, you will always have to send an ambulance, have the poor gentleman visit a doctor, stabilize him, load him on the ambulance with the stretcher, get the doctor on the car and return to the base and end of the mission; however, after a few minutes, here is another elderly man who falls and gets hurt: and you, again, send the ambulance and so on. This repetitiveness makes the free game mode even more useless: no catastrophes to face, but only and exclusively micro-missions to face, to the bitter end, without any purpose, as well as the multiplayer which, among other things, is particularly unstable when looking for a host to connect to: during our tests it was rather difficult to finish a mission with other players, while it was far too usual to return to the desktop without any error messages. Defects therefore that, given the reduced selling price, can be forgiven, but if only the developers had paid more attention to these elements, by now we could have compared Emergency 4 to much more famous and mass productions. Comment Emergency 4, despite the series of flaws mentioned in the previous paragraph, also features some rather interesting cards: first of all, the charisma of the characters in the game and the situations proposed which, more than once, will make your adrenaline rise so many will be the variables you need to consider. Added to this is a playability that settles in the average of the real-time strategy market, with several units available and a good variety in the main missions of the game, some of which are truly of remarkable quality. After all, for less than 20, FX Interactive allows us to bring home an interesting game, which will be enjoyable for several hours, but which you will then abandon on the shelf. We therefore feel like recommending the purchase, since we enjoyed playing it (and, in some cases, quite a lot), but be prepared to be lenient on some rather substantial flaws.Pro Fun in the short term Some really fun missions Against Graphically old-fashioned Quite repetitive Unstable multiplayer PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 1.8 GHz or AMD 2200+ RAM: 512MB Video Card: Ati Radeon 9200 or Nvidia 5500 Disk Space: 2.0GB Test setup Processor: Intel Core Duo E8400 at 2.66GHz RAM: 4GB DDR3 Video Card: AMD Radeon 4870X2 2GB Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium", "date": "2009-04-21", "grade": null}
