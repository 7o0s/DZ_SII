Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. A brave captain decides to challenge the armies of seven evil generals of space: this is, in brief, the plot of Calculords, the original strategy with trading cards developed by Ninja Crime and available for free on the App Store. It is a game born from a precise idea, that of promoting the learning of mathematics through a system that starts right from numbers and from three possible ways of combining them, in this case the operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication. How exactly does it work? Once one of the available opponents has been selected, within a path that sees the unlocking of new enemies only when a certain level of experience is reached, the game screen provides us with three ~lanes~, a handful of drawn cards randomly from the deck and, on the right, some randomly generated numbers. Each card bears a number, and to use it it is necessary to draw that value from the right side of the display, starting from an already present number or trying to obtain it through the aforementioned operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication. Considering that our opponent on duty will also have the same tools at his disposal, the objective of the game is to fight the troops along the three ~lanes~ and reach the end of them, in a progression that goes from left to right, to deal damage to the evil general until his health gauge drops to zero. Easy, right? With the pipe. Calculords is an original, addictive and damn challenging strategy with trading cards The secrets of the abacus Calculords is a very thick strategist, there's no doubt about that. Beyond the mathematical mechanism underlying the gameplay (which also challenges us to use all the numbers to get a bonus and double them, with the possibility therefore of fielding a greater number of units per turn), the experience it is not a simple exercise in which whoever has the largest army wins, but it continually stimulates us to consider the nature of each individual trading card. There are three types: attack ones, ~push~ ones and special abilities. The attack cards imply the descent into the field of units which limit themselves precisely to attacking according to their offensive values; the ~push~ cards instead play the important role of moving the enemy units to the right, preventing them from getting too close to the left end of the battlefield to inflict direct damage on it; finally, special abilities are bonuses or extra attacks that do not involve the direct use of aliens, soldiers, mechs or anything else. Being able to effectively combine all these elements requires a certain skill, but the end result is extraordinarily satisfying; also due to a rather high degree of difficulty and an approach that we don't hesitate to define as ~hardcore~, to which the developers have resorted, however, in an at least questionable way. In fact, to gain the experience necessary to unlock all seven enemy generals, you need to defeat the same opponent at least two or three times, which inevitably makes the process repetitive. In short, lengthening the campaign by introducing a greater number of generals, perhaps working on a more gradual increase in the challenge, would have been preferable. Despite this limitation, the formula underlying the experience works damn well and is addictive, also turning a blind eye to stylistic choices and not exactly exciting color combinations, while remaining within the so-called ~pixel art~.", "date": "2014-04-12", "grade": "8.0"}
