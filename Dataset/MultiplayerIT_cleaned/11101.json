{"name": "MySims Kingdom - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mysims-kingdom-recensione.html", "text": "The idea of MySims, now destined to become the starting point for a real series, comes from EA's desire to present Will Wright's unlucky little men in a guise more suited to the ~traditional Nintendo user~, which in the common view is made of gamers who are a little younger than the average and, for some time now, by a whole segment of the public that, before the DS and the Wii, has always had very little to do with video games. The first MySims, developed for Wii and DS, was a fairly successful experiment last year, especially on the flagship of the Grande Enne: the portable version, on the other hand, left something to be desired in some respects, and what better occasion than a sequel to make up for the mistakes of the past? Accidental hero This time the game has been given a slightly more detailed ~narrative~ context: the little Sims in Nintendo sauce, cute, chubby and cartoony, this time they are the subjects of a real kingdom, governed with wisdom and benevolence by the old King Roland, who by the way is also a pretty good cook... While, however, in the Wii version of Kingdom you are at the center of the kingdom, on the laptop you are a citizen, particularly well-liked, of a peripheral village in which the king, from time to time so much, he comes to visit. You have been on vacation for some time, and on your return, the mayor Carla greets you warmly just as Roland arrives on one of his visits: everything seems to be going well, but unfortunately on the night of your arrival, while you sleep in your cottage , dark forces are unleashed in the village, This time the game has been given a little more detailed narrative context Accidental hero destroying everything that made the surroundings beautiful and functional and wreaking great havoc. Needless to say, Roland and Carla entrust to you (but who knows why, then) the task of making everything go back to how it was before: Dr. F., a brilliant and mad scientist, is giving you a hand, who provides you with a whole series of machinery (then he will also update them as you continue) useful for constructing and placing all sorts of city buildings, from houses to a beautiful ornamental planter. Your task is therefore to restore prestige to the village and happiness to the citizens, and in doing this who knows you won't be able to unravel the mystery that hides behind the strange events mentioned above... Noah's Ark Quite early in the game you will come across a nice treasure hunt that will accompany you for quite a while: almost all the animals have escaped from the zoo and it is up to you to photograph them, recover them and put them back in their place. Of each animal you know where and when it is most likely to meet it and thanks to your construction skills, in some cases you will be the one to create the conditions to attract it! My kingdom for an essence! The fundamental mechanism lies in the possibility of recovering the ~essences~ of the various city furnishings and then recombining them, again thanks to F.'s inventions, and thus obtaining a new object to be placed in the city. Talking to your fellow citizens is necessary, only in this way will you go ahead in a game that presents non-linear characteristics within a structure that remains linear, in the sense that only by solving certain problems do you have access to new areas and new tools, but in the meantime that you solve them you can easily go around carrying out secondary objectives or playing one of the nine mini-games present. The secondary objective is also that of personalizing one's home and one's person, now turning to the tailor's shop, now to the furniture store, now to the one of curious and extravagant objects where you will spend most of the Simoleons (the currency of the Sims universe) ~hard~ earned in minigames or given by Sims who are particularly grateful to you. As much as you may like wandering around without a particular goal, sooner or later you will still have to go ahead and to do this, as mentioned, solve a ~main~ problem, but how can you distinguish one from a simple ~accessory~ request from our friends? It often happens that you resume the game after saving it and don't remember what you were doing at all Simple, you can't, at least not before solving it! And what's more, in a system that resembles, albeit in a reduced version, the ~quest~ system of many RPGs, the possibility of keeping a record of the tasks performed and those still to be performed is rendered with a system as cumbersome as it is imprecise , which involves entering the menu and navigating the biography of each character encountered, with many strokes of the stylus and very little efficiency. It often happens that you resume the game after saving it and don't remember at all what you were doing and above all where and for conto whose, so much so that most of the time you'll spend walking around talking to everyone (characters even change places depending on the part of the day) until you come across the Sim you're looking for. The situation improves when it comes to analyzing the ~free~ component of the game: you can create and place street furniture without any restrictions whatsoever, and this will still improve the situation of the village. The extremely limited customization possibilities compared to other titles will certainly not make the more elderly players cry out for a miracle, but they should reach the goal with the younger ones, the target audience for MySims. Even technically there are no major revolutions compared to the previous episode: the graphics engine is the same, and this involves nice and rounded characters, fluid animations but little detail and colors that are a little too dull, all underlined by a soundtrack without infamy and without praise and with characteristic spoken expressions in Simlish. Comment The mixed free and mission structure and its simplicity could make MySims Kingdom an ideal title to bring younger players closer to those extremely more complex games that are most popular with the so-called hardcore gamer audience. Unfortunately, however, the EA title, like its predecessor, lacks that attention to design and technical implementation that should be primary in any production of a certain breadth: playing is never, mind you, a bad experience, but at the same time it almost never succeeds to involve properly, and this despite a very promising initial idea, which deserves, in any future episodes, to be exploited better. Pros The idea is promising A certain degree of freedom Nice graphic style Cons Doesn't assist players as it should Not very engaging A few steps forward from the prequel", "date": "2008-10-28", "grade": null}
