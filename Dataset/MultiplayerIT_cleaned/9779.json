{"name": "Il vero golf?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80990-real-golf-2011-il-vero-golf.html", "text": "Those who know Gameloft well know that the French house does not leave out any segment of the market, offering products for all tastes and enriching its catalog with even more variants within the same vein. This is the case of Real Golf 2011, a ~realistic~ golf simulation that contrasts with the arcade and spectacular character of the recent Let's Golf! 2: two titles that on paper deal with the same subject, in short, but which are characterized by diametrically opposed basic philosophies. The product reviewed here features a total of ten real-life golfers (Anthony Kim, Natalie Gulbis, Camilo Villegas, Vijay Singh, Greg Norman, Jim Furyk, Sergio Garcia, Annika Sorenstam, Justin Rose, and Karrie Webb) competing in ten fields (also real) located between the United States, France, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Scotland. You immediately notice the classic attention to numbers and quantity that has always distinguished Gameloft games, always made with attention to duration and variety. We therefore have characters that differ on the basis of a series of characteristics and that through the acquisition of experience points can ~grow~ and gradually become more skilled, a shop from which it is possible to purchase additional equipment (capable of improving our accuracy shooting, power and so on) and a good number of game modes: quick game, career, challenges, free mode and a multiplayer that can be enjoyed online or locally (via wi-fi or bluetooth). Swing when youre winning Apart from the graphics, what are the elements that actually make Real Golf 2011 a real golf simulation rather than an arcade interpretation of this sport, like the aforementioned Let's Golf! 2? Firstly, we have less permissive shot management, which exposes us to mistakes even during the apparently simpler phases (for example when the distance to the hole is very short) and which, in general, implies a more reasoned and patient approach to the game . This does not mean that it is not possible to rely completely on the choices that by default the game makes for us, however: you can compete and win a match without touching the controls that regulate the direction of the shot once, even if you manage to obtain these results when the difficulty gets higher, or when we challenge another player, it becomes much more complicated. Secondly, the swing system is not based on timing, but requires the execution of a ~slide~ with a finger on the appropriate area, with the precision of the ~drawing~ and the speed of the movement to determine the goodness of the shot. It is a solution that can create some difficulties at first, but which once mastered proves to be all too simple to use, casting some doubts on the goodness of the choice made by the developers with a view to maintaining a certain degree of realism. Those who don't appreciate this system can still access the options screen and select the ~classic~ one based on the timing of the touch, which however leaves something to be desired. The control system is in some ways cumbersome, with a little intuitive management of the ~rotation~, while the remote adjustment of the direction of the shot does not present particular problems. The solutions adopted for the ~close phase~ instead appear unconvincing: the grid that visually represents the inclination of the ground is not clearly legible, the trajectory adjustment is too sensitive and finally the ball is often not very visible compared to the grass. A series of limitations which unfortunately, taken all together, end up undermining the enjoyment of the experience beyond certainly important numbers: the career mode is really full-bodied, varied and long-lasting, the challenges (organized as ~scenarios~) are a welcome extras and the online multiplayer works very well, although it suffers from too much downtime. And the technical realization? From the point of view of the polygonal models and textures, an excellent job has been done, in addition the lights change dynamically depending on the time of day. The animations are perhaps the least successful thing, not for their quality and fluidity, but for how they are linked to each other and for the numerous uncertainties between one sequence and another, which suggest a lack of care in the optimization phase.
