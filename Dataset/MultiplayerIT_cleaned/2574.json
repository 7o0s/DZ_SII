{"name": "Theme Park Inc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/theme-park-inc.html", "text": "After some time, a new simulation based on amusement parks appears again on the videos of PC owners (after incursions made on the various consoles) which attempts to combine the Theme Park setting with the design ~technique~ in a single product by Roller Coaster Tycoon. Indeed, Theme Park Inc inherits the scheme and style of play of its predecessor by attempting to introduce the possibility of building and developing one's own attractions based on the concept of roller coasters. When I grow up I will be a manager! Now let's see why this time we find ourselves having the management of an amusement park in our hands. The president of the Theme Park Inc. consortium has decided to retire, and has chosen you, an Assistant Manager of the group, as a protg destined to succeed him in the management of the company. So here you begin your adventure as a park manager, and if you are able to acquire company shares and distinguish yourself in management choices, you will be able to own the fateful 51% share that will make you the new president by right. Your efforts will begin with a plot of land, a couple of already functioning attractions and capital to invest as you see fit. At the beginning there will be advice and admonitions from your mentor who will try to direct you towards the most prudent choices in order not to make you fail in a short time; moreover, in order to always have the progress of your structure under control, you can count on a virtual secretary (Microsoft Office assistant style) who will inform you of the most urgent problems or requests-complaints made by the park staff or its visitors. The first investment that you will have to make, in order to start up the park, will be to hire personnel assigned to various tasks (gardeners, street cleaners, technicians) personnel who you can then, as the game progresses, train in order to specialize in certain spheres of intervention. You will therefore be able to create street cleaners/territorial reclamation workers, technicians/operators for the ~evolution~ of attractions, policemen/experts in dealing with customers, etc. etc. The choice of which employee to train on which subject cannot be random, if you want to have good results, but it will have to be calibrated on the needs and preferences of the same. When I grow up I will be a manager! Furthermore, the technical evolution of your subordinates must also be focused on the problems that you will face in the different scenarios (three in all: Arabian nights, New science, Polar zone) that you will have to face as the game evolves. Once your small park has been replenished with insiders, you can start buying new attractions and new shops where your patrons can buy food, drinks, gadgets. As with Theme Park, you can decide the price and quality of each individual service by setting a series of parameters; for example you can decide to put chips at a low cost by simultaneously increasing the quantity of product and salt in order to then make up for it with drinks which will have a significantly higher price and a large quantity of ice. You can make these settings uniform for all types of shop or make them vary from kiosk to kiosk, thus increasing visitor traffic in one area rather than another (in fact, your customers will tend to go to eat where you pay less, thus advancing even in areas that may not be very busy in the park). In addition to managing shops and refreshment points, you can also define the operating parameters of the individual rides by defining the maximum and minimum load at which they must operate and the ticket price required to access them. As park manager you will also have to take care of the logistics of roads, toilets, advertising equipment and green areas in order to make every single attraction perform at its best and at the same time make your visitors happy and contented. ~Grandpa...grandpa let's go on the MegaTurbo AstralLift??~ ~Of course little one, wait for me to turn off the peacemaker...~ A novelty included in this new version of Theme Park lies in the differentiation of users of your services, in fact we will have to try to satisfy different types and groups of users who will go from children to their grandparents. Obviously each of these customers will want/be able to take advantage of different forms of entertainment (there will not be many elderly people who will shoot themselves on a Kamikaze, just as there will be few children sitting in an old cinema), and therefore you will have to think about how to plan your investmentstimings and modify your rides to allow everyone to have fun. In order to understand if your park works or not and if you like an attraction or not, in addition to the usual statistics on the approval rating, you can visit what you have created yourself. Through the game's 3D engine you can in fact zoom the view up to a first-person view of the environment, thus having the possibility of turning between the public and the built buildings and, straight, you can test the rides you built using them in the first person. In this way you will also be able to better evaluate the logistical solutions that you have implemented, realizing if you have exaggerated in putting loops in your roller coaster or if it is necessary to lengthen the barriers that delimit the waiting line at the attraction. ~Grandpa...grandpa let's go on the MegaTurbo AstralLift??~ ~Of course little one, wait for me to turn off the peacemaker...~ While some rides will be ~prefabricated~ others you can build them to your liking. As happened in Roller Coast Tycoon, also in Theme Park Inc. you will be able to build the tracks and evolutions that your attractions will have to follow based on the concept of ~roller coaster~ and to do this you will have at your disposal a component editor that will allow you to build with as many as 18 different styles for your structure. A very interesting element is given by the possibility that you will be able to save your project and send it via the Web to a friend of yours who can in turn modify it or simply insert it in his own portfolio. Still with regard to communication via the network, you can also take snapshots of your park and send them in the form of a digital postcard to whoever you want. So Pierino, did you have fun at the park? Let us now try to draw conclusions about this product. The Park Inc. undoubtedly represents an improved sequel to its predecessor but precisely for this reason it does not propose any truly noteworthy innovations. It's fun to be able to visit your own park as if you were a customer, and it's gratifying to be able to try your own attractions... but in the end this is a management game and therefore even these ~fun~ aspects are destined to take a back seat floor. On the other hand, the elements that determine a greater difficulty and variety of the problems to be dealt with are interesting, in fact, in addition to the aforementioned different age groups, we will also find ourselves faced with situations of good/bad weather, with all the consequences of the case (closed attractions, ice creams that are not sold, requests for umbrellas...) which oblige us to build a park that is also oriented towards the future and not only towards the present in which we are operating. Another positive note is given by the possibility of being able to build one's own attractions and then exchange them online with other users, a factor which undoubtedly gives added value to the product. Moral? Let's say that Theme Park Inc. is a good product for lovers of management-style games, and above all it is intended for those who have loved the previous products in the series or who have never tried a simulation based on an amusement park... if, on the other hand, the first episode didn't exalt you, then it's better to jump on other titles as no innovations are presented that would detach it from its predecessors. Come, sires, come and see the largest and most spectacular amusement park that has ever presented itself to their eyes come and try the loop the loop Since, at the young age of 6, I went for the first time in a amusement park my life changed radically. I was totally in love with the ~torture~ attractions that were offered to the patronsdead loops, continuous accelerations of gravity, upside down to make my stomach turn... in other words, adrenaline. Since then I have never missed the opportunity to undergo any experience that can increase or decrease the acceleration of gravity on my body, upsetting my physical balance. In addition to this, I fell in love with the mini-world that was made up of the amusement park which was based on delicate balances dictated by infinite technical maintenance of the attractions, ingenious intuitions and designs by engineers, tireless performances by extras and artists... all focused to the enjoyment of the customer. More than once I have asked myself what capital and what efforts must be used in order to make one of these parks work properly, and when the first Theme Park came out I was delighted to be able to touch a simulation dedicated to the world of entertainment firsthand.ment, and like me there were many other video players who decreed a good success of the product. In the wake of Theme Park, another game dedicated to the construction of playgrounds was also released in its day, Roller Coaster Tycoon which focused above all on a particular attraction, roller coasters and their design.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
