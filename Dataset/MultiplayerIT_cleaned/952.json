{"name": "Ghost Recon 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-2.html", "text": "Arcade strategy Having to choose a point from which to start, let's choose the playful side of Ghost Recon 2 in order of importance. As already mentioned at the beginning, for fans of the series there will be something to turn up their noses as compared to the prequel this new chapter could almost seem like a ~Arcade~ version of the same. Let's start with the third person view. Framing and cameras are not a problem for GR2 (we will conventionally call it that). The setup phase that preceded each mission has effectively disappeared, leaving room for a quick briefing. The storyline sees us as protagonists in North Korea to avert a possible nuclear war against the United States, after a Navy ship was shot down by a missile in the Sea of Japan. A mere pretext to start, of course. However, each level is absolutely unrelated to each other, and once the incipit is given to the story, it becomes damned inconsistent and frayed, without any continuity, placed there at random in an arbitrary and loose way along the 14 total levels. Obviously GR2's biggest problem isn't this, even if a more attractive and exciting ~pretext~ would be preferable for such a title. From a gameplay point of view, the new cut given to GR2 seems to have been created along the lines of SocomII. From controlling an entire squad or two, the action mostly shifts to our one character. From controlling an entire squad, the action mostly shifts to our one character Arcade strategy It is still possible to issue orders to the other 3 members of the group, but this will be absolutely irrelevant for the completion of the level. Indeed, often doing everything yourself will be preferable for speed and efficiency. Having eliminated the team setup session, the game is much more immediate and faster, but unfortunately it loses all its peculiar strategic feeling. Even the very structure of the levels encourages a lot of pure action and truncates the legs at any tacticism. The levels are very linear and limited, and the feeling of being inside a large closed ~box~ will accompany us until the end credits. Many locations are inaccessible, such as enemy turrets that you'll want to climb up to get a wider view. Many hills that will show themselves to our eyes are merely accessory and aesthetic, as they are enclosed by an odious invisible wall that will prevent us from climbing them. We are dealing with a 3D shooter on rails, just what a war game should never do, especially if it is called Ghost Recon. However, the variety of weapons remains very valid, offering every imaginable sort of pistol, rifle or submachine gun. The gist of Ghost Recon 2. Although this Ghost Recon 2 in the end turns out to be nothing more than a shoot'em up, unfortunately it also ends up being boring and frustrating. The levels last an average of 15-20 minutes, and are nothing more than a succession of moments of waiting for the enemy-shooting-still waiting. The aim of the Korean snipers is absolutely infallible, and with one shot they can kill us instantly as we advance quietly with our troops. Having learned each point where the enemy will fire, just avoid it or face it with greater caution and the game will be done. Enemies will always appear in the same locations and always shoot in the same directions. GR2 thus becomes a memory game of identifying key points, mechanical and very frustrating given that above all there are no intermediate save points. For most of the time even boring as the playful part is reduced to the bone. Turning to the audiovisual sector, there are not many improvements. The framerate is dancer, the textures poorly defined and the use of polygons inexplicably thrifty. The framerate is dancer, the textures poorly defined and the use of polygons sparing The gist of Ghost Recon 2. The character animations aren't very aesthetically pleasing either. The use of colors is spot on and stylistically correct, however, giving a (vague) impression of photorealism. The audio sector is on the contrary much more refined and decisive. Sounds and noises are reproduced at their best, and give the use of weapons a very good feeling. Even the music, in-game and in the menus, is excellent. Going back to the ~cutbacks~ chapter, it should be noted the complete lack of online play (but what was the adsl adapter for cube for?), but above all of any cooperative mode with multiple players, which is absolutely possible on the GameCube. The absence of the multiplayer game weighs doubly given the scarcity of the single sector. In conclusion, if the words used in the review were not enough, the release of thisto Ghost Recon 2 on GameCube is merely ancillary. Rarely in a video game of this genre have there been so many flaws, of all kinds, at every level. From the lack of a plot of the plot to the absolute linearity of the levels, from the absence of tactics and mission setup to the mediocrity of the technical realization, passing through the invisible walls, engine bugs and the frustration given by the lack of intermediate save points, up to to the lack of any kind of multiplayer mode, from online to live. A negative record that heavily invalidates the name of this saga and that will certainly keep many players away. Pros: Very good audio Variety of weapons and equipment Cons: Technically mediocre Levels linear and full of invisible walls Lack of any multiplayer mode Ghost Recon returns with a highly anticipated sequel by the community of fans. Ghost Recon also returns to Nintendo GameCube, with a different version than the PC and Xbox one, and completely comparable to the PlayStation2 one. There are many differences between the two that we will analyze in detail. To create this ~second~ chapter, the developers have also changed. The original Red Storm team makes room for the Ubi studio in Shanghai, and in this review we will find out together how they fared in the work done. Ghost Recon has established itself on the market as a very playable war strategy, and this sequel has been appreciated on competing consoles for its qualities in multiplayer, both offline and online. Unfortunately, the GameCube version will not be able to take advantage of either of the two, and moreover the cut given to this sequel is diametrically opposite to that of the prequel.", "date": "2005-04-26", "grade": null}
