{"name": "RIDE 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ride-3-recensione.html", "text": "RIDE 3 communicates from the outset a planning of depth, which has led the franchise to establish itself qualitatively compared to the other Milestone-branded productions. Proof of this is a finally conscious use of the Unreal Engine 4, with two different graphics modes that allow you to enjoy a resolution greater than 30 frames per second or to give up some detail by opting for the stable 60 frames. However, it's not just a question of technique: the developers of the Italian team have focused on substance, increasing the motorcycle park and the number of tracks, redesigning the career to make it a colorful and convincing mix of experiences, and retouching those aspects of the physics and artificial intelligence that were not fully convincing. The end result is a fundamentally traditional product in its mechanics, but very solid and pleasant to see in motion: a perfect combination to aspire to a reference position for the genre. RIDE 3 in numbers The over 230 bikes immediately available in RIDE 3, belonging to 26 brands and divided into seven categories (sports, maxi enduro, endurance, supermoto, racing superbike, caf racer and naked), guarantee an excellent variety in terms of gameplay. Once you hit the track, in fact, each model differs from the others in terms of weight, responsiveness, cornering management and final speed, all aspects that we can work on thanks to an intuitive boosting system that allows you to modifying various elements of the engine, transmission, brakes and suspension, finally arriving at the aesthetic aspect and the rubber compound. When a new component is purchased, the change in performance is immediately notified, both in detail of the characteristics (acceleration, top speed, handling and braking force) and of the total power of the bike, the latter being a fundamental category indicator from the point of view of races. The approach is therefore the traditional simcade one, with a career progression that is marked not only by access to new events based on the stars conquered (three for first place, two for second and three for third in each race ), but also by the growth of our vehicle, which is essential to be competitive against opponents who initially have an edge. On the track front, 12 new tracks have been introduced for a total of 30 circuits and over 40 variants. Here too there is an abundance of variety and personality, ranging from settings such as Nurburgring, Brands Hatch, Daytona, Donington Park, Monza, Imola or Laguna Seca to urban scenarios set on Spanish, Finnish, American and naturally Italian roads. Staying on the numbers, the modes include the aforementioned and renewed career, fast options such as single race, time attack and drag race (introduced in RIDE 2, allows you to try your hand at races based exclusively on acceleration and final speed), multiplayer to challenge other users in races or entire championships, and finally the weekly challenges, which will offer new ideas and content continuously. Road test Milestone's racers have always been characterized by extensive driving settings that allow you to shape the gameplay according to the player's needs and tastes, and RIDE 3 is no exception, while compacting the options to make the choice more immediate. In fact, it is possible to select a general difficulty preset, modify the complexity of the artificial intelligence of the opponents (who in this way will become not only faster but also more aggressive, although their behavior is still unlikely), the simulation level (which makes it more or less easy to stay in the saddle during difficult situations), activate or deactivate the ideal trajectory indicator, change the transmission from automatic to manual, use the Rewind function (the classic feature that allows you to rewind time in the event of an accident or mistake) and finally adjust the driving aids, in this case automatic braking, joint brakes, ABS, anti-wheelie and off-piste assistance. In short, it is possible to act on many aspects to make the competitions more demanding, progressively on the basis of our experience and the approach we prefer; this is a very important element given that the game allows you to enjoy a more arcade or more realistic experience without renouncing the solidity of a gameplay that very effectively summarizes the work done so far by Milestone, and which in the field of two wheels knows well few rivals. We particularly liked the diverse and engaging approach of the new career, which captivates fans ofmotorcycle between details, history and particulars of each single-seater and each category, dividing the events as if they were catalogs and gradually making them more full-bodied, more complex and detailed, drawing from the freshest and most original methods we had seen in the second episode of the series. From a stylistic point of view, we also appreciated the management of the garage as a personalized hub, very nice to see thanks to the abundance of visual effects and reflections on motorcycles and objects, in which to change our avatar's clothing from a purely accessory part (jackets, jeans, t-shirts and shoes), on the other more pertinent to track work (overalls and helmets for the various races). Finally, a few words for the livery editor, which allows you to change the appearance of each vehicle (together with the aesthetic customizations) by applying paints and vinyls on each side, through a layered system that will certainly give satisfaction to those who want to stand out. also allowing you to share your creations with the community and in the same way download the liveries created by other users: a certainly welcome extra. Playstation 4 trophies There are 51 Trophies in RIDE 3, and most of them can be obtained by winning a race on each of the circuits in the game. However, the achievements also go into the details of the individual actions, such as ringing valid laps in the time attack, reaching a certain maximum speed, unlocking the various Milestones, covering a certain number of kilometres, completing 20 online races and of course reaching the end of the long career in single player. Technical realization RIDE 3, as written at the beginning, is the first Milestone racer that effectively uses the new graphics engine adopted by the Italian team, the Unreal Engine 4. This translates primarily into the presence of two different graphics options, one at high resolution but locked at 30 frames per second, and the other that uses a lower resolution focusing more on fluidity, with 60 very stable frames. We clearly preferred to play by activating the second mode and appreciating the punctual and precise work as usual on the polygonal models of the bikes, assisted by a good level of detail as regards the tracks, which nonetheless move between ups and downs: the sports circuits they impress with the quantity of visible objects, while the extra-urban settings from this point of view manage to give something more. The effects, which are anything but exasperated, highlight a philosophy devoted to performance rather than visual impact, so don't expect extremely spectacular graphics from RIDE 3: from that point of view, TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge manages to make Better. However, the performance of the rain and night races is good, one of the novelties of this episode. As a first ~conscious~ step with UE4, however, the game convinces and foreshadows an interesting future: not only is the fluidity flawless, as already mentioned, but all those annoying pop-ups that were noticeable in the Milestone's first titles using the new engine. In short, the improvement is evident and we imagine that it will lead to further positive developments. The sound sector is excellent, with a certain fidelity in the reproduction of the rumbles of the various engines, a discreet audio environment during the races and a good soundtrack, which however annoyingly tends to click during even short loads: we are sure that with a patch you will be able solve the problem quickly.", "date": "2018-11-28", "grade": "8.2"}
