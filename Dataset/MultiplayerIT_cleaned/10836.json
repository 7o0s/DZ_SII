{"name": "Kung Fu Master Class", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kung-fu-master-class.html", "text": "The contrast between good and evil, the fights with no holds barred and above all the roundhouse kicks are things that never go out of style, even the good old Chuck Norris knows it well. Beyond the films focused exclusively on martial arts, in fact, the oriental fighting style has been part of the collective imagination for decades and never fails to be mentioned, even in the fight scenes of the most prestigious film productions. It is clear that this type of influence is exerted even more strongly in the world of video games, where the characters are usually involved in spectacular fights and to get the better of their opponents they must resort to ever more realistic movements and moves. However, this is not the case with the new product developed by the Chinese team Soco Soft for In-Fusio: Kung Fu Master Class is in fact not an action game as the images might suggest, but a ~casual game~ in which different tests are faced, based on reflex speed or memory. The start screen allows us to select one of the six minigames available at will, and after entering our name we will be able to try our hand at the tests present with the aim of obtaining a record score. The ~Dragonfly Dance~, to begin with, has a rhythm game structure: to allow our character to run across the roofs without falling, we will have to quickly press the keys indicated on the screen through a sequence that first refers to one or more directions of the d-pad and then to one of the number keys. Clearly, failing the combination results in game over, while resisting means gradually tackling increasingly complex sequences. The second minigame, ~Devil's Claw~, is a skill test in which we will have to balance the character by moving the d-pad left and right while he is balanced on a pole, holding himself vertically only on his fingers. Sometimes a countdown will appear, after which a bolt of lightning will crash to the ground and we can avoid it by pressing the 5 key at the right time. The ~Longevity of the crane~ is the only test based on memory: we will have to remember the positions of the new Bruce Lee and then indicate them on a table at the end of each round, with a tolerance of only three errors. ~Fist of wrath~ is instead a pure reflex test, divided into several phases: at first we will have to block an indicator while it is in the center of a pile of bricks; after which we will have to press the 5 key when the power bar is at its maximum, to break as many objects as possible with one blow. ~The final boss 1~ is precisely the clash with a boss who shoots fireballs at us: by pressing the 5 key we will be able to reject them and hurt him, while using the d-pad we will be able to avoid them. Finally, ~The final boss 2~ is a simple ~survival~ in which we will have to hit various enemies from all directions by pressing the corresponding number key. Technically, the game is far from spectacular: the design of the characters leaves something to be desired, but it is above all the mediocre use of colors that deprives the In-Fusio product of the visual impact necessary to rival the most recent mobile games. A good job has been done for the animations, while the legibility of the numbers (where you have to press the number keys) is unfortunately bad. Finally, the sound is hard to get noticed but has an appreciable independent volume adjustment. PRO Very simple Six minigames available Nice basic idea... AGAINST ...but completely devoid of thickness Limited and repetitive action Technically mediocre", "date": "2009-03-06", "grade": "S.V."}
