However, there is an air of change at TT Games: the team, specialized in reinterpretations based on plastic bricks, seems to have received the complaints of gamers, especially those who are not exactly young, and with LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes (as well as with the recently announced LEGO City: Undercover for Wii U) has decided to put on the plate a series of innovations that do not revolutionize the franchise but certainly ~refresh~ it, waiting for further evolutions. One of the cornerstones of LEGO titles has always been represented by the presence of a ~base~ from which the characters on duty can access the various levels, both new and already completed ones. In the case of Batman, needless to say, this ~hub~ is identified with the Batcave, but this time to reach the place we are interested in we will have to jump aboard the Batmobile (or one of the many vehicles to be unlocked over the course of the fifteen chapters that make up the story mode), press the accelerator and follow the path indicated by the bat-computer until you reach your destination, screeching through the streets of a lively and pulsating Gotham City, a real sandbox full of opportunities, people to save and objects to collect in the most unthinkable places; a city in serious turmoil after the Joker manages to escape all the criminals locked up in Arkham. But let's proceed in order, because LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes also introduces important innovations in the plot, which can finally count on a minimum of thickness thanks to the insertion of dialogues, which greatly enrich the humor to which TT Games has us used to but which, after years of silent skits, needed to be expressed more fully. It all starts with a gala evening in which the city of Gotham awards the man of the year: in the running are the billionaire Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor, candidate for president of the United States and Superman's historic nemesis. When the presenter announces that it was Wayne who won and gives him the commemorative statuette, however, an uproar breaks out: Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, the Penguin and other criminals burst into the room and empty the pockets of all the rich participants in the ceremony and then flee. Taking advantage of the confusion, Bruce Wayne manages to put on his bat-suit and jump into the fray together with his inseparable Robin. The fight is without quarter and the dynamic duo must resort to the use of high-tech vehicles to deal with the Joker's super speedboat, but in the end the villain is brought to justice. The point is that shortly after he will be escaped by Lex Luthor, interested in forging an alliance to eliminate not only Batman, but also his friend Superman and the entire Justice League once and for all. How? Well, you'll find out by playing... Playstation 3 trophies There are thirty-eight Trophies in LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes. Fifteen are obtained simply by completing the same number of chapters that make up the story mode, while for the others you have to commit a little more, for example by obtaining 50% or 100% of completion, by collecting all the gold bricks hidden in city, beating all bonus levels and unlocking all bosses. Puzzles and punches If you played with the first episode of LEGO Batman, you know what to expect from the real action of this sequel: many enemies to face (which however go down with a single blow, highlighting all the limits of an overly simple and slippery) and solving puzzles based on interacting with the scenery and managing the characters' abilities. While waiting for TT Games to decide to get a handle on this aspect of its products, it must be said that the many new costumes (with relative powers) available for Batman and Robin, as well as the presence of the various Superman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern and, in general, the Justice League largely manages to mitigate the inevitable deja vu and to offer us interesting, sometimes even complicated situations, which in the end represent the only real challenge of the game. As with all LEGO titles, in fact, death in LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is a relative concept, especially when we play the role of Superman (who can't even be hurt, rightly so). You never come across game over, you never have to start over from a check point, which is certainly an anomalous but effective way to avoid episodes of frustration deriving from the imprecision of the platform mechanics or the aforementioned combat system. Thishowever, the defects remain and it is impossible not to notice them, together with new uncertainties deriving from the driving sessions and from a certainly immature sandbox management: in the first case the graphics engine shows the side to showy drops in the frame rate, in the second case we find ourselves often having to view the map to understand where to go (and moreover there is no button that activates and deactivates it instantly). We expected something more from the driving sessions, especially the flying ones, in which control of the vehicle is reduced to the bone and all you have to do is operate the cannons and hit the targets on duty. Little to say on the technical front: the characterization of the LEGO-style characters is perfect, the relationship between Batman, Superman and Robin makes you crack and there is a lot of variety in terms of costumes and scenarios. The sound is excellent, thanks to the excellent dialogues (in English, subtitled in Italian) and to the soundtrack taken from the first two films dedicated to the Dark Knight. The Wii version Like any self-respecting LEGO title, LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is available on almost all existing gaming platforms, and in the case of Wii it boasts the same gameplay and structure as the HD version. We go too far: playing with the Wii-mote and Nunchuk is in many ways more fun than the traditional controller, because the infrared pointer allows us to manage the viewfinder of vehicles as well as some powers (such as X-ray vision) faster and intuitive. Too bad driving the Batmobile with that configuration of controls is a nightmare. The sound is the same available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, therefore excellent, while on the graphic side the speech is a little more complex: the sandbox-style Gotham City is also present on the Nintendo console, but with a generally poorer visual horizon and, above all, devoid of all special effects such as transparency, which translates into some solutions that are really ugly to see (for example when the police flashing lights ~illuminate~ the scenario and the characters).", "date": "2012-06-25", "grade": "7.8"}
