{"name": "Submerged", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154144-submerged-emozioni-alla-deriva.html", "text": "Founded in 2011 in Australia by three developers with a past linked to successful 2K series such as BioShock and XCOM, Uppercut Games is an independent software house set up with the express purpose of creating games for technically cutting-edge mobile systems, as well as products designed exclusively for digital delivery platforms. After the very good debut with the EPOCH series, a shooter on rails welcomed by critics and the public both for the technical sector (based on the Unreal Engine) and for the well-kept gameplay, Ed Orman, Andrew James and Ryan Lancaster have totally changed course, launching himself into a third-person adventure with a poetic flavor, cloaked in those reflective and emotional elements that have carved works like the splendid Journey into the hearts of enthusiasts. In such particular titles, the recipe proposed by the developers must be almost perfect, and from the promotional material released up to now, Submerged seemed to have all the credentials to hit the target, unfortunately missed by a lot due to the numerous and sensitive problems that emerged during the test. Here's what we think. Despite the good incipit, the first emotional work of Uppercut Games is lost in a teacup Playstation 4 trophies In Submerged there are ten Trophies, divided into 5 bronze, 4 silver and one gold. There are no platinum trophies available. The five basic objectives are related to reaching certain places, such as the highest point on the map and all semi-submerged hotels, as well as using the postcard function and discovering all creatures. The Silver Trophies are mainly related to collecting various collectibles, such as books and boat upgrades, while the single Gold Trophy is related to completing the campaign. Something bad Taku and Miku are two young brothers abandoned to their own destiny on an old motorized fishing boat, a makeshift vehicle which, when the game starts, penetrates into the heart of a disquieting and majestic semi-submerged city, whose surfacing architectures reveal a glorious past as a modern metropolis. We know nothing of this world dominated by water nor do we know the reasons that prompted the two boys to enter it, and only by exploring the colossal ruins will the (light) narrative substrate shaped by the Australian developers unravel step by step. The fascinating incipit is supported by the emergency situation involving the protagonists, given that Taku, the younger of the two, is unconscious and seriously injured in the abdomen, and his sister Miku - controlled by the player - must do everything possible to save him from certain death. After gently placing her brother on an altar inside one of the buildings, the girl begins to inspect the surrounding concrete carcasses with her telescope, discovering that on top of some of them there are emergency boxes parachuted from an airplane , ideal for recovering first aid kits, medicines, food, water and tools useful for the difficult rescue. The main purpose of the game therefore consists in identifying these precious resources (ten, to be exact), reaching the various buildings with the boat and climbing them for recovery. That's all. The mysterious city, of which a map is available to update through exploration, is not particularly extensive, and if you want to discover the secrets that have reduced it to this state, you need to collect the sixty collectible ~books~ scattered around the world of game. Apart from some symbols that recall our alphabet, there is no real text to read in them, but they unlock stylized images that must be interpreted in sequence to reveal all the background. If the task of clarifying the gloomy semi-submerged metropolis is delegated to the books, the story of the boys is unraveled by Miku during her tormented dreams, which follow each other every time she returns to the base to assist Taku. To feed the disturbing atmosphere there is a sort of ~curse~ that affects the entire city, enveloped in mephitic waters that have corrupted the mysterious inhabitants and marine creatures. During boat trips you often come across dolphins, whales, manta rays, birds and other animals clearly disfigured by corruption, but even more cryptic are the humanoid figures who, apparently threatening from afar, scrutinize our rescue mission with interest. Easy life As specified, the main purpose of the game is to explore the submerged streets of the city with the boat and identify the objects of interest to collect. The small motor boat, which can be upgraded with twenty-six bonuses thatincrease the duration of the turbo, it is not particularly responsive in the commands, especially during the rapid turns and in the management of the acceleration, however it is above all the control system of the girl that leaves a bad taste in the mouth, due to plaster animations and a decidedly limited approach to the setting, which translates into dated, scholastic and not always effective gameplay dynamics. They totally lack fluidity and artistic inspiration, cutting off the legs to the expressive power of the image and consequently to the balance of the work. Miku, among other things, can never die and has no enemy to worry about, and the whole playful experience is delegated to simple exploration and reaching the tops of buildings to collect emergency crates. If that weren't enough, the buildings are all very similar to each other as well as the climbing routes, which continuously mix the same ingredients. Basically we find two types of platforms, external stairs, pipes and climbing plants with signal red flowers, with a practically non-existent level of challenge offered, given that the road to the main objective is always easily identifiable and the level design is rather cheesy; only in one case did we have some problems in instinctively understanding which was the correct path. A button for running is missing, which is certainly useful in certain circumstances, while to jump, it is sufficient to tilt the left analog stick of the DualShock 4 in the desired direction. Dead Sea The graphic impact of Submerged, driven by the new and powerful Unreal Engine 4 engine, was undoubtedly one of the elements most exposed in the promotion phase, nevertheless pad in hand the global result on the Sony flagship is anything but convincing. Beyond the continuous and unacceptable uncertainties of the frame rate, almost never anchored to 30 frames per second and with moments in which the engine can literally ~stop~, it is the overall view that does not hit the heart as it should, for various reasons . The color palette is all too bright and recalls a bad copy of the one appreciated in the first Uncharted on PlayStation 3, the anti-aliasing filter is not very effective, there are several flat textures and above all the rendering of the water, i.e. the dominant element, is not at all in step with the times neither from the fluid dynamic point of view nor from the purely aesthetic one. Of course, the dynamic lighting sometimes manages to give some truly fascinating glimpses, especially at sunset, however the limited polygonal complexity, the design of the city without artistic flashes and the woody animations spoil the overall picture. Suffice it to observe the animals in motion such as humpback whales, dolphins and seabirds, characterized by coarse and dated animations which instead of enhancing the visual impact weigh it down awkwardly. Furthermore, the buildings do not have internal structures to explore and in the entire map there are only ten particular structures (called attractions) to discover, although they too do not have an original or particularly sophisticated design. The accompaniment of the soundtrack is fortunately of a good standard, thanks to music written by the Canadian-Australian composer Jeff Van Dyck, winner of the BAFTA award and already author of soundtracks of successful titles such as Alien Isolation, Total War Shogun 2 and other chapters of The Creative Assembly saga. However, we must underline that some ~copying~ is noted in the chords and piano melodies, in particular a certain contamination from The Last of Us is evident, furthermore there is not much variety of pieces, although it is undoubtedly the aspect best of Uppercut Games production. Even the sound effects, after all, just do their job. The element that definitively cuts the legs off the Australian work is longevity: in fact, just over a couple of hours are enough to complete the main story and collect a large part of the collectibles.", "date": "2015-08-05", "grade": "5.0"}
