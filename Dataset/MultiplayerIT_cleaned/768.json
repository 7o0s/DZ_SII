{"name": "Cold War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cold-war-recensione.html", "text": "Accidental hero Once upon a time it was customary to face the enemy alone against everyone, knife between the teeth and power-ups in the bag, regardless of the professional category one belongs to. Tradition, however, is known to be the subject of challenge for the new generations and so it was that Rikimaru launched the idea of entering through the back door instead of the main one. Since then, infiltration professionals such as Sam Fisher were born, forced to wait for hours hanging by his feet and Solid Snake, on the verge of ingesting midges just to last a minute longer. What can Matthew Carter do then, investigative reporter on the trail of a scoop in dear Mother Russia and then unwillingly ended up in the hands of the KGB, accused of being a spy? Here, this is what we will discover by playing Cold War, a new stealth-action proposal directly from the developers of DreamCatcher. And rest assured that this Carter must have gone to a very special journalism school, where evidently an AK-47 is no less important than a fountain pen. A very special envoy As we have said, Cold War is a stealth game, which would like to point in a different direction from the clichs of the genre but which in reality ends up proposing a game system already seen and now dated. Let's try to understand the reasons even if the knots come to a head right away, since our brave journalist, as an assault reporter and not a special agent, is well sparing in acrobatic skills. This means that we will see him proceed crouched, hanging from ledges or at most hiding under a table but certainly not throwing himself off a roof to fall into a room, even if it is a choice that is extremely consistent with the clothes of the character. The problem is that this coherence is completely fluctuating, because our reporter actually shoots like a cowboy but above all he is able to assemble all sorts of devices starting from the most disparate pieces that he manages to collect along the way. This is the most inviting and at the same time least fitting aspect of the entire game. If, on the one hand, by collecting ~projects~ we will be able to learn new inventions such as stun bullets, soporific mixtures or expansions to increase the magazine capacity, on the other hand, one wonders how it is possible that a photojournalist has such a high level of knowledge in the field of survival. Not a small detail when the enemy is almost always able to kill us with the first shot, since in the firefights we remember that after all we are not green berets. A very special envoy However, we accept the thesis of the degree at M.I.T. that we now know is able to turn students into McGyver, but we find it hard to understand the existence of a special camera of which our pseudo-agent is completely unaware: the one that should in fact take simple snapshots turns out to be a device capable of providing us with an X-ray vision capable of inflicting damage from a distance! Let's bet that even the degree in the prestigious American university loses a few hits on this. In any case it could be an interesting gimmick, because it allows us to see the location of the guards even through the walls, but it ultimately turns out to be a surrogate for the various thermal or night vision goggles that have always been part of the baggage of the good infiltrator. Problems of coherence aside, the idea of inventions is tantalizing but results in a false innovation, slightly changing the game system, which is based on the reiteration of the identify-stun-proceed scheme which ends up tiring very quickly. No hint of interactivity with the environment, except as regards the gray areas, of which an indicator warns us that indicates how much we can consider ourselves hidden from the enemy's sight. Unfortunately, however, it is all rather coarse and the same underdeveloped light physics ends up offering a game mode without stimulating nuances. One has the constant impression that the game has not been completed, due to numerous bugs affecting the action, such as the warning phrases pronounced by guards not present on the map, or the apparent attention of an enemy as we sneak up behind him , while in reality a real noise-based detection routine is missing. We tried to open and close a door in front of a patrolling guard (in an alert situation) and he didn't show the slightest sign of suspicion, proceeding along the established route. Perhaps details of this kind could have meant little four years ago but now they are all the more essential. However, let's break a spear in favor of the conspiracy hatched against the damnedi of the journalist and the fascinating setting, which goes from the Kremlin to Lenin's tomb, passing through the foggy streets of a very cold and melancholy Moscow, survivor of the glories now lost in the distance. Not only the narration but also the scenarios and the halls have been reproduced with care and love, to create an atmosphere that relieves Cold War from its many shortcomings, not least a very cumbersome and unintuitive control system. A missed Pulitzer Prize Cold War feels like an unfinished game, surely made with effort but almost completed in a hurry. Certain flaws of the A.I. they are unacceptable, especially if you want to play the stealth-game card and there are underlying inconsistencies that do not allow Cold War to transport the player away from reality into his fantasy world. It simply lacks the pace and bite needed to captivate and it's a shame because the story is intriguing and the ability to choose your own inventions is a starting point that deserves further development. However, there is too little atmosphere and too much repetitiveness, complete with introductory sequences made with static comic images that cannot compete with the style of narration on the genre proposed by titles such as Max Payne. Cold War is like an elaboration of ideas already seen here reproposed too late to be able to tease the savvy user, remaining on a level of general flatness. On the other hand, it is difficult to experience moments of tension when the animations are so clearly stylized and what should be a race appears instead as a kind of jogging in the middle of the park, with the impression of going slowly compared to the energy that the protagonist deep in moving the arms. The same goes for the graphics, too spartan in the management of lights and textures. However, we reiterate that the commitment can be seen and this can only make us hope for a sequel that is in step with the times and smoother in its implementation. For now there is only a simple title for low-demand players looking for instant entertainment. Final comment Cold War does not offer great novelties of its kind, which let us remember is that of a third-person stealth-action, but rather rests on the experiments of titles that have already passed and with which it cannot be compared, especially if we think of the most recent digital incarnations of these sagas, that of Splinter Cell above all. It remains a beautiful story and an anti-hero who could have given more, both in terms of charisma and in terms of interaction with the elements of the game, to offer that flavor of novelty which is instead only caressed. Unfortunately, the gaps in terms of A.I. and technical presentation do not put the user at ease with an adventure that remains only sufficient. Hope remains for a sequel that is braver and less fearful of straying from the traditional rails. Pros The Soviet Union has a charm suspended in time Interesting narrative intrigue Well-kept environments Cons Several shortcomings in the game system Knows everything you've already seen The graphics are years old Cross-platform Cold War will appear in shops for both PC and Xbox and the difference is played out both in terms of graphics and controls. Owning a joypad if you are a PC user can make the difference between the peace of your phalanxes or the contortion into which you will be forced by the continuous pressure of too many keys associated with the actions of the protagonist. The speech is naturally different for the faithful of the green X, who will have an easy time switching from one menu to another. As regards the technique, however, the Xbox version is perhaps more appreciable, although in any case subdued compared to the average of the titles, while the defects are unacceptable on personal computers, accustomed to much higher standards.", "date": "2005-11-08", "grade": null}
