Would you have ever believed it, if they had anticipated it before the announcement of the developers? Irony that doubles, considering that the version for all other consoles has been postponed to the next few months, while the Nintendo Switch port has met every deadline, and at the time of writing it is available for download (digitally only). The version for the hybrid console by Nintendo, therefore, received special attention, a treatment of its own. And the results are visible. Because Crysis (yes Crysis, the very Crysis that has practically often been used as a graphics benchmark on PC) really runs on Nintendo Switch. And not too bad, as you are about to read. The conversion and the technical sector Since this is undoubtedly the most interesting and pressing topic, let's start from the conversion of Crysis Remastered on Nintendo Switch, curated in collaboration by Crytek and Saber Interactive (those of Call of Cthulhu, to understand each other) and marked by a word of order that we will probably recall often, even later: compromise. Crysis Remastered on Nintendo Switch is the result of a necessary, evident and (in the vast majority of cases) positive compromise. We somehow managed to compress Crysis into 7.2 GB of space, and make it available on Nintendo Switch in a completely natural way: as if it had always been designed for this console. Here then is that the main adventure, which can be completed in about 10 or 12 hours of play, runs smoothly and without a hitch; occasionally we encountered some crashes of the entire application, but these are sporadic cases and in any case not at all problematic, thanks to the quick automatic saving of the title. From the point of view of pure numbers, Crysis Remastered (in theory) reaches 720p and 30 FPS in both TV and portable mode: nothing more, nothing less; but that's not a small thing, since it is Crysis and - at the same time - Nintendo Switch. The frame rate remains decently stable in many situations, even when we believed it would soon give way; instead it drops by a few points in the most agitated or full of enemies and means of transport (even if the player is driving them). Nothing too drastic however: these are short sequences in which it probably goes from 30 to 25 FPS. Equally variable are several details related to the game graphics: Crysis exploits the dynamic resolution in an intelligent way, so that the overall glance, especially outdoors, is almost always satisfied. However, the compromises are evident (see how this word returns) especially with game assets and textures: it is easy to see objects that suddenly become rough, angular, grainy, and which a second later are once again acceptable again. Also omnipresent is that well-known blur on the horizon, which disappears as you get closer. Well, however, as regards the introduction of a new lighting system of the game world, which thus always appears realistic and evocative. Beyond the considerations on the technical sector, the player can only feel a sense of satisfaction during his games of Crysis Remastered on Nintendo Switch: the overall yield is really decent, although far from perfect. But in all likelihood (and this is the point) it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to do better. Gameplay The debut of Crysis dates back to the now very distant 2007, therefore a lot of water has passed under the bridge; and yet, it is incredible to note how even today the title has not only many things to say (and to teach its younger brothers) but also hours and hours of fun for all lovers of the FPS genre. The heart of the whole experience is once again the Nano Muscle Suit, of course, that is the hi-tech paraphernalia supplied to the protagonist. The game controls have been intelligently adapted to the Nintendo Switch controllers, whether you play with regular Joy Cons or prefer the (recommended) Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Using the back buttons, the player intuitively activates/deactivates the various commands of the suit, being extremely careful never to unload it completely; unfortunate situation that can quickly lead to death. On the gameplay side, the nano suit allows you to enjoy considerable advantages: charged jumps, increased running speed, a defensive shield that filters out all attacks for a few seconds, stealth mode that allows you to approach any outpost or enemy without being noticed, to eliminate those present silently. This ensures differenti approaches to similar situations: whether there is a base to assault and clean up or a device to destroy, it will now be possible to proceed like real bullies who fear no one, now in the shadows without ever being seen. The gunplay has certainly aged, but here too the ~Nintendo Switch factor~ comes in handy. In fact, the entire Crysis Remastered can be enjoyed making use of the gyroscope and motion control; our advice, in this case, however, is to deactivate the assisted aim, because from time to time it comes into conflict with the gyroscope, causing even immobile targets to ~miss~. If you prefer, however, the motion sensors can be quickly deactivated from the main menu, thus disappearing without a trace.", "date": "2020-07-25", "grade": "7.0"}
