The irreverent animated series produced by Adult Swim has as its protagonists an alcoholic scientist, Rick, and his naive nephew, Morty, grappling every time with situations that it would be simplistic to define absurd. Well, the publisher has decided to take these two characters and dedicate a mobile game to them. Not just any one, however: a clone of the classic Pokmon in which, due to a dimensional anomaly, Rick and Morty find themselves dealing with many alternative versions of them, most of the time hostile. From the point of view of the traditional Game Freak gameplay, in this case it is the scientist who plays the role of ~trainer~, while the young Morty has to fight with his many variations: the disheveled Morty, the one with the kitten in tow, the old Morty , the white collar, the ghost, the rabbit and so on. In short, instead of the monsters, we will find many crazy reinterpretations of the character, which refer to a symbol between rock, scissors and paper to determine those balances of power which in the Nintendo series are indicated by the elements: a ~paper~ Morty will inflict greater damage than a ~rock~ Morty, and so on. Pocket Mortys is a nice clone of Pokmon, a successful experiment albeit with some limits too many Explore and fight Where in the Pokmon episodes there is a plot accompanying the campaign, with quests and situations that somehow increase the variety of a system that would otherwise be reduced to a few simple mechanics, in Pocket Mortys unfortunately this outline is missing and we find ourselves soon to come to terms with a certain degree of repetitiveness of the action. Nothing excessive, mind you, if we consider the numbers of this production and the fact that you can play completely free and without limits, provided you find (or manufacture) from time to time some chips that are used to ~tame~ the Wild Mortys that are found around the scenarios and that, in this way, we will be able to add to our roster of characters. Otherwise, the fights work exactly as in the famous Nintendo franchise, with a turn-based system that becomes more multifaceted as the protagonists level up and acquire new skills. Of course, during the first hours the presence of relatively small energy bars means that defensive or ~debilitating~ maneuvers are practically useless compared to traditional attacks, but the whole process of growing the Mortys and their management are pleasant, in especially when taken in small doses. By fighting you earn credits that you can spend at any time in a virtual shop to buy healing serums, potions that restore attack points or bonuses that improve the skills of our warriors. Technically very well done and decidedly faithful to the cartoon, voices included, Pocket Mortys ultimately performs its role as a clone really well and, beyond a rather basic combat system, has only one major flaw: it lacks that variety of monsters that only Pokmon is able to guarantee.", "date": "2016-01-23", "grade": "7.8"}
