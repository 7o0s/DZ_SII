The reason is obvious: it seemed that both Moon Studios and Microsoft had very little intention of bringing the second episode of the series to the Japanese hybrid console, mainly for technical reasons. If in fact the debut chapter of the franchise could boast an artistic impact remarkable but not as sophisticated a technical sector, with the sequel the developers have focused in a convinced way on the effects and on the density of the scenarios, full of moving objects or animations in the background. An element that actually weighed a lot in terms of performance on Xbox One, translating into annoying episodes of stuttering, but which on Nintendo Switch has been adapted in a surprising, almost miraculous way, finding the right compromise between visual richness and fluidity to obtain a experience that moves at 60 fps. at launch on the Microsoft console. And if you please. History In the original review of Ori and the Will of the Wisps we spoke, not surprisingly, of Nintendian atmospheres. The wonder and amazement that the jewel of Moon Studios manages to convey are in fact close to those of the best productions of the Kyoto house, an element to which the Austrian studio adds an extraordinary ability to narrate through images. The introductory sequence of the game is a very clear example of this, but certainly not the only one in the context of a campaign in which you will be surprised to keep your eyes wide open and your mouth open on more than one occasion. The story of this sequel takes place after the events of Ori and the Blind Forest, showing us Ori, Naru and Gumo taking care of little Ku until it's time for her to take flight. Owl suffers from an ~unfortunate~ wing, but a cleverly applied feather from her mother, How to Train Your Dragon, seems to solve the problem. The character therefore literally takes off and begins to follow the migratory paths of his fellows keeping Ori on his back, but after a while the arrival of a violent storm defeats the two friends and separates them. Setting When the luminous protagonist of Ori and the Will of the Wisps awakens, the setting he finds awaiting him is very different from the forest of Nibel. Again it is a wild place, full of suggestive views but also of areas corrupted by an evil influence that manifests itself in all its grandeur as soon as Ori tries to reunite with Ku in an attempt to bring her home safely .It is also among the thousand facets of the scenarios that we notice the talent of Moon Studios, capable of designing thick grassy surfaces that contrast with desert wastelands, dark caves that we will be able to go through only by resorting to a specific special skill but also glaciers, areas submerged by explore while holding your breath and others made up of huge gears in constant motion. Exploration goes hand in hand with the unlocking of new abilities for the character: a peculiarity of the metroidvania genre that is rigorously implemented. Gameplay The marvelous colors, the poetics of the cutscenes and the fairy-tale tones of Ori and the Will of the Wisps must absolutely not mislead you: in terms of gameplay, the game knows how to be challenging and sometimes even ruthless, even without treading your hand when it comes to punish us following a game over. Compared to the first episode, a more traditional management of rescues has been introduced, with frequent checkpoints (respawn after a killing always takes place nearby) and ~tubs~ that can be used not only to memorize the position and recharge energy, but also as fast travel points to smooth out the rough edges of an inevitable backtracking. Let's go back to the mechanics, which are typical of action platforms but with an extra cue represented by the rich repertoire of moves available to Ori, all to be unlocked (with the possibility of quickly assign up to three skills to the main buttons of the controller), and the excellent rendering of impacts when we hit the many enemies that preside over the scenario, each with different attack and movement patterns. Needless to say, we find the same elements in the spectacular boss fights, some of which are particularly difficult. There's a sense of variety in this respect too: in some moments we can't do anything but run away, trying to findthe perfect timing between jumps, mid-air dashes and flying charges; but at some point the clashes will be inevitable and will take place according to ever-changing rules, forcing us to memorize them to understand when to remain on the defensive and when it is time to fight back. equally interesting extra elements are added such as time trials and numerous side quests that we can decide to complete to obtain further rewards and thus accelerate the obtaining of all the fundamental skills to be able to reach the end of the adventure. The Nintendo Switch version As mentioned at the beginning, the Nintendo Switch version of Ori and the Will of the Wisps appears extremely well optimized, therefore devoid of the annoying problems that afflicted the game at launch on Xbox One. How was it possible to achieve such a result, which results in a frame rate that consistently maintains 60 fps? Reaching an inevitable compromise. Although in fact the resolution of the game has not decreased that much, by adopting a dynamic solution which, depending on the load, goes from 720p to 900p, the developers have thinned out the background elements and the effects, thus decreasing the visual richness that characterized the title on Microsoft platforms but precisely obtaining very solid performances. The cuts are no doubt noticeable in a side-by-side comparison, but these are sacrifices that Nintendo Switch owners generally expect when faced with the conversion of a cross-platform product they never imagined would ever come to their console. The examples so far are numerous, after all. If however the lighting system, the general quality of the assets and the density of the scenarios have undergone a substantial downgrade compared to the Xbox One version, the Moon Studios title also boasts a soundtrack in this new edition extraordinary and the important extra represented by portability, which allows you to enjoy this wonderful experience almost anywhere.", "date": "2020-09-22", "grade": "9.0"}
