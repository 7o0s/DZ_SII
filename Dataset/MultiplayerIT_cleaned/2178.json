Now that we've seen what we're dealing with, we can delve deeper into the subject and see up close what this SPM makes available to us. First of all, before starting we are given the possibility to choose between numerous scenarios and three different levels of difficulty. Each scenario corresponds to a defined valley with its peaks and vegetation. Of course, we have the task of building the nucleus of this station and making it grow over time. The only structure initially present is the entrance, which represents the point from which tourists will begin to flow with a funny gate. Once the game has started, we find ourselves in a valley more or less surrounded by snowy peaks and untouched forests. The snow copiously covers everything and the trees intersperse the landscape with green punctuations. In short, a mortal boredom! Luckily we are the ones to put our hands on the situation, with our wallets always full (at least at the beginning). First of all, if we take a look at the station entrance we see that, in the corner of the description, there is a small red light. This light indicates whether the building is open or closed to the public and, in fact, the entrance is still locked. Later, when we have built the essential structures, we will be able to open the gates and see the first tourists fill our small village. But first it's better to start building something for visitors to find, right? Among the buildings initially made available to us, we find splendid cabins in passport size that can accommodate from 4 to 16 people. These are very cheap houses, and therefore not exactly the Hilton, but they serve at least to mix together sixteen different pairs of wool socks and as many padded long johns for the snow, in order to have the first tourists on the slopes, ready to crack the breakable and even more. First of all, let's get a ski pass... But besides letting them sleep, these tourists, we'll also have to feed them, right? Well, here, then, are the first small bars and refreshments to be placed here and there, as well as a meager mini-market with which to supply the most demanding customers. In addition, we will find the inevitable special buildings: ski schools, infirmaries, operator stations, etc... The first thing to do, however, will be to build the tourist office, from which we will be able to sell the ski passes for our amazing ski slopes ! And yes, the slopes... What would a ski resort be without skiing? Here, then, that in the end we will find ourselves facing the most delicate and, at the same time, fun task of building our beautiful ski slopes! The first thing to do is find a suitable slope and check that it is possible, then, to create a line with a ski lift or ski lift that allows tourists to reach the top of the slope. At this point, using a convenient vector drawing tool, we can draw the track layout, adding a fair amount of curves and descents. Once finished, we will have to assign a color that indicates the level of difficulty, then green for the easiest, up to black for the slopes of champions. Giving the right color to a slope is a fundamental operation, not to be overlooked, and giving the wrong one means that less experienced tourists will risk ending up in hospital for skiing on a green slope that should actually have been black and vice versa , the more experienced will get bored with the black ones that are actually red. Therefore, I repeat, in order for slopes to be successful among skiers, it is necessary to know how to mark them. After we've worked on it for a while, our village will grow small and nice, with lots of comforts and amusements, even for those who don't just want to ski. At this point, it seems to me that the right time has come to open the entrance to our station and let tourists flow in because, let's not forget, tourism is the soul of commerce! Tourism: the soul of li mort... We were talking about tourists... Oh yeah, because tourists aren't just agglomerations of bytes and pixels! Every tourist has his own character and preferences, as well as his fears and weaknesses. Tourists are like a shapeless tide ready to invade and attack our structures, without pity and without remorse. The tourist has tastes and preferences, he has an age and a gender, he will be rich, well-to-do or poor in the cane, he will be thin or obese, in short, there are many types of tourists and each one has characteristics that make it unique. But, above all, the tourist is a great pain in the snow! Shall we build a runway? Well, the tourist will find it too diffdifficult, shall we build him an easier one? Ok, the tourist's cousin will find it too easy and will complain because there are few bars in the village. Shall we build a cross-country ski run and put a refreshment point next to the pool? The tourist's grandfather will break his femur and kneecap when he comes out of the sauna to go buy pizza with Sicilian forest mushrooms in the mountains. In a short time, therefore, we will discover that our ski resort, so perfect that we had already nicknamed it 'EdenSci', will have sent all budgets into the red, leaving tourists as black as the blackest of slopes and green accountants like ours. pockets. At this point, therefore, a little study of marketing and tourist psychology is required. We will then have to take many variables into account when building our structures. We will have to establish in advance a target to which to offer our services and we will have to pamper the tourist ad nauseum. Therefore, if we like extreme skiing and adventurous holidays, we can focus on the younger age groups and on the prototype of the skier tourist to the bitter end. In this case, we'll build many slopes, even difficult ones, and save on homes, which won't be particularly luxurious but at least offer shelter. In the village we will take care to let the tourist find bars, some pubs but at least a minimarket, so that he can also eat at home, if he likes. And surely our station will have its share of cinemas, discos, bowling and other leisure facilities. Finally, we will have different advertising campaigns available to attract various types of tourists to our happy valley. In this way, however, we are attracting above all young people and sportsmen who do not have a large amount of money behind them and for this reason the income will inevitably be limited. Then, we will have to worry about adding the structures dedicated to families and, more generally, to the more well-off people who are willing to spend. As we can see, then, being able to interpret the needs of tourists is already difficult in itself, but being able to satisfy them, then, is even more difficult as we will have to deal with the balance that almost never adds up, with the shape of the territory which will surely create many problems for us to place this one here and this other one there and with the weather situation which is always the opposite... But pleasure interfaces me... Like the other two hundred thousand titles of the same genre, this SPM will be played almost exclusively via mouse since the whole interface is point-and-click. In fact, where the use of the mouse should represent a simplification, in this case it is a complication, given that often reaching a certain resource is very difficult while, moreover, it is not possible to manage time, slowing it down or speeding it up. This fact translates into a high initial difficulty (but which also manifests itself when a certain gaming experience is acquired) and consequently the playability is compromised by a constant feeling of frustration. As the game progresses, the demands of the game become greater and one realizes that the interface is not as robust as required in these cases. Finding information is never immediate, especially as regards costs, and we often find ourselves wasting precious time looking for specific data (remember that there is no method that ~freezes~ time or slows it down, for allow us to organize resources calmly). In the end, however, you get used to everything and therefore also to a cumbersome interface like this, but the players' patience is put to the test and it is not entirely improbable that boredom will come too soon. Put a boot in the monitor too! So, have you bought your shiny new GeForce 4? Do you have at least 512MB of ram? I hope, at least, that you have a good processor... let's say a nice AthlonXP 1900+ goes... No? Well, you have saved a lot of money and you can still play SPM, even with a used coffee machine (let's say that grandma's moka is quite good). The graphics engine this title shows off is decidedly undemanding of resources, so undemanding that - think about it - the complete installation weighs a good 30 MB! Well yes 30 (read THIRTY) MB, even if on the package it says ~available disk space 25 MB~ but I already count about 60... Oh well, mysteries of file multiplication after numerous games. From a graphic point of view, as you can see from the photos, there is a single resolution, 800x600, and there are no particular effects.tti specials (indeed there aren't any at all), so forget Black & White and everything you've seen on the giant animal islands: here we are on the snow, where the only giant thing is the slalom! Put a boot in the monitor too! There is very little texture and this is less noticeable due to the winter setting as 90% of the scenery is white. But those few textures that are there, while not state of the art, are done well and give the idea of being in a ski resort. The skiers move well and are believable, the buildings and structures look cool, and apparently fit neatly into about 30MB of hard drive space. All in all, therefore, we are faced with a game that does not offer anything spectacular from a graphic point of view and which manages to keep the system requirements very low. Whether this is an advantage or a defect is a subjective fact, because on the one hand it will leave the owners of latest generation video cards and ninja computers unhappy, but it will give satisfaction to those who have an older and much less powerful PC. What disturbs, however, is the presence of some bugs that show up when we least expect it. The most annoying of all manifests itself by preventing us from starting a game if we have not previously set the desktop to 16 bit. Problem of little weight, in reality, but sufficiently annoying for those who find themselves having to switch from one color depth to another before and after playing SPM. Experienced skiers or fall professionals? Ultimately, SPM is yet another clone of the ThemePark, ThemeHospital, Themequellochevuoi series, and even if it cannot reach the level of completeness of its predecessors, it is still a good diversion from more demanding titles. As soon as I had this title in my hands, I basked in the idea of being able to experience winter emotions out of season and in the city, but then the sensation of being behind a monitor immediately took over and therefore the initial involvement faded into the background, revealing so you wait which, caught up in enthusiasm, I hadn't noticed at first. Let's see better... I like snow. I grew up in the snow and with the snow I made huge snowmen with big carrots right under the navel and I even broke a few windows with my legendary depleted uranium snowballs. I have always experienced both the snow and the mountains intensely, so being faced with a game that allows me to create a winter micro-world while staying at home stimulates my creativity and, above all, my curiosity a lot. As a skier, finding myself on the other side of those who create, maintain and manage the slopes was certainly fun, but as a player, on the other hand, I have to pull the ears of the authors for a couple of oversights that greatly affect the playability of the title. Experienced skiers or fall professionals? We have already talked about the interface which is not very easy and which mixes the information requested by the player in a confusing way. We have seen that the graphics engine is rather modest and that it is not free from bugs. Whether it's fun to play remains to be seen. In fact, playing with it a bit at the beginning, I had fun creating and inventing my winter station, but then, going forward, I realized that not only being able to keep within the budget is not as easy as it seemed, but that in order to to keep the station going you need to put up with a lot of information and that often this is dispersed in the various menus, impractical to scroll through. Simulation maniacs will certainly appreciate the possibility of having many types of tourists available and being able to manage employees one by one, not to mention the weather factor, which increases the level of realism of the game, but whoever thought they could simply pull down a couple of slopes and enjoy being a ski architect, he will certainly be disappointed by all this cumbersomeness. So, we are faced with a title that is to be loved or hated: spartan and essential graphics, complicated interface and many variables to manage, plus a few bugs that always pop up, like mushrooms. If you belong to the group of fanatics of simulations and extreme realism, then you will certainly forgive some shortcomings here and there, but if instead you want a game that is nice to look at and carefree to play, then with Ski Park Manager you are off track. Ah... don't forget that in the package there is also a discount voucher for MONTEBIANCO magazine and a coupon for a discount on the slopes of Val d'Isere. But you're not buying it for that, are you?", "date": "2002-04-03", "grade": null}
