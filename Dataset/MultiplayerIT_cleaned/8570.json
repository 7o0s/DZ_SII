It goes without saying that in the crowded and competitive world of racing games, the fact of being able to count on an exclusive, official worldwide license can represent a substantial difference in terms of visibility, arriving in some cases to alone determine the success of a product. As far as MUD - FIM Motocross World Championship is concerned, however, the presence of a reasoned play structure is perceived, a work that goes beyond the simple homework carried out to be able to exploit the license and capture the interest of the niche of enthusiasts. It is above all its immediacy that strikes, the freshness of its composite essence, but mainly devoted to immediate fun, contrary to what a licensed motorcycle simulation might suggest at first. It is a characteristic that seems to be part of the Milestone DNA, from Screamer onwards, also reaffirmed in a high-sounding title such as WRC (the only official video game of the World Rally Championship), or rather the ability to maintain a certain balance between the thrusts simulations and motoring fanaticism on the one hand and a powerful, profoundly playful base on the other. On the other hand, a sport like Motocross probably finds its true representation in the arcade, a transposition of the spectacular and crazy spirit of mud motorcycle racing into a video game naturally leads to a more ~caciarone~ approach, but not for this less dignified from a playful point of view, indeed, because the result is to all intents and purposes a racing game with its own identity. Unfortunately, the very fact of positioning itself on a borderline between arcade and simulation keeps it in a precarious balance that risks not satisfying everyone in the long term, just as the particular interpretation of the driving model is not always fully convincing. Mud baths As we said during the hands-on, it was a question of reworking the typical gameplay of motorcycle racing video games in order to adapt a sport that is not covered much in video games, or interpreted only in its exaggerated acrobatic elements, to a video game that is as complete as possible. Racing and stunts are therefore the main elements of MUD - FIM Motocross World Championship, which equally divide the game structure within the various modes present: the Official Mode (with the MX1, MX2 and MxoN championships), the multiplayer and the World Tour. The riding model has not undergone enormous variations from the preview version examined previously, therefore there has remained that certain gap between the behavior - relatively stable and constant - of the bike and the extreme conditions of the track, even if the differences inclination and the ruts created by the passage of the motorcycles are now more consistent. The physics simulation now implements greater effects produced by collisions, which remain almost null between the drivers and still a little permissive even with the background elements but still require some attention, with a careful dosage of the accelerator and the brake on the more tortuous. From this point of view, the behavior of the bike often appears too docile, allowing for constant corrections at minimum costs, partially frustrating the search for perfect trajectories and the cleanest possible ride. It is the reverse of the medal for a game that focuses entirely on immediacy, resulting in fun and accessible from the first games but risking a significant flattening of the game mechanics. Once immersed in the races, one realizes that the focal point of the gameplay does not lie mainly in the ability to execute curves and dose the accelerator, but in the ability to calculate the trajectory and timing of the jumps, so as not to go off the road and taking the right amount of time to be able to carry out the ~scrub~ as perfectly as possible, i.e. the aerial maneuver with which the motorcycle is tilted and which, if performed with the correct rhythm, allows for sudden acceleration. Just to reiterate the idea of the arcade spirit that pervades MUD, a similar acceleration can also be obtained by drinking an energy drink while running: a real old-fashioned power-up. Around the world by motorbike The Championship, divided into the MX1, MX2 and Motocross Nations categories, allows you to compete around the world within the classic licensed mode, built on the basis of the standard race, containing the 12 official tracks of the FIM World Championship and the 84 riders related to the categories. It's FrIt is possible to choose one of the real drivers and carry on a championship with it. Multiplayer, which allows you to compete online in public or private matches for up to 12 players connected simultaneously, is undoubtedly the element that stands out in the long term, with its constant sense of challenge and the behavior of real players that it certainly surpasses in complexity the management of opponents by the not exciting artificial intelligence. As far as the single player is concerned, however, the World Tour is able to provide a valid playful offer, with differentiated challenges and the possibility of making one's rider evolve by increasing his level of strength, resistance, instinct and skill, within a very basic role-playing structure but able to give further meaning and interest to the progression from event to event. For this purpose, the credits that are earned at the end of each race are needed: to buy new skill levels, but also to unlock new riders and new stages of the tour and to buy new items to customize the rider and bike. It's a system that provides an extra push to engage in this game mode, and that makes the World Tour, for all intents and purposes, the best way to enjoy MUD - FIM Motocross World Championship in single player. From this point of view, perhaps the most expert user and motorcycling enthusiast could complain about the lack of the possibility of managing the bike in a more profound and technical way, modifying its set-ups and components to obtain different performances, but it must be remembered that this is not a simulation but a fundamentally arcade game and as such it should be enjoyed, with all due respect to the technicalities. I do want scrubs The game structure is therefore divided into two different sections: on the one hand the speed races, which take on different structures depending on the modality imposed by the event, but in general still require you to win against opponents present on the track or by obtaining other types of results (lowest time, highest number of checkpoints cut in a given time interval, remaining last in the race in the ~elimination races~), on the other hand the acrobatic challenges, or the Monster Energy Trick Battle, where the most extreme aspect of motocross. Within well-defined arenas, huge ramps allow long jumps during which we can perform tricks and combos, through a mechanic that is actually rather classic, almost old-fashioned. The bike takes off and remains substantially stable in its air travel until landing, the focal point because if the trick is not completed in time there is a risk of crashing, while pressing various keys in sequence allows you to ring spectacular combos but somewhat woody in execution. In the era in which extreme sports games (albeit within a certain crisis that the genre is going through) try to relaunch themselves by proposing dynamic control systems, more marked by a creative approach with the frequent use of analog commands, going back to the old pressing of keys in sequence trying to make it in time before landing has a flavor between the nostalgic and the simplistic, a choice that does not convince, despite the undoubted spectacularity of the result. The trick competitions are therefore configured as valid interludes between the other competition events, which in any case manage to stand out just enough to avoid monotony. Xbox 360 goals The classic 50 achievements for the equally traditional total of 1000 unlockable points are distributed quite generously in this game. Being a sports game with exhibitions, the achievements are linked above all to the performance in the competition and to the results obtained rather than to a real linear progression, but their organization immediately invites the player to enter the goal-seeking mechanism, assigning the first with a certain ease and then distributing them in a balanced way along the way. Go out in the mud It's not easy to characterize a motocross track in an original and interesting way, but the work done by Milestone in this sense has been commendable. Mud obviously reigns supreme, but the characterizing elements of the various tracks scattered around the world, visible on the side of the track as natural and architectural elements inspired by the particularities of the various geographical areas, manage to make each track distinguishable and interesting. The light effects and the simulation of the behavior of the mud are also good, which changes lap after lap with the ruts created by the bikes, even if the interaction between the bike and the roughness of the ground is not always perfect, sometimes being affected by that detachment that was detected intest venue, mostly perfected but still remaining an integral part of a not overly technical driving model. The paroxysm that characterizes this representation of motocross is evident in the arenas of the Monster Trick Challenge, special events that take place in delimited areas and characterized by rather extravagant scenario elements, capable of making the game action spectacular. The creation of motorcycles and riders is also noteworthy, although some more animation and a greater link between the movements would be desirable, in particular as regards the tricks and combos, rather woody both to perform and to see. The ~comic~ style characterization of the menus and accompanying illustrations is particularly appreciable, which integrate perfectly with the general spirit of the game and confirm that arcade trend that permeates everything. Standard sound effects with the usual problem - common to racing games - of the constant buzzing effect, but the soundtrack is particularly appreciable, which features various songs ranging from rock, punk and more or less melodic hardcore, all perfectly in keeping with the spirit of motocross and this representation of it in particular.", "date": "2012-04-26", "grade": "7.0"}
