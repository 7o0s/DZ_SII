Quix, an Italian company from Milan, has recently designed and produced a unique and in its own way ingenious tool that could be a panacea for all RPG players. This particular product called Quiro is a set of key covers to be applied over the normal keys of our keyboard to make it easy for us to identify that particular function key that we never remember. Quiro will be marketed at the price of 9.90 in an elegant DvD package containing 14 keycaps expressly designed for RPG players. Similarly, two other sets will be marketed, dedicated to FPS and strategy games. Inside the package we will find 14 colored silicone key covers with various images printed on them for immediate recognition of the functions that can be connected to it. The key covers are easily applied to the keyboard keys and include a window to make the original function of the key always visible, in a nutshell the key covers allow an always optimal view of the letters on which the keys are applied. Of these 14 keycaps 12 are designed to apply to normal keys, 1 for medium keys such as ALT or CTRL and 1 for large keys such as CAPS LOCK or TAB. Everything in its place The images and colors of Quiro's key covers easily recall the functions of standard role-playing games, the large key cover with the map drawn will obviously be positioned on the ~TAB~, the key with the chest represents the inventory and will usually be positioned to I and so on. Once each key has been assigned its key cap indicating its function in the game, we would be ready to test it in the field. I tested the product on two different games at the antipodes in terms of play style: ~Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal~ and ~Diablo II~. For the first game, I knew the key mapping so well that Quiro didn't seem particularly useful to me, in fact the lack of keys depicting defense and healing spells often confused me more than helped me. Instead in Diablo II the music has definitely changed! In an Action RPG where immediate access to a key can mean the life or death of your character Quiro can make the difference. I never remembered which key was the weapon change and here I am the right keycap, the keycap with the image of a potion immediately positioned on ~1~, in this way the mere tactile sensation of the keycap makes me immediate potion slot access. The same choice of colors and images on the key covers seemed decidedly more appropriate for games like Diablo II and studying the Dungeon Siege reference card I can only confirm my feeling. In conclusion A decidedly interesting invention that I see oriented above all for Action role-playing games, or for fresh games where the mapping of the function keys is not already perfectly known. It certainly made me happy while playing Diablo II, even if I can't help but point out two small flaws, the first already mentioned, the lack of keys for healing spells, the second instead concerns the use of Quiro during normal work on the PC. For applications that are not games, I found the key covers a little uncomfortable, especially for those who are used to typing quickly on the keyboard for work or pleasure. This is easily remedied by removing the key covers, in fact the removal and repositioning is extremely simple and no matter how much this operation is performed once the key covers are positioned, they always maintain their position perfectly. Therefore recommended to everyone, especially to Action RPG players, also given the low price, reliability and resistance of the product", "date": "2003-06-09", "grade": null}
