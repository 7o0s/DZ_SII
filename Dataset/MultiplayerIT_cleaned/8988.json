This software house which has its headquarters in the prefecture of Gifu, located in the Japanese region of the same name, and which is the author of absolute masterpieces such as La Pucelle: Tactics and the Disgaea series, seems to have discovered the holy grail of the genre, to the point that each of his works is characterized not only by a certain general quality, but also by a depth of play and a massive dose of irony which are now a real ~trademark~ of the team. Brand that we also inevitably find in this Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten, fourth chapter of the main series (obviously excluding those for portable consoles) to see the light always on a Sony domestic platform. Let's see how, starting with history. The plot, even if with slightly more adult implications than in the past, remains as always light in some ways, and out of my mind. The main protagonist of the adventure is in fact a vampire/Prinny trainer named Valvatorez, with a black cloak and a magnetic gaze. A strange guy, little loved even in Hades, which are the prisons of the Netherworld, because of his unusual culinary habits: in fact, our friend does not like warm blood as tradition imposes for his race, but prefers a succulent sardine plate. And this is because of a promise he made to himself not to swallow blood until he can instill fear in a girl he met 400 years ago, Artina, who died before being frightened by him. With such a crazy premise, it's no surprise to find yourself with dozens of delusional situations later in the game. Strategic battles On a structural level Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten is practically the same as its predecessors both on PlayStation 3 and on PlayStation 2 and Portable, even if on a deeper analysis, and after several hours of play we can truly say that the battle system it's actually more dynamic and better manageable than for example the previous episode. We therefore have a strategic divided into chapters and various sub-quests, where turn-based battles are the protagonists characterized by a depth and complexity that will make the most hardcore gamers among genre enthusiasts happy. Characters collide on the three-dimensional maps, each of which is characterized by its own skills and classes (among these also welcome returns such as that of the Gargoyles, absent from the first Disgaea), managed by the user in parties of at least ten heroes, to be moved in special grids, and dozens of monsters and hellish creatures. In each turn, the gamer can move his ~men~ within a certain space-movement in relation to the conformity of the area in which they are located and to the characteristics of the members of the group themselves, to make them perform an action such as attacking with a weapon, a spell, or simply to place them in a strategically useful point. For each move, however, you must always be very careful as it can then lead to a chain reaction of events. Like when you come across the Geo Panels, which among other things cross each other more frequently than in the recent past: for those unfamiliar with them, these are colored panels positioned on the ground of some scenarios and which interact with the various characters, enemies or friends, who position themselves on it even through particular objects. These, if placed on a square, change its color, if it is different from its own, and the additional parameters. And this will happen for all chromatically similar panels. So if, for example, a yellow box is able to give those standing on it an attack power from a distance equal to 20% more than normal, coming into contact with one of the objects described above, these characteristics can be modified. In addition, all the characters positioned above her, and on similar panels, will be influenced by her for good or evil. The effects of the Geo are multiple and must be discovered game after game. In addition to the colored boxes mentioned above, some goodies introduced in Disgaea 3 return to the game, such as the Tower Attack, a technique that allows you to repeatedly attack an enemy by creating a huge tower with your party members, and an improved Magichange function, thanks to which to create more powerful units by fusing two compatible ones. Playstation 3 trophies Fifty-one Trophies are available in Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten: 42 Bronze, 5 Silver,3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To get them you have to satisfy the game's requests related for example to the various endings to unlock, to specific enemies to defeat or enlist for minor prizes, climbing in prestige until you get all the pieces of the vessel, all the objects or inflict 10,000,000,000 points of damage. up to Platinum, achieved only after taking all other Trophies. Wild grinding It is even possible to torture enemies after having captured them, thanks to the so-called Punishment System, thus obtaining various bonuses, perhaps a chest containing rare objects or a new ally to recruit from one's ranks. For the rest, the things to do in the main adventure are the usual, such as exploring dungeons and outdoor areas, talking with the inhabitants of the kingdom and making experience points, level-ups and whatever else is needed to become stronger as you go. as you acquire new weapons and abilities. And in this sense, to the happiness of those who adored the continuous grinding of the old Disgaea and to the discouragement of its detractors, even in this fourth chapter there is no joking about it: there is in fact the possibility of accumulating experience levels and bonuses until you reach level 9999. All this is feasible more than ever in the ~worlds~ inside the objects: a series of randomly generated stages that allow you not only to increase the level of your characters, but also of their own equipment. In a more simplified way, an element similar to the one glimpsed in White Chronicles with its Georama is introduced, namely the possibility, in this case however offline, of being able to customize one's own village/headquarters at will, using a special board within which insert buildings, scenic elements and characters, then modifying the growth of statistics and skills. This real central hub also allows you to heal your party, save your game or buy new equipment between battles. And if what has been described so far wasn't enough, there is also the old, dear dark council, slightly modernized and similar to a government, where you can interact with its bosses and make a thousand choices related to the game, such as altering if you wants the difficulty level of enemies, unlock bonuses, rare items, etc. All by bribing the opposing senators to obtain a majority and pass the law decree that serves the case. One of the great novelties of the game, perhaps the only real one, is linked to the introduction of online. Nothing serious, please, don't expect multiplayer or amazing challenges between your party and that of other users around the world. Simply in this mode the player can create maps and share them with others via the web space, take advantage of a political party with lots of ministers to be used as well to interact with human players, and various rankings. To the boarding! And still engage in the Pirate System, an option that allows anyone to create their own ship and slingshot on the seas of the Internet. To do what? Simple, to invade the worlds of other users, but only those with parties of an experience level equal or nearly equal to that of the invading crew, perhaps to challenge them in epic battles or to rescue them. The feature is very nice, just a pity that it is not possible to interact much with what happens on the field: no ~real~ one-on-one clashes between two users, in short, since everything is managed automatically by the AI. However, always speaking of vessels, in relation to the objects used for the construction or for the customization of the boat (there are six customizable pieces, each of which intervenes on specific parameters of the same) it is also possible to increase the number of party members from get you on board. To obtain items used for the purpose of improving the ship, you need to defeat the pirates in the Item World, capture specific enemies to torture and with whom you can negotiate treasures as a ransom, or use particular tickets, then working the recovered pieces, as mentioned first, to increase the vessel's abilities and stats, as well as its design. Concluding our review let's take a look at the graphics and audio. For the first, with Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten we can say without a shadow of a doubt that the saga takes a noticeable step forward in aesthetic terms, thanks to a new graphics engine and sprites totally redesigned in high resolution, which enhance the design of the characters as always edited by Takehito Harada, historical signature of the series. Thanks to his ~hand~, Valvatorez and his companions show off a renewed, colorful and defined look, and even if the feeling is exactly the same and the GUI has remained almost unchanged, now the title looks the most visually pleasing of all the chapters of the series released so far. It's just a pity that this beauty is sometimes scratched by rather wooden character animations and by a camera that is not always positioned properly during, for example, the execution of the spectacular special shots. If desired, you can also deactivate a special filter and get back that pixelated overview that characterized the old chapters of the saga. As far as the audio sector is concerned, on the contrary, everything is centered on the excellent music of Maestro Tenpei Sato, historical composer of the series, which appears quite spot on, and on an excellent dubbing available in both English and Japanese.", "date": "2011-10-28", "grade": "8.3"}
