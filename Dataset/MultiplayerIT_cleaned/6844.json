It seems incredible but it's all true, on the other hand this little game immediately made itself heard, both for the original concept and for the particular foibles to which it tries to give gratification. If the idea intrigues you, put on a waterproof suit and get ready to clean the moon too in our review of Powerwash Simulator. They're just pressure washers... Powerwaash Simulator: what a disaster this patio is, luckily we and our pressure washer are here Powerwash Simulator is not an experience dedicated only to clean freaks, even those who love playing with the hose, lifting the dirty corners of the stairs, watching the water drying on the terracotta of the patio, pushing the nose on the glass that separates it from the car in the car wash. We're not kidding: Powerwash Simulator can cause sensory orgasms to all those who live with any fixation, obsession, mania related to water and / or soap, and it is likely that at least one of these is also part of your daily life. Completely normal actions, however capable of causing immense pleasures from goosebumps, shivers along the spine, sudden contractions of the perineum and clenched and tingling teeth. And we're ~only~ talking about water cleaners! The game is super simple, like his career: a series of thirty plus levels, divided into vehicles and locations, to be cleaned from top to bottom, until even the last corner of pork is gone. The only weapon against grease, mold and dust stains is our trusty pressure washer and its various ~tips~ which will change the pressure and shape of the jet. Usually the tips that allow wider jets tend to be less strong than those that hit a larger area, consequently unless you get close, and even this is not necessarily enough, the most stubborn dirt will fade without completely disappearing. To get rid of the more insistent black we will necessarily have to use the most precise and strong jets, or later soften the dirt with a swipe of soap. The jets of the pressure washer can also be rotated, so that according to the needs you can choose between a horizontal jet and one with a vertical extension. A very clean Zen garden Powerwash Simulator: The game is translated into Italian, not that there is much to read and understand But Powerwash Simulator wouldn't work without a sensory offering that lives up to what's promised. The resourcefulness of the splashes, the different levels of wetness, the final dripping, are combined with sound effects that change according to the tips... but what the hell are we writing? This isn't porn, it's Powerwash Simulator and it works just as promised. After all, it's not that different from one of those Zen gardens where you comb the sand and collect your thoughts, in silence or with a podcast in your headphones. It also remembers those coloring books indeed, it is more reminiscent of those covered in that black film that must be scratched to bring out colors and drawings, you know? The non plus ultra of the harp. The hydrocleaning team Powerwash Simulator: in this game you can really clean the impossible! In addition to the career, which as we have said has over thirty levels, the game includes four with a special setting and the possibility of replaying those already completed in free mode, just for the pleasure of eliminating the dirt. In all modes except career, Powerwash Simulator also allows coop for up to six players: practically it will be possible to assemble a real clean team for a time attack to the last spot. Technically it's a really well done game, obviously not particularly complex but colorful, very effective precisely in the effects that matter most in a title dedicated to that magical object called a pressure washer. Commands from Shooter Powerwash Simulator: This station needs to be reopened, but first cleaned from top to bottom The first thing the game will ask us to clean will be a van in a garage, stuff that takes just a few minutes, but the next step won't disappoint your expectations: it will take quite some time to clean your new employer's garden more and definitely much more effort. Fortunately, to avoid us wandering around in search of the last hidden stain, when we are about to finish a job and the remaining dirt will become more difficult to find, we can use the TAB key to highlight it; moreover, by indicating an object or part of it with the cursor, the game will give us a cleaning percentage to indicate whether or not there is more dirt. As always, earn money it will be possible to buy new tips, new accessories andalso customize the appearance of the pressure washer and our overalls, which is particularly useful if you want to play together with friends. To reach the most hidden dirt, just like in a first-person shooter, we can kneel or lie down on the ground, while with the C button we can aim our pressure washer more precisely. Pretty standard controls, if we were talking about Call of Duty", "date": "2022-07-13", "grade": "7.4"}
