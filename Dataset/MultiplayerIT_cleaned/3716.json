{"name": "Pigeon Wings Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pigeon-wings-strike-recensione.html", "text": "Pigeon Wings Strike is basically the freemium version of the original Pigeon Wings, released a couple of years ago on the App Store; and best interprets the mechanisms, declining them in an endless structure that continuously stimulates our interest with surprising events, enemies that appear on the screen and scenarios that alternate as we set new records with our journey. The evil Duke Dexter is back and wants to conquer Velo City, so the only hope for the inhabitants of the city lies in the intervention of the heroic Pigeon, a courageous pigeon who fearlessly launches himself at breakneck speeds aboard his plane (yes, we're talking about a pilot bird) to eliminate the threat of Dexter and his many minions once and for all. In a nutshell, all this translates into gameplay very similar to that of the aforementioned Pigeon Wings, only with a series of interesting refinements and, as mentioned, an endless approach that transforms each game into an experience in itself, different from all the others. In a sort of race with the other birds, our goal in each attempt will be to get as far as possible, dodging obstacles, acting on the boost where possible and shooting at enemies. The game can be downloaded and used for free, without particular restrictions or limitations, but if you wish, you can completely eliminate the ads by making an in-app purchase for only 1.09 euros: a highly recommended purchase if the spirit of Pigeon Wings Strike is able to conquer you. Gameplay and achievement To the eye, the differences between this new episode of the series and the original do not seem so many, but it is in the variety of situations and in the reward system that Pigeon Wings Strike manages to exert its charm, allowing us to collect a certain amount of coins and use them to unlock new characters to fly with. In some ways, the challenge that the game offers is reminiscent of the infamous Flappy Bird, but in terms of quality and vision, the two products are quite distant. The control system is excellent and uses a combination of touch screen and accelerometer by default, although there is also a fully tactile variant if desired. You have to tilt the device up or down for the protagonist's plane to move, alerted by indications that appear on the screen from time to time, while touching the accelerator on the left of the display and the boost on the right will allow it to proceed very quickly forward. The situation changes when enemies appear: in this case, pressing the right side of the touch screen allows you to open fire with weapons and manage the action as in a classic horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up. These are very pleasant sequences, but not the only ones that will make you appreciate the game, dynamic and surprising both in action and in aesthetics. There is in fact a very particular ~cubed~ style to form the basis of the graphics of Pigeon Wings Strike, with really well used colors that characterize the transition from one scenario to another, simple background elements and beautiful explosions. To accompany everything there is an electronic soundtrack that immediately enters the head, conquering with its simplicity and a nice melody.", "date": "2019-04-17", "grade": "8.0"}
