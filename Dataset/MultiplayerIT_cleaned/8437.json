The Local Justice Pack is just the beginning of an even deeper multiplayer experience for Max Payne 3, said Sam Houser, founder of Rockstar Games, and includes three new multiplayer maps based on the latest locations from the game's final chapters ( Imperial Hotel, Boarding Gate and 55th Battalion HQ), the new M4 assault rifle, the Light Fingers perk to loot faster, the new So Paulo Police faction, and new Social Club Achievements, Trophies, and Accomplishments. The news After about two months, therefore, the first DLC appears in the digital stores of 360 and PS3. Those who have purchased the ~dlc pass~ will obviously not have to repay this expansion again, but on the contrary will also be able to download the next contents already announced by Rockstar: 4 more map packs, a new mode and the future co-op. Local Justice concerns exclusively the online multiplayer component: together with the maps, the new gadgets available to the players are also appreciated. The bottle for pills gives a discrete advantage over anyone who doesn't use it because it increases the ability to carry objects that quickly regenerate health (pace those who won't download the DLC), while the ~fairy fingers~ perk gives us the possibility to plunder the lifeless bodies of enemies on the ground much more quickly. There is also a new selectable faction, the fearsome SPP police of So Paulo, with related challenges and customizations, as well as the M4 assault rifle. The first map taken into consideration is precisely the headquarters of the San Paolo police: HQ 55th Battalion is a rather narrow and narrow environment, made up of corridors, cells and offices which make it ideal for hand-to-hand clashes with short-handed weapons range, such as the shotgun. It's a very tactical map, made up of waiting, hiding, chasing, just like a ~cops and robbers~ whose smaller than average available space inspires direct and frontal confrontation. Xbox 360 goals This small expansion does not add, like all single player DLCs, the canonical 200 points more, but 125 points to be unlocked through the achievement of 5 objectives, all quite simple: two simultaneous kills, 4 kills in 3 seconds, a series of victories , level the new weapon to 10 and do at least 100 kills with the Sao Paulo Police character. Quite agile and automatic, for those who play online with normal frequency. Destruction it is! The second tested map is perhaps the most beautiful and best designed; it is ~Gate d'Imbarco~ and as the name suggests it is set in an important city airport teeming with people. This is the funnest map for a simple reason: it develops both horizontally and vertically, leaving the player free to decide his own approach to the enemy (or defense). You can venture into the narrow corridors of the baggage unloading area, or get an overview of the situation directly from the boarding hall, to cross fire with the enemies arriving head-on. Or still aiming with the sniper rifle from the second floor of the Gate, which allows us to see almost the entire map from a privileged and elevated position. The last map downloaded is that of the Imperial Hotel, a building undergoing demolition that gives us a discreet metropolitan war setting. Although the map is drawn almost entirely indoors, its state of semi-destruction leaves many open spaces inside due to the many demolished walls and smashed objects. The supporting columns of the corridors are in the end the only shelters from short / medium range clashes. Finally, an external part of the hotel allows us, if we manage to reach the high position, to snipe the enemies present below or inside the dilapidated structure. 55th Battalion HQ is available for all game modes while both Hotel Imperial and Embargo Gate are available exclusively for Deathmatch, Payne Killer and team modes. By purchasing Rockstar's DLC Pass and making two quick calculations, in the end the price of the individual DLCs would drop by almost 30% less, so it is highly recommended to buy the DLC subscription. However, considering that apparently these future expansion packs will only concern online multiplayer (with new maps, objects and modes) and not the single player, the purchase is recommended only to those who are actually linked to this component and exploit it sinceor basically, given that there is and will be a lot of irons in the fire. For all the others (and those who do not yet have an adequate connection at home to play online), we advise against the purchase of both the DLC Pass and this single expansion.", "date": "2012-07-11", "grade": null}
