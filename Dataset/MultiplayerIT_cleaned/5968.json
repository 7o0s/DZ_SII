{"name": "Soulstice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soulstice-recensione.html", "text": "With great pleasure, we find ourselves more and more often stating that the Italian gaming market is increasingly thriving with creative and willing developers who want to have their say in front of the whole world. Today, a new boot project joins the list that, over the past few months, we're sure many will have kept an eye on: Soulstice. Already authors of Theseus and Joe Denver's Lone Wolf, the Italians of Reply Game Studio will be offering this action game, inspired by classics such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta, on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S from 20 September 2022. We've already told you about it on a couple of occasions, after putting demos to the test, and now we're finally ready to tell you what we think of the final version. If you've brushed up on your combos and are ready to find out everything there is to know, read on for our Soulstice review. Two for the price of one Briar and Lute, protagonists of Soulstice Soulstice tells us about Keidas, a Sacred Realm in which the real and spiritual worlds are separated by a thin Veil. By ripping it open, there is the risk of bringing destruction to creation and, to prevent this from happening, we rely on the Chimeras, or two people who, through a ritual, merge into one. The body of the former accepts the soul of the latter, thus attaining higher abilities. The protagonists are just a Chimera, made up of the souls of two sisters: Briar and Lute. The first is the character we control, while the second acts as a sort of guardian spirit, both in fights and narratively, as it is the voice of reason of the older sister, more daredevil and impulsive. The couple is sent to Ilden, where a rift has opened, which has caused the transformation of all humans and animals into deformed and insane creatures, who obviously will only want to tear us apart. The plot revolves around the partially monstrous figure of the Chimeras, the past of the two sisters and the secrets of the sacred order they belong to. In a dark fantasy world, of course, nothing is truly spotless and from above the machinations involve the smaller gears like Briar and Lute, who will manage to exceed expectations and prevail, of course. The very first setting of Soulstice Overall, even if faced with a pleasantly designed world, Soulstice's plot is quite obvious and does not represent the strong point of the package. The twists, if we want to define them that way, follow one after the other, but all somewhat telephoned and predictable. Not entirely convincing is not so much the general plot, but more the minor sequences and even more the exchanges between the two protagonists. Indeed, Soulstice struggles to give depth to the two girls in terms of character and most of their dialogues are a copy of the previous one, from the beginning to the end of the game: it almost seems that besides ~things are getting worse, we have no other choice that to go forward, together we will make it~ the duo have nothing more to add. Outside of plot highlights, Briar and Lute struggle to captivate the player. Soulstice is all destruction and darkness The repetitiveness is then felt from another point of view: the setting, as mentioned, is a single city, with a medieval cut. It is an immense place, built vertically starting from the docks up to the upper quarters and the temple, like a sort of acropolis as high as a mountain. Sadly though, the bulk of the areas are stone rooms, barren habitable zones, and sewers. In the final stages the team dared a little more, but very often it seems that they are not really advancing because each area seems identical to the previous one. To be honest, there are clearly entire spaces repeated (in a clever and logical way for the architecture) but, also thanks to a very limited color palette, Soulstice tires the player's eye a bit, also because there is very little that is unique and stylistically interesting in the environments, too generic as well as repetitive. At least, on a technical level, the game defends itself well, obviously considering that we are not talking about a AAA production: what matters is that the frame rate is stable even with high details and the action is fluid and without hiccups. Even the design of the most common enemies didn't particularly convince us. They are mostly humanoids of various sizes and shapes, but always very similar and uninspired in detail. Between enemies and the environment, everything is a gray-brown that gets boring after a few hours. The only chromatic boost is represented by the fact that some enemies are blue and some red, as they are linked to the ~Fields~ that can be activated by Lute, which we will discuss shortly. Basically, don't expect to remainere particularly impressed by the enemies, which are a far cry from the variety and fantasy of the creatures faced by Dante or Bayonetta. Fight and explore Briar uses a transformable weapon to fight in Soulstice Up to this point, we haven't painted Soulstice particularly well, admittedly, but let's not forget one thing: it's an action game and the biggest reason many people will buy it is the combat system and, from this point of view, the Italian opera defends itself very well. Let's first look at the basics of the combat system. Through Briar we have control of the attack, while through Lute we have power over the main defensive capabilities of the pair. Briar works as you'd expect: it has a main weapon, a sword, and a series of secondary weapons (six, in the end) that differ in range, speed, effectiveness against certain enemies and some unique moves, such as the ability to use Whips her like a grappling hook at an enemy or swinging the warhammer in a wide range. Individual weapons have few combos, all with the same structure. Even without reaching the depth of a high-level Devil May Cry, Soulstice still defends itself well from the point of view of the paraphernalia and the fundamental structure of the fights. You sprint, lift enemies off the ground, chain combos, switch weapons quickly and maximize damage, but prioritizing the variety of moves performed. Some enemies are intangible without activating Fields in Soulstice In fact, Briar and Lute have a Cohesion bar which, if maximized, allows them to activate a brief state of berserk, called Fury, which makes them very powerful and fast and allows them to activate a destructive final move. If you constantly change weapons, do not take damage and attack without interruption, you can also activate the Fury several times in a fight (if long enough). Added to all this is another mechanic, that of the Fields. Lute can create colored domes - blue and red - which make certain enemies of the respective color vulnerable, otherwise impossible to defeat. The Field cannot be activated indefinitely, on pain of losing Cohesion and Lute's temporary disappearance, so you must always be clear who you are fighting against, activating and canceling the Field quickly. Finally, Lute must be considered with great attention. The spirit takes care of attacking automatically, becoming more powerful as Cohesion rises, but above all it allows us to manually activate defensive moves. Each enemy that is about to attack us can be blocked by pressing a dedicated key, even when we don't see it (the input icon is shown to us at the edge of the screen). This means that it is always necessary to keep an eye on the big picture, looking not only at the closest enemies and those we are hitting, but at the entire screen in order not to miss the opportunity to block the opponent, who is rejected or slowed down to depending on the type. Acting in defense as well as in attack speeds up the accumulation of Cohesion and therefore makes us stronger. Lute is also the more customizable side of the couple: the spirit has many skills that allow us to have a more aggressive and risky approach to combat, or to improve our survival. At any time it is possible to reposition the skills, so you can safely experiment. Soulstice's combat system rewards balance, speed and precision. It is therefore a pity that, on average, the camera struggles to follow the action, especially in the tightest spaces where it easily gets stuck in the corners of the rooms. Adding up the amount of elements to take into consideration, every now and then it can happen that you have a little difficulty keeping up with what is happening on the screen. The developers propose a ~lock-on~ targeting system that many will know from souls-like games, but it's not always an effective solution with such a fast game and sometimes you waste more time trying to lock the camera on the right enemy than to defeat him. There is no shortage of bigger and more menacing enemies in Soulstice Clearly you don't just spend your time fighting. Soulstice intersperses the battles with fully narrative phases, exploration and resource gathering, as well as small puzzle-platformer sections that require you to destroy some blocks that prevent you from progressing. The rhythm is excellent and you pass from one section to another without ever making each component weigh too much. Were it not for the aforementioned repetitive setting and dialogue, Soulstice would flow with great pleasure. To close the picture there are the bossfights, some of which are related to enemies that thenthey become ~common~ adversaries. However, there is no shortage of unique clashes, on average well structured and intense, divided into several phases. It's just a shame that the flagship villains have little impact on a narrative level, but at least in terms of visual design, they far exceed the basic enemies. The soundtrack is also pleasant, especially in the most important battles, which loads the player and accompanies the rapid pace of hits and dodges. The dubbing is instead without infamy and without great praise. Finally, we point out that a minimum longevity of fifteen hours can be expected, which certainly increases if you want to replay to find the upgrades and secondary challenges (battles in arenas, with special conditions) not completed on the first lap. In addition, each battle and chapter receives a score, so you can play each difficulty again and again to get the maximum score.", "date": "2022-09-20", "grade": "8.0"}
