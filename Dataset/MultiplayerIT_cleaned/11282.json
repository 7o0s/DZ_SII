{"name": "Nozze Pazze", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nozze-pazze.html", "text": "The protagonist of Crazy Wedding is Quinn, a rampant wedding planner whose job is to make sure that the ceremony goes off as smooth as oil. This involves a whole series of different activities: therefore we find ourselves establishing the positions at the table, serving the dishes in the right order, delivering the gifts to the bride and groom and - why not - even putting down the fights that can break out between the guests . All following the simple mechanics that Diner Dash has made us know and appreciate. Crazy Wedding is therefore immediate to say the least, given that all you have to do is press the key that appears on the screen as quickly as possible: for example, to seat cousin Billy next to your beloved uncle John, just press the '5' key ' to select the table and then press the button corresponding to the Billy figure. A system that applies to all the chores that poor Quinn has to supervise, and which therefore makes Crazy Wedding a product as frenetic and fun as its illustrious predecessor. The downside is inevitably the lack of originality that permeates the Glu product: in short, in short, Nozze Pazze is Diner Dash inserted in a different context, and little more. It was to be expected, but a little more courage from the developers certainly would not have hurt. Again, the game is based on a decidedly basic scheme, which is repeated to the bitter end and which could get boring prematurely: after all, each stage always requires you to welcome the guests, bring the gift to the bride and groom, serve lunch at the table and start over, with only a few unforeseen events to serve as a side dish. The only element of distinction is represented by the different setting of each of the five internships offered by Crazy Wedding, with Quinn who will find himself working within classic ceremonies as well as in more eccentric contexts, such as Tiki-style or ancient Roman weddings. It could be said that Glu's is a work without acute details also analyzing the graphics, good but without exceptional merits: the game offers a 2D bird's eye view which shows small scenarios but with attention to even the smallest details, with sprites well done and animated in a nice way. All good, but even here we are certainly not dealing with a milestone of mobile gaming. PRO Solid and established gameplay Immediate and frenetic Technically neat AGAINST Identical to Diner Dash Repetitive game pattern", "date": "2008-07-25", "grade": "S.V."}
