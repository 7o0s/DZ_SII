We are talking about a team made up of video game industry veterans, with a respectable curriculum, who have decided to use their varied skills to offer smartphone and tablet owners an adventure that is different from the usual, in which a spider was controlled grappled with a mystery greater than himself. Much bigger. The sequel, Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon, was announced in November 2013 but the project was lost, so much so that it was thought to have been cancelled. Instead then, surprisingly, it popped up just a few days ago with a release date and the officialization of the PC version, which in this specific case we used as a reference for this review. We therefore return to the command of the arachnid of the first episode, but in an even more extensive environment, which includes a farmhouse, a tower, a barn and the surrounding land. An entire farm to explore, small as we are, for a new mystery to discover. Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon is a fascinating and peculiar adventure, but with some limitations on PC The spider's web The mechanisms underlying Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon appear unchanged: within a platform majority context, our task will be to use the silk reserves available to create cobwebs, trap various types of insects inside them and eat them to reload the canvas and eventually build combos for the leaderboard. Completing this task will not always be easy, as it will be necessary to place the threads in compatible areas in terms of length and permeability, focusing on cobwebs with three or four vertices to obtain a denser weave and therefore block even the largest prey. You will also have to be careful not to run out of supplies prematurely, which will lead us to have only a few seconds before incurring game over if we find nothing to put under our jaws. Once the right amount of insects has been devoured, an exit will appear from time to time to end the stage and move on to the next mission, with a view to a campaign nominally made up of thirty levels. The differences compared to the 2009 episode are almost all evident in the structure: each location boasts a certain number of hidden areas to discover and clues to find for solving the seven puzzles that make up the secret of the house, and which only once clarified will allow access to the ending of the game. The average extension of the maps has therefore increased quite a bit, with sections in which the spider is seen from above and the layout of the controls changes, while fearsome red ants will try to attack us, invulnerable to our charges. What's the weather like The most interesting novelty introduced by the game, however, is the geolocation function, which through the triangulation of the provider (with always relative precision, mind you) identifies the geographical area in which we find ourselves and checks the weather. To what? Well, you should know that the behavior of the various species of insects that we will find in Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon (described in a special in-game encyclopedia) is strongly influenced by light and humidity, which means that depending of the four possible phases (clear day, rainy day, clear night, rainy night) in the scenarios the disposition and type of prey will change. Not only that: exploring certain locations by night or day, or in the presence of particular atmospheric agents, will allow you to identify otherwise invisible clues, with a view to solving the puzzles we mentioned above. This is a brilliant intuition from the developers, which actually adds something to the experience and increases its replay value; which is good, considering that the overall duration of the campaign is not extraordinary, and if you want to go straight on, you can get to the end within three hours. However, it also means that to dissect everything that the product has to offer, it will necessarily be necessary to test the missions in all possible conditions. Imagine the London players waiting for a sunny day... Technique, controls and atmosphere Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon is a fascinating adventure, with great ideas, web-weaving mechanics reminiscent of classics of the puzzle genre, such as Qix or Gals Panic, and a structure full of things to discover. It is certainly a sequel that enriches and improves the original experience, and that in the mobile sector has very few competitors able to offer the same things, but at the same timeSome aspects of the production have left us perplexed. First of all the controls, which also on PC largely reflect the layout used on mobile devices, in our opinion wrong. In fact, if certain solutions appear almost obligatory on touch screens (see, for example, movements to the right or left regardless of the context and the drastic change when traveling along a cobweb or switching to top view), using a controller you often find yourself caged from these constraints and we end up almost always resorting to jumping, which is to say the only maneuver (together with weaving) that allows us to ~disengage~ from objects without too many problems. Having tried both the Steam and iOS versions, we can say that the former is easier to approach, being equipped with indicators for the trajectory of the jump, which often avoids performing wrong maneuvers for placing the canvases. Secondly, the atmosphere of the game is thwarted by a banal and uninspired soundtrack, which in most cases seemed completely out of context. There was certainly room to include music more suited to this type of adventure and setting, and we don't understand the choice to opt for something so generic instead. Finally, but here we enter the field of personal sensitivity, the hand-drawn graphics are certainly peculiar and use colors in an interesting way, but you might not like them quite easily. Also in this sense there have been clear improvements compared to the first Spider, primarily as regards the definition, but the quality of the animations is objectively lacking.", "date": "2015-08-17", "grade": "7.0"}
