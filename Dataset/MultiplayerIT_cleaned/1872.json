{"name": "Post Mortem", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/post-mortem_a.html", "text": "AAA Aspiring detective wanted Beyond the shots, the light effects and the livid colors, which by merging give life to a realistic world and at the same time unmistakably contaminated by the imaginary, the singular characters and the settings certainly contribute to creating this atmosphere as disturbing as it is engaging. suggestive. The Parisians we meet and question in the course of our investigation are all well characterized and very natural, as well as the dialogue engine that animates them, the Natural Dialogue Engine to be precise; they are a digital portrait of the best film noir actors: from the ~femme fatale~ who hires us to the naive and arrogant police inspector, from the mysterious and impatient witness to the owner of an ambiguous and probably involved in dirty business. Equally interesting are the ~locations~ of this interactive thriller which, as I mentioned, are realistic but often permeated by a gloomy and oppressive vein, ranging from a very normal hotel to an improbable criminal asylum, made up of an inextricable maze of gloomy corridors and cells armored. All the scenes are rigorously nocturnal and can be explored from a subjective point of view with 360 freedom of movement, even if ~freedom~ is perhaps not the right term, given that the movements are pre-calculated. However, I can guarantee you that this graphic formula, often snubbed by 3D enthusiasts, produces a decidedly immersive game environment and allows for an enthralling exploration of the settings: admiring and rummaging through the two-dimensional backdrops of Post Mortem is always a pleasure, navigation and the use of the context-sensitive cursor are absolutely intuitive and even retracing your steps to solve the toughest puzzles is not a burden at all, thanks to the almost instantaneous movements and journeys that allow us painless loading and the practical map of Paris, accessible with two simple mouse clicks. Every time we reach a new destination, we can enjoy a short introductory film, which however will only appear on our first visit. These and all the cutscenes of the game portray our protagonist in the third person, as well as the conversations, made more dynamic and cinematic by the moving shots. It is precisely the conversations that reveal ever new settings and clues to us: the documents and notes that we can consult at any stage of the investigation and the logical approach of the puzzles allow for fluid and intuitive progress in the adventure - we almost always know where to go and what Do. Where is Mrs. Fletcher when needed?! Of the Natural Dialogue Engine, the main innovation introduced by the Microds developers which I mentioned above, I have already spoken profusely in the preview, so I don't want to dwell too much: in summary, with each exchange of jokes we are offered the opportunity to choose the approach that we feel more appropriate for the current conversation; for example, to get witnesses to give us more information, we could impersonate a government agent, an insurer or a journalist, or be completely truthful. But be careful: it's better to think carefully about what we say and above all how we say it, because with almost all the interlocutors we will have one choice and only one and it will be difficult to go back. There doesn't seem to be any absolutely right or wrong dialogue options and there is still information that we will have to obtain, but it would be a shame to jump through hoops to snatch it from the mouth of an unwilling witness to cooperate, when perhaps another would have provided it spontaneously. , with a minimum of tact on our part! In short, depending on the approach adopted, the information in our possession and the outcome of the conversations could turn out to be drastically different. It goes without saying that a dialogue engine like this can contribute enormously to the longevity of the adventure, together with the puzzles, which are another strong point of Post Mortem: in addition to probing the settings in search of clues or useful objects and interacting with other characters, MacPherson will in fact have to solve a series of logical problems and puzzles of various kinds, which will require from time to time the use of the information collected, spirit of observation, analytical and logical skills, experimentation and intuition... in short, everything that every adventurer worthy of the name dreams of putting to the test. Above all, the variety of possible solutions is surprising: in order not to anticipate anything specific about the puzzles, I will only tell you that, after completing the investigation twice withn different methods and results, I still couldn't help my sister when she wanted to play the game and got stuck in the middle, because she had approached some of the initial conversations and puzzles even differently and got into a situation unknown to me! The real puzzles are not many, but always sophisticated and masterfully integrated into the plot of the adventure. Some boast a not indifferent originality and complexity and I assure you that they will keep even the most savvy players busy for a while! Indeed, one or two risk bringing them to the brink of despair: among other things, Gus will find himself picking locks, going through a kind of labyrinth, interpreting coded messages and playing the little alchemist. The tools of the virtual detective Post Mortem's graphics engine generates a 360 panoramic visualization of high resolution two-dimensional planes, on which the 3D models of the main characters are literally embedded, rendered in real time and animated with a certain naturalness. The two-dimensional backdrops are rich and detailed but decidedly static, as are the characters with whom you cannot interact. All this creates a singular, but certainly not unpleasant effect: such a graphic solution lends itself well to the adventure genre and above all to the methods of investigation and search for clues, as well as creating an engaging and particular atmosphere, suspended between the 'nightmare and reality. Of course, this does not prevent the polygonal characters from sometimes clashing with their surroundings and perhaps these ~two-dimensional paintings~ could have been a little more lively. The movies deserve a separate discussion, always fluid and well-made. The interface is discreet and functional: the cursor takes the form of a gear, hand, lens, megaphone or shoe according to the operations that can be performed in the various areas of the screen (operate, pick up, examine closely, speak, move) and with the key left mouse button, the appropriate commands are given. The inventory, which appears at the bottom of the screen with a right click, has a traditional layout and you just need to select an item to use it. The soundtrack represents a further contribution to the enveloping atmosphere of the game, it is sober and never too intrusive. The main musical theme has nothing to envy of a cinematic thriller. The audio effects are discreet, even if not unforgettable. On the other hand, the Italian localization of this title is decidedly good: the translation of the dialogues and the dubbing are more than satisfactory, even if in some cases one gets the impression that two or three of the actors did not have an easy life! Elementary, my dear MacPeherson! ... Or not? All in all, Post Mortem stands out as an excellent graphic adventure that no enthusiast can afford to ignore: the creation is very well cared for, the system of dialogue and interaction with the characters flexible and innovative, the atmosphere new and captivating. Nonetheless, it is not a title for everyone: the issues addressed, as has been said, are adult and will not fail to conquer thriller lovers and aspiring detectives, but some of the puzzles are rather difficult, which is not always considered a defect although it might discourage less experienced users. Above all, players who are intolerant of dialogues should stay away: they are many, they are long and cannot be skipped! If you are still reading this article, on the other hand, you will have very clear ideas about the fact that Post Mortem draws its lifeblood from the realistic and exciting dialogues that faithfully recreate the path of an investigation! Someone will object to the relative brevity of this adventure, but all good things do not last long (Holy words, what I always say to my girlfriend, NdMatt) and the longevity of the game is however redeemed by the presence of three different endings and by a more unique than rare replay value for this kind of title. The complex articulation of the dialogues and the variety of methods of solving certain puzzles create some negligible inconsistency in the development of the plot, but overall Gus MacPherson's investigation is quite engaging, even if several questions ultimately remain unanswered. Even those looking for a game on the same wavelength as Syberia might be disappointed: Post Mortem has very little to do with the latest Microds title, if not some technical characteristics and part of the development team, andit is aimed at a potentially different audience. The only aspect that unites them is the fact that in both cases the protagonists are Americans visiting Europe, involved in an unusual adventure in an unfamiliar world, just like the player - a clever device to facilitate his character identification. Both adventures have fantastic elements, but in Syberia the impalpable and surreal world of Benoit Sokal reigns, seasoned with bizarre technologies all to be discovered, while in Post Mortem the fantastic dimension is certainly less remote: it is rooted in the paranormal, in the esotericism and in the darkest recesses of the human mind. Maybe Post Mortem won't be overwhelmingly revolutionary either as a graphic adventure or as a thriller, but it certainly represents an excellent evolution and synthesis of both genres! The crime served... Grab a handful of film noir and detective stories from the 1920s and 1930s, a pinch of Hitchcock and a sprinkling of more modern psycho-thrillers like Seven or Friday the 13th, then add masters of thrill in the mold of Lovecraft and Poe, shake the everything and you will get the essence of Post Mortem. Indeed these, according to Stphane Brochu, were the sources of inspiration for the developers who conceived this original graphic adventure or, as the aforementioned lead designer of Microds prefers to define it, this new example of ~interactive narrative~. In fact, the player finds himself interacting with Paris in the 1920s in the role of Gus MacPherson, a former New York detective who has just moved to the ~city of artists~ to devote himself body and soul to his true interest, painting. He will have the opportunity to reevaluate his ambitious plans for early retirement after making the acquaintance of Sophia Blake, one of those beautiful and mysterious clients that only happen in movies (or video games), because it is easier to imagine that the professional life of detectives is studded with jealous husbands and insurance agents! In short, our Gus just won't be able to resist the charm of such a mysterious and seemingly inexplicable case: our client's sister and her husband were beheaded in a Paris hotel room, according to a strange ritual. What is even more inexplicable, our protagonist begins to have disturbing visions of the crime in question and decides to momentarily hang up the brush to get to the bottom of the dark matter. The local police don't seem to have the slightest idea where to put their hands to start the investigation and neither do we in principle but, strengthened by our psychic powers and above all by the generous reward that has been promised to us, we courageously set ourselves on the trail of the psychopath of shift. Most likely, overseas the adult themes of Post Mortem will be worth the ~M~ brand of Mature Audience to the game packaging and perhaps some warnings for minors and the more impressionable here too: not so much for the presence of blood and gory scenes, which are relatively few, but because it is still a story of heinous crimes, disturbing mysteries and more or less esoteric rituals. One of the winning ingredients of this adventure is precisely the dark and intriguing atmosphere: in several titles of the genre we have already tried to play the horror or noir setting card, but rarely with such spot-on tones and with the right amount of cinematographic and literary suggestions, as well as a certain historical fidelity.", "date": "2002-12-20", "grade": null}
