{"name": "Doom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doom.html", "text": "The myth returns To be clear, for the times, a game of this quality had the same meaning that Metal Gear Solid 2 has now and, certainly, not by chance: graphics with a resolution set to 320x240 pixels and extremely fluid for the time (provided have, err, a 486), was married to a game structure that was as perfect as it was scary. The undersigned honestly does not remember how many dozens of times he jumped from his faithful chair whenever he heard a grunt, an unequivocal sign that a pink, black or (worse still) invisible cow was nearby. Impossible to forget the many jolts every time you got hold of a key with the surrounding walls that lowered revealing dozens of cacodemons and zombies ready to kill us. Doom had such a huge success that it guaranteed a sequel (better to talk about updates anyway), the conversion for Mega 32 (unfortunate add on for Sega Megadrive), Atari Jaguar (excellent conversion), Snes (remarkable, also thanks to the sfx chip) and finally, Playstation (with the pleasant inclusion of Doom 2). As you may have guessed, Doom is a game, always very entertaining, otherwise we wouldn't be here to review the conversion for Game Boy Advance, anticipated in recent months by dozens of screenshots and interviews with the David A. Palmer Productions guys who took care of the first one ( and I would say unique) conversion of Id Software's masterpiece for a portable console, coincidentally the most powerful. Sinister commercial operation (perhaps taking advantage of the fact that Doom 3 is in the works) or announced masterpiece, moreover in pocket format? Let's start from...... .actual game You start with only the service pistol and your faithful fist but little by little you will come across shotguns, chainsaws (very useful for cacodemons and cows), machine guns, cannons up to the famous Bfg, the global weapon blast it all! Against you are hundreds of enemies, from soldiers to demons, from pink cows to cacodemons, up to the fearsome barons of hell. In between, colored keys to open the corresponding doors, rivers of acid (to be overcome with anti-radiation suits), secret rooms filled with ammunition, medkits and armor and much more. Indeed, the 24 game levels (divided into 3 episodes), are stuffed with what has been said: you will have to move felinely and cunningly in the various levels, kill as many monsters as possible, pick up the various weapons (and related ammunition) along the way, reloading your energy lost in battle thanks to medkits. Along your way there are also several secret rooms to find, a factor that in first person shooters has always stimulated replayability, even after the game is completed. Unlike the most recent games (from Duke Nukem 3d and Quake onwards), there is no possibility to look up and down, nor to jump from one platform to another: you will automatically aim at enemies who are in a perspective plane different from yours as well as without you taking any trouble, your alter ego will delightfully jump when requested (very little). .actual game As in the original, here too we have various difficulty levels, 4 in all, to ensure that both newbies and champions who remember every single map by heart are at ease. If the singleplayer mode would already be enough and would advance for any gamer worthy of this title, it is incredible to note how in this Activision production the multiplayer mode has also peeped (although every player must have a copy of the game)! The co-op mode doesn't feel like it needs explaining, as you won't be alone in clearing the 24 game areas of monsters while the deathmatch sees up to four players fighting each other to see who is the bloodiest! From the options you can select the automatic run, as well as choose to disable it, whether to use the dynamic lights (which sometimes take away a little fluidity) or the static ones and, even, decide the degree of brightness of the game, a really important feature since in theory Doom should be enjoyed at night and with headphones at full volume. Unfortunately due to the lack of backlighting, all this is just utopia and it's a shame, because at night (and disabling the music) the masterpiece of Id Software gives its best, also because there are many dark or poorly lit areas. The control system designed by the boys of David A. Palmer Productions (in any case configurable at will) is extremely simple to manage, even for the undersigned who does not play subjective shooters for consoles for the latitkeyboard and mouse; with the ~b~ key open the doors and activate the switches, with ~a~ shoot, with the back keys carry out the strafe, keeping them pressed and scrolling up and down the directional joypad, you can select the various weapons; finally, the d-pad is used to control your marine. As already mentioned, this key setup is absolutely comfortable even after a few moments of play, but if it's really not your thing, you can change it freely. .actual game Playability at excellent levels therefore and enviable longevity, already for these factors we should not just order you to buy Doom immediately but we still have to talk about ......... graphics and sound! The aspect that most aroused the most curiosity (and concern, to be honest) was precisely the doubt of how the graphics of the original PC would have been converted for Nintendo's 32-bit portable console. Well, we knew that Game Boy Advance was powerful, we have seen the very smooth Mario Kart, the colorful Rayman, the flawless conversions of Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 2 but nothing could prepare us for the impact of this conversion. Apart from the lower resolution (obviously) and therefore a considerable difficulty in seeing enemies and objects in the distance (which, on the contrary, are very pixelated as always up close), we don't think we can squeeze much more the hardware of the small monster of the big one N: everything is identical, the sprites are the same, whether small or big, their strokes too, the maps have lost absolutely nothing in terms of decorations, landscaping and details (and I think I remember them almost like the Ave Maria if not Better!). The only negative notes (but not so much) are represented by the frame rate and some areas in the dark; in the first case it is good to underline how the game is always very fluid with some problems that occur for a short time and only in certain areas (in multiplayer however it happens more often unfortunately). By disabling the dynamic lights you will obtain greater fluidity in some areas but in addition to depriving yourself of a bit of atmosphere (already halved because you cannot play in the dark), you will thus take over the second problem of the conversion: if you play in low light, in areas in the dark you will be forced to use the maximum brightness by excessively lightening the graphics of the game, otherwise you will get stuck in some unclear location from the point of view of orientation. graphics and sound! The music is quite anonymous and we advise without fear to eliminate it keeping only the digitized voices (so to speak, between moans, screams and various grunts) and the sound effects. Sorry that there is no longer the possibility to hear the same sound with a lower or higher key depending on how far you move away from it but here writing these lines is a super Doom maniac who has played it in every version possible and imaginable. Conclusions Graphically surprising (but not perfect), with an atmospheric sound (music disabled permitting), Doom also maintains on Game Boy Advance the playability that has distinguished it for almost a decade now, elevating it as one of the titles for the Nintendo portable absolutely essential, thanks to 4 different levels of difficulty and the observation that solving the 24 levels, without leaving out any secrets to unearth or monsters to blast, will take away plenty of time and batteries. The fact that you save at the end of each level (as on Playstation), instead of when you want it, further elevates the already excellent longevity of this conversion by David A. Palmer Productions and Activision, equipped (even) with multiplayer mode . Conclusions A masterpiece to buy absolutely therefore, inadvisable only to those who are already fed up after solving it 100 times in the previous formats or to impressionable people, given the high degree of violence (however with the coloring of the blood from red to green which in any case does not affect least of all the value of the game). All the others must buy it immediately, together with a considerable supply of batteries. Pros: almost perfect conversion technically very fun skyrocketing longevity Cons: frame rate sometimes uncertain, especially in multiplayer a minimum of habit is necessary to play at maximum will lose many diopters The myth returns 2001 will be remembered as the year of the return of two games that have made the history of videogame entertainment: if the fantastic Return To Castle Wolfenstein is labeled a remake but, at the same time, a sequel to Wolfenstein 3d (first first-person shooter of the ever-changing world of video games) the tiny Game Boy Advance cartridge with the unmistakable name Doom winking from a shelf two meters away, contains the conversion of one of the most terrifying video games and controversies of the last decade. For the little ones or for the bears returning from the longest hibernation that the human mind remembers, let's clarify a bit: after the worldwide success obtained by Wolfenstein 3d (such as to convert it also for Super Nintendo, although afflicted by the censorship of the large N ), ~guilty~ of having given birth to the genre of subjective shootem'up, the geniuses of Id Software scored another coup in 1993: Doom. As a Marine who escaped a massacre on the Moon, you'll have to return to Earth, surviving hundreds of monsters, demons, loathsome beings and dozens of insidious traps.", "date": "2001-12-12", "grade": null}
