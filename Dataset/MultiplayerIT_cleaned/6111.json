{"name": "Il re dei mostri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155013-monsters-ate-my-metropolis-il-re-dei-mostri.html", "text": "PikPok is a development team particularly skilled in making mobile games with crazy and irreverent humor, and Monsters Ate My Condo! (as well as its improved version, Super Monsters Ate My Condo!) is a great example of this type of product. In fact, the game put us in the shoes of a handful of absurd giant monsters, grappling with their snack: entire apartments of different colors, which fell from above and were devoured in combos to score as many points as possible. After some time, we find the same characters in a new episode of the series, Monsters Ate My Metropolis, which however addresses the issue in a very different way, that of a strategy based on trading cards. So the huge crab Boat Head returns to the charge, so called because during its disproportionate growth phase it overwhelmed a ship that it now uses as a hat; Mr. Shigoto, the cyclops with a Japanese name but who comes in a traditional Bavarian outfit; Reginald Starfire, a giant blue unicorn; and finally Lord Ferocious, a pug who serves as the mastermind for a powerful mechanical body. However, we will not be able to use them all, at least not immediately: respecting the canons of freemium productions, the game allows you to unlock a single monster at the beginning and then possibly buy the others with the coins obtained or using real currency. The problem is that the figures required to buy the monsters are quite high, which cuts a bit the legs to the variety - even visual - of the experience. Monsters Ate My Metropolis is a decent card-based strategy game with insane and irresistible monsters Fake cards At the beginning of the game you have to choose one of the monsters on the roster, as mentioned, and create your own city. After that it is possible to try your hand at a series of tournaments aiming to destroy the cities of increasingly good players, climbing the rankings to finally obtain a prize in cards and coins. This is not a multiplayer properly speaking, because in practice the ones we fight are entities controlled by artificial intelligence that exploit the decks of the related users, and the degree of challenge increases hand in hand with the level of experience of the opponent. In practice, the formula unfortunately becomes repetitive after a certain number of games. Moving on to the actual gameplay, everything is based on the color of the cards and their value, which eventually determines the damage inflicted on the enemy, with the energy bars placed at the top and bottom of the screen. The interface shows at all times the simple rules that we must keep in mind: red wins over green, green wins over yellow, yellow wins over blue and blue wins over red. Considering that we will be able to have three cards at a time, randomly drawn from the deck, it goes without saying that we will have to look for the advantage deriving from the color to limit the damage and attack decisively, even more so if we are facing a high-level opponent. The strategic value of these mechanisms appears good at certain moments, but often one has the feeling of being faced with a somewhat too simplistic experience. Luckily you are distracted by the fun animations that accompany each attack, and which see the monster (or the city) hit the enemy with flying peppers, onions, flying saucers, hammers, bombs and so on. Each maneuver is accompanied by a quick time event that requires the use of the touch screen to stop a timed indicator or a quick press of the screen, and which if completed successfully amplifies the effect of the move. Finally, there is a special attack that loads as we score the shots, and which allows us to reverse the fate of a game that was perhaps going badly. In short, the technical sector is at the service of entertainment, including the absurd soundtrack, but as already mentioned, the freemium elements appear a bit too limiting: in addition to the traditional action energy, which is recharged by one point every minute (in you need twenty to play a game), to get hold of new cards you have to collect too many coins, and the question is even more felt when it comes to unlocking the missing monsters. It's a shame, because with a little more elasticity, the PikPok title could have guaranteed greater variety and fully expressed its potential.", "date": "2015-08-22", "grade": "7.0"}
