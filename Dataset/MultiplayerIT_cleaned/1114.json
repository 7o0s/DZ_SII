And that's not all: according to a study conducted by Microsoft after the acquisition of Mojang in 2014 for 2.5 billion dollars, Minecraft was played by more than 50% of the population aged 9-11. This is also thanks to the version of the game designed for educational purposes and adopted by 115 countries for a total of 35 million students. The phenomenon generated by the Swedish team has pulverized any videogame record and it was more than reasonable to expect that this universe, albeit still alive and well and capable of producing dizzying numbers, would have been used to try to create a new equally winning formula. The undertaking is difficult and fraught with dangers and before talking about a Minecraft 2 capable of repeating this enormous success, there are several ways forward to go in search of a different audience; partly to test the waters and partly to bring innovation within the brand. The first attempt was Minecraft Dungeon which, supported by the release also on Game Pass on the day of the launch, received the favor of the users without however approaching those monstrous numbers ground by the original game. For Mojang, however, it is time for a new adventure and in this review of Minecraft Legends we will take you to discover an RTS with strong action nuances. The revenge of the Piglins In Minecraft Legends we will have to deal with the fierce Piglin The world of Minecraft has introduced us to many creatures, but the real protagonists in Minecraft Legends are the Piglins, the pink little pigs whose home resides in the Nether. These friendly monsters have always been neutral, as long as you wear a piece of golden armor and respect their rules, such as the prohibition to snatch this resource under their noses. Times, however, change and, after years of thriving trade, the Piglins have become our worst enemy, fierce as ever and ready to besiege the Overworld, a parallel universe that has enjoyed peace and serenity until then. Thus we get to know Farsightedness, Knowledge and Action, the three creators of this new world in which we find ourselves catapulted in the role of Hero, our three guides in battle and beyond. The Minecraft Legends campaign is based on this narrative device, it is a rather basic story, but one that embodies everything that made Minecraft famous: its simplicity. Even in this title, learning the game mechanics is quite intuitive and this has meant that the many hours that have engaged us during the main campaign have flown smoothly, keeping us glued to the screen battle after battle. The new game by Mojang is in all respects a real-time strategy, but also adds the free movement of the protagonist and the ability to interact with the world around him. There is therefore no chessboard where to set up our pawns but rather, the battles against the Piglins are very eventful and require front changes and new strategies to be implemented as the battle evolves. The Minecraft Legends Overworld needs a Hero In Minecraft Legends will you be able to be a formidable strategist? The Piglin forces are divided into three main factions of different difficulty, distinguished by the green, orange or red color, visible directly on the game map. These are the Spore, Bastion and Hunt Horde respectively. The creatures with curly tails have literally invaded the Overworld and, after an initial initial phase where you learn the rudiments of the game such as collecting resources, building defensive elements and grouping troops, the real campaign begins. In Minecraft Legends, time flows just like in Minecraft: enemy attacks are concentrated at night, while opponents use the daylight hours to fortify their strongholds. This mechanism has a double use: to leave time to explore the game map to discover secrets and useful allies in war or to attack each outpost head-on before the Piglins are able to fortify their bases. Minecraft Legends features four difficulty levels that affect the frequency and intensity of attacks on villages by the ~bad guys~ and the availability of resources scattered around the map. By increasing the difficulty, the approach changes radically, since more time will be required to better prepare for the current battle. It often happened during the campaign that I had to pause the explosionration to help a targeted village; on the map, the Piglin objective will appear surrounded by red markers and with a gauge that determines its Horde strength. This signal gives time to build defensive countermeasures such as walls and towers to keep the piglets away from the Fountain, the main building of each village which determines the health and happiness of the inhabitants. Our task is therefore to defend the harmless inhabitants in a sort of horde mode that can last a few moments in the initial stages, but which can give life to real sieges marked by a timer with an increasingly high minute count as we goes into the story. A Creeper for a friend To accompany us in the adventure created in Minecraft Legends we will have many friends, some quite unexpected The Overworld, before the invasion by the Piglins, was a real Eden and you can therefore imagine our surprise to learn that all the creatures here lived in peace, including Creepers, Zombies and Skeletons. The terrible mobs that tormented us in Minecraft are now our allies and we had to defend their villages from enemy attacks; protecting their lands will ensure that an alliance can be forged with them thanks to which we will be able to recall all three species to our side during attacks on the outposts of the three Piglin factions. In the early stages you only have Golems available, nice creatures of wood, slime or rock created by Farsightedness, Knowledge and Action that require few resources to be able to be created. With the addition of Creepers, Zombies and Skeletons, the battles become much more interesting and we must admit that their strength and resistance have represented a solid help even in the most complex outposts, but obviously the cost in terms of resources to create them is undoubtedly higher. Skeletons, for example, require Diamonds to call into battle, the most valuable resource in the game. To help us in this war against the Piglin there are finally the Giants who, once discovered and assembled, will join us in battle permanently. Unlike Golems and Creepers which are ~disposable~ and infinitely replicable as long as you have the resources to do so, the Giants are practically immortal and if they fall during an assault they will come back to life every time we return to a village or main hub. Finally, in the latter, it is possible to manage the improvements of Minecraft Legends, thus obtaining a greater inventory capacity or the possibility of deploying a greater number of creatures in battle. Unity is strength Playing Minecraft Legends in company is undoubtedly fun and addictive The Minecraft Legends campaign has undoubtedly surprised us, both for its longevity and for the many mechanics put in place; in order not to fall into repetitiveness, Mojang has found the right balance between the attacks on the outposts of the Piglins, the real objective of the game, and the defensive phases of the villages, a sort of secondary, random and timed missions. What could have seemed like an extensive tutorial to prepare us for PvP battles has instead proved to be a rather solid and fun content to complete. Obviously, once all the methods have been tested, the race to free the Overworld from the Piglins is rather schematic, finding ourselves fighting three strongholds for each faction and the relative final Boss for each Horde. To dampen this rather repetitive cycle there is the possibility of freely exploring the game map, which offers not only resource deposits and defensive towers to discover, but also mounts for our hero. The beauty of Minecraft, and consequently also of Minecraft Legends, is that all of this can be tackled with one or more friends, up to a maximum of four. The cooperative mode does not overturn everything we have learned by playing alone but rather manages to maintain an optimal balance, creating a shared inventory and therefore limiting the possibility of appearing in battle with duplicate resources. Even the Golems or Creepers to generate before a fight remain limited, and the same goes for the Giants: all this manages to add a further degree of challenge given that in two, or even four, we had to divide the troops and lead them in different corners of the strongholds for a multi-pronged attack. Playing with other players has therefore become a further mechanic able to stratify the offer rather than flatten it, making everything too easy. Minecraft Legends is in fact a full-blown strategy game, even if it doesn't go as deep into the mechanics as Age of Empire or Total War do, for example. Mojang's title is simple and clean, commendablele also from that age group that made this brand famous, but at the same time, fun even for those who have spent many hours on decidedly more demanding real-time strategy games. Blocks too big Not everything runs smoothly in Minecraft Legends, and precisely the pixelated nature creates some problems However, we do not hide that this product is not free from some small defects that undermine an experience that wants to be light but without falling into the banal. The main strongholds, which are 9 in total, stand on Nether pillars, and in order to be able to destroy all the defensive mechanisms or forges that create Piglins, we had to deal with Minecraft's imprecise pixels. To permanently eradicate an outpost you must destroy the Portal located in the highest pillar; to be able to reach it, therefore, we had to create stairs that connected all the surrounding platforms, bearing in mind that in order to build, the Nether must first be ~purified~. Since these are extensive areas, the reclamation procedure can be quite long and thus dampen the rhythms of the game, as well as a consistent inaccuracy of the models that make up the stairs that allow us to get to the fulcrum of the outpost. In our test we very often witnessed the fall of our troops down cliffs because the space available on the stairs or on the pillars was insufficient for our allies, forcing us to recover them by retracing what we had climbed up to that moment; therefore having to divide the Golems and Giants into small groups does not want to be a game mechanic that increases the difficulty of the siege, but only a problem that can be fatal in some clashes. To dilute these inaccuracies that could create our early departure, there is the possibility of creating a structure capable of making us reborn near the outpost we are attacking. This allows us to return to the battlefield quickly, but the losses suffered by sending small divided units rather than a large offensive front of creatures unnecessarily prolong the duration of the clash. This must be associated with the fact that generating Golems or Skeletons costs resources, increasingly rare if you want to have an army made up of the strongest units, leading us especially in clashes with the Bosses of the various factions, to spend large quantities of iron and diamonds. In order to therefore arrive prepared for the more difficult outposts it is necessary to spend a lot of time on destroying the small outposts of the Piglins, randomly generated on the map, to collect the gold and other resources necessary to expand the capacity of our inventory and the number of allies to call under our banner. The power of friendship When you get tired of tearing apart Piglin in the main campaign, call your friends and immerse yourself in Minecraft Legends multiplayer Minecraft Legends, however, does not only have a rich campaign as an arrow in its bow and offers other modes capable of entertaining players for a long time. One of them is Lost Legends, a PvE mode consisting of 20 waves of Piglins of increasing difficulty and intensity. When each wave is repelled, in the chest near the Fountain, materials are obtained to repair damaged structures or to build even stronger buildings to repel enemies. There is currently only one map, and the reward for completing it is a set of armor to equip on our Hero and mount. This is a small taste and we believe that the support this game will receive will lead to new weekly or monthly missions, so as to offer new adventures to be undertaken in addition to aesthetic rewards to keep interest in the title alive. To complete the offer there is a sector dedicated to PvP, with public or private matches in which to compete with friends or online players in challenges from 1v1 up to 4v4. The objective of these matches is quite simple, but achieving it instead can prove more complicated than one might think. This mode requires a lot of strategy and collaboration between the players, dividing the tasks and executing them perfectly if you want to get the better of the other team: the members of the two teams will therefore have to defend their base but also collect the necessary resources to fortify yourself and generate an army capable of breaking through enemy defenses. Unfortunately, having played the title before the servers opened, we were unable to test the game under stress, but we have to admit that PvP could probably be the most rewarding and fun experience of all the Minecraft Legends offer.
