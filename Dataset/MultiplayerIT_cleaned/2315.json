Let's immediately clarify a simple but essential concept: if you don't like simulations, Silent Hunter II won't make you change your mind. It may seem like a criticism, but in these times, in which manufacturers try to publish ~hybrid~ products, in an attempt to draw on the largest possible catchment area, it is necessary to point out the fact that we are dealing with a real simulator , free of any arcade contamination. Add to this that we are not talking about any simulation, but a simulation of submarines, in which in addition to the mastery of the vessel and its tools, you have to add a generous dose of tactics and strategy. So discard Rambo-style bayonet assaults a priori, since submarines (as the title of the game suggests) are silent and above all very, very patient predators. To complete a mission (for example to sink a merchant ship), you will have to plan everything down to the smallest detail, trace the most advantageous route, stand there and spy on the prey, waiting for it to approach, before launching the attack. Remember that in most cases you will have only one chance to complete your task and that once identified by enemy tools, you will lose your most powerful weapon, or invisibility (it is no fun to slalom between depth charges, see I assure you!). Prepare tubes 1, 2 and 3! It is therefore clear that the gameplay of SH2 will be appreciated by those who are not only not frightened by the prospect of learning to govern a complex and ~capricious~ vessel such as a submarine, but will also have the patience and constancy to undertake a campaign whose missions they are, inevitably, rather ~slow~, despite the very useful (indispensable) Time Acceleration function that will help you overcome dead times (be careful not to get too carried away though). The quality of the simulation is undoubtedly of an excellent level, and the interface allows you to intervene in a fairly intuitive way on all the tools available to the U-Boat. Of course, looking after the radar and sonar and simultaneously keeping track and speed under control is not easy for a person with only two hands (and a mouse), however this is one more reason to push you to plan your actions: improvise once in engaged battle is absolutely not recommended. However, there are some notes to make: the tactical map is undoubtedly a very useful tool, since your position and that of all the enemy vessels are shown in real time, but the impression is that it makes the life a little too easy for the player. Prepare tubes 1, 2 and 3! In theory, in fact, your position on the map should depend on your own instrument readings, just as to identify the enemy you should attach yourself to radar or sonar, and through the latter trace an approximate position of the target. The fact that all this happens automatically, reduces the use of the detection instruments to only determining the speed of the target and the inclination necessary to hit the target with the torpedoes. I also found it all too easy to get in line with an enemy ship to tail or torpedo it, while remaining invisible. In theory, to do this it would be necessary to maintain a relatively low speed and remain below the periscope height, but it should be sufficient to exceed 5 knots for the noise of our propellers to be picked up by the enemy, which does not always happen in the game, and I it happened several times to be able to almost ~buffer~ my prey, before it was aware of my presence. The seais the voice of my heart!! Musical quotations aside, it's not like the landscape that you can admire from the turret of your submarine can be of great inspiration for a sailor in a poetic vein. It is also true that 90% of the time you will spend admiring the static control panels of the different environments of the submarine, but by activating the external cameras or taking a look from the periscope, the graphics certainly do not leave you speechless and the engine appears somewhat raw. Of course the graphics are a detail that I would dare to define as an accessory for a simulation of this type, but the fact remains that on the threshold of 2002 it is legitimate to expect more detailed 3D models and a slightly more generous use of polygons. On the contrary, the interiors of your boat are impeccably made and although they are almost static two-dimensional images, they do not fail to communicate the feelingto ~feel on board~. On the sound front, the game does not disappoint and does not impress: the music is absent (and after all, there is no need for it), while the effects, although well sampled, are repetitive and in small quantities, even if most probably they weren't there other sounds to play. Conclusions Silent Hunter II is a game to be recommended to all naval simulation enthusiasts, also by virtue of the multiplayer compatibility with the future Destroyer Command, a warship simulator that should see the light of day next year, virtually allowing you to reproduce naval battles from unprecedented scope. Not only that, there is also a very accurate single-player campaign, which starting from the dawn of the Second World War, will make you progress in your career as a commander, giving you the opportunity to govern increasingly modern and sophisticated submarines. Conclusions On the actual quality and likelihood of the simulation, it is useless to repeat that we are at the highest levels; of course, there are some positions taken in terms of gameplay (such as the question of the tactical map updated in real time) that could leave the most demanding players perplexed, but given the general complexity of the game, I think the choice to simplify one of its most cumbersome is to be considered as a plus point of the Ultimation. Finally, as confirmation of the enormous work carried out to ensure the historical veracity of the game's contents, by purchasing SH2 you will be able to enjoy an interview (strictly in English) with the legendary Erich Topp, legendary U-Boat commander, still alive, who among between 1940 and 1945 it was assigned four submarines, collecting enviable successes during the war. To be seen. The submarine sailor always has a warm cot. As reported by the flourishing literary vein born from the myth of the ~silent hunters~ of the sea, one of the pleasant aspects of the submariner's life is that, once one's shift is over, to go to bed on a cozy cot which in the meantime has already been ~heated~ by whoever will now take his place. Disgusted? In fact, the stay inside these steel giants (especially in the first half of the last century) must not have been the height of comfort; after all, we had a taste of this with the recent film ~U-571~, and even more effectively with the unforgettable ~Duel in the Atlantic~ (for those who remember). Well Silent Hunter II will put you right in the uniform of a stiff captain of the German Kriegsmarine, in whose role you will relive the events of the Second World War (from the periscope eye of your submarine of course).", "date": "2001-12-13", "grade": null}
