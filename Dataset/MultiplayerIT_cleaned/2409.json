{"name": "Cossacks: European Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cossacks-european-wars-2.html", "text": "A bit of history As you naturally know, it was during this period that infantry with firearms gradually replaced melee infantry: the armored knights left the scene in favor of the ~musketeers~. This happened due to the fact that medieval armor now offered very little resistance to the penetrating force of the buckshot fired from muskets. Also, there wasn't much point in letting a giant clumsy iron-clad man charge into an attack with a firearm... Over time, armor was phased out, as were melee units. , that is, medieval reminiscences. A typical army of the period consisted of units of musketeers, possibly companies of pikemen or light infantry, cavalry and artillery. Since the first firearms took many minutes to reload, the survivors of the first lines that had fired and above all had been fired, withdrew, leaving room for the other lines of musketeers waiting or they could retreat to make room for the pikemen departments to resist cavalry attacks or infantry for possible charges. Pikemen and other units of this type were gradually made to disappear with the invention of the bayonet, which while less effective than a pike made it expensive to have two completely different types of units when you could only have one type that served both purposes . Cavalry was essentially divided into two types: light and heavy. The difference was both in the quality of the horses and in the type of attacks they had to undertake: the light one was in fact responsible for isolated attacks, man against man, while the heavy one had to try to attack en masse from the flanks or from the rear, the most vulnerable positions ( throughout history there were also examples of knights armed with short-range rifles, instead of mowing down soldiers with swords and the like). Cavalry was also very dependent on terrain conditions, as a certain Napoleon at Waterloo would like to remind us. Artillery instead began to be gradually introduced from the seventeenth century and as you can imagine its effectiveness (before the invention of explosive shells) derived from the ~bowling~ effect that a cannonball could have on the enemy ranks. It goes without saying that throughout the game, all these changes are carefully described and modeled, and this and other information is available in the excellent online help included with the game. Europe today, the world tomorrow! Cossacks offers the player a series of ~historical~ campaigns (such as the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Ukrainian revolutionary uprisings - the programmers are Ukrainians, and it happens to be one of the strongest nations -) as well as a series of single missions that will focus on the tactical and strategic aspect rather than on the construction of the city. The nations that you will be able to lead into battle in the campaigns are clearly the most famous ones such as Spain or France, involved in their respective wars. In random or multiplayer missions, on the other hand, we will also be able to use the Serenissima Republic of Venice or the Kingdom of Savoy (~use~ in the sense that these ~nations~ have a characteristic graphic style and some also have unique units). The campaigns in Cossacks attempt to establish a kind of ~story~, StarCraft style with the various characters talking to each other and with you often impersonating a particular unit, dead which ends the mission. Clearly you won't see French soldiers shouting ~Oh no! It's the Austrians.. The scanner reads 2m, but we can't see them... They're above us!! AAAAARRGH!~, the narrative element ends in some scrolls appearing on screen with the phrases said by the characters, phrases that can vary from a priest who thanks you for freeing him from Austrian captivity or from the leader of a company of mercenaries who asks you if you want to hire them. There are two big criticisms to make: the writing is really bad, in the sense that they will leave you rather cold to the emotional reactions of the various characters, furthermore the game (in the campaign) tries to route you along well-defined and marked tracks, so much so that often if you try to take one path instead of another, the game will remind you that you can't, and even if you could, the maps are built in such a way that you have a fixed path. The gameplay All the historical information of this world is effectively useless if the game is not that great. How does it behave?eight this look? The answer must be interpreted according to what your judgment parameters are: exceptionally if you have the patience to resort to sometimes excessive micromanagement, catastrophically if what you want is a tank rush against the enemy. Let's start with order, in fact in Cossacks you will have a really large number of resources available: food, wood, stone, gold, iron and coal. If you're thinking ~and what do you do once it's finished?~ don't be scared: they are infinite. If you were thinking ~I'll have to keep an eye on them all!~ scare yourself because you will have to do it. Armies eat and without food they will not go on, in fact many will begin to die of hunger and disease. Wood and stone are used to build the various structures. Gold, on the other hand, represents the soldiers' pay: without money, the soldiers will mutiny and turn against you. Iron and coal, on the other hand, represent your ammunition: without them, soldiers and artillery will no longer fire. As you are starting to guess, these resources should not be paid ~one-off~ i.e. at the construction of the units or to keep them in circulation as was the case for the various farms / warehouses / overlords of War / Starcraft. These resources will constantly be depleted from your reserves moment by moment, step by step and blow by blow. However, the resource system has a fundamental error, in fact one of the market structures allows you to infinitely convert one resource into another if you miss it, with the result that you can also concentrate on just one of them and ignore the others. This type of detail can surely overwhelm those who don't have the patience to pay themselves to such a level of attention but it will be appreciated by the most passionate without a doubt. But we must consider one thing, if on the one hand we cannot ignore the fact that the armies needed food and that diseases and epidemics were the order of the day, on the other we cannot even ignore the fact that history has never seen the RTS mechanics. I mean, when has it ever happened that before facing each other two enemies start building cities, hiring soldiers and at the same time studying the sciences and making substantial technological advances? While on the one hand we may have an excess of realism, on the other we lack coherence. An approach to Shogun Total War would perhaps have been the most appropriate. In the game it is also possible to adjust the speed according to your preferences, but unfortunately it is not possible to send orders with the game paused. Take comfort: even the French army, it is said, was the victim of stupid orders sent by its leaders. Technological advancement works in exactly the same way as in Age of Empires: you will have some structures which, depending on the historical period that the mission allows you to reach, will allow you to research various improvements. Click and you will discover the wonders of human knowledge (provided you have the ~prerequisites~ of course!) 7 The tactic Another very important aspect of the game is the ~rock-paper-n-scissors~ logic, i.e. the famous game of ~chinese rock~ (I think it's called that). What does it has to do with it? A lot: it is the same logic that animates the relationships between the various units I mentioned at the beginning. To make you understand how the rock destroys the scissor but is ~captured~ by the paper, so the musketeers will destroy the infantry but the cavalry would massacre them once they manage to get close. Similarly, the pikemen will be very effective against it, but a cannon shot in the front would certainly not help them... it goes without saying that the artillery can be captured, once you have eliminated any units guarding them (even the ~villagers~ can be captured, as well as structures, with the same logic). Another very important feature of the game are the formations! But be careful, because each formation must have certain specific requirements, such as a fixed number of soldiers (for example a company of musketeers will be made up of 36 soldiers, the other soldiers, if less than 36, will remain out), the presence of an officer who coordinates them as well as a drummer ... who plays (the drum was used, according to the rhythm, to propagate tactical orders). You can also create more complex formations such as a ~frame~ of pikemen protecting a column of musketeers, and so on. 8 The graphics engine The engine used in Cossacks, albeit 2d, is really nice to see: in fact, it provides a system to model the various irregularities of the terrain in a different way fromto the ~tiles~ systems used in StarCraft or Command & Conquer: everything is much more similar to what is seen in Settlers for example. The units are also pre-rendered from 64 different directions, making you practically forget the not-so-distant days when the units spun jerkily. There are also other graphic subtleties, such as the ears of corn which hide the units that may pass through them for a certain height. What I didn't find appropriate was the understanding of the Fog of War: your units will have a remarkably large vision range, but as you move around, the map will revert to ~black~ (not obscured, just black!) in areas that are no longer visible. Sounds and the like are in line with the rest. The only comment that can be made is the scarcity of the animation frames of the units. The game ran without a doubt on my AMD 1200 MHz with GeForce 3 and 512 MB RAM in 1280*960, but I doubt that I can give you any valid indications :-) War.. War never changes So said the narrator of the Fallouts, war never changes... and while military planes flew above my head all morning, probably flying towards Kosovo (I doubt they come here to Salento on vacation) I find myself reflecting on this game. It certainly perfectly recreates the battles of the time, but the excessive dose of realism (in the interested parties) could discourage many from enjoying such a title. I would recommend it to all Age of Empires style RTS fans. Those who were frightened by it, stay away from Cossacks: you may develop an inferiority complex! Cossacks: European Wars As soon as I received this new RTS from GSC Game World (the authors of Sudden Strike) my thoughts immediately turned to the way war was thought of in the period in question (17th and 18th centuries). If you are reading this article it is likely that you have seen films such as Kubrick's Barry Lindon or the recent The Patriot with Mel Gibson: well they are excellent examples of how the war was carried out by the powers of the period. Just seeing the box brought up in my mind images of many ranks of soldiers marching boldly to the beat of the drums to their deaths, oblivious to what was happening around them as the enemy had already started shooting. Cossacks is therefore an RTS that aims to simulate with a decisive and marked attention to the tactical and strategic side (forget the tank rushes of Red Alert: this is a ~professional~ RTS) of this historical period. One of the titles that inspired it is the Age of Empires series from which it takes up the ~technological~ model, the historical accuracy and the relationships that existed between the various units.", "date": "2001-09-01", "grade": null}
