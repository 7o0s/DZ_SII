A success that spurred strong game support via DLC; after the first, convincing The Zombie island of Dr. Ned has in fact recently peeped out the second downloadable content, this time entitled Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. Violent punches For the occasion, however, the programmers have chosen to follow a different path; if the island of the Zombies was roughly an expansion that traced all the characteristics of the gameplay of the main game, simply adding a new location with related missions, in this case the cards were decidedly mixed. Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot is in fact, in simple terms, the adaptation in the world of Borderlands of the ~Horde~ mode of Gears of War 2: three arenas in which to face 5 rounds (initially) each consisting of 5 waves of enemies, obviously of difficulty growing. Each round ends with a boss who, once eliminated, releases a loot made up of some objects to be collected in the central area of the setting. The presence of variables tries to bring relief to a rather monotonous and soon repetitive progression, which before each wave pose some additional rules to be taken into account; for example the greater effectiveness of a certain type of weapon than others, or the absence of shields, or the addition of super speed, and so on. What is important to underline is how eliminating enemies does not guarantee any loot - bosses excluded - nor an increase in the experience points of one's character; this factor, combined with the persistence of the level cap at 50 and the high general difficulty, makes the target of Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot rather precise, thus aiming at users with already maximized characters and looking for some further stimulus to return to Borderlands. The question is therefore very simple: is this expansion able to achieve this? Frankly, the answer cannot be affirmative, or at least not in a convinced way. There are many reasons, starting from the cost: 800 Microsoft Points (and 7.99 euros on PSN) appear excessive for a simple series of three arenas with monothematic gameplay and intended to offer, at best, some new objects to put in the own inventory. Secondly, it is a DLC that further accentuates the multiplayer vocation of Borderlands; Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot makes practically no sense when played alone, and the fun is purely related to games with other users in co-op. The sum of all these elements inevitably leads to having to evaluate this work by Gearbox insufficiently; emptied of many of the most important elements of the gameplay of the main game, starting with the progression of the character, repetitive and monotonous to the point of quickly becoming boring, devoid of new enemies or relevant elements, and ungenerous in the few loot offered. The only aspects of interest are a ~bank~ of dubious utility in which to keep objects, the beautiful soundtrack during boss fights, but above all the 2 skill points offered to virtuosos capable of completing the challenge.", "date": "2010-01-26", "grade": "5.8"}
