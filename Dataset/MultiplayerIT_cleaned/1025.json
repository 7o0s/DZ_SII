{"name": "Skate City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skate-city-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "It's fate that sports titles will either never be released for years, or be released all at once within a few months. Here then is the review of Skate City on Nintendo Switch, at a time when all in all there is also the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 to keep an eye on on consoles and PC. Speaking of platforms: certainly you will not have missed the review of Skate City for mobile devices and more recently also for PC, the first by Fabio Palmisano, the second by Luca Olivato. Since you often ask the editorial staff to analyze as many conversions as possible of the same title (and rightly so), why not settle when the possibility exists? Everyone who has been waiting for Skate City on Nintendo Switch today will know more about this specific release. The conversion to Nintendo Switch Let's start with the most important aspect when analyzing a port: how is the conversion of Skate City on Nintendo Switch? Appreciable, although not representing anything exceptional. We mean that the HD Rumble, although present, has not been adapted in an ingenious way and certainly could have enhanced the tricks and grind on surfaces a little more, as well as many other small aspects of the gameplay, which would have come out of it embellish yourself. This was not the case: and yet the tactile feedback is quite good, and allows you to identify with the (sometimes slightly reckless) performance of the skater protagonist. The adaptation of the commands, in truth, partly seems to make sense, and partly doesn't. Let's explain better: by holding down the A button, the skater moves on the screen; if you stop pressing it, it stops. And so far nothing abnormal; only, to perform the tricks, you have to tilt the single analog sticks in various directions, both the right and the left. Now, as far as the left is concerned, no problem, but try holding down command A and simultaneously using the right stick on that tiny Joy-Con. And even try to use all three input systems at the same time: this is inconvenient beyond a reasonable hypothesis, if not simply impossible. Technically speaking, then, the conversion of Skate City to Nintendo Switch is not exciting. The loading times seemed borderline acceptable to us: a couple of seconds longer for each, and we would have rated them negatively. It is not clear why a title that basically has very little to ~load~ takes so much time; let's assume the optimization wasn't all that great. On the other hand, there is no objection to the graphic rendering and frame rate, which remain at good levels, even considering the mobile nature of the title and its already existing conversion for PC. Gameplay That said, it is appropriate to recall, at least briefly, what the gameplay of Skate City consists of. The player controls a skater and tries to perform as many tricks as possible, without necessarily enhancing the spectacular at the expense of the technique. The goal is either to have fun freely on open maps (there are three of them, associated with three main cities scattered around the world) or to try to complete the challenges proposed by the developers. The latter guarantee Skate Points, credits to be used in various ways: to unlock the other two maps present, initially unavailable; buy new styles for the protagonist and skate; improve performance parameters. Perhaps the real underlying problem of the production, which has also led here and elsewhere to give him not exactly generous votes, consists in the lack of a well-defined progression: of a plot, of a purpose, of any career mode. However, this is understandable if we consider the nature of the title itself, which in the end was born on mobile, suitable for very short game sessions between one break and another. Nintendo Switch partially recovers this philosophy, because it once again allows you to carry Skate City around and select it ~how, when and where we want~. On the other hand, compared to titles properly born on consoles, it lacks a depth that leads one to criticize the launch price on the Nintendo console, which is however set at 15 euros. That's not to say that die-hard skate fans or casual gamers can't still have a lot of fun with Skate City - in fact, they will. Provided, however, that you keep in mind the quantitative limits (it is not a particularly full-bodied or long-lived game) and qualitative (it quickly gets boring, and various recent productions can easily overcome it in every aspect).", "date": "2021-05-17", "grade": "6.5"}
