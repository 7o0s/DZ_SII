{"name": "Space Miner", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-miner.html", "text": "Qplaze seems to have every intention of revolutionizing the mobile gaming market. While not having the resources of the most famous software houses, this team produces products that always guarantee high-level graphics as well as gameplay specifically designed for impromptu and casual use such as that of those who use the telephone to distract themselves during a break. Ensuring this type of entertainment does not mean creating ~games~, however, and Space Miner is a perfect example of this assumption: technically excellent but also as engaging as few others, rich in depth and quite long-lived. In the game we find ourselves in command of a space drill (and Grendizer has nothing to do with it...), on the first of the three planets available, and we have the task of penetrating the ground up to frightening depths, collecting all the materials in our progress valuables and then returning to the surface to store them and collect the relative fee. The view of the game is lateral, and we can move the vehicle in four directions: going down, in the presence of obstacles we drill, as well as going left and right; going up, however, the engine is activated and we will have to grapple with an inertial control that simulates the force of gravity. The game mechanics are simple, it involves collecting all the minerals that it is possible to get into the hold and then going back out and ~selling~ them, using the money earned to upgrade the vehicle (there are upgrades for the drill, the engine, the hold, the tank, the shield, the cooling system) or to buy useful items (fuel reserves, repair kits, but also explosives or a teleportation system). On the surface of each planet there are always three points of reference: the first (on the left) allows us to buy upgrades and items, the second (on the top, to be reached by flying) is used to save the game (there are also three slot available, and it is possible to save at any time) and to check the missions and tasks assigned, the third (on the right) allows us to empty the hold of minerals and be paid, as well as to fill up the tank. The fuel, in this case, is of absolute importance and its level can mean life or death for our space miner: a bar placed at the top right shows us the level of the tank, and we must take this into account when we go down beyond a certain depth because then we will also have to be able to go back up to refuel. In fact, if the fuel runs out, the drill explodes without too many compliments, so much so that it is much easier to keep the level of the shields under control (which are only affected by ~non-depreciated~ falls or when too high depths are reached). It is therefore very important to limit yourself to ~light~ drilling in the early stages, earning as much as possible and upgrading the vehicle, perhaps also purchasing reserve tanks and repair kits where it proves necessary to use them (perhaps when you get too far low and it is not possible to go back up in time to stock up) and only later to look for greater depths and the most precious minerals. When completing key missions, a message warns us that we can go drilling on another planet, starting from scratch with a different vehicle and more expensive but also more effective upgrades. Moving on to a technical discussion, Space Miner is really very well done. On the official website of NOMOC, publisher of the product, we can even find a series of preliminary illustrations for the characterization of the characters and for the backdrops, which attest to the care and attention that Qplaze has put into making the game. Both the drill and the scenarios are well designed, the latter brilliantly overcome the problems that may arise from the repetition of the background elements and are lively and functional to the action. The characterization of the characters is excellent, as is the level of the animations and explosion effects. On the other hand, the sound sector is rather poor and of little impact, with only an initial music (moreover invasive) and to follow a series of effects that are far from convincing, which seem to be placed there at random. The control system sees the use of the joystick (or the corresponding number keys) for the movement of the drill, while the bottom three keys of the number pad are used to scroll through the available objects and to use them.
