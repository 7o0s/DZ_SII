Like that Kentucky Route Zero who was able to interpret the post-crisis existential instability of 2008 in a unique way, We Are OFK is also divided into five acts, and its characters alternate on the stage of life with grace and naturalness. chosen by the team is a realistic Los Angeles, very different from the United States of America of Cardboard Computer, which seemed born from a dream. Apart from some futuristic elements, the world of We Are OFK allows players to fully identify themselves, who will find themselves feeling sympathy, hostility or concern for the protagonists of a video game with limited interactivity from a playful point of view, but capable of fully involving the emotional sphere of the player. This is not the bombastic rise to fame of a great band: We Are OFK tells a small story, and also for this reason it manages to enter the hearts of those who know how to listen to it. Let's find out in the We Are OFK review. Escape from crunchtime The protagonists of We Are OFK We were talking about the episodic structure of We Are OFK. We were able to play all five episodes for this review, while when We Are OFK is released on August 18th, only the first two will be available to the public. Don't worry, because there won't be long waits: over the next three weeks the other three remaining episodes will also be unlocked, at no additional cost. The story opens by following one of the long car journeys Itumi takes to reach her place of work: a video game development studio where crunchtime is the rule. The team's criticism of the big studios' failure to respect the privacy and creativity of workers is evident. It is unusual for a videogame to be used to give a voice to the thousands of employees in the sector crushed by the gargantuan production gears of the large videogame companies; what is certain is that players will find themselves reflecting, very naturally and without forcing, on the nature of the behind-the-scenes work necessary to create virtual worlds in some immense cases. In the offices we meet Luca, the second of the four co-stars. Along with Itsumi, he too shares a passion relegated to a corner of his mind to make room for cumbersome work deadlines: music. Luca has written several songs in the past, but has never thought about a career in the music world. His meeting with the producer Jey changes everything for him and more: even Itsumi, pianist, and Carter, graphic designer, find themselves involved in Luca's dream and in the big plans that Jey has for him. Between twists and difficult decisions, the characters of We Are OFK will weave a dense but always clear and coherent emotional plot, provided that you have a good knowledge of English and a fair familiarity with juvenile slang. A big, small story We Are OFK talks about simple stories, but able to hit the right buttons If the premises of We Are OFK are certainly simple, the way in which the story is told is not obvious. We are witnessing the explosion of a creative fire that was smoldering in the hearts of the protagonists and their life will never be as before: everyone, without exception, tries to become aware of their real priorities and the unrepeatability of life, finding themselves having to choose between pursuing a dream of uncertain - perhaps impossible - realization and stable and secure employment. Music is the mad variable initially kept under control, but which once released overwhelms the lives of the quartet. And nothing will ever be the same again. We Are OFK speaks a frank and direct, honest language (the theme of honesty is central to the narrative and is taken up several times), which does not give discounts to the characters and the viewer / player. The ghosts of the past suddenly return, in the form of boxes, puppets, videos of old friends who are no longer there; the exorcism of the ghost is a necessary exercise, but not always possible: sometimes, the right path is that of a serene acceptance of oneself and of the world as it is. In We Are OFK there will also be moments of introspection This does not mean that we should not fight, quite the contrary. The growth of the characters of We Are OFK takes place before our eyes, without jolts, without forced changes. It's still them, yet we see new facets of their personalities with each episode, and discover how the four are shaped by their interactions with each other and with their environment. The depths of existential contemplation explored by the aforementioned Kentucky Route Zero are not reached, but Itsumi, Luca, Jey and Carter remainare in my heart for their sincere humanity, as if they were real people. Telephone, telephone of my desires The telephone is at the center of the events of We Are OFK, but now not only those... The narration of We Are OFK passes through scenes of daily life: receiving emails from the boss, messages from friends, waiting for a drink at the counter... All moments in which we often use the telephone. Here, this is a constant presence in the contemporary world, and it is also for the protagonists of this independent video game: from a technological tool, the mobile phone is transformed into a totem that symbolizes the need for interconnection between the protagonists. The use is interesting, by one of the characters, of the Games and Online Harassment Hotline chat: it is a really existing service that provides, anonymously, listening and useful information in any case of mental discomfort. Even if you just need to communicate with another human being, you can get a helping hand in the US by texting 23368. The service was created with the needs of the gaming community in mind, but anyone can reach out to Games and Online Harassment Hotline to get advice and information, or just a word of comfort. Discomfort is one of the themes of We Are OFK Thus we come to the theme of the gameplay of We Are OFK. In general, the player is above all a spectator of the adventure, which takes place without the possibility of changing its course; the interaction is given by the choice of responses and dialogue options both in live conversations and by message. The scenes in which the protagonists communicate via cell phone even if they are in the same room, perhaps at arm's length are emblematic: in particular, a conversation via messaging app during a concert left us amazed by its intensity. episode has a duration declared to the player on the main screen, and closes with a music video. Not surprisingly, the creators of We Are OFK have presented it as an interactive music EP: our actions during the songs will in fact affect the direction of the related video, and the performance can be repeated as many times as you want, even separately compared to the rest of the episode. In these sections, the interaction of the players is more marked: we have a sort of Pong to play by bouncing a telephone, a destructive fracture to be conducted on a set table to pulverize luxurious dishes, a kitty rescue session to be delivered by mail (!), and so on. Music beats at the heart of We Are OFK We got carried away with pleasure by the indie pop of We Are OFK, which in our opinion has some peaks of excellence: it's hard not to love pieces like Infuriata, impossible not to be amazed by the always happy marriage of lyrics, music and interactive music videos. The dubbing, generally of an excellent level, and a natural writing, capable of giving spontaneity and life to the protagonists, do the rest to make We Are OFK one of the most interesting releases of this very hot summer. A tip: as also specified by the developers in the introductory phases, it is better to enjoy We Are OFK on the sofa. Having tried the Nintendo Switch version, we can tell you that using the console on the move does not allow for an optimal rendering of the music, the constant presence of the adventure even in the purely narrative sections.", "date": "2022-08-17", "grade": "8.5"}
