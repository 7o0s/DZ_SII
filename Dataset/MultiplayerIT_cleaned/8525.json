At the very least some dark threat must always ruin the peace of our village and as usual it will be the usual wannabe wizard trying to save the world. In short, never let the sorcerer or the archmage come down from their ivory tower to fight! So here too in Sorcery the fate of the world will fall on the shoulders of little Finn and his feline mentor Erlin, in a fight for the whole realm, armed only with his magic wand and his cheek. Ice or fire? The magic wand is therefore the main feature of the game, which is comparable in all respects to a third-person action. Casting and choosing spells is completely entrusted to the Move + Navigation Controller combo. The (many) movements to be memorized are all quite simple and easy to perform. Thanks to the semi-automatic lock on enemies, it is not very demanding to hit the target: a quick forward blow is enough for a ~straight~ attack, in the same way a quick blow to the right, left or up causes our spells to be thrown in the desired direction. And if we wanted to exaggerate, it is also possible to give a sort of effect, more useful for solving some small puzzles than in battle. Initially Finn has only two spells, the basic attack and that of ~earth~, but with progression several are unlocked, such as ice, lightning, wind and fire. Switching from one spell to another is instantaneous: just perform a few small movements with the Move, such as rotations, to easily choose the spells. The heart of the game is therefore this, deciding at the right moment the right spell to cast towards the opponents, given that the clashes with the latter are structured with the Chinese morra system. However, very intelligently, and this is the most important merit of the developers' work, it is possible to combine spells to amplify their effects, thus increasing the attack potential. As if that weren't enough, every spell is equipped with a ~secondary fire~, to be achieved by mimicking a sort of backhand with the Move. Do enemies particularly suffer from fire and there are no braziers lit in the area? Simply create a wall of flame to ignite the basic attack. Are you surrounded by dozens of spiders and sylphs too eager to kick you in the face? We can create an electric trap with lightning, summon a tornado (and set it on fire), or freeze them until they fall apart. The game therefore manages to make the infinite battles as varied as possible, but above all it is capable of convincing us that we really have a magic wand in hand, fortunately without weighing everything down with cumbersome movements and few reactives. In the same way also the puzzles, which punctuate the levels from time to time, reinforce this feeling. It's not about anything particularly difficult or bizarre, hitting energy globes, making some ~trap doors~ sound, using the wind, and so on, but they undoubtedly work as a means of trying to break up the long battles. The little chemist We are therefore faced with an uncompromising action, which makes good use of the potential of the Move. To make everything even more interesting there is also a mild role-playing component to expand the attack and defense statistics of little Finn. By mixing the many alchemical elements that are found around the map, or by buying them directly from a merchant who occasionally pops up as you progress, it is possible to create different types of potions, really useful for resisting the continuous onslaught of enemies. Since we are novice magicians, we don't have recipes to prepare without fail, we simply have to try, or rather experiment, by throwing what we have in the saddlebag into the pot. The results are many: potions that make our attacks more powerful, others that increase the energy bar, others that increase the rate of regrowth of the same, not to mention those that improve resistance to the various magical blows of enemies. All then to be used wisely since the ingredients hidden in the caskets are few and not always cheap in case we want to buy them. How do all of these gameplay features translate into play? The combat is undoubtedly very frenetic, immediate and once all the spells have been unlocked, also very rewarding, unfortunately, however, some serious problems affect the gaming experience. First of all, the adventure is very linear, it is simply a question of following a single path with few detours worthy of the name, where moments of calm alternate with realarenas to fight in. This pattern is repeated endlessly for the approximately six to seven hours it takes to finish the title. As previously written, there is no shortage of small puzzles and puzzles, but they are very little in the face of the umpteenth wave of enemies that appears every time when we come across a large space. In short, boredom can quickly appear in Sorcery. Playstation 3 trophies Sorcery rewards the player with 34 trophies that commit us to thoroughly dissect all our magical abilities, experimenting with the various possible combinations. There is obviously no shortage of trophies that mark progression. More generally, Sorcery gives trophies very easily, but without a doubt finishing the game without using potions will be very difficult. From directing... But the most important and burdensome thing is the poor management of the camera, which also brings various collision management problems with it. The point of view on the game world is fixed. We can make small adjustments via the Remote Controller but the camera will always rotate towards what the system deems most important and dangerous, often putting the player in a sort of unsolicited strafe, thus going to hide part of the settings often remaining stranded or victim of lopsided framing, with the result of invalidating the semi-automatic lock on enemies and more generally not letting us see most of the opponents' attacks when in melee. Then, when you are targeted by different types of spells and by melee shots, it is not uncommon to get stuck in the nefarious loop of animations on the ground - standing - on the ground, until you manage to escape using an area attack or using the right timing the shield. In the first hours of the game these problems are evident but not too penalizing given the low level of challenge, but with progression, when the screen fills up with enemies and spells, everything becomes very frustrating, especially in the frantic final bars. It is therefore a pity to see such a well-implemented and varied combat system thwarted, due to problems ~external~ to the actual gameplay, not being able to act as we would like. Visually, Sorcery gratifies the player with a good general design of the environments and enemies, which fully hit the naive and fairy-tale tone of the game. However, going into detail, the work done by the graphics on textures and effects certainly does not make one cry for a miracle, we are on a qualitative level that is only sufficient, which denounces the average production ambitions of the title. This is associated with numerous frame rate drops, especially when the maps are filled with enemies. Then adding electric traps and tornadoes to the mayhem, the situation often becomes dramatic, with quite significant reductions in the number of frames.", "date": "2012-05-22", "grade": "6.5"}
