How can an almost completely random game be considered so entertaining by an entire nation? Yet on the iPhone there is the enormous success of Peggle, a game that follows this dynamic a bit. And now here's Coin Drop, which in turn derives a lot of its gameplay from this pastime (and from Peggle!), but modifies it, improves it, immerses it in amazing and colorful graphics and makes it something absolutely fun. Coin Drop is the simplest game in the world, it's true: but the care with which every aspect has been created, from the graphics to the gameplay, make it, in its small way, a true champion. Falling coins Behind Coin Drop there is also a story, or almost. The yellow coins (which are the ~good guys~) must catch the blue Bad Pennies (which are the ~bad guys~) scattered around the pinball-style and very lively levels. To progress to the next level, all the bad pennies must be caught by dropping the yellow coins from above. Of these we can only control the point from which they fall... even if a few ~taps~, given by shaking the iPhone, can partially modify their trajectory. The mechanics of the game are all here and it soon becomes clear that in addition to skill in this game you also need a lot of luck. But of course this is just the beginning: in a game like Coin Drop, the score is king, and to achieve astronomical scores it is certainly not enough to frame the bad guys! There are several dynamics implemented in this sense, and they act somewhat as alternative objectives during the game, guaranteeing this very simple game a surprising level of depth: you get extra points for hitting all the colored pegs scattered around the level, and others to send coins to the bottom bins in a given order. Starting from the second world, pink coins also appear, trapped in bamboo cages, to be released. At the end of each scheme you receive a rating, from one to three stars, depending on the score you have accumulated. In summary, Coin Drop's gameplay is something seemingly trivial, but which hides continuous levels of fun: it captivatingly mixes skill and chance, making each scheme different and making sure that the player is never frustrated, or stuck in the game. Shiny coins Beyond the fun and well-crafted gameplay, what is most striking about Coin Drop is the wonderful presentation. The graphics are colorful, lively, original: it mixes ~kawai~ elements with a remarkable realism in the physics of falling coins. Also, with 4 different worlds, each consisting of 15 levels, it offers a nice variety in presentation. Within each world the elements are different and themed, and interesting novelties are always included, not only cosmetic but also structural. Waiting for future updates, the levels available for now are 60, and once finished replaying them in search of better scores is a pleasure. So is Coin Drop the perfect game? Well, not really. Despite a general care in the gameplay, there are some decidedly ~bastard~ levels where the bad pennies are placed in virtually unreachable places. In this case you end up relying a little on luck, and it's good that Coin Drop contains some element of randomness. Furthermore, it must also be admitted that completing the 60 levels does not take up more than an hour of time; but it must be said that one of the best sides of Coin Drop is its wealth of objectives, which encourages the player to replay the previous levels.
