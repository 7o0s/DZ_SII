A result mainly due to a narrative that is different from the usual Marvel style, born from the contribution of a luxury author like Ed Brubaker, who has written many excellent stories precisely for the Captain America comic book. And the video game? As usual, Gameloft grabbed the license for the mobile tie-in, determined in this case to offer us a ~different~ action experience, however rather permissive as regards the incidence of in-app purchases; but after all we are talking about a title that, at least on the App Store, is sold at a price that is halfway between the most accessible and relatively expensive productions. But let's get to the game. Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The Official Game amazes first of all for the choice of viewing the action in portrait mode, with the scenarios that therefore develop vertically and a fortunately customizable control system, which in its default setting proves to be well soon cumbersome and lacking. From the options screen it is possible to decide whether to opt for classic-style commands, therefore a virtual d-pad and the buttons on the right side of the display, or for an RTS-style approach, in which you have to touch the areas of the map and the enemies because the our character walks towards them and starts hitting them automatically. Let's say right away that both the starting hybrid system, which mixes both solutions, and the RTS-style controls work decidedly badly, for one reason or another. The classic controls therefore prove to be an obligatory choice, even if far from perfect, and the aforementioned choice of vertical display just doesn't help. Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The Official Game is an interesting title but with some problems Captain America and his SHIELD The gameplay of Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The Official Game focuses not only on the charisma and skill of the Marvel character, but also on the SHIELD special agents, who accompany the Captain during his missions and sometimes even prove to be essential for the completion of the same. The agents are in fact divided into classes, each of which has a peculiar ability, for example the safety of an explosive or, on the other hand, the possibility of detonating a certain object. Controlled by artificial intelligence, our helpers defend themselves as best they can but it is often necessary to protect them and ensure the contribution of a medical kit to treat their wounds; or resign yourself to losing them at the end of a stage and recruiting new ones, which unfortunately involves the loss of any upgrades and level increases for those who are eliminated. The acquisition of new agents is carried out using virtual money, given in a fairly generous way, but it is clear that by putting your wallet in your hand it is possible to unlock better assistants and/or one of the many Captain America costumes: there are several, from those seen in the movies to the comics, and each includes a different rechargeable special power. The campaign is decidedly full-bodied, with as many as one hundred missions gradually more difficult, and is supported by an online multiplayer mode which however leaves the time it finds, based solely on three ~cards~ that we are going to compare with another user's deck, winning or losing the challenge according to somewhat random mechanisms. Of the fights we appreciated the yield of the impacts and some interesting elements in the behavioral routines of some enemies, who alternate head-down charges with more evasive and exhausting strategies. We'll be able to knock them out using not only spectacular punch and kick combos, but also the launch of the shield (by drawing its trajectory on the screen) or the aforementioned special move. The play system is accompanied by a respectable technical sector, with beautiful graphics in cel shading, characterized by good animations, and an excellent mix of music and effects.", "date": "2014-04-01", "grade": "6.8"}
