This fact, combined with the low installed base of the Nintendo console, led the title to rather disappointing commercial results, despite the very positive feedback from the hard core of the fans. Now, thanks to Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero here, anyone who missed the original will have the opportunity to make up for it: but will it still be worth it? Meeting people on the train While mainly addressing that (large) slice of the public who was unable to enjoy the original on Gamecube, the Capcom product immediately sets usability limits for anyone who does not have a sufficiently detailed knowledge of the events narrated in the first chapter of the saga: the storyline of Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero makes constant references to the background of the Umbrella Corporation, at times making itself clearly incomprehensible to newbies. Not that the plot is the strong point of the title, on the contrary: the story starring Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen is well below the average supported by Capcom with its survival horror, which is saying something considering how the Japanese software house has always relied on scripts worthy of a B-movie. Even the suspense is not up to par with the other chapters of the series, this time due to a trivial technical problem resulting from the use of pre-rendered backdrops. In fact, the game ~hiccups~ whenever an event involving a change in the scenario is near (for example, the inevitable sudden entrance of zombie dogs from a window), alerting the user of the imminent danger and totally frustrating the 'surprise effect. While wanting to leave aside what can also be considered subtleties, it is undeniable how playing Resident Evil Archives today: Resident Evil Zero represents a dive into the past characterized by more pain than joy. Beyond any reasonable nostalgia effect, returning to confront a wooden control system, a limiting inventory management and a barely sketched cooperative mechanic is objectively tiring to digest. Moving the characters through the now - fortunately - outdated tank dynamics is a real agony, which often collides with changes of shot that do not make life easier for the user; the impossibility of the two characters to carry more than a handful of objects each is a choice only apparently devoted to a hardcore style of play, but which in reality hides an annoying backtracking forcing; finally, the parter zapping system (thanks to which the control of one of the two protagonists can be changed on the fly) could have been innovative in 2002, but nowadays it appears really dated, above all in the light of the bad artificial intelligence that regulates the actions of the CPU driven character. Amar(o)cord As is evident, therefore, the years that Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero carries on the back are felt all right: however, this does not prevent the Capcom production from being able to prove itself attractive to a certain type of audience. First of all, the game is sold at a budget price, mainly because it is a beautiful and good porting without any additions of any kind, but also to further stimulate users to try their hand at this sort of neo-retrogaming. Furthermore, from a technical point of view, Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero still makes a good impression: the two-dimensional backdrops are extremely detailed and well-defined, also embellished by remarkable plays of light and shadow, while the polygonal models prove to be more than satisfactory, even if penalized by some woody animations. Although it is also pointed out by many as the least convincing chapter of the saga, the Capcom title has several arrows in its bow from a playful point of view. In fact, some puzzles that involve the use of the skills of the two protagonists are particularly successful, perhaps forcing them to act simultaneously in different places; furthermore, the game offers some really impressive boss battles, which are sure to put even the most savvy users to the test. In principle, however, Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero is one of those video games that you either love or hate, so its strengths and weaknesses fade or accentuate depending on who is in front of it. Hard to believe such a good oneslice of the modern public can gladly compromise with the large technical and playful limitations of the Capcom work: conversely, the most convinced fans of the saga, perhaps the same ones who do not approve of the action drift that manifested itself starting from the fourth chapter, will probably throw themselves more than gladly in this horrific revival.", "date": "2010-01-15", "grade": "6.8"}
