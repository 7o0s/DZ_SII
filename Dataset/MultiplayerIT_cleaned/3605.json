{"name": "Rescue Wings! la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rescue-wings-recensione.html", "text": "Scruffy's life proceeds as quiet as that of any dog of a certain age, in the comfortable doghouse at the small airport dedicated to the forest firefighting team, at least until the alarm goes off. Having to deal with an obviously narcoleptic master, he must then take the initiative and, having jumped into the cockpit of the plane, take care to extinguish the threat with a good dose of water bombs. That's right: the heroic protagonist of the game, an airplane pilot specialized in extinguishing fires, is Scruffy the Dog in this new PlayStack title for mobile platforms. Although it is a purely casual game and designed specifically for touch screen devices, some expert players could find in Rescue Wings!, the protagonist of this review, even suggestions from the past, which highlight how the game appeals to ancient dynamics rather than referring to the passing fashions of mobile titles and this is undoubtedly a positive thing. At first glance it may come natural to think of that old game that was Wings of Fury by Brderbund Software, or even the ancient Scramble by Konami in the dynamics of the ~bombardment~. It's just about sensations, but they give the idea of a game that, if nothing else, is linked to a more classic tradition than usual while offering mechanics very much in line with casual games for mobile platforms. It is a side-scrolling action where we have to control a fire-fighting plane using four simple commands corresponding to the keys on the screen: climb, dive, acceleration and release of the water bombs, making the control system easy to manage with the touch screen but without trivialize flight, which must be constantly monitored so as not to crash into the ground or the obstacles found in the scenarios. Beyond the fact of maintaining altitude and direction, the elements of difficulty are provided by the need to have to load the tank with real dives into the water and to focus the fires precisely. Flying dog life Rescue Wings contains three main game modes: two single player modes consisting of Levels and Adventure and one competitive multiplayer. The mechanics of the game are always the same, that is to fly the plane by loading the water tanks and then unloading them with the greatest possible precision on the fires, being careful not to crash and avoiding the various obstacles present. The organization of the scenarios and events changes a bit: the Levels offer a simple succession of different settings, in each of which it is necessary to put out a certain number of fires, trying to eliminate them all to get the maximum score and unlock the next stages . The Adventure has substantially the same structure but offers a sort of unique setting made up of different scenarios placed in sequence, without a solution of continuity. In practice, you start from the airport and try to get as far as possible, discovering new paths and environments and unlocking new landmarks that open access to further levels. In this case we are dealing with a rather honest free-to-play game: the game can be downloaded for free and all the contents can be unlocked simply by proceeding inside it, with the only limitation provided by fuel consumption at every game. Each single attempt requires 5 units of fuel and considering that the maximum quantity is 30, it is clear how easy it is to quickly reach the end of the reserves. Recharging is achieved by simply waiting but it is also possible to watch an advertisement to immediately get the possibility of rejoining the game and this is an option that can also be used to restart from the exact point where we crashed (without having to start all over again ) or get coins and bonuses. The coins are mainly used to purchase new planes and to customize them but the idea is that there is no real push towards the compulsive purchase of micro-transactions and that the greatest annoyance is the need to see some advertising: not really the worst monetization system seen so far, honestly.", "date": "2019-07-04", "grade": "7.8"}
