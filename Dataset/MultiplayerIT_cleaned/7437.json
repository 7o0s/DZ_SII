Even with several names of medium-high value, the launches of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 both lacked the aforementioned blockbuster, leaving the simple desire for next gen to drive sales, which has now reached the highest levels. In such a scenario, how interesting can it actually be for the same user to find a game already released on the PlayStation 3 PSN at the beginning of 2009 in the catalog of the new Sony console? Flower is a unique and unforgettable non-game that deserves to be tried All in one hour The question is far too tied to personal tastes to be able to give a simple answer; what is certain is that Flower by Thatgamecompany (those of Flow and Journey) was by far one of the most interesting exclusives that appeared in the PlayStation 3 online store, which is why finding it also on the newcomer of the Japanese house can only be a pleasure . Especially if, thanks to a correct and intelligent marketing choice, the title was offered for free download to anyone who had already purchased it in its first release, also including the PlayStation Vita edition in the cross-buy offer: a single spending to have three versions available therefore, obviously with the option of exploiting a single common save thanks to the appropriate option of the PlayStation Plus. Having to buy it for the first time however, the price remains  7.99. Describing Flower is exceptionally simple and complicated at the same time: the concept is in fact basic to say the least, as is the gameplay. The overall longevity is then very poor, to the point that an hour or so is enough to get to see the final credits. So how can a product with these contents get such a positive rating? The reason is that the intensity and beauty of that miserable hour, what it will leave in the hearts and memories of players sensitive enough to appreciate it, is such as to justify at least every penny spent. The theme on which the project is based is the ecological one, with the finger pointed towards the villainous work of man who, regardless of respect for nature, with the palaces and buildings of the city makes everything grey, dull, sad. The player, on the other hand, plays the role of that nature so offended and outraged, who however finds the way to reaffirm his own strength precisely against iron and concrete; specifically, the dual shock allows, through its inclination, to manage the direction of the wind, which has always been a metaphor for renewal, which with its delicate energy pushes the petals. At first very few, then more and more, to the point of generating an authentic trail of colors and (probably) scents that restore life to their passage. Playing Flower therefore means abstracting from the dynamics and logic of ~commercial~ video games and agreeing to take part in a sensory journey, in which eyes and ears enjoy the continuous and extraordinary show offered by the artists of Thatgamecompany. There are no menus, indicators, enemies or superstructures, none of this: all you have to do is ~fly~ within the settings making flowers blossom as you pass by, bringing life, light, wind, rebirth within 6 levels (plus a final one linked to the credits), each associated with a different flower placed on an anonymous windowsill. Flower's Zen experience is therefore essentially a journey, in which the value of entertainment as such takes on a less precise and definable sense, supplanted by the emotional trace left along the way. Obviously, in all this, the audio accompaniment also assumes enormous importance, composed of an exceptional dynamic soundtrack by Vincent Diamante: every action, every blossoming flower adds a chord, a note, giving life to a melody that becomes an essential element of the inside of the package. As far as the passage on PlayStation 4 is concerned, there are no content additions but rather technical refinements, which in practice translate into an image at 1080p and 60 frames per second capable of expressing the value in an even better and more convincing way of Thatgamecompany's work. On PlayStation Vita, however, the downsizing in this sense is inevitable, albeit not to the extent that it affects the pleasure of the experience; among other things, on the Sony laptop, the possibility of choosing between two control systems is offered, with one being basedto on the motion sensor and the other - less effective - on the touch screen.", "date": "2013-12-02", "grade": "8.8"}
