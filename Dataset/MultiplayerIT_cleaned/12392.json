{"name": "Ghost Rider - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-rider-recensione.html", "text": "Even devils cry Right from the start, Ghost Rider reveals itself to be strongly inspired by the Devil May Cry saga: the character fights using chains (in this we could see a bit of God of War...), a rifle and an infinite series of more or less devastating and spectacular, within locations that have the sole purpose of hosting fights against demons and infernal creatures of all kinds. These settings (and here we see the main reference to the Capcom product) boast small dimensions and are framed in a particular way from the game's viewpoint, with music that starts every time enemies appear and a passage that ~unblocks~ at the end of the battles  and allows Ghost Rider to access the next area, complete with a distorted vortex effect to represent the closure of the stage. The game mechanic is clear in its linearity: the character enters a new area, enemies appear (which vary in type, number and capabilities depending on the level) and you fight until they are all eliminated, then you proceed further . In Ghost Rider there are no puzzles and the map that can be accessed from the pause menu is purely accessory, where it is not difficult to understand where to go, also because most of the stages are designed to be a ~circuit~: you continue up to a certain point, then you go back. To break the monotony of this pattern, the developers have included a large number of ~driving~ sessions, in which the character gets on board his infernal motorbike and has to make his way through enemies and obstacles to get to the place where the events will be held. subsequent fights. These phases turn out to be profoundly different in gameplay compared to the ~action~ sessions, given that you need to have quick reflexes for jumps, ~slides~ and anything else that allows us to overcome the traps placed along the way unscathed. The Spirit of Vengeance The game is divided into five large ~chapters~, made up of thirty stages in all, and at the end of each chapter there is the inevitable fight with the bosses, in this case taken from the pages of the Ghost Rider comics rather than from the movie. Taking into account that each chapter takes three or four hours to complete, the result is a duration longer than the average action game. What's more, completing the game unlocks new characters with which to tackle the whole adventure afresh: Blade (the character played on the big screen by Wesley Snipes), Vengeance (Ghost Rider's nemesis), Ghost Rider in version 2099 and Ghost Rider in ~classic~ version. In the case of the black vampire slayer, we won't have any super moves at our disposal, but only the sword and martial arts... The combat system in the game works well and is really rich in variations, complete with numerous upgrade possibilities: by eliminating enemies, you collect luminous elements which you can then spend through the ~Upgrade~ item of the pause menu. At that juncture we will be able to buy not only numerous new combos, but also a whole series of extras: comics, photos, drawings and video interviews with the developers. The Square and Triangle buttons correspond respectively to the light (chain) and heavy (punches) attack, and their combined pressure gives rise to the combos, as already mentioned, very numerous. The X button is used for jumping, whereas the Circle is used as an ~action key~ but also for grappling. The back buttons activate the Ring of Fire (a powerful smart bomb), the ~punishment mode~ (a kind of bullet time in which it is possible to eliminate an enemy by devouring him in hellish flames), the shotgun (whose shots depend on the bar of mystical energy) and parrying, essential as soon as the difficulty starts to climb. The execution of the combos is rewarded with bonuses, and sometimes this procedure is not purely aesthetic but serves to break the magical barriers that surround certain opponents. During motorcycle sessions, the back buttons are used to accelerate and brake, use the boost and slide, while the central buttons allow us to shoot fire projectiles, hit left and right with the chain and jump. Technical realization Ghost Rider's graphics are well done, if far from perfect. On the one hand there is a very well done protagonist, for which animations have not been skimped given the enormous amount of combos and special moves. The enemies you fight don't have a very inspired design, but they are varied and well animated. The settings, due to a choice of the developers, have an aspect of clear fantasy inspiration and therefore deviate from the urban scenarios that certainly are not lacking in the film; just think that we start from the infernal prisons and sOnly after a while does it return to the surface. The ~crooked~ shots in some areas are very interesting and contribute to the general atmosphere. The only flaw in Ghost Rider's graphics, unfortunately not just that, lies in the effectiveness of the graphics engine, unable to guarantee a constant frame rate as soon as the screen gets crowded. To this must be added a small bug that ~moves~ our character a few meters during the fights, but which fortunately occurs very rarely. As far as the driving sessions are concerned, the situation is very different and unfortunately the quality drops a lot: the scenarios flow without defects in the polygonal construction, but are decidedly anonymous and inhabited by even more anonymous enemies, which the particular ~racist~ nature does not allow to value at all. The sound sector is average: the effects are functional and do their job well, while the music has difficulty getting noticed except when the enemies appear: in that case the same song is repeated (another reference to DMC). The dubbing in Italian is done very well, but unfortunately it is mixed very badly: you have to turn up the volume a lot to hear it during the narrative sequences, while fortunately there are no problems for the sentences spoken by Ghost Rider during the fights. Comment Ghost Rider is an action game with clear Capcomian inspirations, and it's more than we expected from the movie tie-in. Taking into account the fact that this Marvel character is certainly not among the most popular in Italy, it is obvious that the qualities of the game have not been ~amplified~ in the eyes of the writer: beyond the good technical realization, the new product developed by Climax Studios is very solid, long-lived and with spectacular moments. If some different solution had been found for the sections on motorcycles, unfortunately mediocre, we could have recommended this title to a greater number of people. Do you know Ghost Rider and do you like Devil May Cry style games? Well, most likely you will enjoy the dozens of combos that this tie-in offers you. We are not dealing with a perfect product, but it is certainly a nice surprise. Pros: Good technical realization Very solid and long-lived Numerous and spectacular combos Cons: Uncertain graphics engine Low speech volume in cutscenes Mediocre motion sections On the occasion of the release of the film ~Ghost Rider~, 2K Games entrusts Climax Studios with the development of a tie-in that takes its cue from the film to tell the adventures of one of Marvel's darkest characters. And so we will take on the role of Johnny Blaze, a ~stunt biker~ who makes a pact with the devil to protect his loved ones: in exchange, he will have to host the Spirit of Vengeance in his body and carry out Mephisto's orders.
