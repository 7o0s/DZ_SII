{"name": "DARQ: Complete Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darq-complete-edition-recensione.html", "text": "With the review of DARQ: Complete Edition on PlayStation 5 we rediscover, at the same time, a decidedly disturbing and also quite amusing title. Unfortunately also one of those games that failed to get noticed by the general public, not immediately, engulfed by the myriad of productions that land on PC and consoles every month. It must be said that DARQ needed its time: developed by the independent team Unfold Games (of which it represents the first title ever) it first arrived on PC in the summer of 2019, then in December 2020 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Finally, these days it has finally landed on next gen consoles and also on Nintendo Switch; the process has therefore been completed. The good thing is that all those who arrived late will now be able to enjoy it in the best edition, both in terms of quality and content (it is a complete edition, after all, and we will explain why). Plot: dreams, darkness The narrative of DARQ: Complete Edition is very cryptic and proceeds by notable analog leaps, however the title does not lack a plot; the developers of Unfold Games were the ones who provided the (few) main coordinates. We know, for example, that the protagonist is called Lloyd, a slightly creepy boy (~creepy~ is an adjective that will come in particularly useful in this review) who experiences adventures bordering on the paranormal within his own dreams. The fact is that Lloyd is aware that these are dreams, just as he is aware that each new dream quickly turns into a nightmare. And that from this nightmare he will have to flee, in order to be able to return home. DARQ: Complete Edition and its perspective shifts The main adventure is divided into seven different levels, each corresponding to a dream of Lloyd. Piece by piece, some key points of the narrative become clearer, a bit like in Little Nightmares (the influences of the first chapter of the series on Unfold Games are clear). But, given the surreal tones of the context and the evident symbolism of objects and scenarios, it must be somewhat the player to reconstruct the key points of Lloyd's story. The writer has obviously made an idea of it, based on certain enemies that are shown in the various levels; and above all following the last moments of the ending of the main adventure. We cannot anticipate any of this unfortunately, because we would ruin the gaming experience for you; among other things DARQ: Complete Edition is already very short on its own (a game night is enough to complete it, two or three hours at the most) and it would be cruel to reveal what you will encounter. DARQ: Complete Edition: to solve puzzles you will have to interact with objects However, the advice we want to give you is the following: while you try to understand how to continue, appreciate the various details of the levels. Every element, every embellishment, every detail, is never there by accident in DARQ: Complete Edition; while it is not related to the gameplay, it is related to the main narrative, and can provide you with an interesting interpretation of Lloyd's dream experience. Gameplay DARQ: Complete Edition: Nothing is as it seems Don't be fooled by the labels that mark it, for example, on Steam: DARQ: Complete Edition, before even re-entering ~action~ and ~adventure~, presents the gameplay of an exquisite puzzle. Completing individual levels means finding a way to get to the exit before it's... too late. To do this, you'll have to sharpen your wits in a very creative way, experimenting with combinations of objects and various mechanisms. Sometimes this is easy (a key must be used on a lock, yes), other times a little less, especially in the later levels. Almost all the environmental puzzles present are well thought out: just a couple of them seemed excessively frustrating or unbalanced to the writer; but these were cases in which anxiety was also the host, due to various threats that were coming at great speed towards us. Overall, the level of difficulty, among other things, is never prohibitive: DARQ: Complete Edition is a perfect title for both the youngest and the most elderly, and manages to amaze everyone. DARQ: Complete Edition, one of the creepiest scenes Another interesting element in the gameplay of DARQ: Complete Edition consists in the possibility of changing perspective and shots, thus altering the possibilities offered by the individual levels at the same time. Are you unable to take a certain road because it is inaccessible? Try changing the view 180 degrees with that lever over there. Other times what changes are the levels of depth of the level or the gravity that imposes Lloyd's movements; but in general the protagonistssta is still able to walk up walls and ceilings as if nothing had happened. After all, she moves in dreams, not in the real world. Or not? The PlayStation 5 version DARQ: Complete Edition has more than just home or city environments to offer A few words should also be spent on the PlayStation 5 version of DARQ: Complete Edition, which offers something more than what has already been seen elsewhere in less recent times (on PC, on PlayStation 4, on Xbox One) and more recently (on Nintendo Switch ). Basically, the big difference is being able to choose between cinematic mode (4K and 30fps) and performance mode (1800p but with 60fps). Our advice is to opt for the latter, given that the general glance is still satisfied even at 1800p: 4K is not necessary to fully enjoy the atmosphere of DARQ (just imagine, then, that for most of the time you will find yourself in the dark). In addition to this, in terms of content, the title also includes two additional levels previously available only through optional purchase: the tower and the crypt; they are very valid, because they propose further experiments from the point of view of the game mechanics, and they also enrich Lloyd's story a little. Finally, support for DualSense, which we actually didn't even notice: and this says a lot about how much it has been exploited by developers.", "date": "2021-03-30", "grade": "7.8"}
