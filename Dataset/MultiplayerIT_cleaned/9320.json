{"name": "Il lato oscuro della genetica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87895-darkspore-il-lato-oscuro-della-genetica.html", "text": "The formula ~Spore meets Diablo~ represents a rather apt summary of the genesis of Darkspore. But the new Maxis title is not a simple mix of things already seen. In fact, although even with respect to the general feeling the inspiration seems to come directly from Starcraft, the 25 unlockable characters, each with three further evolutions, allow you to experiment with dozens of different combos thanks to the possibility of mixing dozens of skills and components in different ways. In addition, the gameplay is both slower and more rational but also richer with dozens of abilities that are unleashed at the same time and include pets, teleports, stuns, meteors, projectiles, energy orbs, electromagnetic shields and even the ability to launch missiles. Obviously also the Spore element, linked to the customization of the characters, changes the cards on the table compared to the classic hack & slash recipe, and Darkspore also brings another novelty since it allows you to choose at any time which of the three characters to use the player can lead on missions. This kind of genetic tag team allows you to put a wounded creature on the ~bench~ and heal it by finding healing cells with the other, and it also further amplifies the game possibilities by introducing synergies between creatures that include special group skills. Genetics, you can do anything with it Each creature has a basic attack, a unique ability, a variable, a passive and a group with which it is possible to create sequences. The basic attack and the passive ability are always available while the other powers use genetic energy which, as underlined by the blue color of the bar placed under the health bar, is nothing more than the classic mana and like health it is rechargeable with power ups dropped by the monsters we've slaughtered. Our creatures are divided into three main branches that can focus on strength, dexterity or mind. Each creature can have pets, wield melee weapons, use missile launchers, be more resistant, faster and obviously can evolve both thanks to the addition of advanced genetic components. Furthermore, the title implements an alternative inventory which initially has only three free slots, but can be expanded and contains the catalysts. Particular genetic enhancers, these, of spherical shape that we find in the form of loot and which give further bonuses such as speed of movement, damage, effectiveness of cures, reduction of damage suffered, decrease in the effect time of the powers used by enemies on us and so saying. But the main evolution of the character is linked to the Spore system that allows you to change different parts of the body of our genetic heroes with better ~components~ that require DNA points; and this can be found by crushing musts and destroying plants and living elements. And we have to destroy plenty of them since DNA points are never enough and they are necessary to ~assemble~ the genetic improvements collected in the missions and thus boost the level of the creatures which is essential to face the next stage. The potential of the creatures must in fact be adequate to the challenge given that energy and mana do not recharge automatically and therefore it is not possible to wait for regeneration and to face each situation as if it were separate from the others. Furthermore, careful management of progress allows you to tackle two missions in a row and this allows you to obtain higher quality objects upon completion of the assignment. In short, Darkspore is rich and refined but has another surprise in store to distinguish itself from the competition. In fact, for truly desperate situations there is another resource and it is the Overdrive. This bonus is a sort of ~fury~ which is charged by inflicting a mortal blow on an enemy and which, when activated, also allows for a few seconds to take half damage, increase attack speed, decrease skill cooldowns and pump passive bonuses The result is an extremely powerful and useful boost both for getting by in the midst of a particularly violent horde and in front of bosses capable of inflicting huge damage. Although it is not an element related to the gameplay, the new Maxis title also maintains part of the major peculiarity of Spore or the possibility of altering the shapes of our creatures. Unfortunately, the possibilities of manipulating the form are lower, given the needs related to the different type of combat that would go unbalanced by radically changing the proportions of the creatures, but they are still many. Furthermore, there are dozens of skins and even more numerous components to be equipped for an enviable level of customization, including aesthetics. Genetically manipulated hack & slash imgalso the enemies have their own skills, resistances and must be faced taking into account the peculiarities they show off among which we also find the carapace, which makes them very resistant to beatings, or nice abilities such as the one that allows them to suck us in the middle of a ravenous horde. And this eventuality can turn out to be quite dramatic if at that moment we find ourselves using a creature that is vulnerable and specialized in ranged attacks. But that's not all. In addition to sporting a variety of standard powers, some opponents also possess special defenses that allow them to become indestructible, perhaps by releasing poisonous gases, or to teleport. And the question becomes even more thorny in the case of the end-of-level bosses, the inevitable bad guys that we find waiting for us at the end of several missions. The latter are not only robust and evil but are also endowed with spectacular abilities and focused on science and genetics, which allow them to replicate over and over again, to create electromagnetic vortexes and to perform many other devastating acts aimed at sweeping us away from creation. As for the difficulty, the title is clearly inspired by Diablo, with sudden hordes of monsters, often placed at the end of the picture and underlined by an alarm, and with three difficulty levels to be unlocked gradually and all necessary to climb the steep peak of the evolution. Obviously, with the increase in difficulty, the quality of the objects dropped by the monsters also rises and the last levels reach such a difficulty as to make an alliance with other players advisable, in order to have offensive power and cures at the same time. In fact, Darkspore too, like any self-respecting hack & slash, is developed around the 4-player cooperative mode which further increases the already complex interactions between skills and powers. As in other titles of the genre, the increase in players also increases the degree of challenge of the opponents but consequently the gains in terms of DNA points and objects also increase, making the cooperative mode rather inviting. Thankfully, supporting online play is a complex infrastructure that capitalizes on the experience of others by introducing contextual chat, functional matchmaking, and comprehensive profiles that showcase the player's creatures. Furthermore, there is the classic PVP that allows you to organize 1vs1 and 2vs2 matches and requires the millimetric use of the characters' skills, giving particular importance to those that stun or incapacitate the opponent. In this case, the apt use of the three creatures is essential and it is necessary to respond adequately to the heroes used by the opponent so as not to be too vulnerable, perhaps being too far from a ranged fighter using a slow one like a sloth. Among other things, the tactical potential of Darkspore is also increased by the duration of the clashes which, thanks to the three creatures and the defense skills, are significantly longer than those of the classic hack & slash. Plastic surgery for space monsters From an aesthetic point of view, Darkspore certainly does not aim to outperform the competition. The destructible elements are rare, the structures are anonymous and the polygonal mass of the backgrounds is rather small. But the settings are several and range from planets on the way to collapse to snowy territories passing through jungles and forests. Furthermore, there is no shortage of refined elements that are capable of diverting attention from the less cared for ones. The alien pavements are crossed by flashes of light, the poisonous roots pulsate, the blood glitters in large patches and black holes and suggestive visuals sometimes appear in the background. The creatures used by the player are made with care and customization allows us to bring each genetic hero closer to our aesthetic tastes. The models are quite refined and are enriched by defined and animated textures that are gradually enriched thanks to the elements applied by the player to his entourage of genetic heroes. Furthermore, each creature, including monsters, is outlined with a light but decisive Cel Shading effect which, by refraining from zooming excessively, increases the perceived definition. The graphics therefore more than poor is optimized and designed to underline the light effects and above all the living beings that represent the heart of the action. But Darkspore also offers an outline that includes a laboratory, a bridge and, right inside the latter, a screen used to show us the suggestive cutscenes and the spread of the dark spore. To underline everything we find a suggestive soundtrack with an unmistakable sci-fi flavor that in certain situations closely resembles the envelopsnti sonorities of the Vangelis. And as icing on the cake, the sound sector presents us with the inevitable robotic-like female voice which has an indispensable appeal even though it is now a clich in productions set in space.", "date": "2011-04-27", "grade": "8.0"}
