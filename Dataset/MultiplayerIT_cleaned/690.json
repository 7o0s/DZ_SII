{"name": "True Crime: New York City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/true-crime-new-york-city.html", "text": "Marcus is now a clean man, a new life awaits him. ~The game's deep and varied gameplay will take gamers into New York City's slums, from apartment buildings to subways and virtually experience the city in a way never before seen in a video game,~ said Will Kassoy, vice president of Global Brand Management at Activision . We find it hard to believe him, judging the work of the Luxoflux developers in the chapter released in 2003 set in Los Angeles. In that game, the virtual space extended from the beaches of Santa Monica and Venice Beach to the hills of Hollywood, obviously passing between the skyscrapers of Downtown. Activision has decided to abandon the West Coast scenario with this sequel looking for another location that had more charm: the Big Apple, New York. Controversial, cosmopolitan city, which unlike Los Angeles does not grow horizontally but vertically, with its very high buildings and its underground slums, between subways and underground clubs. Even the incipit of the story has been better cared for, the protagonist is called Marcus and at the beginning he finds himself entangled in a settlement of accounts with the Boss Isaiah, eager to kill him and his father to take control of the criminal affairs of the area. Activision has decided to leave the unexciting West Coast scenario looking for another location with more charm: the Big Apple, New York Marcus' father dies, but the boy fortunately manages to survive thanks to the help of a policeman. The scene suddenly shifts to five years ahead, where Marcus finally has a ~clean~ life and has entered the police force, perhaps precisely because no one knows the streets of the city better than him. The cut scenes and the story are well done and manage to immerse the player much more than what happened with the prequel. What then of prequel it is not because the two stories are completely unrelated and Activision has not added any suffix ~2~ in front of the title, just to demonstrate the desire to create a series of releases on a strong brand. The street cop never gets bored The world recreated around Marcus has an incredible verisimilitude. Starting from the police station, where everyone works, gets busy, trains. There's a shooting range, a track to learn how to drive a car properly, our personal locker. Once the short tutorial is complete, which is fun for once, the door of the police station opens and we take to the streets of the Big Apple. The best thing about True Crime: New York is the recreation of life as a street cop. Just like in the chapter ~Los Angeles~, walking through the city or driving through its streets, the crimes that will happen to us will be multiple, constant, numerous and above all varied. True Crime, from this point of view, is not boring. We go from the madman who wants to kill a hostage, to the bandit who carries out a robbery, to the car thief, the fisticuffs on the street between rival gangs, and so on and so forth. Of course, there's a main thread that you can follow between cases, and that's obviously the classic theme of revenge. Revenge against the Boss Isaiah who killed our father. During the game it will be necessary to infiltrate some criminal gangs in order to arrest the culprits. The best thing about True Crime: New York is the recreation of life as a street cop. For example, it is possible to take part in clandestine car races, which generally take place in certain parts of the suburbs at night, or it will be necessary to participate in some boxing match. The good thing is that all of it is fun and satisfying. Much more than the main game and story, which all rely on a tried and abused scheme: interrogate a witness, go to the criminal, kill everyone who protects him and arrest him. Cyclically. For this reason the ~sub quests~ of True Crime, which should be the companion of the game, turn out to be a nice lifesaver for the fun it manages to create, ending up becoming the first course. Probably playing in a normal way, taking into account the main story in a marginal way, the title is more enjoyable and satisfying. If, on the contrary, we focus on the plot, True Crime will end up becoming a very short and not very varied title. But this obviously depends on the gamer's approach. Being a ~GTA style~ title, however, it is probable that we will spend most of the time on the street trying to get to some crime scene, relegating the storyline to the background. New methods implemented...how? The new True Crime has some good thinking. For example after catching a crimfinal, you will be allowed to question him in your office. And if she won't sing along, rest assured she will spit out some information, but through the trees. When the interrogation starts, a bar with a colored part appears at the top of the screen. Our goal is to make the bar cursor go over the highlighted part at least three times. And this through a combination of actions, including the threat (pointing the gun at the criminal), and mocking, hitting our element with the butt of the weapon. The problem lies entirely in the difficulty of execution: very simple. You will rarely be wrong. Too bad because the gimmick wasn't bad, and with a little more challenge the interrogation would have been more compelling. If the test goes wrong and the criminal does not reveal anything to continue the story we should go and talk to some of our personal informants. Another innovation of ~New York~ lies in the aiming methods. Also in this chapter of True Crime our character will be able to have a moral alignment as a good or as a villain. In addition to precision aiming, which slows down time and gives you all the convenience of hitting the target, others have been implemented. One locks the target by pressing the left trigger, to GTA, another instead allows you to move freely while the character is involved in a shootout, in full Max Payne style. There is no universal aiming method but it will be up to us to choose the best one depending on the situation. To block a runaway car, for example, we can choose to puncture its tire with precision aiming, or riddle it with bullets until the vehicle stops. Also in this chapter of True Crime our character will be able to have a moral alignment as a good or as a villain. In stealth phases, for example, it is possible to stun an enemy or break his neck. Likewise, the killing of innocent civilians affects our reputation. Locations and Soundtrack Despite the innovations introduced, True Crime partially fails in the attempt to give a fresh and new gaming experience. The game is very similar to its predecessor, which we remember came out two years ago. True Crime: New York is a game that never takes big risks, resulting in a title with already seen gameplay already in its second appearance. The new location, New York, which according to the developers was chosen as more inspired than Los Angeles, personally is not fully convincing. The game map is huge, and manages to perfectly and maniacally create all of Manhattan, but in the end we find ourselves constantly playing in the midst of buildings, buildings, buildings. Where Los Angeles offers appreciable panorama glimpses and more varied locations: the beaches, the city, the hill, the tidy houses of Beverly Hills. True Crime has therefore taken an ~urban~ turn that can be liked but also boring. The quality of the technical realization of the city is controversial. On the one hand, the significant effort to recreate such a complex world is appreciable, on the other, the frame rate undermines its charm in a destructive way. On PlayStation2 the refresh rarely hits 30fps. In driving sessions, and especially in racing sessions, the jerkiness of the images can offend the most sensitive. True Crime has therefore taken an ~urban~ turn that can be liked but also boring The streets of New York are in fact much more ~alive~, they have been filled with passers-by, people, garbage, flying newspapers, cars. Using the same old graphics engine, it is easy to understand that the polygonal weighting negatively affects the fluidity of the whole. Much better fluidity for the Xbox counterpart, which enjoys more effects and lights, for example on the car bodies. The audio sector is instead impeccable, one of the best of the genre. Ranging from Hip-Hop with Run D.M.C., Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and LL Cool J, to R'n'B, Rock, Pop with the most varied groups and artists, including Public Enemy, Bob Dylan , Ramones, Sonic Youth, Blondie, Biohazard, Iggy Pop, White Zombie, Velvet Underground and so on and so forth. The whole audio sector is well cared for, starting from the music and effects, up to the Hollywood dubbing. True Crime New York is a more controversial title than the previous chapter. If ~Los Angeles~ had brought some fresh air to the genre, the same cannot be said about this chapter. The additions to the gameplay, the more accurate story and the improved controls are appreciable, while Luxoflux should have concentrated more on the development of a new graphics engine, worthy of a title released at the end of 2005 and on the slightly low level of challenge . True Crime therefore bets everything on the citywhich is set, in the variety of situations and in the characterization of our character, Marcus. Perhaps too little given the ambition of the project. Pros: Large play area. Welcome improvements to controls. Excellent sound. Cons: Low frame rate on PlayStation2. Monotonous setting. Cross-platform While the PlayStation2 version suffers from annoying problems that are difficult to overcome on a technical level, which above all undermine the enjoyment of the sessions on foot and those driving the car, the Xbox counterpart from this point of view instead seems like another title, with a much more convincing. True Crime is a very ambitious project. Ambitious enough to make Activision invest dizzying figures, a round of money from a Hollywood mega-production involving the internal Luxoflux team and a stellar voice cast with Laurence Fishbourne, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken. After the moderate success of the first chapter, ~Streets of Los Angeles~, it seems that Activision wants to improve True Crime even more by trying to bring it to levels of absolute excellence, have they succeeded?", "date": "2005-12-16", "grade": null}
