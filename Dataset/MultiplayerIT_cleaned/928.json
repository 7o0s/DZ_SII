{"name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2-battle-nexus.html", "text": "Between game and cartoon The presentation of Turtles 2: Battle Nexus, like the visual aspect in general, is very colorful and dynamic and reflects the feeling of the cartoon, with omnipresent recited voices and discreetly made electronic music that keep the rhythm high while browsing the options. The style is cartoonish, in perfect continuity with the animated films and with a cel shading that goes well with settings sometimes equipped with excellent textures, but at the same time extremely sparse (and without the possibility of decently maneuvering the camera, which would have benefited the 'graphic impact). Overall, the aesthetic presentation is very bare. Animated cutscenes intersperse all levels, which branch out in multiple directions on the N.Y. map. City and beyond, presenting the player with the choice of the order of missions. The game consists entirely of a series of repeated attacks - now frantic, now more or less targeted - against the swarms of robotic and mutant enemies who move to assault the turtles. Exactly what is required of a ~classic~ genre of bitmap graphics consoles and which is being tried to re-propose in the era of solid polygons, but in the case of Battle Nexus the attacks, while discrete in variety, are too repetitive in terms of gameplay: whether it's a weak, strong, jumping, special, shuriken or haste shot, little changes in terms of interaction with enemies. In this second episode - new - it is possible to change characters in real time (even if the energy bar remains in common), accessing different skills: lifting heavy objects, unlocking electronic barriers, and so on. This presupposes a certain degree of interaction with the environment, which however does not go beyond the rapid - and often useless - character change on the fly; or, at most, the interaction with some element of the background. The sporadic platform elements are the weakest point of the interaction: the jumps, even the double and wall ones, are very inaccurate and risk making the sections in which they are used hateful. The game thus presents itself with its own precise economy: kill everyone and wait for the new animated film. As for extras, during the levels, defeating enemies leads to their inclusion in a database, while collecting certain bonuses allows you to accumulate ~antiquities~ to get bonuses in the antique shop section. From the hiding place of the turtles, located on the map, it is possible to access these bonuses and others, such as the artwork - very sparse and low definition, as well as in two dimensions and non-rotatable. The most important bonus is the presence of the Turtles-inspired arcade classic, in an emulated and perfectly playable version: which not only constitutes the greatest push to continue, but although it is not a perfect game, it is greatly regretted when you return to that of 2005. Battle Nexus is clearly a product intended for a very young audience, sensitive to the new animated series of ninja turtles: it is therefore very simple and is based entirely on the ~playability~ of the cartoon, completely interspersed and merged with the game. It is true that even children (who, incidentally, are more skilled players than adults in ninety percent of cases) tend to get bored if repeatedly subjected to the usual soup and with imprecise supervision, which risks boring and discouraging in the face of missions that become difficult only for loopholes in the control system. In short, the turtles will also still have great charm, but in Battle Nexus you have less fun than with the action figures, and the greatest attraction remains the emulated arcade of the late eighties to unlock. Pros A beater suitable for a very young audience Feeling almost like a cartoon B-movie retains its charm Some nice extras, especially the emulated classic arcade Cons Very repetitive, as well as disarmingly easy The same shots are always fired, it jumps badly here and there Every now and then a frustration takes over for control and cel shaded environments okay, bare and empty no Strictly in cel-shading and combined with the animated series, Turtles 2: Battle Nexus is a very simple and linear three-dimensional beater, without any great pretension and specifically designed to entertain an audience of young and very young gamers. The latter will be more attracted by the charm of the characters than by the promises of a thoroughbred fighting game gameplay. And, in fact, this second chapter inspired by the new adventures of the most popular freak turtles of the eighties can be considered little more than an interactive extension of the animated series. Animated interludes and characters aside, his formula doesn't go beyond a few attacks on diarrangement, elementary interactions with the environment and a completely faithful presentation of the cartoon line. Compared to the first episode, Battle Nexus adds some gameplay elements, tournament-style modes and some pleasant additions such as the possibility of replaying the Konami-branded hall classic, the famous scrolling 2d fighting game from the late 80s. With the first episode, Battle Nexus continues to share limits in the control and interaction system and a strong repetitiveness: after a weekend of tests and the animated sequences, and provided you don't get bored because of the game design flaws, no child would tend to keep it in the collection.", "date": "2005-05-31", "grade": null}
