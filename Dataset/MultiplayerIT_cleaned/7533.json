{"name": "The Inner World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/124566-the-inner-world-fino-alla-foce-del-vento.html", "text": "The Inner World is the first graphic adventure by Studio Fizbin which has cut its teeth with minor projects to date. There's no denying: as a start it's excellent. And once again we have to note that these are German developers, who more than many others are contributing to the success of a genre that has managed to survive in over twenty years by always offering the same form of game. Today developers try to make it take new paths; think for example of Gone Home or the recent The Wolf Among Us, but Studio Fizbin shows us that it is not necessary to overturn the gameplay to amaze. Honest, artfully illustrated stories filled with engaging puzzles continue to draw legions of loyal gamers to their mouse and keyboard. One of these stories is told by The Inner World. The first aspect that struck us is obviously the graphic style. The hand-drawn drawings are illustrations escaped from a children's book and, at least to us, they immediately reminded us of Altan's Pimpa. Over time we realize that the choice is not random; Robert, the protagonist of The Inner World is a naive young man, who grew up under the close supervision of the Abbot Conroy. In fact, his story begins in a trivial way, in pursuit of a pigeon that had ~stolen~ the precious medallion of his mentor and master. Rushed into the world through a waste duct, Robert meets the much more dismal Laura and, in an attempt to help her find her missing father, opens her eyes to the reality of life, becoming an adult and ready for love ( which coincides with Laura's heart). Not only the characters, with that singularly long nose - Robert's is even an ocarina - but also the world in which they live is an explosion of fantasy. Imagine Asposia, a planet enclosed within a crust from which the wind blows strongly through three craters. A magical wind, which supplies energy essential to life. When Robert's journey begins, this energy source is almost exhausted and the Basylians, divine creatures who petrify people, roam near the craters. In this twilight climate, Abbot Conroy speaks of sin and divine justice and proposes himself as the only guide for the Asposians. But can we really trust him? And above all, why has Robert been held prisoner since he was a child? Start by hunting down that pigeon and you will come to have all the answers. Nostalgia for denied childhood and discovery of love in the great adventure of The Inner World Use your head, Robert The Inner World is told in five chapters. The puzzles gradually become more complex but always remain within the reach of almost all players; only once were we sidetracked by a snippet of original text peeking out under the new graphics needed to contain the English adaptation. However, there is a help system that we can consult, whether we want a small suggestion or are looking for an explicit indication on what to do. In short, it is impossible to block. Beyond the complexity, we really liked how the puzzles were inserted into the game and the fact that we often had to imagine how one object could replace another, for example crystal powder instead of flour; a stimulating and satisfying exercise in the imagination. You don't even need to walk around too much to understand how the puzzles are solved because each chapter consists of a maximum of four or five screens. Yet the number of actions that must be performed in each scenario is impressive; a busyness worthy of old Gobliiins. Sometimes there is a well-defined obstacle and it is enough to use a little logic to understand the chain of steps necessary to remove it. In other cases we have to focus on the first problem at hand and start from there. However, once you have taken the right path, it is easy to continue to the end of the chapter without getting lost. Every element of the game has been designed to make life easier for the player. Even the topics of the dialogues are indicated with nice images instead of sentences. Unfortunately this system forces you to click on each topic several times waiting to get to the point of the question and you often get the impression that speaking is a task to be performed rather than a pleasure. However, this does not affect the quality of the dialogues. But we talk about this in the next paragraph. There is a sense in all this The exchanges between the characters, as well as Robert's solitary comments, are an opportunity to insert comic intervals or biting comments on Asposia's reality. Fortunately, the spirit of the game doesn't seem to have been spoiled from German to English.Only once did we notice an inconsistency, a box referred to as a pillow. It may be that an English speaker identifies other details, but we are sure that these would be trifles. The voice actors are also convincing, although we would have preferred to hear Robert's voice become more confident as the young man gains more self-awareness. Seeing him ready to conquer Laura and accept his role in the world while continuing to speak with the uncertain tone of a fish out of water takes away credibility. However, the production remains excellent in all other aspects; especially for its graphic style The Inner World ranks above many recent adventures. But don't be fooled by the drawings: this is not an adventure for children. There is talk of absolutist institutions, manipulation of the truth and, between the folds of the plot, there is also room for two emblematic human figures: the man who has not opposed the abuse, and lives haunted by a sense of guilt - it is the case of the guardian of the mouth of the wind, who has developed two personalities to deny his past - and the man who despite himself collaborated with the dictatorship to protect those he loved. These are questions that reach our consciousness without us realizing it, as we marvel at the adventures of a boy born with an ocarina instead of a nose.", "date": "2013-10-28", "grade": "7.9"}
