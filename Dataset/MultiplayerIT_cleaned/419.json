{"name": "Trapt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trapt.html", "text": "There is a series born on psx, partially unknown to the European market, which has nonetheless been able to leave its mark due to its absolute originality, with gameplay that mixes role-playing game elements and graphics, with a tactical structure and a character design that recalls fighting games up close. The series is that of Kagero, released in this fourth chapter (first for ps2) with the name of Trapt; the game is developed by Tecmo and if this could partially explain the reason for certain choices on the aesthetics of the characters (just to mention a name, Dead or Alive), the particular game structure is what makes it truly original and certainly worthy of more than one attention. If you are ready to enter a world littered with traps, then you just have to read on to find out how to avoid them. Rock, wall and scissors The fight takes place within 3D arenas, in the first moments of battle by pressing the 'circle' button it will be possible to enter the specific trap menu to decide in which exact point of the location plan to insert the deadly devices. Traps are divided into three specific groups: wall traps, such as pop-up iron spikes or self-propelled walls; from the ceiling, including the various iron balls or the pendulum; and finally from the floor, such as hatches and pressure bombs. Each button of the remaining three (triangle, square and X) is assigned a specific trap, the player during the selection will have to decide the exact insertion point and in some cases also the direction of action. After this first phase of customization of the battlefield, the player's aim will be to lead the opponents towards the traps, to then trigger them and defeat them. Within this particular game structure, the presence of any 'combo' of traps will be taken into consideration, so that for example an opponent hit by a self-propelled wall is pushed onto a block that inhibits his movements and then hits him definitively with a stroke of the pendulum. Simple combos like this are at the same time the cross and the joy of the game: unfortunately due to bad or superficial programming, a combo of three crushes any opponent in a few turns and due to its particular conformation (in the plan the set of three traps forms a sort of L) is viable in any area that has a stairway or similar object. Always relying on the same configuration of traps is also made possible by the fact that while being able to move in the space between the various rooms of the house, it is also possible to always remain in the same one and therefore complete half the game within an hour of time always using and just the attack technique itself. To this factor is unfortunately added a not excessive balancing of the traps, with a series of these totally useless and another absolutely destructive. If the combat tends to lose points in terms of fun along the course of the adventure, the story behind the game demonstrates all its defects right from the start of the game with bad localization and bland rhythms that are difficult to they associate with long cut-scenes often and willingly well over five minutes. Another factor that works against the final result is undoubtedly the graphics: the characters move in slow motion and although the models of the main ones are of excellent workmanship, the supporting actors suffer from too many similarities, all in 3D settings that are decidedly not up to par and that too closely resemble the visual poverty of the past generation. Combat in Trapt is -sometimes- the result of a careful strategy, others of a monotonous repetition of commands that will lead the player to an easy and insipid victory. To this is added a not excellent graphic realization, undermined by more or less relevant problems. What's left is a good game that could have had a lot of tricks up its sleeve and exploited very few. Pros: At times funny Definitely original and well thought out Cons: Too monotonous Story undertone Graphic realization not up to par Once upon a trap The narrative plot behind Trapt tells the story of Allura, princess of a kingdom on the brink of destruction after the assassination of her father, the King. Allura's stepmother (and second wife of the King) proves herself from the first moments of the prologue the true rotten apple of the family and solely responsible for the death of her husband, but despite everything she manages to guide suspicions towards the innocent princess who is forced - together with her faithful personal servant Rachel - to escape to the old royal mansion not far away. The mansion in question is abandoned as it is said to be the home of an evil demon (called poco imaginatively precisely ~fiend~ or demon) capable of manipulating human beings according to their own purposes. Bad luck has it that Allura, still shaken by the death of her father, naively comes into contact with it and makes a pact to help her get out of that situation alive. The princess doesn't know it yet, but unfortunately Fiend has much more in mind for her... It is right in the mansion that the game begins and unravels the first plots of its plot for a good 50% of the adventure. Despite the mental connections that are made just by mentioning the word ~mansion~ (exploration, horror, resident evil, to name three), Trapt remains an unconventional game. This first combat location is simply made up of a number of rooms that does not exceed ten and of which there is no exploration factor. Trapt is a sort of real-time strategic role-playing game, in which you don't use first-person weapons to fight, but let a series of traps set to perfection by the player work, in order to weaken and subsequently defeat the enemies that they introduce themselves. The fights are proposed as a series of missions in which you will fight against a certain number of enemies, between one mission and another it will not be possible to move within the environments, you will only witness a more or less long cut-scene which illustrates the evolution of events. At the end of the sequence the player will be able to prepare for the next mission through a menu that will allow him to create even more deadly traps, to decide which of these to bring into combat, to study (superficially) his next opponents and to fight a special extra mission that while not differing in any way from the structure of the main quest, it will allow the player to gain some experience and extra money (useful for creating traps).", "date": "2006-07-06", "grade": null}
