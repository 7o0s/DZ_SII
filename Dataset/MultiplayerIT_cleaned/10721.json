{"name": "Bionic Commando", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/braccio-di-ferro-con-il-rampino.html", "text": "2009 seems to be a particularly prosperous year for Capcom which spares no effort in re-proposing its major IPs on the market, and given the great success of titles such as Street Fighter and Resident Evil it is clear that this policy is bringing excellent results for the Japanese house. Once again enjoying a new episode is a brand that represents a real pearl of the past, that Bionic Commando that has recently already shown itself on our consoles thanks to a remake of the original and unforgettable chapter available on digital platforms delivery of Microsoft and Sony. The title in question, however, represents in all respects a new chapter that transports us a few years after the events of the original game in a future where bionic soldiers have become an uncomfortable legacy of the past, and by virtue of this the government intends to get rid of them forever. The results of this policy, in addition to creating various clashes between supporters and detractors of bionics, lead to the flight of many supersoldiers who thus escape the so-called ~purge~. The reasons for such intolerance are to be found in the widespread mental incapacity and the growing aggressiveness of soldiers equipped with bionic prostheses, reasons which have prompted the upper echelons to abandon the project leading to the arrest and in extreme cases to the elimination of the remaining biotics homeland, as happens in the case of the protagonist of the game who, deprived of his mechanical limb, is locked up in a cell on false accusations just for having carried out the orders given to him. The fate of our hero, however, are destined to change when a terrorist group destroys a city with a nuclear attack and occupies the devastated ground, from this moment the services and skills of the soldier come back to being useful and it is from here that the adventures of the game begin. Urban decay A large part of the game takes place right in the rubble of the town devastated and occupied by the mere presence of terrorist forces, but there are also various excursions in extra-urban environments, always very convincing in execution. These prove to be an excellent theater in which to give vent to the peculiar abilities offered by the bionic arm of the protagonist who, almost like a primate, can exploit every protrusion and handhold to reach every place in the explorable area, from the tops of decadent skyscrapers to gorges. deep that wind their way underground. In the face of such a wide freedom of movement, an equally generous breadth of areas does not counteract which, although the horizon offers us an entire admirable city, are limited to a continuous concatenation of macro-rooms delimited by insurmountable obstacles or banks of deadly radiation and united by rather invasive loadings also seen the large number of times in which we have to change the area during the game. There is therefore no freeroaming component, which leaves a bitter taste in the mouth given that the proposed settings would seem to lend themselves beautifully to a similar approach. However, if we put this aspect aside, there is no doubt that the creation of all the environments has been skilfully supervised by the Capcom designers who have created an infrastructure that lends itself perfectly to the numerous gameplay solutions that a dynamic game like Bionic Commando offers. Grapple or pistol? The real protagonist of Bionic Commando is undoubtedly the bionic arm and its relative and very famous grappling hook which offers the player a wide range of useful moves both in exploration and in more agitated situations, revealing itself as an equally effective offensive weapon thanks to the use of various special moves unlockable throughout the game. Thanks to the use of this versatile limb, we are able to climb any type of surface, swing like modern Tarzans at any ledge and save ourselves from a jump gone wrong, all with the use of a single key, which manages the grappling hook in an intuitive and functional way. Thanks to this, distinctly platform sessions are also faced which offer a pleasant diversion from the fights as well as presenting a fair level of challenge. The other side of the gameplay of Bionic Commando lies in the clashes with enemies, even the latter can be addressed both by using the grappling hook, for example to grab enemies or to throw them against objects and parts of the scenery, and by using firearms, obtainable through the support of the operational base which occasionally offers us new instruments of death that can be used against the occupying forces. Of these two different ways of dealing with clashes, the one that convinced us the least is undoubtedly the more markedly shooter one: relying on the use of firearmsoffers the same satisfaction of using the bionic limb and its moves, although it is often necessary to resort to conventional weapons. The feeling with the weapons is approximate and does not have the same depth found on other more traditional titles, the shootings prove to be monotonous when faced against enemy infantry, which does not boast a very developed AI as well as offering a demanding challenge only when the enemies present in large groups. The situation is very different when we have various types of mechs in front of us, these machines must be faced using a more reasoned approach based on the opponent's weak points, so that the clash takes on a much higher depth and level of challenge . The same depth is found amplified in the boss fights which are undoubtedly the most successful part of the package. Xbox 360 goals Bionic Commando presents a particular structure with regard to the objectives which is partly reminiscent of that presented by Valve's Orange Box. In fact, the objectives of Bionic Commando are very numerous and, consequently, not very profitable. Most of the unlockable points refer to the numerous challenges that gradually become available in the game, mostly related to the use of weapons and the grappling hook. Biotic technique Bionic Commando boasts, as already mentioned, a respectable level design, combined with a more than satisfactory technical realization especially as regards the modeling of the protagonist and the environments, the latter caressed by an excellent dynamic lighting system. It happens to find yourself faced with some subdued textures, particularly in the interior environments, but the overall impact offers some enjoyable landscape glimpses especially considering the wide visual horizon of the areas. Instead, the modeling of the enemies is rather cheesy, here too greater care has been placed in the mechs which boast a detail and a research that is closest to today's standards. Special mention for the soundtrack composed mostly of rearranged pieces from the first Bionic Commando, to the delight of longtime players who have already appreciated certain unforgettable sounds in their time. But Capcom has thought of the nostalgics throughout the development of the game, peppering it with numerous quotes that recall the original game on more than one occasion, as well as offering numerous references, in the form of documents to be collected, to the events that unite this new chapter to its illustrious predecessor.", "date": "2009-05-18", "grade": "7.5"}
