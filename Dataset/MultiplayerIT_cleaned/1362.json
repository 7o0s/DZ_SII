{"name": "Prezzemolo in una giornata da incubo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prezzemolo-in-una-giornata-da-incubo.html", "text": "Adventure or cartoon? Prezzemolo presents itself as a traditional point and click graphic adventure. Solving the puzzles relies heavily on exploration and conversation. The ability to use the right object in the right place will be crucial, but a good dose of imagination and logic will also be useful, as well as a certain familiarity with fairy tale clichs! The plot is not strictly linear and the player is free to solve the puzzles in any order they like, although in each case they will face exhausting journeys up and down the world of Tanaboo, despite the provision of a rapid transport system via a map showing the main settings. The level of difficulty of the puzzles is on average low, given the target of the game, with some exceptions that may require a little help from parents or the collaboration of more savvy players. Humor reigns supreme in the game: it ranges from refined to demented, perfectly adapting to the tastes of children of all ages, or more precisely those between 5 and 15 years old. Some situations are really hilarious, like that of the unbreakable piggy bank, which our heroes repeatedly try to open, often with dramatic results! The animations and the funny walk of the dragon will not fail to make you smile, as will many of his ironic observations. To embellish the whole we find a stable of likeable and very well characterized characters, who populate the fantastic world of Tanaboo: a greedy and despotic sorcerer, a sly and profiteering tiger, a hysterical and clumsy seagull ... a cast worthy of the best films of the 'animation, in short. The glowing virtual world of Tanaboo The three-dimensional graphics are decidedly pleasant, colorful and cartoon-style, as well as in perfect harmony with the light-hearted spirit of adventure. The rendered backdrops are gaudy and full of elements to interact with: the settings are in fact vast and dotted with fun details and interesting objects to examine, a boon for the innate curiosity of children. All characters are animated in real time. The cutscenes don't always boast the same quality as the in-game graphics, but they're decent nonetheless. The cheerful cartoon music that accompanies the daring exploits of our little dragon also contributes to the atmosphere of the game. Excellent dubbing, entrusted to the same voices of the television series. The efforts aimed at varying and making Prezzemolo's responses to the player's commands deserve a special mention: the usual ~It's not possible~ or ~Why should I?~, for example, are replaced by amusing comments such as ~It would be degrading even to try! ~- in some cases the same (absurd) operation can be attempted three times, always obtaining different answers from Prezzemolo. Within certain limits, these nice comments make the exploration even more exciting and fun, if it weren't for the fact that too many active elements appear on the screen, which in reality have no use for the purposes of the adventure, other than to give the settings a certain ~realism~. However, this is a double-edged sword and, in addition to the relative difficulty in identifying the objects with which it is necessary to interact, it has another side effect: every now and then the dragon goes off on a tangent and if it finds something funny on its way it is finished, because it will be difficult to stop his uproarious laughter or his endless demented anecdotes! Even the dialogues tend to be a bit long at times, with the obvious risk of not being able to always keep the attention of the little ones. Comment Ultimately, Prezzemolo is an extremely enjoyable and well-packaged adventure, full of interesting ideas and peppered with good values. For the little ones, it will be an excellent opportunity to learn new words and test their logical and deductive skills. We therefore feel comfortable recommending it to all budding adventurers and parents or older siblings looking for the classic, useful and fun gift! Pros: Various and fun puzzles Cartoon-style graphics Humor Cons: Backdrops too full of active elements Prezzemolo runs, but not fast enough Prezzemolo is a bit too talkative! The ~monster~ of Lake Garda For those who still don't know the popular mascot of the Gardaland amusement park, Prezzemolo is a funny green dragon with a passion for strawberry pizza and an inexplicable aversion forpigs. This ~nightmare day~ begins precisely with a bad dream of our hero and the inexplicable disappearance of his dear friend, the panda Bamboo. With the assistance of a ramshackle gang of fellow adventurers, Prezzemolo will have to unravel the mystery of the disappearance, exploring the colorful world of Tanaboo and facing a series of challenges and puzzles of various kinds. The game was developed by the Prograph team, already known for Tony Tough, and it is not excluded that in the future the adventures of Prezzemolo could have a sequel.", "date": "2004-03-23", "grade": null}
