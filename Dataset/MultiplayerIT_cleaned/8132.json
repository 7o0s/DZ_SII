No instances, of any kind, but entire continents to cross in a single solution among thousands of players engaged in a perennial battle for the conquest of Auraxis. The factions that compete for the rich planet are the usual three of the first chapter or the old Terran Republic, an authoritarian government and not very kind to the settlers, the New Conglomerate, a rebel entity moved by various interests, and the Vanu Sovereignty, convinced that the evolution steps for the exploitation of alien technologies some of which are still hidden under the soil of Auraxia. The main goal of the player, in addition to killing and conquering bases to earn experience points and obtain new instruments of death, is to conquer all the disputed territories of a continent to obtain substantial bonuses for the whole faction. An important technological achievement The gaming market has long been keeping an eye on the promising genre of persistent first-person shooters and Sony is among the most active developers when it comes to throwing more and more players into the same battlefield. But, until today, technical hurdles and balancing difficulties have always prevailed. In fact, unlike the spells and abilities of normal MMOs, the bullets of an FPS call into question precise geometrics, physics and dozens of impacts that must be calculated precisely and without this weighing too much on the framerate or data traffic. PlanetSide 2 finally manages to mix this complexity with the enormity of an MMO and does it quite well even if there are some youthful problems. From time to time the servers flicker, latency grows and enemies disappear, but generally the action flows smoothly, even with dozens and dozens of soldiers packed into a small base. But the real surprise appears before our eyes only when we go outdoors and we can only be amazed by what SoE has created. The extreme visual distance allows you to embrace with a single glance canyons, burning aircraft, bases perched on hills, huge spaceships transformed into strongholds and hundreds of units moving towards sensitive objectives trying to organize themselves. Everything is surrounded by a lighting system that enhances the climatic situation and is a fundamental element to make the continuous movements on the huge pitch which is divided into three large continents pleasant. The burning and hot sun of Indar alternates with the pristine nature of Amerish which extinguishes icy Esamir whose whiteness is mottled by auroras and huge purple crystals. Then there are woods, grasslands and jagged rocky slopes, with the infantry that can creep into them in situations probably similar to those experienced by the fighters in Afghanistan but which in this case, fortunately for us, are of a playful nature. Unfortunately, with increasing distance, the models lose detail, the movements of the soldiers are slightly embalmed and the interiors of the bases are often repetitive and not too detailed, but the glance is always more than valid and the sacrifices are evidently functional to make the title fully playable even on mid-range PCs. A real battlefield During the first few games, especially if you don't have a team to rely on, the most valid option is to follow the flow of your contingent, charging into a fluid movement of players, creating a front, protecting the medics and trying to to break through the enemy defense. The mass movement after the conquest of a large base, which passes through different stages and in the case of strongholds also allows for several reversals in front, is truly spectacular with dozens of vehicles moving through a continuous flow of soldiers looking for a new front to conquer. In these cases it is easy to find the enemies who have just been defeated on the street, determined to recover the base they have just lost or to conquer a new one nearby. Thus begins a short battle in the middle of nowhere, destined to fall apart due to the lack of defenses and nearby spawn points, but which offers new game situations and which can keep forces engaged outside the bases allowing organized teams to conquer a position by facing minimal resistance. A well-varied 12-man team can make the difference in many situations, especially by focusing on surprise and targeting areas on the edge of battle. The largest transport aircraft have, not surprisingly, 12 seats and can drop an entire team in the middle of enemy territory. Butthe opponents have enough time to intervene in defense, if they are attentive to what is happening on the map, and it is necessary that a territory is conquerable or that it is connected to another area in our faction's hands and therefore, usually, close enough to the main front. In addition, larger bases require reactors to be shut down to open major access routes, and it is often necessary to maintain secondary capture points as well. Many structures are in fact distinguished by three key positions, indicated on the map by the first three letters of the alphabet, and the faction that maintains two for a certain time eventually also gets the third. Thus, even if a faction manages to hold the center of the base, which is more defensible and often equipped with devastating emplacement guns, they cannot remain cornered all the time. Furthermore, in various situations it is advisable to maintain control of nearby bases, often positioned in defense of the main ones and which, when equipped with cannons, can be used by attackers to weaken the defenses of a stronghold before carrying out a mass assault. In short, having the dominion of some areas is rather complex and all this even without considering the chaos of players who fall from the sky into orbital capsules, descend from the mobile spawns and leap out of the base under siege, often aboard aircraft, to disturb the our plans. The balancing game The PlanetSide 2 units are decidedly classic and are the same for all factions even if the different technologies still alter the gaming experience. Choices, with the player being able to switch classes at will like in a normal FPS, include the medic, who can resurrect and heal teammates; the engineer, vital for repairing vehicles and equipped with a self-propelled turret; the soldier, equipped with a jetpack; the sturdier, missile-launching heavy soldier; the infiltrator, equipped with a camouflage module and sniper rifle; and finally the max, a very powerful android, available only in certain situations, generated by mixing living tissue and mechanical prostheses. Despite the inevitable similarity with the classes of other titles, the characters of the SoE title boast a greater balance thanks to limits imposed by the developers and thanks to the need to draw on some resources, which have a maximum ceiling, to obtain vehicles and part of the 'equipment. The C4, which must be unlocked by spending experience points, is lethal against vehicles but cannot be reloaded with normal ammunition. Like grenades and vehicles, Special Explosive must be paid for in resources and can only be salvaged at specific Supply Posts which are only available when a base is captured by your faction. Furthermore, after abandoning a vehicle, it must be destroyed, or disappear after a fixed timer expires, in order to recall another of the same type. This system prevents hundreds of units from being all equipped with tanks, without forcing players to wait for the vehicles to respawn as happens in Battlefield. But, to make the experience enjoyable for everyone, there are other types of balance, even more radical, which prevent the single player from becoming too decisive in a fight. The sniper, for example, has the invisibility perk, but can't start shooting before being visible again. The heavy soldier, on the other hand, can count on a powerful shield, but the machine gun is inaccurate and several missile launcher shots are needed to bring down an enemy vehicle. Unfortunately, on the other hand, it is not possible to collect the companions' equipment and use a vehicle that does not belong to us if you do not have the appropriate hacking skill, reserved for snipers. This choice limits the contextual possibilities, with many vehicles left abandoned in the middle of the battlefield, but it is an acceptable sacrifice to guarantee an otherwise impossible balance. No outside help Sony Entertainment Online has recently decided to prohibit the use of any kind of client side modifications with the sole exception of *.ini files. By deleting all mods, without any exclusions, the team has a better chance of identifying and eliminating cheaters. These would in fact be destructive in a formula exclusively linked to first-person competitive combat that does not allow for the creation of private servers to escape the bad habits of some players. Wheels, tracks and vertical thrusters The means of PlanetSide 2 have a fundamental role in the direct attack on the bases. Quads allow infantry to arrive quickly, thetroop transports can become a spawn point, and tanks are essential for weakening enemy defenses before the infantry arrives. Without the right support it is difficult to overwhelm the enemy who can count on safe and close spawn points. These, among other things, are protected by a shield, until the base is conquered, to prevent the spawn kill of opponents under siege. Of course, a dozen carts keeping an eye on the teleportation chamber exits is an almost insurmountable obstacle, but if nothing else, players stuck in the room have the ability to teleport to a new zone without having to die. The tanks, among other things, have a weak point, and this is represented by the aircraft which are vertically propelled and therefore extremely manoeuvrable. This means that they can hover in mid-air firing large confetti and missile salvos with pinpoint accuracy. Fortunately, the large number of aircraft and vehicles scattered across the three continents of the title makes the bad practice of air camping difficult, even for the most expert pilots. Of course, a soldier isolated in the mountains is easy prey, but in more populated areas it is impossible to stand still for too long without being spotted by an enemy fighter and there is no way to prevent the respawn of enemy aircraft. Not all aircraft are designed specifically for combat, some are designed to transport troops. In any case, a twelve-person transport aircraft like the Galaxy has enough turrets to deter enemies, and with all the offensive positions occupied by the players, it is a real flying battleship, far better than the smaller transport aircraft which are slightly more agile but also less defensible. Transport aircraft do not have a turbo, unlike single-seat fighters which allow rapid evolutions and equally fast escapes, but the vertical propulsion still allows the pilot to carry out extreme maneuvers to displace the opponent and allow his companions to unload as much ammunition as possible is possible on the opponent. On their own, however, the transports are little more than caissons kept in the air by a miracle and, when a fighter arrives, they quickly transform into huge metal coffins. Furthermore, with increasing experience and ranks, more and more pilots and soldiers will have homing missiles available, making the sky less and less safe for slower aircraft. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the absolute balance in this phase, especially since SoE intends to release important updates that will even implement mechs and flying aircraft carriers. But a game like PlanetSide 2 must be evaluated precisely for its evolving essence which provides for continuous evolution, hopefully without excessive imbalances. Communications, advances and perspectives The ~social~ part works well. There is a lack of visible notifications for private messages, which are often lost in general chat, but creating or joining a team is quick and easy. The item Outfit allows us to socially characterize our profile, allowing us to find people with a style of play or a philosophy similar to ours. This feature replaces the classic guilds and can give life to real armies made up of platoons and teams to organize. But it is also possible to play as mavericks and join impromptu groups of players. Public teams, i.e. those without filters linked to an Outfit or a friends list, can be created simply by inviting someone and are visible in a handy window that allows us to join the group with the most convincing name or, perhaps, a squad of compatriots. Once joined the team, the companions are always shown on the map with green dots marked with a number and this allows us to reach them quickly by aiming for the closest active spawn point. Once you join the team, it becomes possible to communicate using the game's voice chat even if there is, of course, an automatic communication system that can be controlled with the keyboard. This system, similar to that of Battlefield, allows you to ask for ammo or healing with the simple press of a button and allows you to access more complex options by holding Q while targeting a teammate. Furthermore, the team leader can set a waypoint and become a spawn point himself even if the latter possibility must be used with knowledge of the facts since it is bound to a cooldown. The progression of the characters is rather slow, with the experience points that raise the level but do not correspond to the much harder certification points to obtain, but for some skills the effort is certainly worth the candle.
