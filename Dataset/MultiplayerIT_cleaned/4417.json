All this to be able to try your hand, together with a group of friends, in an augmented reality FPS with laser tag dynamics: in this review we will try to understand if, as the saying goes, the game is worth the candle... Between saying and laser tagging there is the sea Let's start with the more strictly practical aspects of Father.IO: the Inceptor package contains the real detector (to be charged via a USB cable that is strictly not included) and a universal adapter to fix it to the back of your smartphone. In our experience, the Bluetooth pairing of the device did not go smoothly, but despite some initial error messages and a general slowness in recognition, we still managed to complete a configuration process that certainly will not enter in the Olympus of the most user-friendly experiences available in the mobile sector. Once this obstacle has been overcome, the potential buyer of Father.IO immediately faces another much more imposing one: finding at least a handful of other Inceptor owners to physically meet in the same place and start deathmatches in augmented reality, thus shooting across the screen of the smartphone but moving on its own legs to face the opponents. On paper, the Proxy42 title supports a maximum of 32 users per game, both in the all-against-all and team variants: numbers that are honestly difficult to reach at the moment, both due to the still very limited diffusion of the product, and due to a purely organizational, which the developers have also tried to remedy by making available a dedicated community and a Discord chat. Even imagining a utopian scenario in which about thirty of their friends are willing to spend forty euros each for the Inceptor and then meet in the same place to challenge each other, a major underlying problem remains: Father.IO is simply not a good game, or at least it's not an experience rewarding enough to justify such an investment of money and effort. A first limit on which it is difficult to overlook is the evident lack of content, certified by the presence of only the two aforementioned modes (with a single modifier that allows or not the respawn), of four classes for one's character that certainly do not distort the gameplay and an arsenal made up of four weapons whose only peculiarity is represented by the sniper rifle, actually capable of restoring a different feeling from the more canonical assault rifles, SMGs and pistols. The control system is not responsive enough, especially when it comes to changing the weapon, and the animations that sanction the passage to the viewfinder and the replacement of the magazine are of a slowness that does not suit a title with competitive ambitions like this . The total absence of secondary elements that can encourage you to continue playing (objectives or upgrades to unlock, but also trivial rankings) could also take a back seat if we were faced with an incredibly exciting game, but that's not the case: like the ~classic~ laser tag, Father.IO exhausts its appeal after very few games, and unless Proxy42 shows off the proverbial trump card with future updates, we wouldn't put our hand on fire on its life expectancy in the medium / long term. Also from a technical point of view, the product fluctuates between the proverbial ups and downs, with a clear preponderance of the latter: the Inceptor works well and with limited lag, but the augmented reality elements on the screen are reduced to a minimum sound effects are extremely poor and the app is a voracious drum eater. Finally, better to spread a pitiful veil on the two single-player modes offered by the main menu, a target shooting with drones and a headshot contest that frankly really leave the time they find.", "date": "2018-02-10", "grade": "5.0"}
