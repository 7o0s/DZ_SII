If the more arcade experiences - with all the infinite nuances that this category incorporates - are perfectly suited to the modern or futuristic context that has been in vogue for some time now, the use of a historical setting seems in fact to become all the more enjoyable when faithfully in reproducing environments, weapons and protagonists there is also a certain level of simulation in terms of playability, physics, systems and so on. In the case of Tripwire Interactive's shooter, the level of anticipation has skyrocketed quickly and it is not difficult to understand the reasons. It is the standalone sequel to a hugely successful mod, independently produced and with the needs of a certain type of audience in mind. As well as the peculiarities of the PC gaming platform. After years of development, with an already announced expansion and a perhaps not long enough beta behind it, the one released a fortnight ago is a very interesting title, exciting when it works but also rough and in the process of improvement: we talked about it at length in a recently tried and we're going back to it now, after having been patient with a few corrective patches, to sum up what can be purchased on Steam and other digital delivery systems for the (modest) sum of 34.90 euros. Immersion The foundations on which Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad rests a lot of its charm lie in the simulation aspects put in place both by the heavily modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 used, and by the implemented mechanics. And few times as in this case the two fronts, the technical one and the gameplay, end up merging and working in unison. The covers, one of the most recognizable features of the Epic Games engine, have, for example, been implemented letting the view remain in first person at all times, abandoning mixed solutions such as that of Rainbow Six Vegas. At the same time the ~blind~ fire is rendered in a realistic way, with the camera remaining low and not allowing you to see beyond the obstacle. And the weapons take advantage of the possibility of support offered by the guards, with in particular those equipped with a tripod which increase exponentially in effectiveness. The physics of the bullets, the degree of penetrability of the surfaces and the environmental interaction are important details taken into consideration: each material is crossed differently by shots fired in accordance with the real values of each reproduced weapon, while the force of gravity can be counterbalanced both by raising the aim and by adjusting the grip of the weapon. Possibilities like the latter or others, such as the iron sight also available for sniper rifles or that of extracting and changing the incandescent barrel of machine guns, are subtleties that increase the degree of identification, making themselves appreciated above all when considered as a whole. Only the destructibility of the scenario is a little disappointing which, rather advertised in the development phase, applies to a few elements and not always in a coherent manner. A pity also because the only means inserted could have taken advantage of them: two tanks, one for the Axis and one for the Russians, which allow the crews to effectively simulate the roles and difficulties of aiming and moving that beasts of the gender imply. Many changes to the standard rendering of Unreal Engine 3 - it is one of the products that revises it more heavily without leaving the FPS sow - have for the moment how to counteract as many optimization problems ranging from heavy frame rate drops to wrong interactions between polygons to some surface display issues. The development team, however, is working well to solve these problems and others, which we will discuss in the following paragraphs, so much so that, for example, on the test configuration used for the review, we have obtained rather substantial improvements in terms of fluidity. A lot of work remains to be done and in general, a considerable care for environments, weapons and effects such as those of smoke, are opposed by not very exciting shaders, fluctuating models and a graphic rendering that overall is not top of the class. Not bad, mind you, the visual component remains enjoyable and functional, especially since at the moment the priority is to resolve the flaws that affect the gameplay. Sound has so-so voices and only one theme song, still pretty good, but sonor the effects and the use made of them to be really good and atmospheric. Of course, the care taken by DICE in this respect with Battlefield 3 remains difficult to achieve, but we can be satisfied. Hot shots! That it is not a title to buy for its single player component is clear to anyone who has followed the genesis of the project even casually. What a nice bunch of enemy AI The decision to introduce a mode for the single player anyway, however, was sensible above all by virtue of the complexity of the gameplay, the commands extended to a considerable number of keys, the need to practice with the ten maps present at the exit and in general the challenges offered by such a complex title. It is a pity therefore that the commendable desire to give an assist to the new recruits does not correspond to an equally noteworthy achievement. The two campaigns are a sort of multiplayer with bots where you can attack and defend in accordance with the objective, be reborn in case of death in place of your companions and learn to master tools such as the radial menu of orders. Single player melee All good except that, apart from the more scripted sessions done as a tutorial, the rest is a sequence of situations tragically undermined by a Fantozzi-like artificial intelligence. The enemies behave in a rambling way and the companions as well, completely forgetting, for one thing, the smoke grenades. And this when they are not busy moving in a bizarre way, jumping from one cover to another or starting funny melees with their opponents. Giving the right commands helps up to a certain point and indeed it is frustrating not to see the correct feedback to one's efforts. We repeat: it is an accessory component which, however, once in the pipeline could have been shorter, more accurate, didactic and with development times and costs not poured into secondary aspects such as the many interlude films. As it is, it feels like a wasted opportunity to be indulged in only when looking for some gun confidence. The party is here The area in which Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad excels, the only one in which it was really made and the one that justifies its purchase, is multiplayer for up to sixty-four players. The three modes are the classic Territory, which asks you to attack and defend points on the map, Countdown, which is similar but with one life for each player, and finally the team deathmatch. Enough to stage hard-fought battles which, also thanks to the design of the settings, overwhelmingly favor team play. Never so profound and based on cooperation as well as respect for roles and positions. In this way we obtain a slower rhythm than elsewhere but a very strong sense of identification, also suggested by the presence of the Suppression System. This alters visuals and sounds if you are touched by bullets and explosions but also when a companion falls to the ground lifeless in our vicinity. The choice to limit the number of players for each class is right and the options that alter the settings for realism from server to server are very welcome, for example affecting the mini map and any recognition writings above the head of the companions. The support given by Tripwire Interactive to the modder community is therefore based on an already more than solid foundation and we can't wait to see what enthusiasts will come up with from such interesting premises. For now, the ten maps available, however, offer a sufficiently varied playing field: not all are equally inspired and are on average rather small, suggesting not to exceed the number of users for each team, however we appreciated the alternation of open and narrow spaces , fights in the corridors and rooms of destroyed buildings and long stakeouts lying on the ground, moving in the open trying not to get shot. What doesn't work properly, in addition to the progression system and the objectives that have given the writer many problems, is the balancing of some weapons. Particularly the German ones which are generally considered more powerful than their Russian counterparts. Balances almost always imperfect to the first releases of the most ambitious multiplayer titles, for an aspect that will be recorded over time depending on what has emerged from thousands and thousands of online games.", "date": "2011-09-28", "grade": "8.5"}
