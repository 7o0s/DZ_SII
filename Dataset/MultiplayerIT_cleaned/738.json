{"name": "Soul Calibur III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-calibur-iii.html", "text": "One of the main flaws of this type of game has always been the limited longevity, essentially due to a number of fighters that is not always high, or at least, not enough, and by the very structure of the ~fighting~ genre, which does not allow, in general maximum, too many flights of fancy for programmers to vary the contents, especially in single player mode. Instead Namco managed to amaze everyone, for better or for worse, by designing a whole series of ~game modes~ designed to keep the gamer's interest high for a long time, significantly increasing their number as never before seen in a similar title. But let's go in order. Once we ~arrive~ at the main menu, immediately after the spectacular CGI presentation, the game offers us the possibility to select four basic options, the main one of which is undoubtedly that for the Single Player, the beating heart of SCIII. Here we can still choose from four sub-categories the mode that best suits us to play. The first, one of the two most interesting of the entire title is the one called ~Stories of Souls and swords~, which in practice replaces and improves the classic ~story mode~ of the previous chapters. In this ~section~ of the game, each character has his own personal story that is intertwined with that of the other fighters. In practice, we users will decide the path to follow before tackling the final canonical mega-boss, and in this way the plot will be less linear than usual. On a map depicting the universe of Soul Calibur, in fact, the possible paths to follow are highlighted with a marker that represents our character. Each of these paths will lead, depending on the choice made, to ~open~ new paths and to a different story development, as well as more endings. This mode is also full of cut-scenes, sometimes even in the form of Quick Time Events, i.e. those phases of the game that require the timely pressing of a key on the joypad, the same that appears as an indication on the screen during the movie (for example ~G  to press the guard button), otherwise you will be put at some disadvantage in the next fight. Continuing in no particular order in our analysis of this category reserved for single-player, a special arcade mode called ~World Competition~ has also been introduced, which will allow you to fight in various tournaments to become the best fighter in the world, as if you were against other gamers in a championship with a standings or in a knockout ~cup~. Finally, the new Arena of souls is interesting. In this mode, a whole series of amusing mini-games has been collected where each of us, driving his own favorite character, will be able to try his hand at a series of amusing enterprises. For example, we will be able to face a huge marble colossus in a duel or fight against an opponent by throwing him against a wall in order to make him bounce like the ball of a pinball machine from wall to wall, because in this way we will obtain a certain score, and so on. It is not the state of the art, for some these games are a bit out of place in a videogame context like this, but in our opinion they constitute a fun diversion from the usual more ~serious~ fights. The whole is completed by some secondary modes, such as the one for Practice, Versus, with two sub-categories, i.e. Standard Vs (quick duel) and Advanced Vs (tournament for up to four players) and the Shop, where we can buy items and the weapons that we will unlock during the game and which will be used in particular to edit and strengthen the characters created from scratch. The modality called ~Histories of the sword~, perhaps the most intriguing, conceptually, of SCIII deserves a separate chapter. Almost a real game in its own right, complete with a plot independent from the rest of the story, this ~option~ represents a big novelty in the beat'em up world, a meeting point between 3D fighting games and other genres, such as RPG or the strategic. Overall, the ~product~ that derives from it is not excellent, given that the section has some flaws, especially in group clashes and in the planning and troop movement phase, due to a little evolved AI of the enemies which must therefore be reviewed in perspective, but it's a start. How does it work. First of all we will be asked to create our own character practically from scratch using the powerful internal editor (which we will analyze shortly, in the next paragraph), and to assign him class and name. This Pg will be the protagonist of the story, which will take place as if everything happened in an alternative historical context, in a universe parallel to the one narrated in Soul Calibur III, where a young cadet of the Empire of Grandall, at the ordersne of General Girardot, he will have to face enemy armies to defend his Kingdom and for the fate of the globe. On a 3D map with a bird's eye view depicting the various battlefields, we will have to move and act just like in the most classic of PC strategy games. Here we will be able to view the enemy strongholds and direct the characters at our disposal freely, in order to attack the opposing positions or to defend our most advanced areas. Some battles can be tackled directly on the three-dimensional map, while the classic 1Vs1 fighting game system will be used in the most important battles (which can also be selected from a menu in other cases). The various phases of the game are interspersed and integrated with each other by a more than discreet plot, by some interlude scenes seasoned with many dialogues, complete with FF Tactics-style dialogue windows, and again by various quests that will be proposed as the story progresses. But let's now analyze the section mentioned several times up to now, that of ~character creation~. Entering the appropriate area we can make the first choices. Once you have selected the class to which our hero belongs (at the beginning you will have six available, Barbarian, Thief, Dancer, Saint, Monk and Samurai, each of which has its own set of schools of struggle) and gender, in fact, we will access a very complete menu within which it is possible to determine their physical appearance, from the haircut to the complexion, from the clothes to the single details, such as belts or brooches. Believe us when we tell you that, once you've unlocked the various items available for this section, you'll be able to create practically anything, from MGS4's Solid Snake complete with a black eye patch, to FFVII's Cloud and Sephirot, just to give you an example. And technically? From this point of view, SCIII is a truly well-finished production. Thanks to a framerate anchored on 60 frames per second, a good graphic cleanliness, well-animated and detailed polygonal models, the game is simply splendid. The characters have a higher number of animations than SCII and have also undergone a heavy graphic restyling. The stages show a great variety, with environments covered with well-made textures and embellished with mobile elements, such as flames, water, animals. The only flaw perhaps the choice of palette which comes with a very strong variety of bright colors. In short, although the Ps2 hardware has been squeezed like and more than a lemon, there are still those who manage to surprise us positively. We have talked so far about everything concerning the structural part of the game modes and the aesthetic one. Now let's focus on what has always been, and God forbid, the real test of a shout'em up, its central pivot: the fights. Let's say right away that in this sense the programmers have not added anything really new to the good things we had seen in SCII. Simply, these have limited themselves to correcting some imperfections of a technical nature, almost an upgrade, for example by better balancing the skills of the characters and consequently the general playability. The parameters that regulated the execution speed of certain techniques appear reduced, which, together with the decrease in the reaction times of the various counter-moves, means that the fights are much more spectacular and frenetic, but also less uneven, calibrated, in relation to the characters you use. This probably won't catch the eye of most immediately, but after a few games you realize these changes are not heavy but effective. Also reduced the physical speed of some fighters. If in SCII the speed of some of them made them almost unbeatable, especially if they were used against physically stronger but slow fighters, now this is no longer the case. For the rest we are faced with the usual things. The 29 characters (many unlockable) including the new arrivals Zasalamel, Setsuka and Tira, are characterized by a personal fighting style, the same set of basic commands, which are summarized in vertical attack, horizontal attack, kick and parry, and from which combination then the various types of attack of which each wrestler is capable arise. The effective ~blocks~ seen in the second chapter have been re-proposed almost identically, especially the so-called ~impact~ ones, which by pressing the appropriate button with the right timing together with a direction, allow the opponent to be unbalanced, interrupting his sequence of attacks and leaving him exposed to any counter-moves, and the ~holds~, i.e. those moves which consist in grabbing the opponent and, with a short but spectacular animation, inflicting on him imporlots of damage. Conclusions Namco greets the Ps2 to focus on next-generation consoles, and does so by taking leave with a qualitatively valid title, even if not particularly innovative. However, even if on balance it turns out to be almost a simple upgrade of its predecessor, at least in terms of gameplay, Soul Calibur III is undoubtedly the best game in the series. Completely new single-player mode, high longevity and a story-mode that is not excellent but much more engaging than usual, ultimately make this product a mandatory purchase for those who loved the Soul Edge saga, while for others, it is recommended first a careful evaluation. Probably, also given the hardware limitations of the Sony console, the Japanese team could not have been better asked to close the experience on the Monolith positively. Pros: 50/60Hz selector. In Italian. High longevity and good playability. Fluid, neat. Cons: Some modes to be reviewed. Lack of online game sections. Not very innovative. The primordial force of the two very powerful antithetical ~twin~ swords, the evil Soul Edge and the purifying Soul Calibur, have finally been silenced. Even the unfortunate Siegfried, once possessed by Nightmare in his body, freed himself from the evil power of the blade, completely recovered and almost recovered his identity. Evil therefore seems defeated. But it is only an illusion. In fact, it is said that somewhere in the world, the dark force has been reborn in another form, and with it the historic blade... Meanwhile a mysterious sorcerer armed with a scythe appears on the horizon, ready to take possession of it. Soul Calibur III, the fourth chapter of a saga that began way back in 1996 in arcades with Soul Edge (Soul Blade in the European version) and was later ~converted~ to Psx, is, like Tekken 5, the Namco title that more than any other contains, albeit with some small flaws, all the technical experience gained in years of programming by the Japanese software, almost the videogame summary of an entire ~working career~ in this sector.", "date": "2005-11-25", "grade": null}
