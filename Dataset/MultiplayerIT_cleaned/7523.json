We had already offered you a trial of this multiplayer video game and, today, we offer you our final judgment on a product that is perhaps interesting, but clearly not very lucky. Here is our review of Killer in the cabin. Eight under a canopy Killer in the cabin But let's start from the beginning, for those who don't know Killer in the cabin. We are talking about a multiplayer game for up to eight users. The protagonists, after an accident, end up in a forest, where they find abandoned cabins. The aim of the group is to survive until the time runs out. But there is a problem: among the players there is an assassin who will take advantage of the situation to kill everyone. The killer can use multiple methods to come to victory. He can act directly, attacking with weapons such as a hatchet, knife, or rifle. However, it can also act in a less direct way, for example by poisoning food or water. Killer in the cabin is more focused on survival than lighter works like the aforementioned Among Us. Characters must account for body temperature, hunger, thirst, and energy. Every match has a rapid night-day cycle and if you stand outside in cold weather it will freeze. Also, you have to eat and drink. Finally, one can rest while sleeping, but in this case one risks being strangled in one's sleep by the assassin without being able to react. If only one of the physical conditions goes to zero, you start losing health and eventually die. Players must roam the map looking for cookies to feed on or ingredients to make food at the main cabin. Resources are scarce and scattered, so it is necessary to act in a coordinated way, dividing ourselves to search for what we need more quickly, but thus giving the assassin the possibility of eliminating us more easily. Cooperation Killer in the cabin inventory The focus of the game is verbal cooperation. Voice chat is active and required. If you don't talk, you can't tell other players what resources we have available and what we need to survive. The basic idea of Killer in the Cabin is that by talking, you must necessarily give the killer information that helps him decide how to attack the survivors. You can also vote against other players to eliminate them, but until the end of the game time it is not possible to know if the killer is dead. The killer can win even when dead, if the other players don't survive or decide by vote that, in their opinion, the killer is already dead. The problem with this system is that it completely collapses if you don't communicate effectively. There is the risk of wandering around the map without knowing if a certain area has already been explored, without being able to do anything interesting. There are also some activities that can only be managed by two, such as exploring a small island to be reached by raft. Some of Killer in the cabin's activities Also, there is always the limit of the language barrier. If you don't speak English, you can't hope to complete a truly satisfying game. Also for this reason, we suggest Killer in the cabin only to those players who know they can gather a group of 6-8 friends to play via private sessions. Fortunately, Killer in the cabin costs only 3.99, so the investment is really minimal. Also, note that the number of active players - according to SteamDB data - is very minimal. We are talking about a maximum of thirty users in this period. We too, during our tests, had a hard time finding someone available. The developers have added bots, which were missing at the start of Early Access. However, these are not particularly intelligent, since they are unable to feed themselves, they get stuck easily in certain points and, if one of them is an assassin, he will soon start attacking with a weapon without stopping, with an energy and an unexpected precision. Problems A murder in Killer in the cabin Killer in the cabin is obviously one of the many imitators of Among Us, born in response to the success of Innersloth and the impression is that he tried his luck by investing the minimum necessary. It is a project with low production values and it can be seen from the technical sector. Don't expect a graphically satisfying game with polished animations. The real problem, however, is that it offers very little content. There is only one map and within a few games it has exhausted everything new. We will see if the team will support the game, but considering the lack of success we would understand very well if it weren't. Furthermore, in the months of early access, the updates certainly did not revolutionize the game. We also point out that we encountered some small bugs, such as a command block that made it impossible to interact with objects and therefore practically meant game over.", "date": "2022-05-18", "grade": "5.0"}
