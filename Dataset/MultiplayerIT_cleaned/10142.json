Jump in Music which despite modest appearances was able to prove to be an extremely successful experiment. Bulkypix re-proposes it today in an extremely ~fast food~ version, a bit like we have seen Babel Rising made for it: fast gameplay, to be consumed in a few minutes of pause between one commitment and another, elementary but functional concept, commitment and challenge in crescendo until its end. Master! In short, Green Grove is proposed as an excellent game for quick sessions even if not too painless, capable of generating in the user a certain angry frenzy and a discreet persistence on the screen of our iPhone/iPod Touch in an attempt to overcome the level. But let's see for a moment what it is exactly and how it aims to achieve the coveted goal of entertaining us pleasantly. Beethoven for Ducklings The game immediately presents itself with its characteristic of colorful joy: our Maestro conductor is none other than Presto, a pink duckling who will have the task of performing the tracks offered. The graphics are far from excellent, and not even beautifully finished, but in any case it manages to do its job which, after all, needs more functionality than particular visual frills. Already from the tutorial we realize that we are faced with a mix between platform and rhythm game elements, with our orchestra conductor engaged in the execution of musical notes as he jumps from one wire to another, collecting fruit and remembering kill spiders that, you know, have absolutely nothing to do with Beethoven. After the not exactly very short and all in all fun tutorial we are preparing to engage ourselves in the challenges that the actual game offers, to tell the truth with a surprise that is not exactly very welcome. There are only three tracks in this version of the game for Apple platforms: Beethoven's Fifth, Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 and Dvorak's New World Symphony. In all cases, these are obviously short excerpts of the most famous topics to the public. The pieces will be repeated for the three difficulty levels of the game: once all have been completed with a score of at least B+, the same three pieces will be accessed in the more difficult version, for a total of nine executions to finish the game. My kingdom for a metronome The duration of the game would not be a huge problem, especially if we consider that it is offered to us at the price of just 0.79 euro cents, an extremely low cost which abundantly justifies the ~play and run~ feature of the title. However, it would have been nice if you had chosen to insert a few more tracks to vary the gameplay from one difficulty level to another, or perhaps insert end-of-level bosses. But even that is forgivable. Especially considering one fundamental thing: the game is fun. The gameplay sees the game screen scroll horizontally on the screen and what you have to do while our pink duck runs frantically to keep up with the rhythm of the song undertaken is to draw vertical lines on the screen in parallel to the light bars that appear on the wires that make from path to the duck. Obviously to the rhythm of the music: the right moment to touch the wires and make the notes resonate is when the duck passes over them, if you have more eye than ear. We must also be careful of the interruptions on the string which can cause the frenetic orchestrator to fall: it must be plucked to make it jump. There are two fundamental enemies that you meet: spiders to be killed with a touch of your fingers and the red notes that represent out of tune. If you're good, you'll have a row of little green ducks to testify to your talent. The real problem, possibly, is its difficulty: while Beethoven and Chopin are leaving which is a pleasure Dvorak really risked producing flying iPhones. Across the room. But not so much for the lack of execution skills, as for two structural problems that are the real moles of the game; the first is the imprecision with which the touch on the notes to be played is sometimes perceived: if there is no exact detection it is clear that the notes will be wrong or that the duck will not jump and risk falling. Patience, even in this case it would be a venial sin considering that an error can, in principle, be recovered. The cardinal sin, the second real mole of the game, however, is not of a technical nature but of a design nature. It has been said that to pass a piece and move on to the next one you need to get at least a B+ score. And that some inaccuracy generates errors. The result of this two plus two is compounded by thefact that the final score is not calculated on the basis of the integral interpretation of the passage but only on the way in which the finish line is crossed. At the highest levels you must be able to finish with five green ducklings and the crown and the problem is that a small mistake at the end of the course is enough to jeopardize the entire execution, perhaps perfect up to that point. Considering that the latest notes are the most difficult and also those with the greatest sensitivity problems, at least in Dvorak's case, you will understand the reason for the flying iPhone a few lines ago. But believe us: it can be done. And at the dentist it is much better than Novella 2000. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-17", "grade": "7.5"}
