{"name": "Toki", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toki-la-recensione-ps4.html", "text": "It would be really hard to pick a better season than summer to write a review of Toki. Or rather, the remake of Toki: do you know those old voluminous, noisy cabin cruisers that probably consumed half of the daily electricity of the bathing establishments in a few hours? We're talking about almost thirty years ago of course: it was the 90s, and playing the arcade on duty immediately after lunch was practically a ritual. Alongside the more famous Metal Slug, Puzzle Bobble and company, it was not uncommon to find Toki too: initially disdained by game room players, he soon achieved remarkable success. It was fun, it was colorful, and it required you to learn very few game mechanics: jump, shoot, progress towards the end of the level eliminating all enemies along the way. In the time since 1989 the TAD Corporation has now gone bankrupt, but thank goodness Philippe Dessoly (art director) and Pierre Adane (programmer) are still alive, well and active in the industry. And so here we can provide you with Toki's review for PlayStation 4: let's try to understand how much and how the title has aged and above all if it still makes sense to devote your attention to it. Plot and gameplay: Toki is back From the outset, Dessoly and Adane's goal was to give the 1989 game back to the public, updating it only in terms of visual rendering: the goal was largely achieved, since Toki really remained the same game as almost thirty years ago. Not that this is a problem, indeed probably the greatest value of the production is precisely that of having brought back the gameplay that made the original title so famous and that has entertained players in arcades for years and years. Not even the narrative sector has been altered in the slightest: the player's aim is to take out the bad guy on duty, controlling the movements and actions of Toki, the protagonist hero of the same name. The assault by the sorcerer Vookimedlo on Toki's village is merely a narrative pretext to set events in motion: not contenting himself with declaring war on the village, the sorcerer kidnaps Toki's girlfriend and transforms the latter into a grotesque (but traits funny) ape. Of course, this is not enough to make the hero give up on his intent: Toki begins a long journey (along six worlds to be exact) in search of his fiance, during which he will have to contend with small and large henchmen of Vookimedlo. The few narrative lines necessary to understand the unfolding of events are provided from time to time before starting the specific game world: they are also fairly detailed, although purely ancillary. After all, Toki was not played (and is not played) certainly for the plot. Fortunately, in addition to the narration, the gameplay has also remained the same as always, and this means that for most of today's players Toki will be a damn difficult title. One of those that will occasionally lead you to desire the complete and total destruction of the PlayStation 4, by means of petrol or giant hammers. Toki knows how to be sneaky and frustrating like few video games, and it was certainly one of the most infamous even in 1989: this is because beyond the immediate and intuitive game mechanics, within the reach of all age groups, the level of difficulty is been deliberately calibrated upwards by the developers themselves. First of all, the protagonist is extremely fragile, and always in constant danger, as could be a crystal glass inside an active volcano. It doesn't matter which enemy hits Toki, it doesn't matter if you accidentally bump into the spike of a save that you hadn't even noticed in the slightest: today as then, the monkey will fly away towards game over, in a funny leap towards the underworld. There are also few credits available to the player: the ~easy~ game mode would actually be nothing more than the experience of the original arcade, which certainly wasn't even easy at the time; gradually it is then possible to harm yourself even more by setting direct permadeath or with other options that we strongly advise you not to even go and check. It should be noted, however, that the PlayStation 4 version can also count on a quick save system, which certainly comes in handy on more than one occasion. On the other hand, Toki has at least one series of power-ups on his side that can be collected along the fairly long six levels of the main adventure: there is the breath of fire that invests everything it encounters, the charged energy spheres, the triple blow and a few tricks up his sleeve that will either be collected from the ground or obtained from the gods dropenemies eliminated. From time to time there is no lack of help of various types, such as extra time to complete the levels (and yes, there is also the timer to chase the player), or sneakers that allow you to jump higher. Don't even think about extra lives, since they generally require very high risks to collect. The aids, however, in general are few, especially considering the amount of enemies that you will find yourself against at every corner of every single level; it should also be kept in mind that everyone is placed in positions that are never random, and that from time to time the approach, the inclination of the shots and the strategy must be very precise. If you don't pay attention to every single step it is likely that you will never be able to save your girlfriend and become human again; but the satisfaction that comes once the game is completed is difficult to express. Playstation 4 trophies The remake of Toki on PlayStation 4 offers players the possibility to unlock a certain number of Trophies: however they are not many, and the Platinum Trophy is completely absent. A decision, the latter, decidedly questionable: it is very difficult, in fact, to be able to unlock all the Trophies of the game. Some require you to get high scores in the main game mode, others even require you to finish the game without using even an extra coin. If it was already impossible in the arcade, let alone thirty years later. The remake The remake of Toki was developed by Microids, as already mentioned in collaboration with the creators of the original game: from the point of view of the artistic direction, the graphic sector and the (rearranged) soundtrack, the difference is the same as between day and night. Indeed, this is probably one of the cases in which the remake factor gives its best results: nothing unchanged from a content point of view, everything updated from a technical-visual point of view. Backdrops, characters, enemies, power ups: every single game element in every single situation, including the map between worlds and menus, has been completely rethought and redesigned by hand, while maintaining total fidelity to the original essence. The sensation is precisely that of finding yourself in front of the original Toki, as if thirty years had never passed and it had actually arrived on the cabinet only yesterday, as beautiful as the current generation titles. It is hoped that the graphic rendering tending towards cartoonish will also be able to attract younger players, even if the latter will probably remain traumatized by the considerable level of difficulty of the production. There are few problems to report in the PlayStation 4 version of Toki's remake, mainly due to a certainly annoying factor: the input lag, accompanied by short slowdowns. These are sporadic cases, never really invasive, but it is possible that they occur precisely in the most dramatic moments of the level, where they can then prove fatal and lead to game over, moreover within a game whose general difficulty has already been talked profusely. But they are certainly not defects that can distract from a hypothetical purchase, indeed probably one of the first patches arriving on PlayStation 4 will correct them in the sprint. And if the nostalgia factor alone is not enough to make you go back to courting the simian Toki, the speedrun mode could certainly provide you with an extra incentive: of course, some purely aesthetic contents would also have been appreciated, such as sketches and bonus images, but you will have to settle for the jukebox with all the audio tracks.", "date": "2019-06-17", "grade": "7.5"}
