{"name": "Weird War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/weird-war-2.html", "text": "Sometimes you come across really unusual and light-hearted titles. As soon as Weird War is installed, it is clear that we are dealing with an exponent of this category of video games. Pure insanity, a very intuitive game style and a pinch of madness invite any player looking for frivolous adventure to such a title. The war to which the title refers can only obviously be the Second World War. While lending itself as an excellent contextual scenario to the story, the great conflict with the development of the story has little to do with it. The protagonist, grappling with a nefarious shipwreck in an attempt to repair the damage to his boat in order to return as quickly as possible to sail the seas chasing Nazis, is on the African shores ready for an incredible adventure. In fact, soon the events will lead him to lose the main track to venture into a surreal scenario, from the edge of the desert to the snowy peaks of northern Europe in search of ancient tombs and magical weapons. English humor Wandering around the map it will be possible to come across inhabited areas where you can have a chat and gather information on the mission in progress, buy objects and reveal the secrets learned during the course of the story. Every single character is highly customizable and in addition to particular and individual characteristics and abilities it will be possible to modify its appearance through the combination of numerous items of clothing. As in any self-respecting RPG, the dialogue part has a fundamental weight. And it is precisely in the dialogues that the player will have to support that the comic vein of the game is hidden. It is almost always a subtle irony, typically English, based on little exchanges of ~acidic~ and improbable jokes. Meeting Bedouins with rather alarming names, such as Osama Laden Bin, or finding yourself having to share the path with a camel with almost human characteristics should therefore not surprise you. A totally British humor also pervades the definition of classes and skills that transcend the classic RPG to propose improbable characteristics, such as ~Boring reading~ for the intellectual class, which gives the character the possibility of foisting the enemy with very engaged thus weakening its agility and resistance. In total Weird War offers three character classes, 7 specializations for a total of about fifty different skills. The technical department It is necessary to spend a few more words on the graphic and technical aspect. The game has a decidedly dated look, something very similar to what was seen with Diablo and the old RPGs. The reason is simple, in fact Techland seems to have already decided to complete the development of this game based on the isometric engine already used in Another War. Obviously Weird War uses an updated version of this engine, which however must necessarily surrender in the face of the next generation 3D engine revolution. According to Pawel Kalinowski himself, producer of the game, this title will probably fall into the category of the last videogames users of this kind of isometric old school applications. Indeed, this product cannot be judged from the graphic aspect, since it would risk an unjust demolition of a title that is still valid in terms of playability and entertainment. It is clear that Weird War still remains a product that cannot be compared to the two major inspiring genres. Nonetheless, the hybridization between RPG gameplay and Diablo's more action-oriented arcade approach paid off. Final comment In conclusion Weird War is aimed at all those who love adventure and irony. The banter of this game often distracts from the actual game scenario. Were it not for the haunting presence of the Nazi bodies scattered throughout the three main settings that can be visited during the course of the events, one would run the risk of forgetting that one is in the middle of the Second World War, elements which can be traced once again to one of the inspiring elements of this title, i.e. films like Indiana Jones, where the war element willingly gave way to the adventure and fantasy of the proposed story, and why not even a pinch of surrealism. Diablo & Baldur's Connection The gameplay of Weird War closely resembles that of the best known action RPGs. At first glance, one would swear it was a Diablo clone. Same ways of moving and managing objects, except for the fights, managed through a hybrid mode that allows you to switch from real time to a ~suspended~ mode that recalls that of the mostwell-known RPGs of recent times (Baldur's Gate above all). It is in fact possible to call up the pause whenever it is deemed necessary to better organize the party of characters and the equipment in view of the clash. The fights, while joining in equal quantities to the more relaxed parts based on dialogues and the exchange of objects between the characters and the NPCs, play a fundamental role in the structure of the game. As already mentioned, it is possible to freeze the game during the action and meditate on what to do, a point that puts a serious division with games based solely on action because it introduces several strategic elements. The structure of the combat itself, however, sometimes leaves a little perplexed because it is easy to be faced with close-up firefights that leave little to the imagination and tactics, in favor of chaotic and less manageable action.", "date": "2004-05-13", "grade": null}
