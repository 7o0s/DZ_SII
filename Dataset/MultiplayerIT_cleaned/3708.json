{"name": "Katana Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/katana-zero-recensione.html", "text": "The first moments of Katana Zero can be misleading, appearing as a simple action platformer with stealth elements under a graphic surface that does not have any particular characteristics, in the midst of the large amount of 2D games with pixelated graphics. However, just try the first schemes to find yourself sucked into a perfect mechanism, made up of timing, speed of execution and strategy, capable of exalting the player by placing him in the role of an infallible samurai assassin armed with a katana. It soon turns out, however, that this well-structured gameplay is also based on a narrative substratum of a certain interest, able to propose dialogues that are not at all trivial and rather bizarre situations, inserting everything within a futuristic pseudo-cyberpunk frame which does a great job of compacting the gameplay experience into a fast-paced and interesting tale. There is clearly a bit of Hotline Miami inside and some solutions are even reminiscent of the good old Viewtiful Joe, but the composite mix of elements at the base of Katana Zero, the protagonist of this review, works almost perfectly, at least while it lasts . In a future world that has just come out of a long war between two opposing factions that has left its marks throughout civilization, mysterious occult organizations seem to take part in power games on the skin of a subjugated population kept in the dark. The protagonist of the story is an assassin dressed as a samurai and armed with a katana who is commonly called ~The Dragon~, a war veteran but completely devoid of memory as a result of a serious wound. Or not? Although the gameplay is all about action, the narrative is built with remarkable skill and includes hallucinations, nightmares, delusions, psychoanalyst sessions and mysterious phone calls, all to constantly instill doubt about what we think we are and even the fact that what we are seeing on the screen is really happening, in a progressive fall of certainties and the discovery of new and obscure backgrounds. You start out being simple hitmen who follow orders without asking questions but end up finding yourself in a whirlwind of existential questions that lead to truly unexpected consequences and situations, also thanks to the particular dialogue system that allows you to choose various interaction possibilities and attitude to adopt. Sword master The story is much more than a simple outline in Katana Zero and contributes strongly to characterizing the game by instilling a very special atmosphere, which perhaps its appearance may not bring out much, but the gameplay is certainly the fulcrum of the whole game. experience. The action is proposed as if it were a continuous planning of moves to be implemented to tackle each level until the definitive solution is found: that's why, instead of a ~game over~, the protagonist's death brings with it the writing ~No, this wouldn't work~ and restarts us at the beginning of the pattern. We thus understand that what we are witnessing is a sort of mental scheme of the protagonist and that the real action corresponds only to the run in which we actually manage to complete the level, which is promptly recorded on videotape to be able to be reviewed in full, in a solution bizarre but which finds explanation within the strange narrative frame of Katana Zero. In any case, it's a system that works very well both to encourage you to keep trying, given that the checkpoints are close together and the loss of time practically reduced to zero (just like in Hotline Miami), and to increase the exhilaration of a sequence performed particularly well with the possibility of being able to review it recorded, as well as finding justification in the story. The protagonist can jump and deliver lightning strikes with the katana, roll, sneak, camouflage and throw objects but also manipulate time, with the ability to slow it down to dodge and deflect blows with the blade or ~predict the future~. The latter is the expedient used to explain the samurai's ability to always try new solutions to complete the levels, a power conferred on him by a mysterious drug that is injected into him daily by the disturbing psychoanalyst-boss and which allows him to live and relive repeatedly a situation until he can find the right solution. There are no energy bars around here: with one shot you eliminate enemies but it only takes one to be killed, which means you die easily and often. There are some noticeable difficulty spikes throughout the game but the ease with which you get back into the gameit is disarming and makes it really difficult to break away and finish the attempts, however frustrating the more advanced sessions may become. Enemies with different skills and weapons require different approaches and the ability to exploit the scenario to one's advantage between openable doors, alternative passages, objects to throw, elements in which to hide and security systems to evade and perhaps turn against enemies also becomes important. In short, the slashing with the katana remain the basic element in the game action, highlighted by copious amounts of blood, but in addition to the speed of execution and precision, a certain strategic approach is also needed to survive. Katana one, none and one hundred thousand The gameplay mechanism is so well studied that we find ourselves wanting more, considering that Katana Zero is completed in a rather small amount of hours (we are quietly under 6 hours), compared to today's standards. Some elements of the game, capable of creating real twists, find little space to express themselves at their best and everything seems to be almost an anticipation of what will continue to be developed perhaps in a new chapter. The story is all there, mind you: the narration, as we have said, is well structured and intersects in a remarkable way with the game action and also with the particular way adopted to represent it, all made up of rewinds, montages and recordings such as if you were dealing with an old VHS, but some aspects could perhaps be further investigated. In any case, the price at which it is offered is well commensurate with the value of the game, only that we must consider a duration that is not particularly extensive and with few elements that can stimulate replayability, beyond the desire to see some possible variations exclusively within the ambit of the story, based on the choices to be made during the dialogues. The graphic style adopted is a classic pixelated 2D not too alternative or charismatic compared to the typical standards of this genre in indie productions. Scenarios and characters are well detailed and the animations, in particular, stand out for their richness and fluidity, which also works well to reinforce the excitement that comes from the combat system, but perhaps looking at the screenshots it may be difficult to grasp the rather marked character of Katana Zero, which instead derives from the gaming experience between gameplay and narration. On the other hand, the numerous visual effects applied in post-production are very particular, including distortions and various chromatic aberrations that should recall some typical behaviors of analog videos on videotape - a recurring theme throughout the game - or real system errors that expand the effect of disorientation in the face of the most bizarre situations in which the game places us. The soundtrack is also of excellent impact, which accompanies the action with appropriate atmospheres between techno and ambient to underline the basically cyberpunk setting. Unfortunately, the game is not translated into Italian, at least for the moment.", "date": "2019-04-21", "grade": "8.5"}
