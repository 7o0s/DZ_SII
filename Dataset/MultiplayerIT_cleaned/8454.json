First Person Zombies Following an increasingly common trend in mobile gaming, Dead Trigger is offered at an extremely low price and then offers the player a whole series of in-app purchases useful for grabbing the most powerful weapons and the juiciest upgrades faster : in this sense, the title behaves honestly, not exceeding in content blocked by exorbitant prices and basically leaving the freedom to the more patient to continue the adventure without further outlays of money. The emphasis placed on the accumulation of dollars and on the constant updating of one's arsenal is however quite strong, as evidenced by the absence of a proper plot and a playful structure made up of short missions and unrelated to a real narrative fabric. The user takes on the role of an anonymous survivor of the most classic of zombie invasions, and finds himself carrying out a whole series of tasks essential to his protection or that of the handful of humans he joins in the early stages of the adventure. A convenient map that serves as the main hub allows you to select your favorite mission, view your stats or go to the ever-present shop for a refill, all just a tap away. Round and round, however, you soon get to understand that in Dead Trigger the entire gameplay revolves around a handful of objectives, which end up becoming repetitive quickly: the scenarios can therefore require you to reach a certain position on the map, defend an outpost for a certain number of seconds, kill a fixed number of zombies or collect packages and bring them back to the beginning of the stage. The constant recurrence of the missions is also accompanied by a rather narrow diversity of settings and characters, which only exacerbates the feeling of always playing and replaying the same segment only with different weapons. In this respect, however, Dead Trigger can be forgiven thanks to the excellent amount of items of equipment that can be purchased, a gameplay that is nonetheless compelling and a well-calibrated level of difficulty. Moreover, it doesn't hurt that the MADFINGER Games title is one of the most graphically impressive works ever seen on smartphones: the settings -although not too vast- are treated in every detail and enriched by sumptuous visual effects, while the polygonal models of the zombies they're generously sized, well-animated, and feature ultra-sharp textures, all without sacrificing rock-solid frame rates. It's a pity that the developers didn't spend the same energy on the control system, no doubt a few inches lower than the decidedly more satisfactory results achieved, for example, by Gameloft with its latest FPS. With a solution inherited from the previous Shadowgun, the left part of the screen is delegated to movement, while the right part to aiming: a pity that the reactivity and precision are far from exciting and that the possibility of moving or reducing the dimensions is not granted on-screen keys, which often end up being pressed by mistake. The most obvious consequence, in terms of gameplay, is that the best results in Dead Trigger are obtained by standing in a corner waiting for the zombies to come forward. In short, not exactly the best of life for an action game...", "date": "2012-07-05", "grade": "7.0"}
