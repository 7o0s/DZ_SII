Although expected for several months more or less for this period, the release of the game had not been anticipated by any news, thus leaving the launch ramp for the Grasshopper Manufacture title that we had had the opportunity to try on the stage of the Sony event a few months ago. While counting on a minor direct involvement by Suda51, Let It Die brings with it several elements dear to the Japanese game designer, certainly among the most talented around in terms of originality. In the case of Let It Die, a very good dose of violence and madness is also accompanied by a free-to-play nature, interesting first of all because it allows anyone who wants to try this title to proceed directly with the download, and secondly to discover how Goichi Suda and game director Hideyuki Shin integrated paid dynamics into a title repeatedly compared to the Dark Souls series. Right or wrong? Let's find out together. Madness and originality are the basis of the good atmosphere of Let It Die, which, however, is not without its flaws Crazy climb Beyond the many side elements, the concept behind Let It Die is quite simple. In fact, in the role of a wrestler we find ourselves having to climb the Tower of Barb, an enormous structure born spontaneously after a series of earthquakes that have devastated the Earth. The journey immediately presents its eccentric nature, making us choose our hero from a series of people intubated in a subway car, before arriving at the stop where we find the good Uncle Death waiting for us. It is this ~cool~ version of the Grim Reaper, equipped with hypnotic glasses and skateboard, who accompanies us throughout the climb, setting the grotesquely violent tone of our undertaking while they spend the first few hours in the company of Let It Die and the explanations of this strange guide. Drawing inspiration from the roguelike universe, Barb's Tower is not always the same, but presents in its levels a set of rooms and corridors recreated every time the player finds himself walking through them. The various places are obviously populated by enemies of various types, mainly human (or more or less similar) without disdaining a few detours in the field of robotics. Defeating enemies is not only the only way to move forward, but also a necessity to ensure that our character has something to wear, given that at the start he finds himself practically in his underwear. Collecting loot that your opponents gradually leave on the ground is an integral part of the Let It Die experience, and perfectly sums up the concept of volatility at the basis of this game: clubs, helmets and other objects often have a very short duration and do not they are repairable, which puts the player in the position of having to constantly look for new equipment with which to continue his climb. Fortunately, in its headquarters it is possible to find a seller of objects, who also takes care of transforming the projects that we find during our exploration into real pieces. Speaking of weapons, the set of objects made available to us by Grasshopper Manufacture is quite colorful: the iron, surprisingly lethal, was at the top of our preferences, but for the more traditionalists there is no shortage of various types of maces and edged weapons . A place like the Torre di Bard also hides other things, such as mushrooms which, depending on their species, allow a specific use. They range from the classic recovery of vital energy to more particular situations, in which to launch the kitten on duty to obtain a real explosive bomb, a sleeping pill effect or a toxic cloud against enemies. Similarly, it is also possible to collect animals such as rats, giant toads and scorpions, to be tasted with appetite to recover life points between one encounter and another. Playstation 4 trophies Let It Die presents a total of thirteen Trophies, of which one gold, three silver and nine bronze. Most of them are naturally linked to climbing the Tower of Barb and defeating some enemies in particular, but also to collecting the collectibles scattered along the way. There is also no shortage of prizes for performance in Tokyo Death Metro, the game's multiplayer mode. Do you want me to die? For its combat phases, Let It Die has been repeatedly compared to the Dark Souls series in the past. Compared to the latter, however, the Grasshopper Manufacture title has some differences that fans of From Software's work must keep in mind. In the first place, everything is less refined, mleaving the player grappling with an aiming system bordering on a nervous breakdown and somersaults that never seem to want to respond to the first one. The attacks of the enemies are quite violent, but above all once started in series they rarely leave our character a chance. In such a situation, it is much better to approach Let It Die as a hack and slash in which you devote your experience to the attack, rather than proceeding between dodging and more reflective phases. The control system has some rather questionable choices, such as having mushrooms and animals selected with the touch pad of the DualShock 4 controller: by sliding your finger, you can switch from one object to another, realizing very soon how much it is possible to make mistakes in moments more excited. Eating an explosive mushroom instead of a healing one is a matter of a moment, after which you find yourself stone dead. This is one of the points where the free-to-play dynamics of Let It Die come into play, given that by spending a Death Metal (the coin obtainable for a fee) it is possible to immediately bring your character back to life. Alternatively, you can choose to pay in Kill Coins (the base currency) once you return to base, thus returning the dead character to the freezer intended to contain our heroes. We will return to this aspect after having explored the last possibility after dying: letting our deceased alter ego become a so-called Hater, infesting our games and those of others in the form of a CPU-controlled enemy. Changing character and letting the previous ones die is therefore an integral part of the experience offered by Let It Die, within which, however, there are elements destined to remain linked to our player profile. Unlike character attributes like strength and endurance, for example, weapon experience doesn't start over. As the title Let It Die suggests, it is a game in which it is good not to get attached to anything, especially your alter ego: the choice to have it picked up from a series of inanimate mannequins is certainly indicative. Tokyo Death Metro We've already touched on Let It Die's HQ, but it's worth getting back to. In addition to managing our character, the waiting room represents the launch point for Tokyo Death Metro, the asynchronous multiplayer mode of Let It Die. In a similar way to other free-to-play games, this title allows you to launch attacks against the bases of other players; as per tradition, everyone can set up defenses, which in the Grasshopper Manufacture title are represented by fighters frozen in the freezer. If successful, a raid on someone else's base can lead the player to earn moderate sums, but not only that: by defeating an enemy character, it is possible to take him away, inserting him among those present in the freezer of his own base. It is therefore in all respects an experience similar to those of free-to-play for mobile phones, in which in truth launching a series of attacks can trigger a real escalation capable of distracting from the real goal of Let It Die. The waiting room is also the only place where you can exit the game without losing your life, but also go for a ride in the Tokyo arcade where we actually are: the bizarre world of Let It Die ce in fact presents it as a meta-game that breaks the so-called fourth wall, proposing a situation in which our alter ego is not actually the one who climbs the Tower of Barb but a player who sits comfortably in front of a video game Hated Arcade. To keep him company we find Uncle Death himself, a bartender who dispenses missions and another patron of the club, from whom valuable advice comes. One of them, how to reload weapons (L2+X for left weapon and R2+X for right one), comes rather late. Trips from the 80s Does Barb's Tower and its secrets really exist or are they really just a game? What is hidden behind Uncle Death's mask? These are just some of the questions that Let It Die manages to plant in the player's head, captivating him with a decidedly inspired setting, on which an important investment of time by the developers is evident. A dreamlike, indeed nightmarish atmosphere, fueled by a series of videos to which Grasshopper Manufacture has decided to delegate the narrative aspect of Let It Die, thus obtaining the possibility of immediately lowering the player into the unbridled violence that distinguishes this title. The contaminations are manifold to the point that it becomes impossible to try to list them all, including thosefrom Goichi Suda's previous works. Although the involvement of the good Suda51 is in fact lower than in other titles born from the Tokyo team, the madness and gore to which the former gravedigger has accustomed us does not make us miss them, up to moments in which the bizarre Let It Die can even be disturbing. In purely technical terms, Let It Die certainly does not cry out for a miracle with its graphic detail, even if we must bear in mind that we are still talking about a free-to-play game. The originality of the style still manages to fill the gaps in detail, even if something more could and should have been done to give the corridors and rooms of Barb's Tower a modicum of extra variety. On the other hand, we find Akira Yamaoka, an expert composer of the Silent Hill series and therefore a guarantee in creating and selecting melodies capable of transmitting the disturbed nature of Let It Die even in the player's ears. To do this, Yamaoka has relied on a fair number of musical groups and soloists, who have created an excellent soundtrack that you will perhaps want to listen to outside the game as well. We close by analyzing the free-to-play aspect of Let It Die: although it is not a pay-to-win title, the effort of Grasshopper Manufacture inevitably encourages the player to spend to bring back to life the character who died under the blows of a high-level Hater that came out of nowhere, or for example to speed up research and development times in the waiting room. Climbing the Tower of Barb without spending a penny is still a possible undertaking, provided you have a dose of full-bodied patience.", "date": "2016-12-19", "grade": "7.0"}
