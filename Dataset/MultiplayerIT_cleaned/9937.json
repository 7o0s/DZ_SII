If the answer includes the slavish reiteration of ideas already seen and a level of cleanliness that is not exactly stratospheric, then Singularity could be for you. Raven Software's latest arrival was ready months ago and was postponed so as not to end up crushed among the most famous releases of last winter, finally being launched into the fray by an Activision that probably believed little and will believe it until the end ; a pity, considering how much this imperfect work lends itself to being enjoyed by a certain number of users. The approximately nine hours needed to complete the adventure start from a premise involving good old Mother Russia: a group of American special forces soldiers, including the user's alter ego, is shipped to Katorga 12, an island in the off the eastern ex Soviet Union where after the Second World War experiments were conducted concerning the element E99, an addition to the periodic table available only in the subsoil of that lost point in the middle of the sea, an energy source with enormous potential which however, it was soon found to be useful in applying the most bizarre quantum theories of space and time. After a decidedly unorthodox landing, what initially appears to be an abandoned place turns out to be something much, much scarier. The art of getting by As mentioned, Singularity is a continuous referral to other works. From a narrative point of view, the first hours are not a little reminiscent of Bioshock: Katorga 12, like Rapture, represents a small ecosystem built to support a specific objective - now the use of a new resource to make Russia invincible, now the elaboration of a better society than the one built by men on the surface - which is illustrated to the player through a series of tricks, such as the now classic audio recordings scattered throughout the levels or films made to introduce newcomers to life on the island, thus trying to make the game environment more immersive and believable. However, the similarities stop here, leaving room for an extremely linear progression that will lead us to change the sequence of events by jumping back in time, meeting old physicists eager to change history and also a secret organization whose actual usefulness for the purposes of history remains in power, a little wasted. Therefore, it takes its hands full from the various Cryostasis and Half-Life 2, quoting them in a plot that holds up, also thanks to a successful atmosphere, when in the course of its development, but presents several little sensible points when at the titles at the end the reflections on what happened overlap. Similarly, the gameplay does not invent anything, preferring to add bit by bit elements freely taken from other works. In a level design made up of corridors and small more open areas, generally well-made although ultra-guided, the use of normal firearms therefore alternates with the Temporal Manipulation Device - or CMT - or the maximum expression of post-war engineering. E99. A device that, somewhat as seen in Timeshift, allows you to alter the normal flow of time, aging or rejuvenating objects and enemies, creating bubbles that slow down to immobility what is inside and finally acting as a gravity gun-like so as not to miss another quote from the Valve masterpiece. Many elements that combined with others, such as the not very useful weapon growth system and the much better implemented one of the CMT, are well exploited in a number of different scenarios: the shootings follow one another with always some new gadget or power to experiment and the environments, also the scene of some puzzles of honest realization although perhaps a little too similar to themselves in the end, offer a good variety of situations, also influencing the playability as in the case of a long session with the face covered by the anti gas, kept alive by oxygen cylinders scattered throughout the rooms of an old military facility. In short, Raven Software takes inspiration, even copies, but manages to entertain throughout the more than discreet duration of the adventure, always adding new elements rather than refining them beyond belief. Singularity involves without particular pretensions or flashes of genius and in this sense the paradigmof the entire experience is the sniper rifle, equipped - unique in the entire game - with a sort of slow motion, an ability that lacks a coherent justification, probably added afterwards so as not to make the weapon useless in too frenetic and often close clashes, but which on several occasions we end up using with satisfaction. Gear changes The previous lines served to affirm the unusual, varied but not very original composition that at a certain point was found in the software house's design documents. The next step, or rather the way in which these pieces have been arranged, is perhaps the element that can be the most controversial and subject to personal judgement. Singularity starts very slowly, very concentrated on the plot and on illustrating it, with few bullets available so as to increase the feeling of danger within environments created more to frighten than to kill, and then alternates between different moments in fits and starts, with shootings furious that are very reminiscent of those of the id Software titles - Raven has worked on both the Quake brand and Wolfenstein - and sessions bordering on stealth, seasoning everything with an excellent variety of different enemies, human but not only, equipped with normal fire or psychic and physical powers out of the ordinary. The lack of coherence does not help the credibility of the events from a certain point of view, on the other hand favoring the more strictly playful aspect, or rather the most successful thing you can get out of the DVD included in the package. Careless aspects, such as an artificial intelligence that gives its best when linked to some specific pattern, as in the case of some bosses, or is limited to the player's aggro, are thus overshadowed in favor now of the frenzy of action, now of the variety thereof. As a side dish, there would also be an offer for competitive multiplayer. Not much stuff given the presence of the classic deathmatch and a ~human vs mutant~ mode that will probably have little to say and even less will be played after the very first days of its release. Weapons for all tastes As mentioned, Singularity does not spare itself when it comes to putting a respectable arsenal on the plate. There are common firearms such as pistols, submachine guns and rifles, pump or sniper, while more exotic pieces are represented by explosive dart shooters, gatling guns, a rifle with remote controllable shots - identical to that of Clive's lieutenant Abigail Black Baker's Jericho - and a grenade launcher with dual modes of fire, normal or with a bomb that can be moved at will once it hits the ground. The expressive potential of the player, then, is further stimulated by the powers of the CMT which between shock waves, rays to age enemies until they kill them or make them monsters that can turn against their own companions, creating chaos, proves to be a respectable trinket. The engine for all seasons Visually the game is passable, nothing more. The island of Katorga is reproduced in a credible way and, especially when you are away from the aseptic laboratories, you can notice different levels that reproduce the rooms, endowed with a certain charm, once occupied by the families who inhabited the island. In the same way when the game allows you to alternate the view of certain places in both eras, the present from which the player's alter ego soldier comes and 1955, the year of the end of the experiments, there is no shortage of positive elements. On the other hand, the use of the engine developed by Epic, despite the efforts, gives back a certain feeling of plasticity that is often created when it doesn't end up in the wisest hands, also highlighting various problems in texture management, on several occasions poor of details or uploaded late. The effects alternate good particles with other less positive aspects, while the models are discreet, with a downward peak relating to normal enemy soldiers, really poor in details. Ups and downs that still don't affect the performance of the Unreal Engine 3, particularly light in this version with an average of more than 90 frames per second on the test configuration. The soundtrack, as well as the effects, are normal while the dubbing in Italian is discreet, which however loses the use of the typical - stereotyped? - accent of the Russian characters, instead present in the English version. The controls are the standard ones, with all the keys useful for the selection arranged on the keyboard and the activation of the weapons as well as the powers assigned to the mouse.", "date": "2010-07-01", "grade": "8.0"}
