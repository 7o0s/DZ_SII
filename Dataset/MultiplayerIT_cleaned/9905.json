The Rocketcat Games team rightfully falls into this category, a small group of three longtime gamers who, one day, decided to develop their own product for the iPhone. The result was Hook Champ, by far one of the best exclusive games to appear on the Apple platform so far; Super Quickhook is its spiritual sequel, destined to repeat the success of its successful predecessor. A grappling hook to rule them all The cornerstone of the mechanics developed by Rocketcat Games, and which acts as a common thread between Hook Champ and Super Quickhook is as simple as it is intriguing: in summary it is a matter of crossing the levels using in the vast majority of the time a grappling hook thanks to which you can attach yourself to walls, ceilings and ledges. Thus swinging from one hold to another, one must try to reach the end of the stage, possibly without falling into the void, lava or other mortal dangers. In reality, the description, we admit, is not particularly exciting, but fortunately things change a lot in practice. In the first place this happens thanks to the graphic style, which had already strongly characterized the first chapter; if in that case the inspiration was clearly that of 8-bit games with pixels in plain sight, this time the ~generational change~ brought Super Quickhook closer to the 16-bit era. In short, more colors, details, animations and elements on the screen, while retaining at the same time that fascinating retro style which is a fundamental aspect of the series. The same goes for the sound component, capable of bringing back at least 15 years. As far as gameplay is concerned, however, adjustments have been made with respect to Hook Champ such as to make the final product less demanding and punishing; this basically thanks to the inclusion of checkpoints within the levels, and to the elimination of the lethal ghost that instead constantly chased the protagonist in the first episode. The result is a game that is obviously very similar in terms of mechanics, but fundamentally different in terms of pace and the priority aspects that support it. In fact, if in Hook Champ you had to worry above all about being quick and precise, largely sacrificing the exploratory factor for the looming and perennial threat behind you, on the contrary in Super Quickhook you can take it more calmly, going in search of the secrets scattered in the settings and above all to collect coins. Once again, in fact, the economic factor is fundamental, since the protagonist's equipment and abilities can be improved with tangible and effective implications in the way in which the games are tackled. For the ~professionals~ the challenge factor remains high, in the face of the ranking system that rewards speed and the score obtained. The new Avalanche mode is also very pleasant, which in practice is a survival in which it is necessary to try to cover the greatest possible distance before being reached and hit by an avalanche. An interesting way both to add a little extra money and to further extend the already robust longevity of the game, which is also destined to be further increased with future content.
