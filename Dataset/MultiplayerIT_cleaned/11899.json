{"name": "Sega Rally - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-rally-recensione_a.html", "text": "Sega Rally is a name that only those who lived through the golden age of arcades can understand the importance of. In times when afternoons were spent inserting tokens to touch technological marvels that home consoles could only dream of, Sega was one of the software houses that most often settled on the front line by offering productions capable of attracting public attention. Today things are very different: following the crisis of the arcade market, arcades have completely changed their function, filling up with video poker and the like. Sega has lived through terrible years on the verge of bankruptcy, reinventing itself in a decidedly different formula from the past, and to meet the most technically advanced video games it is enough to sit on your sofa and turn on a next-gen console. In such a different gaming world, how much sense can the return of Sega Rally make? Game over yeah! We had the opportunity to talk about the version for Ps3 and Xbox 360 (LINK), but the Sega production did not want to forget the portable consoles, more specifically the Sony handheld or -obviously- Psp. Compared to the other editions however, this time the differences are not limited only to the technical aspect, but on the contrary they also involve some components of playability; all this basically because the realization was entrusted to a different team, that Bugbear Entertainment already author of the Flatout series. But let's go in order. Among the most positive aspects of this new Sega Rally, the fidelity on a conceptual level with the original must undoubtedly be underlined; in fact, the programmers did not want to try to tread new paths with the risk of distorting the franchise, but on the contrary they rightly preferred to create a product capable of making long-time fans happy and at the same time entertaining even those of Sega Rally who perhaps have only heard of. In a period in which the search for realism seems to be the common denominator in the (actually few) rally titles available, the production of the Japanese company is instead a hard and pure arcade without too many frills. The physics of the cars is in fact very simplistic, and there is no possibility of leaving the track which is delimited by the so-called ~invisible walls~. Adding to this the fact that there is no setting whatsoever except for the marginal choice of tires (for tarmac, dirt and mud), it is easy to see how Sega Rally represents an old-school racing game in which the important it's basically just holding down the accelerator and perfecting your drifting skills. Yet, if on living room consoles more than someone had complained about the excessive difficulty set by default, surprisingly on the contrary on Psp we are faced with the opposite problem. For anyone who is a little familiar with titles of this genre, it will in fact be almost child's play to systematically rank in first position, overcoming the all too submissive opponents one after the other. Furthermore, even collisions with the edge of the track do not compromise the speed of your vehicle too much, thus overshadowing the need to adopt clean and careful driving. And it is easy to understand how this situation affects the enjoyment of a racing game, since the challenge factor towards the high pilots is decidedly in the background. Luckily the track design is instead really good, offering tracks full of curves and which are a real pleasure to ride in the search to improve one's performance from one lap to the next. On the other hand, a greater number of tracks would have been preferable, which instead are in limited quantities to the point that you will soon find yourself forced to repeat them numerous times between one championship and another. Rallies for everyone The game structure offered by Sega Rally is quite standard, if not stripped down to the bone, offering the classic set of single races, against the clock and with the main mode being the championship. The latter, divided into classes which are in turn divided into single rallies, allows the use of rally cars, modified and historic; the cars are all under original licenses, and their reproduction is decidedly accurate and appreciable. By winning the various competitions you can then unlock other increasingly performing cars. More generally, graphically the Sega production on Psp represents a good exponent of the hardware's capabilities, especially as regards the always high and solid frame rate. But the settings also appear more than pleasant, with a good level of detail and a variety that leads from deserts to snowy roads over the course of a couple of races. The defects must be sought ina certain granularity of the image and in textures of not excellent quality, especially when viewed up close. But the limited capabilities of Psp compared to Ps3 and 360 are denoted above all with regard to the deformation component of the tracks, an interesting feature of the home console editions and in this case instead reduced to little more than a few overturning of tires and pins. Lastly, the multiplayer mode should be mentioned, which allows you to organize challenges both ad hoc and in the online infrastructure. Unfortunately, the scarcity of available options and the almost absolute lack of available users make the feature in question decidedly less interesting than expected. Comment Sega Rally for PSP is a different game than the Xbox 360 and PS3 editions. In fact, some of the features that made the home console version interesting have been lost on the Sony laptop, and above all the programmers have opted for setting a level of difficulty that is really too low which demeans the experience for every player with a little of experience in the automotive genre. What ultimately results is therefore a conventional product, fun in the short term but which certainly represents the least successful conversion of the lot of this return of the Sega brand. Pros Faithful in spirit to the original Technically good Pure arcade, like in the good old days Cons No challenge level Few tracks Online multiplayer almost useless", "date": "2007-10-25", "grade": null}
