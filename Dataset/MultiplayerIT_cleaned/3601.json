{"name": "Horizon Call of the Mountain: la recensione del primo gioco Guerrilla Games per PlayStation VR2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-recensione.html", "text": "The brand new PlayStation VR2 arrives and with it the review of Horizon Call of the Mountain, a virtual reality spin-off of Aloy's adventures where, however, this time Aloy is not the protagonist. Our alter-ego will instead be Ryas, a former soldier who between rescue, redemption and revenge will have to bend over backwards to be accepted by his new friends. The other dimension Horizon Call of The Mountain: a VR-only game with graphics like this, perhaps it had never been seen before Finally inside the new Made in Sony viewer! His hands are tightly wrapped inside these sci-fi white gloves, headphones tucked properly into his ears. All that remains is to press the teleportation button: after two deep breaths, we are literally catapulted into the world of Horizon. Not in front of the world of Horizon, as we've been happy to do in the past, but this time and for the first time literally inside it. If there's one thing virtual reality has proven it can do very well, it's giving you the sensation of being present in an imaginary elsewhere. You put on your helmet or visor, call it what you want, and it's like traveling in hyperspace: not only are you there, but you feel there and you're afraid of the void, you get excited by crossing another character's gaze, you experience different vibrations from those of ~flat~ video games. Of course, this feeling of presence can also be frightening at times, such as when you come face to face with one of the biomechanical beasts in Horizon Call of the Mountain. It doesn't suit you Horizon Call of the Mountain: battles with the biggest creatures can be really exciting Horizon Call of the Mountain throws you without too many pleasantries into action, and it's a smart choice because when you have a headset on your head you want to play, be active, and not just passively watch and listen to cutscenes and dialogues. But this is a setting that has a great desire to tell itself, and puts us in a political context that you have to know really well, having played and replayed Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, to be able to give it the right weight. If you are not a huge fan, every superfluous detail will turn into a blablabla that we would have gladly done without. Luckily Call for the Mountain isn't a long-winded game, but it chooses a narrative formula that has no time, no time, to work really well in VR. Memorable climbs Horizon Call of the Mountain: difficult not to be amazed by certain passages Even this new protagonist called Ryas doesn't exist after all, because the real Ryas will be us in the very first person. As heroes of the game we will essentially have to do two things: climb and fight. Much more the first to tell the truth, given that most of the time we will spend climbing mountains jumping between wooden scaffolding, ropes, bare and very hard rock and more malleable slopes, the latter to be tackled with ice axes. For us users, all this translates into exciting vertigo, and a tiring shoulder exercise that after a few hours will begin to be less and less fun. For those who have dabbled in virtual reality for a while, there isn't even a big novelty factor: the mechanics are basically those of The Climb and its sequel, a Crytek game originally released in 2016. In both titles, you reach out on the climbable wall and, once grabbed, you pull it towards you simulating the movement of a climb. The Climb however was a small game, in two hours you had finished it... Fortunately in Horizon Call of The Mountain there is much more variety, there is also fighting, and the fantasy context allows it to offer us various interesting tools which, however, deep down, never really change the game system. Each instrument, such as the sun disc used as a frisbee, is the reflection of a new, simple, environmental puzzle. The only difference will be the ice axes which will serve several purposes, but mainly to tackle the more malleable walls. Ice axes are also very fun to use because they never make you feel safe, and then it's really satisfying to stick them into the rock: you feel and perceive this ~ciach~ in the controllers that conveys just the right idea. Strange that they didn't come up with another solution to open the tool inventory: asking us to press the analog stick with the thumb, while trying to reach R2 with the index finger, didn't turn out to be a good idea. Bow and arrows Horizon Call of the Mountain: yes, we will finally be able to look Aloy in the eye, and it will not be the only familiar face you will meet With the bow, on the other hand, you play it safe and extract it, exactly like arrows, by carrying one of your hands over your shoulder. The bow is a weapon present in many games pIt's for virtual reality because it always works great: to aim you have to use the dominant eye as in reality, and it has a certain effect, moreover the use involves complex movements but which the sensors never have problems replicating in the game. It should come as no surprise that, with a state-of-the-art headset and controllers at your disposal, the Horizon Call of The Mountain arc is nearly perfect. Don't expect a simulator, the Sony game is always devoted to action and don't forget that you are heroes, but despite the presence of some aiming aids, hitting the target is never entirely obvious. On target Horizon Call of the Mountain: here too the machines will have weak points on which it is good to focus your aim In each level there are several hidden targets to find and destroy, great for occasionally shooting a few arrows, but from the bow you will naturally get the best out of it in combat. In clashes, Horizon Call of the Mountain blocks the view on the enemy, or in the center of the arena, allowing us only to move laterally. It's a clever solution, and it's a bit like a billion games usually against the biggest bosses. Through the keys and the movement of the arms, we will be able to take small steps or a large dodge that will put us most of the time safe from enemy blows. The actual battle is decidedly galvanizing: nocking the arrow, and waiting until the last minute to hit the right point of a lookout ready to jump on us, moreover with this graphic, is a concrete emotion. However, things don't always go the right way: beasts with a large range of movement suffer from the small size of the arena, and can remain stunned for a few seconds before returning to fight. It happens with the smallest and most agile beasts, which we can meet in groups; instead it goes much better against the larger, solitary biomachines, always ready to offer us great battles, always in conjunction with the best moments offered by Horizon Call of the Mountain. There are also stealth phases where we will have to try to climb without being seen by the surrounding beasts, and silent approach phases in the tall grass that directly recall the gameplay of previous games. The hunter's fun Horizon Call of The Mountain: the game also offers two extra modes, one for those who love exploration and the other for those who want to test themselves with the bow There is also a bit of exploration in the game. The progress is mostly linear, but forks and associated detours on the route are offered from time to time. Here too it is important to look everywhere, above all to find the parts of the arrow that will be used to create special ones (thunder, fire...). Exploring it is also possible to find many gadgets with which to play around and take advantage of the many nuances of VR: tambourines, juggling torches, brushes and paints, to have fun creating rock paintings. You open the lid of a barrel and you find two maracas... at which point you don't spend ten minutes singing mambo jambo in the living room? It's a bit of everything that can no longer be missing in a VR game, especially if designed for an audience that doesn't yet have great experience with technology and is ready to be amazed by every trick. Free movement Horizon Call of the Mountain: The use of colors is truly exceptional, shame about the audio a bit shy Horizon Call of the Mountain does not support movement with teleportation, but we will be able to move through the normal analog stick or by simulating the undulation of the arms. The latter is an atypical solution but already seen in the past, for example with the transposition into VR of L.A. Noire, and in addition to being functional, it really minimizes the risk that the viewer could cause some problems, such as the dreaded seasickness or motion sickness effect; the downside are movements that are not exactly agile during exploration, but which can be mitigated by turning (in reality and therefore in the game) on themselves to change the direction of the walk. However, remember to cyclically throw an eye out of the viewer, to see where you have gone and thus avoid unpleasant accidents. Between graphics and hammer Horizon Call of the Mountain: ropes, beams, rock walls... Horizon Call of the Mountain stands out above all for its graphics. If this was meant to be a showdown of what PlayStation VR2 can do, combined with PlayStation 5, then the goal can be said to be perfectly achieved. To increase the detail, much of the scenery is in the distant background, and the walkable and therefore more detailed area is always very limited. On the other hand, the audio sector is strange: the effects seem a lotsounds good and layered, but the sound is subdued, not very bombastic even where it could have been, and perhaps should have been. But they are details, Call of The Mountain is a beautiful game to see also from an artistic point of view, very colorful thanks to a beautiful saturated HDR. The game's problems lie elsewhere, for example in its unconscious predictability. With virtual reality you can create experiences that are impossible to replicate without a viewer, we have already had proof of this, Horizon Call of The Mountain is instead an attempt to transpose into the medium that should be more revolutionary the classic (literally) two-dimensional modern videogame, which here it shows twice its limits and resulting in the new context far too slow. The climb is fun up to a certain point, the clashes with the bow are too few, and in between there is this somewhat awkward exploration that is not surprising to the end.", "date": "2023-02-16", "grade": "7.5"}
