{"name": "Death Rally", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87364-death-rally-curve-molto-pericolose.html", "text": "While Hollywood, in constant decline of ideas, throws itself headlong into any source of inspiration or improbable sequels/prequels to continue churning out films, the world of video games also suffers from the same problem, both for reasons of economic risk (a title with resources from ~triple A~ but from poor sales could by now decree the premature end of a software house), both for objective lack of imagination as well as, finally, for the ease of towing by consolidated brands, whose sequels often represent an easy guarantee in terms of copies sold. Death Rally therefore arrives on iOS terminals about 15 years after its debut on PC, thanks to a technical sector absolutely in step with the times and a playability perfectly adapted to the sensitive touchscreen made in Cupertino. Twisted Metal without clowns? Both in Death Rally and in the famous David Jaffe saga, the protagonists are unleashed pilots driving armed and dangerous vehicles; however, while in the Remedy title the races take place on asphalt or dirt tracks, in Twisted Metal it is the arenas that provide the maximum fun, substantially changing the approach to the races. Driving a whole peculiar series of vehicles (ranging from modified dune buggies to armored vans, up to real ultra-handy supercars) the player's goal will be to win the various races present but, above all, try to stay healthy and functional until the finish line . In fact, using all available means it is desirable (but strangely not mandatory) to install active or passive weapons of various destructive levels; the firepower, as well as the handling characteristics of the vehicles are subject to upgrades thanks to the cash prizes awarded at the end of each session. Speed, handling and armor are the three parameters to be upgraded thanks to the victories obtained; in addition to placement, however, the main sources of income are represented by the destruction of opponents and the acquisition of power ups hidden in the boxes along the circuits, in the form of extra money but also health, turbo and ammunition. Finally, each weapon has 9 levels of increase, the achievement of which will gradually achieve larger and larger magazines. Speaking of artillery, the choice made available by the Remedy guys is quite wide: together with a sort of gun present by default on each car (and which inflicts light but constant damage), the front of the various vehicles can be mounted a rostrum to ram opponents or an effective laser sight, in addition to a single firearm chosen from shotgun, machine gun, sniper rifle, mines (which are left behind the vehicle), single missile launchers and, after having unlocked the ninth level above all the others, a small battery of guided missiles, capable of always hitting the target if within visual range. Once on the track, after having assembled the vehicles for the hard battle, Death Rally really gives its best: in fact, it is enough to run two or three practice races, just long enough to familiarize yourself with the simple controls (a classic virtual analogue of with which you accelerate, brake and turn and the right fire button), to find yourself mastering the vehicles naturally, also thanks to the two selectable views of the ~bird's eye~ camera, front or rear of the vehicle . Despite the small screen and the even smaller dimensions of the cars, the feeling of the cars with the various tracks is really well reproduced, even in terms of physics; although rather accentuated in fact, the game engine more than decently returns the difference in grip between, for example, the smooth asphalt of The Pit circuit and the dirt road of the Oasis. Added to these tracks are the Velodrama on asphalt, The Rift still on a dirt road (composed of many bridges over spectacular crevasses) and a circuit with an industrial background created in a refinery, very tortuous and with very tight curves. The races, to be repeated many times to accumulate credits and thus unlock the upgrades, will never be identical thanks to the good artificial intelligence and above all to the strategic use of weapons also by the CPU; in addition to the usual races (even in the opposite direction), special events will be randomly available, such as single-make/single-weapon races, races with the turbo always set by default, head-to-head, rally-style special stages starting in different directions, a lap or even grueling 40-lap marathons. In each circuit then one of the secondary objectives is the defeat of the local boss, indicated by an icon, which must be destroyed or beaten in speed to obtain extra bonuses; among the bosses is thealso the long-awaited Duke Nukem, as well as numerous goliardic quotes from existing actors and stars. After upgrading all weapons and vehicles, go head-to-head with the final boss The Adversary will be the official end of the game. However, the longevity of the title is quite controversial: if in fact the number of tracks and vehicles certainly does not appear high, the unpredictability of the races, combined with the 71 Game Center objectives available, could actually lengthen the gaming experience by a lot; the absence of any type of multiplayer, however, is to be considered a serious shortcoming, precisely by virtue of the chaotic and spectacular nature of the title. Finally, a last, well-deserved commendation goes to the technical realization, which on the latest generation Apple devices (see iPhone 4 and iPad 2) returns razor-sharp graphics with a granite framerate, full of details and with well-kept environmental views; the application is then natively compatible with both devices, without further disbursements for the tablet version.
