Band Hero is therefore dedicated to this potential catchment area, and comes on the strength of a more radio-friendly tracklist, a downward level of difficulty and a whole series of elements that favor party gaming. Which -obviously- could only go hand in hand with the most festive console in history: so let's see how the latest addition to Activision behaves on the Wii and what are its peculiar characteristics. Wii will pop you Let's start by saying that Band Hero is a new franchise so to speak: the similarities with the original Guitar Hero are everywhere, and the basic mechanics offer no surprises of any kind. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, especially for a genre in which the space for innovation is currently rather limited, but it is certainly true that we end up with a title that distances itself more for questions of image and tracklist and for actual aspects of gameplay (however present and which we will deal with later). The songs to be played therefore go fishing in the vast sea of hit parades, a choice that implies the declared objective of trying to satisfy the widest possible range of tastes: among the many melodies on the Activision offer it is therefore easy for anyone to find something known, even if it is clear that the lineup has been studied with the American public in mind, given the presence of well-known names overseas but much less here. If you want to nitpick, then, the basic offer on the disc is made up mostly of slightly seasoned pieces (which is not synonymous with classics, of course) that taste slightly of ~stock stock~. On the presentation front, however, Band Hero relies entirely on a simplified but not too much interface, and on a design obviously orphaned of the rock iconography typical of Guitar Hero: the available characters and the settings in which to play therefore show off a decidedly more trendy, perfectly in line with the different target users. Compared to the PlayStation3 and Xbox360 versions, the Wii graphic system obviously pays the price in terms of polygonal complexity and image definition, also showing a remarkable aliasing rate: the overall result is in any case discreet, even if a a little livelier would not have hurt. Not just songs However, under the casual dress of Band Hero there is an absolutely complete product from the point of view of gameplay, which in this sense has little or nothing to envy to more ~serious~ titles. The playful mechanics have remained the same, and it is therefore a matter of using guitar, bass, drums or microphone and keeping time with the indicators that appear on the screen. To truly allow anyone to pick up an instrument and play immediately, the new level of difficulty Basic has been introduced which simplifies the playful experience to the max, for example by requiring only the execution of the picking with the guitar in time, without pressing the keys. The whole game is generally more affordable than the various Guitar Heroes, even with regard to a Career mode which evidently does not represent the core of the product and which in fact has a very marginal role. As mentioned above, Band Hero is to all intents and purposes a party game, and there is no shortage of exclusive features designed to maximize this aspect. A special mode therefore allows you to freely play each track of the game without worrying about the score or any game overs: through a convenient drop-in system you can join the performance in the running by selecting the desired instrument, keeping in mind that the game tolerates every possible combination, so you can use four guitars, three drums and a bass, etc. etc. The connectivity with Nintendo DS is interesting, thanks to which you can select or change the lineup in real time. However, the combination with the handheld reaches its peak with the so-called Battle of the Roadies: in this mode, while one or two users play the guitar, as many players equipped with DSs must try to sabotage the opponent's equipment in real time using a series of fun mini-games that really add a pleasant depth to the group experience. The Mii Freestyle section concludes the roundup, in thewhich one can improvise jams and even make their own music video once again with the help of the Nintendo handset. Beyond these appreciable exclusive contents, Band Hero offers a whole series of elements to which rhythm game enthusiasts are now accustomed: therefore, there is an online store where you can buy new songs, a system that allows (for a fee) to import tracks of Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Guitar Hero 5, and even the GHStudio section through which to create your own musical compositions. In short, pop but with class.", "date": "2010-03-11", "grade": "8.0"}
