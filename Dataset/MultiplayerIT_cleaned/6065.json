Miller's incredible film is perhaps one of the most visually powerful works ever, thanks to its ability to tell everything without too many frills and incredible attention to detail. On the other hand, it is no coincidence, given that the Australian director practically invented the post-apocalyptic genre, codifying its rules, customs, characters and landscapes. But success can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can get crowds excited about all sorts of new brand announcements, and on the other, it creates sky-high expectations that aren't always met. For that reason we approached this Mad Max tie-in with due caution. Visually it looked very nice, but would it be able to hold its own against the cinematic experience? Let's get on board our V8 for the Mad Max review! Between game and movie Although the game is not strictly based on the film, Avalanche Studios worked practically in parallel with the film production, drawing heavily from the initial sketches and talking with Miller step by step, to make sure that everything was consistent with the ~canon~ . Therefore, we will not see Tom Hardy, we will not see Furiosa and it will not be necessary to have seen the film to enjoy the game, but we will find the War Boys, Gastown, the religious creed based on the V8 and on petrol, cars that look like rusty hedgehogs and, sifting through the notes, we will be able to read that the main villain, Scabrous Scrotus (the name was chosen by Miller himself) is related to Immortan Joe. The result is a brightly colored and hypersaturated product that will drive fans of the saga crazy with its breathtaking landscapes and car fights, but which leaves a bad taste in the mouth for some choices that are not exactly enlightened from a gameplay point of view. Let's get the tooth out right away, Mad Max's biggest problem is the same as many free roamings: the obsessive repetition of a routine made up of areas to be unlocked in sequence and tasks that follow one another more or less identical in all areas of the map. So here too, as in Far Cry or Shadow of Mordor, we will find outposts to clean up by killing all the enemies present, blowing up oil wells or eliminating a particularly big and angry boss. Inevitable, there will be areas to climb to explore the map and more or less difficult tasks that will be essential to reduce the influence of Scrotus on the area and unlock new upgrades and tasks. The execution of the missions is extremely linear, especially as regards the assault on the outposts. You arrive, take out defenses and snipers, enter, fight any number of screaming baddies and blow everything up. In short, the result is that after a while Mad Max tends to become monotonous and the real driving force that will carry us forward, more than the fun, will be the need to unlock an upgrade to see how it works or the need to scrape together scrap or lowering the influence of enemies to unlock a main mission, a choice we didn't like very much. As far as longevity is concerned, we can say that more or less the game will occupy about thirty, forty hours of your time; it depends how deeply you want to explore the world around you. A story not to be admired Exploration, which is the true essence of free roaming, is also limited by the clumsiness of Max who can only climb in certain points and has the jumping skills of a lame cow, so much so that even a knee-high wall can represent an insurmountable obstacle. Another big problem is managing the pace of the story. After a crackling start it drops drastically. Sure, we get into fights and cars blow up, we know what we have to do and the missions are consistent with the goal, but you don't feel a real threat, you never get the idea of being hunted by a guy two tall meters that binds the heads of slain enemies to life. Instead, what is rendered very well is the sense of precariousness of resources. Everything in Max's world is bought for scrap, so every opportunity will be good to stop and play the looters, stealing from the dead, feeding on what is around and using ammunition extremely sparingly. Hour after hour the game transforms us into individuals moved only by the survival instinct, ready to do anything to get that extra handful of scrap that would allow us to mount studded tires. My world is fire and blood The stories of Max Rockatansky all have one thing in common: they start with a loss. In this case, uA bit like in the film, our hero loses his beloved car in the most important moment, which is just before leaving for an idyllic area called Piana del Silenzio. Alone, without resources and without a car, Max is rescued by a decidedly colorful character: a hunchbacked mechanic named Chumbucket. Chum is a guy who has spent way too much time in the desert and doesn't have all his wheels right. He lives his life following the creed of the Angel of Combustion and treats cars, petrol, oil and engines with religious fervor. If Max were Frankenstein, Chum would be his Igor, a deformed and deferential helper ready to support his master in building a real monster created with parts of ~dead~ vehicles: the Magnum Opus, a perfect car that will allow Chum to fulfill his prophecy and Max to take revenge on Scrotus and finally begin his journey to the Plain of Silence. Before we get there, however, we will have to explore far and wide the wastelands surrounding Gastown, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of deserts, canyons, gorges, wreckage and remnants of a now lost era. From this point of view, the work done by Avalanche is simply perfect. Mad Max is able to offer incredible views, especially at sunset, when the light gets warmer and the shadows of the whale carcasses lengthen on the sand. The most incredible aspect is that despite dealing with a paradoxically homogeneous environment like a desert, the designers have managed to characterize each area in a convincing and characteristic way. We will therefore be able to roar among the blinding sands of a now dried up ocean of which only enormous now dried coral formations remain, try not to get bogged down in territories where oil dirty the earth, making the bottom muddy, navigate between gorges and crevasses, admire a 'huge barge poised on a rock and consume the screenshot key, capturing extraordinary panoramas. I am the one who flees both the living and the dead Although he doesn't have the features of Tom Hardy, our Max is undoubtedly convincing and over time we will be able to equip him with the standard leather jacket. During the adventure we will be able to improve his skills and equip him with spikes that will allow him to do more damage in close combat, a sniper rifle, special moves, an improved shotgun and other very useful gadgets for come out alive from any situation. In case we want to give him even more of a surly surviving hermit look, we can also lengthen his beard and hair, although unfortunately this will not discourage any assailants. To survive, Max will also be able to count on a water bottle, to be filled in the rare sources of clean water, and which will allow him to recover some energy. The water can also be used to curry favor with the nomads who roam the desert and obtain valuable information. In case this precious resource is scarce, his nature as a survivor will allow him to regain energy by feeding on dog food (obviously the Dinky-Di brand) or, in extreme cases, on the worms present in the carcasses. Obviously all of Max's features can be improved and to do so we will have to rely on a mysterious character called Griffa. This kind of holy man with a huge backpack will appear on the map from time to time and will allow us to spend the points accumulated with our businesses (such as killing more than a hundred enemies or freeing at least three outposts) by choosing from various characteristics. We will be able to increase energy, damage with weapons, the ability to find wreckage, improve fuel consumption and so on. Details that may seem minimal on the surface, but which in the long term can be fundamental. As a road warrior, Max is equipped with deadly and effective fighting skills to take on one or more opponents, after all, he didn't get the nickname ~Mad~ by accident. His vein of madness will therefore pop up at the right time in fights, allowing him after a series of combos and counterattacks to significantly increase his damage capacity for a short period of time. As far as melee mechanics are concerned, the reference system is undoubtedly that of Batman: one button to hit, one button for countermoves and one button to dodge, always trying not to be surrounded to avoid attacks from behind. In fact, Scrotus' men will not get ordered and lined up to attack us but will try to take advantage of every good moment to make us skin, luckily we will be able to draw on the scarce ammunition of the shotgun to thin out their ranks. In general this part of the gameplay seemed to us the weakest of the game; despite being well choreographed,it is based on somewhat woody and imprecise animations, it is certainly not very original. Nothing to do with the adrenaline rush of road racing. Four-wheeled duels According to the developers the game is ~60% to be played by car and 40% on foot~ and this is immediately evident by the incredible attention paid to giving the player an experience as close as possible to the Fury Road battles. Screaming engines, cars flying through the air, explosions, beaks, people throwing themselves on the bonnet to punch us, convoys to be attacked, harpoons that gut car bodies, there's everything we've ever wanted and if we wanted we could even capture and drive the raider car. The driving model is obviously very rose water and benefits from Avalanche's great experience in creating spectacular situations, which will allow us to perform incredible stunts, drifts, rams and spins without affecting the car too much. The only defect of this physics engine is that, making the cars very light, a stone on the road is enough to jump as if we were in an episode of The Hazzard or make us roll over badly, a decidedly unpleasant situation when we are being chased by two beetles that spit fire . Duels can take place in various ways: spontaneously, perhaps because we meet a lookout by chance or because we have to eliminate the opposing cars in a convoy or in a Death Race. In fact, scattered around the map there are some columns of cars and trucks that follow circular trajectories and that we can assault to obtain particular ornaments or get a large number of scrap. However, these challenges can only be faced after having properly upgraded the Magnum Opus because they will put us in front of a large number of vehicles that can't wait to tear us apart and transform us into yet another Wasteland corpse. In Death Races, on the other hand, we will simply have to arrive before the others, using one of the cars in our garage. It doesn't matter if we blow up the opponents' tank or if we take a shortcut. Admire it! The Magnum Opus is such an important presence in Mad Max that it can easily be called a co-star, since we will be spending a lot of time on board. His role is to try in every way to win the hearts of fans and supplant the Interceptor, a very difficult task which, it must be said, has been taken very seriously by the developers. The car can be disassembled and modified in every part, starting from the body up to the engine, the overriders, the ramming bumpers and other essential equipment for a world in ruins. The Magnum Opus is not only equipped with ramming-based attack tools, but with some very interesting gadgets. In fact, while we are driving, Chum will take care of providing us with support by clinging to the back, this will allow him to throw lethal explosive spears and use the grappling hook. This tool is especially useful for quickly neutralizing enemy vehicles. Initially we will only be able to use it to hit the drivers of less armored cars and drag them out, but once it has been upgraded it will be able to tear off wheels and pieces of armor, a key feature for eliminating convoys. Over time, improving and enhancing the Magnum Opus becomes an obsession, a real challenge with oneself, even if to do so you will need to complete some missions, spend a lot of time collecting scrap and decrease Scrotus' power on the territory with sometimes repetitive tasks .", "date": "2015-09-04", "grade": "7.8"}
