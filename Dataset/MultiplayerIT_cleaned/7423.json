{"name": "Pac-Man Museum+", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pac-man-museum-recensione.html", "text": "It's round, it's yellow and it looks like a pizza that someone has already eaten a single wedge of. We are obviously talking about Pac-Man, the famous icon of the entire gaming world, regardless of geographical latitude, historical time, even individual tastes. It was 1980 - many of you weren't born yet - when the historic arcade produced by Namco arrived in the arcade; character and video games had been invented, however, by Tru Iwatani. These days the yellow ball is once again being talked about, because Pac-Man Museum+, announced a few months ago, is finally in the pipeline practically everywhere: you can retrieve it on PC, on PlayStation 4, on Xbox One, on next gen through backward compatibility, and finally on PC. What better way to blow out the forty-two candles of the character, than to publish another very rich anthology? Because Pac-Man Museum+ is actually just that, a collection of fourteen historical video games, some more recent, some very old, even with some names that are currently unobtainable and almost unknown in our country. Well, the following Pac-Man Museum+ review will allow you to understand whether or not you should join the festivities. The pac-dots are on us. The contents: the definitive collection Pac-Man Museum+ includes returns old and new, for a total of 14 different titles We don't have to explain how to play Pac-Man, do we? Probably only the aliens don't know that the formula of the game consists in collecting yellow balls inside a labyrinth, obviously avoiding getting eaten by the four colored ghosts that inhabit it, namely Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (light blue) and Clyde (orange). Each labyrinth also contains four pac-dots that are bigger and brighter than the others, which allow Pac-Man to become invincible for a few seconds, also allowing him to eat the unfortunate ghosts along the way (but they will regenerate shortly thereafter ). This is the standard formula, ubiquitous and infinitely varied in Pac-Man Museum+. Which is nothing more than a full-bodied, essential anthology for all fans of the Bandai Namco mascot. The contents of the same, in fact, boast the presence - among other things - of a total of fourteen different video games, all taken with both hands and chronologically from the history of the franchise. There is the first, real, irreplaceable Pac-Man from 1980, and with it the initial, timid variations of the basic gameplay: Super Pac-Man, based on fruit to be freed and collected; Pac & Pal, with the added difficulty of a fruit-stealing green nemesis; Pac-Land, which suddenly transformed the video game into a platformer; Pac-Mania, 3D experimentation from 1987. And many others. Of these ~others~, some you have probably never seen, if only because they were absent in the previous Pac-Man Museum; they should therefore be considered as unpublished games. Pac-In-Time, for example, in which the hero finds himself transported to various eras of the past, with the aim of defeating an evil witch and thus returning to the present; basically an action adventure game that shares nothing with the standard formula of the series, except the presence of some fundamental characters. Pac-Man Arrangement is also back in the limelight, a delightful 3D iteration enriched by an artistic and sound direction that is still extremely captivating today. And ~new~ are also Pac-Motos, a welcome rediscovery dating back to the time of Nintendo Wii (2007); Pac 'n Roll Remix, the latter born on Nintendo DS and raised on Nintendo Wii (reminiscent of Super Monkey Ball); finally the most recent Pac-Man 256, whose pixels and bizarre powers, such as tornadoes destroying ghosts and bombs, have probably already marked you on consoles between 2015 and 2016. A personal game room Pac-Man in platform sauce? Pac-Man Museum+ offers that too In proposing its fourteen titles, Bandai Namco had a good idea: that of not simply combining a series of names within an anonymous main menu, but instead of allowing the player to create his own personal arcade. Once Pac-Man Museum+ has started, you find yourself inside a small room hosting a series of arcades: these are the historic cabinets, obviously made to scale, which have allowed you to play the various versions of Pac-Man Museum+ since the 1980s. Man, in Japan and Europe. The main hub consists, in fact, in the games room: and the player - who controls a 3D Pac-Man free to move in the environments! - he can furnish it as he sees fit. Initially it is explained that access to each individual title costs a token, exactly as it would in the real world. But unlocking new coins is very simple, just dedicate yourself a little to singsoils titles, thus earning many more. Pac-Man Museum+ also offers very different expressions from the traditional formula With these coins it is then possible to unlock decorative items and trophies at a vending machine in the corner, thus customizing the game room according to your personal tastes. However, it is not advisable to always and only devote yourself to the same title, for two reasons: some are blocked, and require having finished at least a couple of games with specific cabinets; moreover, the more matches of different video games will be completed (even losing in the first levels, it's not a problem to be denied with the series at all), the more visitors will come to the arcade. And these visitors are the colored ghosts! A further positive note is the presence of specific challenges for each of the fourteen titles in the collection. They range from the most intuitive missions (complete a certain number of games, eat a precise number of ghosts) to some seemingly impossible ones (get 50,000 points in the first Pac-Man without dying, for example). This stimulates the individual cabinets to be played and replayed, proposing different objectives to the various types of purchasers: the newcomer, or the one who wishes to devote himself only to the very first Pac-Man, will be able to do so without problems; the most demanding will instead find themselves grappling with proposals of truly significant difficulty, capable of keeping them busy for a long time. Customizing your own arcade is the real gem of Pac-Man Museum+ Finally, from a technical point of view, we have not noticed any problems whatsoever on consoles: loading is rapid, accessibility is intuitive and immediate, the emulation of individual games is practically perfect. It is also possible to change the screen size of the arcades and, to some extent, their colours. Nothing to tear your hair out of, but it's good that there are also these customization possibilities. Finally, all the menus are in Italian and even the Pac-Mans who have never left the land of the Rising Sun have been enriched with subtitles in our language, thus making that minimal narration understandable even though it is present in the interlude scenes.", "date": "2022-05-26", "grade": "8.0"}
