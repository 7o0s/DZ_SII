{"name": "Railway Empire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/railway-empire-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The charm of trains and railways seems immortal, regardless of technological progress, therefore a game that manages to put together the spirit of the model railway collector with the innate sense of omnipotence that derives from the construction, organization and management of territories and resources of a ~builder~ with simulation elements can only arouse great interest, especially if well done, as we see in this review of Railway Empire. We are in the middle of the 19th century, with North America experiencing the first stages of organizing the new United States towards a concept of a united nation and in this operation the railway assumes a fundamental importance. With the economy of the New World starting to mesh, but distributed over an all too large territory, the railway and the train become an extraordinary instrument of union and even of national identity, managing to connect distant and disparate places of the new States United States of America. Our mission is therefore to retrace the grandiose project of building a trans-continental railway capable of joining the east coast with the west coast, through five chapters regarding the main story, in turn focused on different areas of the USA and placing us at the grappled with various problems and tasks to accomplish. Railway Empire is a ~tycoon simulation~ that puts various parameters under the player's control, from the construction of railway lines, trains and service structures to their management and organization, trying to keep them economically sustainable and perhaps profitable. Said like this it may seem like a title dedicated specifically to a small niche of enthusiasts, but in truth Kalypso has managed to build a rather balanced game, which thanks to a gradual progression and a good tutorial, in addition to the irresistible charm of trains and railways , is enjoyable for everyone, and this version for Nintendo Switch also adds the gift of portability to the whole thing. Pocket railways Railway Empire originally came out in 2018 on PC, PS4 and Xbox One getting very good feedback already at the time and its strengths have been transferred quite intact to Nintendo Switch too, with the physiological weaknesses but also some additional advantages, such as portability and the double control system that also uses the touch screen. The game modes have remained the same and there are also some additional DLCs, which offer new scenarios set in Europe, which can be purchased separately on Nintendo eShop, while the main contents are all focused on North America between the 1800s and 1900s. There are various game options, such as the Scenarios that require you to complete specific objectives within different environments, the free play and the Sandbox mode that allow a more personalized and free approach to building your own railways. The main mode is instead the Campaign, which stages the mission of building the coast-to-coast railway line within progressive chapters also characterized by a certain narrative substratum, inspired by historical events. This is the mode that allows us to delve into the mechanics of the game, guiding us step by step within the complex game systems with great attention to the balance and organization of information. The mapping of the controls on the keys and analog sticks of Nintendo Switch is good and the on-screen indications are almost always present and clear at all times, complete with short videos that can be activated to understand precisely how to perform certain actions. The problem of the text remains: on the portable screen of the Nintendo console it is really microscopic and difficult to read, although it must be reported that it is completely translated into Italian and, obviously, the problem does not arise if you play connected to the TV. What is most striking in Railway Empire is its ability to scale from an overall view of the railway lines to the management of the more specific elements of each single section and station in an instant, a feature which is well reflected by the possibility of zooming in at any time from the map general of the State in which we find ourselves in a close-up shot a few meters away from the objects in the frame. We therefore pass from a macro-organization which consists in uniting the cities with the railway, establishing the routes of the various lines and their functions between the transport of passengers, mail and goods, to the solution of much more specific problems, such as the need to manage the individual stations by expanding them with new structures, areas for materials and passengers or establish the directions of movement of the individual sectionsin order to better organize rail traffic and avoid traffic jams or accidents. A complex but understandable system All this wide variety of actions is performed through a contextual system that opens up different options depending on the structure highlighted by the cursor, in addition to the classic radial menu that allows us to access the various construction, repair and management sections. The main elements are obviously the stations, which represent the focal nodes of the network of railway lines which act as a connecting system for the entire geographical area. The construction of the railways takes place in a semi-automatic form, once the starting point and the arrival point have been established, but it is possible to modify the route through an intuitive method of managing the junction points, even if the impression remains that it is difficult to have a Full control over track configuration. In all of this, clearly, we must consider that the privileged control system is certainly the mouse, and the excellent work done by Kalypso in adapting the interface to the Nintendo Switch controls does not completely remove a certain inconvenience of use. As a tycoon simulation, Railway Empire also bases a large part of its structure on the economic management of railway lines. The most important aspect to take into consideration is the cost of building and managing railways, structures and trains, but in general there are various aspects to keep under control which fall within the economic sphere of the entire geographical areas that we want to connect, therefore it becomes important to establish transportation lines that allow reference and commerce between cities, rural areas, factories and agricultural areas. In short, it is not just a question of guaranteeing the transport of passengers from one place to another: the railway network was the basis of the industrial and commercial fabric of the USA between the 19th and 20th centuries, which is correctly reflected in the need to organize the network of transport. This aspect is present in the game, even if to tell the truth it is rendered a bit confused by the interface and compared to other elements of the simulation it is perhaps less clear than others. Obviously, trains could not be missing from all of this: the somewhat model-making spirit that lies at the base of the fascination of the railway world can let off steam in the large number of vehicles available. These are vintage models, clearly, appropriately taken from the historical catalog of trains present in North America in the period under consideration, but it is interesting that these too are regulated by a particular skilltree which allows you to unlock increasingly advanced vehicles, focusing resources on research. The Nintendo Switch version The Nintendo console has already shown that it knows how to handle games that are normally aimed at PC users very well, in particular strategic, management and the like. There is a great charm, also in this case, in the possibility of carrying around a type of game that is usually associated with the most static position possible, or rather the desk with mouse and keyboard, which gives the Nintendo Switch version an edge in more. The most visible problem is the same that characterizes other titles of this genre, as we have seen for example with Cities Skylines: the sharp resolution cut applied to the game especially in the portable version makes close-up vision very confusing and dirty. Here too Railway Empire maintains the impressive zoom level which allows you to pass in a few seconds from an overall view of an American state to framing any detail of the map, but in the latter case the technical compromises to which the game met in the Nintendo Switch version. The outlines of buildings and elements of the scenario are confused and highly subject to aliasing, which obviously does not affect the fruition but partially ruins the pleasure of contemplation which is an integral part of this type of game. Even the implementation of the touch screen for the interface could perhaps have been more extensive, given that it is only a partial use that is limited to being able to scroll the map and zoom on it but without being able to perform more particular actions. However, practically all the characteristics of the original version are recorded within this adaptation, which still manages to offer the complete experience without reductions in terms of content and game systems.", "date": "2020-06-21", "grade": "7.5"}
