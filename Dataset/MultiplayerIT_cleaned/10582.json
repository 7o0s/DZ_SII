And in fact, between ups and downs, he achieved his main objective: to create a series of graphic adventures that could be inserted rightfully into the Wallace and Gromit universe created by Nick Park. The Bogey Man has the task of bringing the curtain down, starting with the last twist (so to speak) of the previous chapter. In Muzzled! in fact Miss Flitt misunderstood Wallace's intentions and mistook a bolt for a wedding ring - if we think that Wallace is an inventor, one can see the irony of this only apparent oversight. Luckily for him (Wallace's), Gromit discovers that there is one thing Miss Flitt's family cannot tolerate, and that is that someone is a member of the local golf club, of which Duncan McBiscuit is the president. From here begins a series of events that reveals ancient family rivalries and mysterious ancestors of the golf club, along a more interesting and articulated narrative axis than the stories proposed so far, but without the air of the first and third episodes. The pace is similar to that of The Last Resort, and for this reason The Bogey Man could have been placed among the central chapters, leaving an electric screenplay like that of Fright of The Bumblebees or Muzzled! for last. If these names sound obscure to you, it's because you've reached the end of the series: start from the beginning and everything will become clear. In the meantime, we proceed. Curiosity The Bogey Man is the fourth and final chapter of the series dedicated to Wallace & Gromit and developed by Telltale. Please note that it is not possible to purchase the episodes separately, as they are only sold as a complete package. Slow as golf The Bogey Man is the most challenging of the four episodes: after a couple of warm-up puzzles, it immediately begins to get serious. If you get stuck, all you have to do is try to use each collected object with what you see around you, but it could also be that you just missed something along the way. However, it would be better to follow common sense and ask simple questions; this is enough to finish even The Bogey Man, which runs away in the usual four or five hours. Instead, here is a novelty: in the central part of the game, when you visit the country club, you are faced for the first time with several interrelated ~minor~ puzzles, for which you can work out a small action plan. It is there that the series reaches its peak, at least from the point of view of mental effort. Too bad for the scenarios, which add little and indeed close several roads. The most annoying aspect concerns the house, of which we can only visit the entrance, the living room and the garden. Furthermore, except for the entrance of Felicity Flint's great aunt, there are no new characters, but all those seen so far return, including Monty Muzzle. At least you create some continuity in a series composed of self-contained episodes. In any case, even if the narrative tension is frustrated by a senile walk-in-the-park pace of events, there are solid gameplay elements that loosen the game's joints. A positive note concerns the now typical closure of the chapter, which also confronts a brilliant mini-game; brilliant not so much for the idea as for the expedient with which it was inserted. We would like to give you more concrete examples, but the game is so short that if we tell you even just a few stages you will miss out on at least a third of the fun. Still to be remembered are the voices of the voice actors, splendid in their Anglo-Saxon accent, and properly subtitled thanks to a well-done and inspired Italian translation. And now, it's time to say goodbye.", "date": "2009-08-10", "grade": "7.0"}
