The plot of the portable reduction of Street Fighter X Tekken therefore remains the same, but some contents change: the traditional Arcade mode has in fact been joined by the new Explosive Kumite, a survival mode in which our character must be able to beat as many opponents in sequence; but above all all the extras, warriors and costumes, released in the form of DLC for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions were immediately included. Speaking of the Sony home console, then, the game not only includes a voucher to allow the download free of these elements also on PlayStation 3, but uses the same servers for multiplayer, with the latter therefore acting as a cross-platform experience in which players can challenge each other regardless of the platform owned, guaranteeing a greater presence of opponents long-term online. The wait is therefore rewarded in this way, but will it be enough to guarantee the success of Street Fighter X Tekken? We will only find out in the coming weeks, in the meantime let's try to understand exactly what we are dealing with. Yet another crossover produced by Capcom, with the various Ryu, Ken, Guile and Chun Li of the Street Fighter series who cross their blows with the Tekken roster in full force, for a total of over fifty characters, the game proposes in many ways the ~simplified~ approach of Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, which effectively eliminates the super as we are used to imagining them and focuses its attention on the execution of the combos, which in this specific case can also be built while performing the ~ tag~ with your partner, dealing massive damage to your opponent. Fighting game DOC Purists of the genre should not be deceived by appearances: Street Fighter X Tekken is a terribly solid and fun fighting game, which in the face of certain defections in the gameplay introduces new elements capable of shuffling the cards on the table, such as gems (bonus which improve certain characteristics of our characters) and the strategic management of the tag, with our companion recovering energy while we let him rest. There are ~predetermined~ pairs in the selection screen (Ryu and Ken, Heihachi and Kuma, Kazuya and Nina, Chun Li and Cammy, etc.), and completing the Arcade mode with each of them will allow us to witness a nice sequence in CG showing what the warriors in question will do with the mysterious energy released by Pandora. Some cutscenes will leave us with a bad taste in the mouth, others will not fail to make us smile: in any case, our efforts will be adequately rewarded. As mentioned above, in the PlayStation Vita version there is also the Explosive Kumite mode, a survival that will allow us to confront an almost infinite number of opponents, trying to establish a new unbeaten record each time. Then there are the Challenge mode missions, ideal for mastering certain mechanisms after having done a dutiful tour of the tutorial, and finally the online multiplayer via PlayStation Network, with three possible options: Ranked match, which takes place according to the rules already seen in Street Fighter IV; Combat Infinito, a sort of mini-tournament organized with the players gathered in a waiting room; Group combat, also a tournament but which takes place in teams. Finally, there are some nice options for saving replays, the ~KO monuments~ (miniatures of opponents defeated online) and photos in augmented reality. Come on, tap here The massive amount of options made available by this portable edition of Street Fighter X Tekken deserves a discussion in itself. Beyond the traditional customization of the commands, in fact, the game allows us to manage the aforementioned gems, modify the character's appearance and create a set of ~instantaneous combos~ which can then be recalled by acting on the touch screen of the Sony handheld . Let's get specific: the right part of the screen is divided into four large squares, whose touch translates into combos or simple hits. For example, if you're not comfortable with the size of the primary buttons X, Square, Triangle, and Circle, you can assign these ~hot spots~ their functions. Or, as by default, record combos that start when you touch a certain portion of the screen. This is now a must-have feature for match-based fighting games where the controller includes a touch screen, but you can easily decide to iignore it if we believe it simplifies the gameplay too much, as well as adjust online matches so that our opponents do not take advantage of it if we decide not to do it first. And speaking of online games, the matchmaking system in these days of testing has given us some headaches, often failing the search for online players but offering us bursts of challenges while we were intent on trying our hand at the Arcade mode, with a very similar system to that seen on the home console. As soon as you connect to an opponent, the cutscenes click and this can cause some concern, but in principle we have not noticed particular lag, unless it was evident that the counterpart had an internet connection powered by a wheel for hamsters. PSVita trophies There are fifty Trophies that can be unlocked with Street Fighter X Tekken, and many of them are obtained by completing trivial actions: changing teams during Arcade mode, using all the characters, obtaining a ~KO monument~, accessing the store , and so on. Of course, there is no shortage of more difficult Trophies, however, such as the one obtained by fighting one hundred online matches, or by bringing home thirty ~perfect~, or by completing all the missions in Challenge mode. Technically speaking As mentioned, the wait was long. So were the Capcom developers able to make a perfect conversion of the game? Let's say that a good job has been done, but the final result is far from being identical to the original. Street Fighter X Tekken for PlayStation Vita runs at sixty frames per second and doesn't miss a beat, that's for sure, but if you've tried the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version you won't miss the differences in the polygonal models, necessarily less elaborate and slightly more angular. The speech also extends to the scenarios, which boast a lower level of detail, in particular as regards the textures. Another thing you notice is the duration of the uploads for each match: we cannot speak of very long times, but compared to the speed of the ~home~ edition, things are decidedly different and you have to wait several seconds for a match to start . On the other hand, nothing to say about the sound sector, which lacks absolutely nothing, and about the features of online multiplayer, with cross-platform games that certainly present themselves as an excellent idea.", "date": "2012-10-29", "grade": "8.1"}
