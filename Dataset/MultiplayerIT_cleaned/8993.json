Do you want a tyrannosaurus to appear on the screen? Well, type ~tyrannosaurus~ and that's it. Want to fly from platform to platform? Then write ~helicopter~, ~plane~ or even ~jetpack~ and enjoy the ride. As Nintendo DS owners well know, this is not science fiction, but a consolidated reality, behind which an impressive research and production effort is clearly hidden. For Scribblenauts first and then Super Scribblenauts, the developers of 5TH Cell have in fact opened some huge dictionaries and then, word by word, have created the objects (animated and not) to be included in the two products, trying not to miss anything. Beyond the copyrighted names, offensive words and blood, it is really difficult to find a word that is not present in the large list of the game, which arrives on iPhone and iPad (in a single version, which can be shared at will via iCloud) under the name of Scribblenauts Remix and offers Apple users a total of forty levels taken from the DS episodes, plus ten completely new ones. We therefore find the protagonist of the series, Maxwell, grappling with a large number of puzzles that we have the task of solving by inserting the elements missing from time to time into the scenarios, with the possibility of giving full use to our creativity and therefore using the less obvious solutions possible. In each stage there are three time limits, beyond which the system provides us with suggestions; however, taking a minute or an hour will change little compared to the final result, or the ~star~ that will allow us to unlock the next puzzle. Unfortunately, already in this phase there is a serious lack compared to the Nintendo DS version of the game, i.e. the possibility of completing the same stages again to earn bonus points has been eliminated, but with the obligation to use different words. When the wind has stripped the trees The iOS reduction of Scribblenauts Remix also suffers from a significant defect for our local users: the presence of the English language only. This is an inexplicable thing, considering that the episodes for DS were in Italian and therefore the vocabulary was already ready to be brought to iPhone and iPad without much effort. We stalled in offering you this review while waiting for an update to fix the problem, but the 1.1 update did nothing but eliminate some minor bugs. Those who do not speak English will therefore find themselves in great difficulty, and even those who are able to hold a conversation in the language will find that they do not know the name of trivial objects such as a broom (no, you don't say ~fuck~) or some animal species, transforming the experience into a painful sequence of trials and errors to grope to the solution. To this systematic limit another one is added which however depends on the choices of game design, or rather the obscure logic of some puzzles beyond the language barrier. Finally, let's also add the touch interface, very cumbersome as regards the management of objects, although certainly better than that of the debut episode on the Nintendo portable console. Beyond these elements, it must be reiterated that the game has extraordinary potential and that in fact it represents something unique, to be tried even just for the sake of seeing how far its capabilities go. There are moments in which this grandeur appears evident, for example when you have to make a shipwreck escape from a desert island and you can choose to do it in an infinite number of ways, or when you have to cross a series of pits in which there are pitfalls different and therefore bridges are created of the material suitable for all conditions. Finally, the technical sector is not exciting but reflects the style of the franchise, proving to be perfectly functional to the action.
