With the developer behind him, there were few doubts: CyberConnect2 is known for the passion it pours into its products, mostly inspired by popular manga and anime, always respectful of the sources and extremely well-kept from a technical point of view. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot was no exception, net of some important angularities. As you can read in our PlayStation 4 review, the game is probably among the best videogame adaptations of Akira Toriyama's work and entertainingly mixes a real-time combat system with RPG progression in an open world scenario. Almost two years later, Bandai Namco has decided to bring the experience to Nintendo Switch as well: find out how it went in our review of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot + A New Power Awakens Set. The conversion for Switch Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Goku and Vegeta in Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan version For the uninitiated, Kakarot is Son Goku's Saiyan name, but also the subtitle of the CyberConnect2 game which traces the Dragon Ball Z plot from Raditz's arrival on Earth to the battle against Majin Buu, telling it through dialogues and kinematics which, in most cases, they faithfully reproduce what was seen and heard on TV. You can choose between English and Japanese voice acting - obviously the latter is much better - while the soundtrack features the original music and multiple arrangements. Thanks to the versatile Unreal Engine 4 and cel shading, the developer has managed to redesign the most iconic scenes of the animated series with a style very faithful to that of Toriyama. Interlude sequences with windowed dialogues are a little less accurate, the animations stiffer, and give bad publicity to a much better visual impact for the vast majority of the time, thanks to detailed and excellently animated polygonal models especially during the fights. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is really nice to see, and we have to admit that on Nintendo Switch it hasn't lost its polish, net of some sporadic slowdowns and a noticeable pop-up effect over long distances. The conversion returns the experience in its entirety, although the image looks a bit dirtier due to less marked anti-aliasing. We tested the CyberConnect2 title both on TV and in portable mode: in the first case it reaches a resolution of 1600 x 900, in the second it drops to 1120 x 630. In both cases, however, the game runs at a fairly stable 30 frames per second and the rare dropped frames hardly affect gameplay. Anyone who has played the original version, however, will surely feel a certain sense of heaviness while flying or fighting. It is clear, however, that this conversion is dedicated to those who have not yet played Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot in its previous forms, and in this sense we doubt that a Dragon Ball fan who owns the Switch will be disappointed. Toriyama's world Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Beerus in one scene Akira Toriyama has always shown only bits and pieces of the world in which his stories take place, but Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot brings almost all of them together in one open world. Fans will recognize the places where the most iconic moments took place, often marked with postcards that add to a huge list of collectibles to find and collect. CyberConnect2 drew on the author's imagination, under his careful supervision, to design a coherent and detailed world, but less interactive than we would have liked. In fact it is not a real open world: you can move from one region to another, if they are contiguous, otherwise you will have to travel quickly from one area to another using the world map. There are so many things to do and see, but one always has the impression of being in a gigantic sandbox that mostly serves to prolong the hunt with collectibles. Toriyama's touch is also felt in Side Stories, temporary optional missions that disappear if you continue too far in the main campaign. They add little to the experience, but they are nice little curtains that reward the player with experience points, Z Spheres, recipes, Emblems and lots and lots of fanservice. Unfortunately, the structure of these missions, less well-finished than the campaign, is really very repetitive, but completing them serves to improve the so-called communities. Divided into various categories, they are chessboards on which to arrange the Emblems, medallions depicting the various characters of the saga. The right combinations of Emblems unlock the bonuses of the Communities in a sort of miniinterlocking game. Fight like Goku Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Frieza in a scene from A New Power Awakens Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a title suitable for all those who want to relive the story of Goku in a video game. The combat system is not very original, but it is intuitive and allows you to relive the spectacular battles seen in the anime. The base is in fact very simple, but over time you learn the combinations that allow you to dodge, counterattack, break through defenses and so on, but also to launch the famous special attacks seen in the anime. Kakarot can be learned to play in a few minutes and the first fights may seem like a walk, but the bosses are quite challenging and require a minimum of preparation, especially now that the difficulty level can be increased (or decreased) in the Switch version. The CyberConnect2 title is not a 3D fighting game, but a third-person RPG with real-time combat and, in this sense, it does its job honestly. Perhaps we would have preferred a more articulated management of the support characters who will keep us company during the clashes, helping us in different ways depending on the category to which they belong, and to whom we can order to perform certain strategic attacks or launch devastating combined techniques that take the name of Combo Z. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of playable fighters: we will often find ourselves checking Goku, Gohan, Vegeta and a few others while warriors like Tenshinhan, Yamcha or Krillin will remain simple support characters throughout the game. In fact, between one saga and another, there are the so-called Intervals during which you can compose the group as you like and travel around the world in search of side stories or other challenges. To find out more, we refer you to our original review which describes the dynamics and contents of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot in more detail. The DLC included in the Switch version Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, a fight Once the campaign is completed, there are not many extra contents to deal with in addition to the boundless Z Encyclopedia to be completed by finding the collectibles, and this is why Bandai Namco has produced a series of paid DLCs. The Nintendo Switch version includes the first one which, entitled A New Power Awakens, was divided into two parts, released respectively in April and November 2020. The third DLC, entitled Trunks, the warrior of hope, is not included in the version of launch for Switch. In all honesty, the three DLCs are quite disappointing both in terms of thickness and additional content: the first retraces the story of the films The Battle of the Gods and The Resurrection of ~F~ in its own way in a succession of battles with repetitive bosses and little inspired that unlock new techniques and transformations. However, given the excessive cost that every single DLC had, we don't feel like criticizing this little free extra too much in the new version for the Nintendo hybrid console.", "date": "2021-09-23", "grade": "7.8"}
