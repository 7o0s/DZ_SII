After an album, a single, a film, any particularly successful work of human ingenuity, the author experiences the anguish of the second time around, wondering if it will go as well as at the debut, if he will have the same luck/ability, in short if it can, precisely, reconfirm itself or transform itself definitively into one of the many meteors of the artistic firmament. The world of video games is certainly no exception, being among other things the undisputed realm of a myriad of sequels / prequels, sometimes better, other times far worse than the original. And after a media phenomenon like Cut The Rope, landed (rightly) on almost all gaming platforms, the guys from ZeptoLab found themselves faced with a very high risk; in fact, Pudding Monsters has the thankless task of not making fans miss the cute Om Nom, the little dragon always hungry for candy. Excuse me, my pudding has an eye... and a mustache too! To create a new, fairly original game context, the Pudding Monsters developers may have found the right starting point while sitting at the table, perhaps right at dessert time. In fact, the protagonists of the puzzle game are nice puddings with one eye, hardly classifiable as terrifying monsters but, more coherently, as sweets with little gastronomic appeal. The player's goal is to bring together all the pieces of gelatinous monsters scattered around the game plan, making them slide and collide with each other using the various finger slides but also being careful to finish the reconstruction on the tiles marked by stars. The star tiles are 3 and represent the score of the level; in fact, the reconstruction of the monster can also take place without touching any of these tiles, but in this way the next level will not be unlocked. In case of complete reconstruction, the eyes of the improbable assembled pudding will become starred in correspondence with the tiles with the symbol, thus giving the player the maximum score. The puddings can move horizontally or vertically but if they don't have another piece of jelly or otherwise an obstacle in their trajectory, they will fall out of the game board, thus forcing you to restart the game. It is therefore important to organize movements in such a way as to always maintain a safety margin along the sliding of the various pieces of pudding. The monsters can rebuild themselves in all possible ways, in fact a direct contact is enough and each animated ~portion~ will form a new appendage; it is then possible to always move the partial fusions of the gelatins in the two directions, without prejudice to the rule of an obstacle or another gelatin necessary to block its movement. In addition to the red ones, there are 3 other types of gummy monsters, namely the sleepers, the green ones and those that we can define as synchronized, marked by a spiral. The sleepers are normal jellies, which however cannot be moved precisely because they are taking a nap; just hit them with one of the already awake monsters and they will immediately become available again. The green puddings can instead be moved but leave a sort of slime of the same color in their passage, useful for stopping the red jellies just like a solid obstacle; the green trails in fact constitute a fence within which to move the soft protagonists safely, but at the end of the necessary maneuvers the original green puddings are transformed, on contact, into normal reds. The synchronized monsters, on the other hand, have the particularity of moving all at the same time in the same direction, even if only one of them is selected; in this case it is important to be careful in choosing the exact direction of movement, as it is always necessary to respect the rule of the obstacle present in all the trajectories, under penalty of exiting the scheme and restarting the level. Further elements of help (or disturbance if you like) for the solution of the patterns are the ice obstacles, which break after a single contact, the spring ones, which guarantee a rebound equal to a tile, and the cloners, which when passing through they reproduce 2 or 4 jellies by transferring them to different positions on the game board. The final patterns of Pudding Monsters provide for an extra difficulty, because some jellies are found broken up, i.e. with the eye on one side and the soft body on the other. The player will then have to rebuild them, applying the same rules as always, and then assemble them as usual on the starry tiles. Technically the title is nice and enjoyable, but the 75 levels included at the beginning end, to be good, in just over half an hour. ANDMore than one free update has already been planned, however even if at minimal cost, we can't understand the meaning of a game that is finished, among other things without even a big effort, practically standing still on the ring road.", "date": "2012-12-27", "grade": "6.7"}
