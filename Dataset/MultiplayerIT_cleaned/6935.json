And equally frequently it happens that a developer uses them as a shield to deflect potential criticisms, promising that in the full version of his game certain problems will no longer appear or that certain features will be implemented, when then punctually from those points of view the definitive edition is essentially unchanged. Then there are cases like that of Xaviant who not only manage to keep faith in a healthy and transparent way of making a game, but even amaze, exceeding all expectations. A few weeks ago we had tested his Lichdom: Battlemage in depth to talk about it equally in depth in this article, finding ourselves on our hands a title that already in pre-alpha was characterized by an excellent level of completeness and refinement. We would probably have expected the American team to use the two and a half months that remained available to them before the scheduled launch date to insert the elements whose absence was more blatantly noticeable and make some polishing here and there, and instead we finds in his hands an expanded, improved, chiseled and in some ways even rethought product. A surprising load of changes, which seem to have listened to many of the wishes expressed by the community during the Early Access period, including several of our own, which also fill in some rather important gaps. If you've already taken a peek at the vote below, however, you'll already know that this wasn't enough... Reviewed the definitive Lichdom: Battlemage, concentrated fantasy action powered by CryEngine 3 Spells instead of slaps Lichdom: Battlemage is a title that in terms of structure, rhythm and engagement logic closely resembles an old-school FPS, such as Serious Sam or Painkiller, where tons of enemies are grinded in battles with a very direct approach. The substantial difference is that, impersonating an (aspiring) wizard, instead of making the weapons sing, magic is cast, like a version on steroids of a hypothetical BioShock played only with plasmids. The legions of undead, warriors, witches, sorcerers, wild beasts, gargoyles, doped mutants and various other exponents of the evil cast deployed by the Cult of Malthus, which intends to reshape the world according to its Apocalypse-flavored canons, must be eradicated by resorting to a series of magical Sigils that range from classics like fire and lightning to more interesting powers like Corruption, which infects the target with parasites that mutate and spread through the environment in various ways. There are basically three types of attack: a direct one, an area one and a barrier that can be activated as a defensive countermeasure or by charging the Blink, which behaves exactly like the Dishonored namesake, allowing you to instantly teleport a few meters, although in this case it is used solely as a combat asset. But this is only the tip of a real iceberg made up of hundreds of different spells that can be developed by tinkering with an extremely versatile and profound Crafting system, which allows you to churn out countless variations for each Seal, which as well as for speed and power can be differentiated by a swarm of secondary effects, chance to land critical hits and various forms of interaction with other Seals. The true heart of Lichdom: Battlemage is the experimentation of various solutions, until you find the ones that best suit your style or to question it following the discovery of something new, which you suddenly want to develop. If you intend to fully enjoy the game, therefore, you must enter into the perspective of spending almost as much time in the crafting screens as in action. Compared to the pre-alpha, Xaviant has worked very well in illustrating more clearly the particularities of a powerful and versatile but at first glance quite indigestible tool, in making it more practical and intuitive to use, thanks to the radical revisiting of the dedicated menus, and in 'expand it with the ability to dispel a spell, to recycle some of its components, or to try to obtain a rare element, sacrificing someone in a sort of slot machine. Equally pleasing is the more marked practical differentiation of the spells, which in pre-alpha were all cast in the same way, while now, in addition to a more colorful set of graphic effects, they can count on different types of trajectories and consequent game mechanics . And so a direct hit can be done withdistinguish for a more or less pronounced lock-on effect, rather than for a dove-like trajectory, complete with a breakdown on impact into several clusters, or for a beam concentration that is very Onda Kamehameha. At the same time, the introduction of Apocalyptic blows (which allow you to obtain a buff if in certain cases you kill a specific enemy promptly) and specific Synergies between different Seals enrich the clashes with new variables. And we also like the reorganization of Blink and Barriers, whose characteristics were previously exploitable without limits, while now they are placed in relation to the type of Shield mounted, making this last piece of equipment even more relevant. Thumbs down, however, for the Focus, the new Seal leveling system, which allows you to develop up to a maximum of three at a time. The choice in itself wouldn't be a problem if in the change of magic you intend to focus on you didn't reset all the hard-earned progress achieved up to that moment. A solution bordering on nonsense, which Xaviant says he has introduced to make the weight of the choices feel more, a justification that hides nothing more than a gimmick with which to try to give a little more sense to the New Game Plus. The Achilles heel of magic Some changes to the level design, to the composition and positioning of hostile formations in certain areas, to the repertoire of moves of some enemies or to the timing of certain of their attacks complete the long list of efforts that the developers have made in the last few weeks of work to enhance the game concept better, in an attempt to make the action more incisive and structured. Very appreciated, but not enough. The definitive version of Lichdom: Battlemage in fact only manages to delay the appointment with the widespread feeling of repetitiveness felt by many players in Early Access, ending up getting bogged down in the lands of monotony. In addition to the absence of significant variations on the theme capable of breaking cleanly and refreshingly with raw combat, such as puzzles or more effective exploratory digressions than impromptu opportunities to linger in search of resources or secret arenas, the Xaviant title suffers its being overly verbose. 20 and more hours of adventure, in a demanding action and so marked by experimentation, are an absolutely tempting prospect, but when many areas seem to dwell beyond what they should, stringing together too many situations that taste like fillers between a key event and a more successful battle, the boredom is very likely to take over. Especially when another engine appointed to drive the level of interest struggles to fuel. We are talking about the story, which compared to the pre-alpha has also benefited from numerous interventions, including a greater number of interlude scenes created with absolutely valuable ~animated artwork~ for style and direction, thanks to which various aspects of the events are clearer now, while gameplay sequences are enlivened by the performances of voice-over pros like Troy Baker, Clancy Brown and Jennifer Hale. Too bad that everything is generally devoid of bite, unable to properly capitalize on a lore that would also be taken care of, lighting up only in correspondence with some rare event. Virtually non-existent perplexities, however, for another type of engine, namely the graphics one. The fantasy universe imagined by Xaviant takes shape thanks to CryEngine 3: as we had already highlighted some time ago, the technology of Yerli and associates cannot here count on a technical-artistic load comparable to that unsheathed in Crysis 3, but the general impact however, it is of a high standard and it often happens to luxuriate in a view that is gently tempered in dazzling lighting, in the extreme vividness of certain materials (ice and lava above all) or in the riot of particles that is often unleashed on the video. Of note is the implementation of TressFX, the AMD technology dedicated to hair rendering, baptized in Tomb Raider. It will be that we tried the game on nVidia hardware, but witnessing drops of 20 and more frames per second (out of 55 of indicative average) when the only character for which it was implemented appears on the scene, even if shot at about fifteen meters away , convinced us rather early on that we could very well live without.", "date": "2014-09-03", "grade": "7.5"}
