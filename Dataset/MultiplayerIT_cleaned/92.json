The developers, with the latest expansions, have in fact been able to satisfy the wishes of historical players, but have also been able to help casual and novices enter this universe, offering a title that can be used by an incredibly vast audience. Much more accurate tutorials, as we had seen in our most recent preview, a revamp of the skill and talent system, but also more appealing narrative universes than in the past, with the Skyrim imagery as the standard-bearer in the latest iterations. The new lifecycle of The Elder Scrolls Online today welcomes Blackwood with open arms, with his dark style and incredible charm. After several hours of play here is our review of The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood. New players are welcome! A new adventure awaits you We know that the discussion is cyclical and is repeated with each new expansion but, once again, Zenimax has continued to work to ensure that the entry of new players on the game servers is as simple and practical as possible, even avoiding to tie them inextricably to the new content to start the adventure. In fact, Blackwood introduces an all-encompassing tutorial, capable of explaining the basics of movement, combat and the backbone of the game, but also designed so that, at its conclusion, players can freely choose their favorite expansion and from there plan their own adventure. A long series of portals, in fact, will allow you to reach any area of the world and this, combined with the automatic leveling of the various regions, enemies and quests that make it up, offers the possibility of enjoying any content from launch to today at three hundred and sixty degrees . However, this is not the only introduction designed to facilitate the entry of new players, but the new companion system echoes it, obviously designed for low-level characters, but also for those who have the desire to face the adventure over Tamriel like a real lone wolf. Of course, thinking that an MMO can be played as a single-player adventure can make one turn up one's nose, but we must say that over the years and also on other titles we have really appreciated the pure moments of relaxing farming, without having to discuss or organize with others players to face dungeons and challenges or even just to travel the world with our times by completing main and side missions. In short, the greatest value of this novelty is precisely this, the full ability to manage the rhythms of the game independently, without having to risk being behind someone who wants to skip dialogues or run from one quest to another while remaining in one bubble where the player does not feel alone. The AI more than once proved to be better than many adventure companions encountered over the years. Whether you play for the quests, for the new dungeons or for the more vulgar factor of unbridled collecting of the shiny new equipment, what you need to know is that the new narrative line is certainly to be counted among the most successful elements of Blackwood. The bases may perhaps seem a little abused, with 4 sources of mysterious power to recover to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands, but the whole evolution of events will leave you more than once intrigued by the narrative plot, with good twists and the appearance of old acquaintances capable of snatching a sincere sense of belonging to the gaming world from the most nostalgic. Never again alone in Tamriel The tutorial is really perfect now. We were talking about comrades, then. NPCs who will support you in your adventures, a trusted ally capable of taking the blows on the front line for you while you launch arrows or spells from a distance or support your trusted tank. However, they are not to be considered simple cannon polygons, so much so that you will be asked on several occasions to satisfy their needs, perhaps by undertaking opposing secondary missions or even by moderating your behavior in the game world in order to avoid their early demise. They therefore become virtual Tamagotchi to take care of, not only in terms of equipment that you can make them wear to improve certain statistics, but also from a moral point of view by adding that increasingly necessary level in these cases to humanize an otherwise too cold relationship. Your soul is mine! ...or something like that A choice that we liked to be honest and that goes well with the atmosphere that Blackwood and its history have offered us. At allthis large outline then brings the more classic contents, that is, those that allow you to venture to the new lands and prepare to face Mehrunes Dagon, prince of destruction and constant figure in the background of the new adventure. A looming presence that beautifully conveys the concept of the hero's journey, with his ultimate goal ready to annihilate him in an instant, while he prepares himself to face it. It's the classic meat we want in every expansion, although unfortunately, this time there are no new classes, special abilities or revolutions in the actual gameplay to accompany it. A little more variety is added to public events, the dungeons are retouched trying to make them more dynamic but the equation that made The Elder Scrolls Online what we have come to know and love with the previous expansion does not change.", "date": "2021-07-09", "grade": "7.5"}
