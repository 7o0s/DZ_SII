And for gamers it can only be good for him to be involved in the creation of a large number of productions (from Rainbox Six to Ghost Recon, passing through Splinter Cell) that have been able to benefit from the screenplay worthy of a novel. With the release of EndWar, we arrive for the first time at a change of genre compared to first person shooters and third person action games, since we are faced with a turn-based strategy game set during a hypothetical third world war . The player will therefore have to control in order the Enforcers of the European Federation, the JSF of the United States and the Russian Spetsnaz through three distinct campaigns of increasing difficulty, which see these forces collide for absolute dominance. Each campaign is set between Northern Europe, North America and the Middle East, and is made up of about ten different missions, for a total of almost ninety stages. Not bad, right? The best defense is offense Once EndWar has started, we will be able to choose whether to play alone, challenge a friend via the wireless multiplayer mode or try our hand at the integrated editor (see box). In the first case, we will have the possibility to choose between a single battle (selectable from the stages already completed) or the ~campaign~, which naturally represents the fulcrum of the game. An introductory phase will teach us how to manage our troops on the map and how to eliminate enemies, then we will find ourselves in the middle of the action and we will have to select the missions one by one (with a minimum of freedom), with the aim of completing them in the best and complete the entire scenario. EndWar is a classic turn-based strategy, which introduces minimal variations in the gameplay compared to the genre it belongs to: the turns are no longer formed by a movement phase immediately followed by an attack phase, but the two alternate between the parties in the field. This means that, after having moved our units, we will have to wait for the opponent to attack; and only then will we be able to respond. This is an atypical solution, which forces us to make our moves with the utmost attention and to consider the characteristics of our troops as well as those of the enemy. Each unit, in fact, is characterized by different values as regards the range of action of the weapons, the ability to move, the effectiveness of attack and defense as well as by a series of variables that give it advantages or disadvantages depending on the land on which it operates. In the case of infantry, for example, moving inside buildings or in the woods greatly increases the resistance to assaults, as well as the effectiveness of the attack. At the same time, for flying units (aircraft and helicopters) it is best to fire at enemy artillery from an adjacent square, as this type of unit cannot return fire except from a distance. Maps for all tastes The new Ubisoft title has an integrated editor that allows us to create maps using a series of rather simple tools that are intuitive to use. After determining the size of the map and the type of scenario between summer and winter, we will be able to place the preferred terrain on the boxes (expanses of grass, mountains, woods), place roads and urban settlements, as well as some buildings in particular. Then we will move on to the positioning of the troops for the starting round, with almost total freedom of action. The maps created can be saved and used both for a single battle and for multiplayer with a friend. Behind enemy lines Each mission involves the achievement of a main objective and numerous secondary objectives, for example we will have to destroy all enemy air units within the fifth turn or conquer all the depots on the map. From this point of view, EndWar always manages to be very varied, each time entrusting us with different tasks that must be completed to obtain higher recognition at the end of the internships. Within each map we will find a variable number of ~depots~, buildings that can be conquered by placing infantry units in front of their entrance, and which once in our possession allow us to produce new troops or repair damaged ones. The management of the ~hit points~ for each unit goes hand in hand with our attack strategy: although the game presents us with a different approach than usual, the numerical superiority rule will always be valid, sometimes determining sure way the victory of one side or the other. Anyway, in some casesit may happen to be able to turn the tide of a battle that seemed lost, simply based on the intelligent use of the territories and the related bonuses/maluses: in our test, we managed to shoot down three enemy air units using only infantry equipped with rocket launchers, keeping the soldiers strictly inside the buildings for their resistance and attack values to be adjusted to the maximum. Technical realization The graphics of EndWar, in its PSP version, are completely two-dimensional. The maps boast an excellent level of detail, with an accurate reconstruction of widely recognizable scenarios, and sin only in the lack of animated elements. The design of the units (which are quite numerous) is of a decent level, while the interface is always easy to read and easy to use. The combat phases see the troops clash at a distance, through predetermined scenes that in terms of spectacularity cannot compete in any way with what was seen on PS3 and Xbox 360. The sound sector boasts some well-made music to underline certain moments, but in general it is rather ~silent~, were it not for the presence of anything but exceptional effects during the clashes. The control of the units takes place via the main buttons and the d-pad, while the back keys boast alternative functions (display of objectives and statistics, etc.): the configuration of the commands behaves well and no problems of any kind are detected.", "date": "2008-11-25", "grade": "8.0"}
