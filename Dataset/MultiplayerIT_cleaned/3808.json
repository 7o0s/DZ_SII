{"name": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance  Band of Bastards", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-come-deliverance-band-of-bastards-recensione.html", "text": "Band of Bastards is the third major DLC of Kingdom Come: Deliverance and if we want it is the third disappointment packaged by Warhorse, all the more burning because of the appreciations we had reserved for the base game, of which we had sensed the enormous potential behind a non-realization just outstanding. Also in this case, as we will see in the course of the review, the problem is in the contents, which are really limited. Said with all possible understanding for a team that is not gigantic and in its first title like Warhorse, wouldn't it have been better to launch perhaps just one more DLC, more substantial and, why not, more expensive? It's true that not all DLCs can be The Witcher 3's Blood & Wine, but those of Kingdom Come: Deliverance are really poor, starting with From the Ashes, which if played with so many resources available went away in a couple of hours , through The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon, really very well written, overall enjoyable, but also made up of a handful of missions that would have been perfect for the base game, but which as an expansion didn't mean much, if you get past it the expression. Exactly the same applies to Band of Bastards: we are faced with two and a half hours of supplementary content: basically a really well-written mini-campaign that ends in the blink of an eye. Story... short The story told by Band of Bastards has quite phoned assumptions and takes place on the sidelines of the main campaign, once again putting us in Henry's shoes. The usual Sir Radzig sends us to Baron Kuno of Rychwald to hire him together with his band of mercenaries. The goal is to exploit its strength to make the territory of Rattay safer, but some events will make this decision more problematic than expected, with the emergence of new shadows from the past of the mentor of the Skalica blacksmith's son. Basically Band of Bastards is a DLC designed to give more prominence and improve multiple fights, which in Kingdom Come: Deliverance have always been very weak. In fact, all the missions that compose it (five in total) offer clashes with a large number of enemies at the same time (relative to the standards of the game) and situations suitable for characters versed with weapons. The focus of the mini-campaign is so defined that before starting it you are tested in a duel with a white weapon: until you manage to win you don't go on (it's not very difficult, but it's still indicative). As we said, the individual missions are not bad, especially in the narrative part. In one in particular the writers gave a great moment to Henry and his louder side, without saying anything really new about him. The problem is the one already pointed out: Band of Bastards ends quickly and without leaving a trace. It is true that during the missions you have to make some decisions that make the DLC replayable at least twice to experiment with some alternatives, but we are still talking about a light content that has nothing essential. The new items, especially the new armor, don't add much to the overall gameplay experience either, especially if you've already finished it or are particularly skilled in battle. The dynamics of fighting multiple of them, while slightly improved, are far from perfect. The one-on-one clashes remain the most successful overall, also because they help to mask some inevitable heaviness of the game system. In short, you will have understood that we are talking about a DLC that will only appeal to the ultra-fans of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, those who perhaps will have the perseverance to start the game from the beginning to better fit the new missions into the fabric of the gameplay. Everyone else can pretend it doesn't exist.", "date": "2019-02-16", "grade": "6.0"}
