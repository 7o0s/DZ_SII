{"name": "Super Bombad Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-bombad-racing.html", "text": "The pod race? The purpose of Star Wars ~Super Bombad Racing~ is simply to pilot (or drive?) fluttering overcraft that mimic the spaceships and pods of ~Episode 1~ in a race on the track; the first driver to finish all laps wins. However, playing Bombad Racing isn't just a matter of accelerating and braking because you'll need to know how to make the most of the over thirty gadgets (!) scattered along the tracks (force fields, turbo boosts, various jammers, etc.). At the beginning, only three routes will be available and to unlock the next ones, you will need to arrive at least third in the standings. Among the scenarios available you will find the swamps of Naboo, the deserts of Tatooine and the streets of the capital of the Republic. Eight characters are available (at the beginning) each with its own characteristics, for example the mythical master Yoda has a slower speed than the others but greater power (strength!). In addition to the race, you can play divided into teams, the challenge (in which you load your old game and try to beat your ~ghost~), the mirror race (a classic ploy widely used by Ridge Racer) and the arena (a Royal Rumbe in which the last one standing wins). Once upon a time there was Mario Kart... It won't be the title everyone was waiting for, nor a Killer Application but there's no doubt that this little game oozes sympathy right from the cover: the famous characters of the saga in a super-deformed version (with the big head) are a real hoot! The chromatic choice of all the graphics is really ~solar~ resulting in a joy for the eyes. Hats off to Team Lucas above all for having created high-quality light and particle effects (the sandstorm of the second runway was beautiful) while the models and scenarios could have been more detailed (I mean the number of polygons). The tunes are simplistic (even a SuperNes could have made them) but certainly nice, as they are playful remixes of the famous themes created by the orchestra of John Williams. The sound effects make you smile due to the high rate of insanity, for example every Bombad racer has a horn that is as useless as it is fun (Anakin Skywalker's bicycle bell is legendary!). In the game there is no real Intro, while there is a small movie in the Credits section but we are really fed up with the scrolling texts in perspective (A long time ago.. in a distant galaxy far away) right? As far as playability is concerned, for those who have not yet understood it, we are faced with yet another clone of the Nintendo success; a game with a simple but immediate concept. The quintessence of this genre of games is undoubtedly the multiplayer; challenging a friend in split screen mode is definitely fun and if you have a multitap (PS2) you can have fun with up to four (provided you don't have a really small TV). The Bombad Racers are controlled quite well (you'll just have to get the hang of them ~twirl~) but you will be able to play exclusively with the analog lever, which in any case could annoy lovers of the directional cross. The shower of special effects, the various detours on the tracks (such as South Park Rally) and the myriad of power-ups (to be understood and kept constantly under eye) make this title a bit confusing, and therefore less easy than it would seem. I haven't encountered any particular problems or bugs in collision management, which is appreciable in a racing game where you have to avoid objects and pass through narrow spaces. The sensation of speed is still low, but I don't think it's a defect ... in short, if you are looking for pure adrenaline you better wait for Wipeout, while if you want a carefree game remember this title while bearing in mind that conceptually it is nothing innovative compared to the old Crash Team Racing on Psone. Once upon a time there was Mario Kart... Pros: Funny ... especially in many Graphically nice Cons: Confusing Nothing innovative The effort Luke! The effort! The legendary Star Wars brand has inspired myriads of tie-ins not always successful and often with concepts not necessarily based on the wars between the stars. Super Bombad Racing was created by the LucasArt ~Learning~ division dedicated to children... but this title hides a gameplay capable of captivating even the most serious adult, as it is based on a more than tested concept-game.", "date": "2001-06-25", "grade": null}
