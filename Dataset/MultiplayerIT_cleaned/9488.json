This is undoubtedly the case with World of Goo, whose mechanics were borrowed from the first Tiki Towers - released almost two years ago - and brought to the top of the App Store charts. It is therefore logical to expect a sequel, which has now materialized with the present here Tiki Towers 2, which chooses the comfortable path of the ~more of the same~. Castles in the air The role of the user in Tiki Towers 2 is exactly the same that had been reserved for him in the prequel: relying on a limited number of pieces of bamboo, it is therefore necessary to build structures on which the protagonist monkeys can hang to reach the exit of the internship. Depending on whether the level develops vertically, horizontally or a combination of the two, the player will find himself forced to set up bridges and scaffolding of various kinds, being able to count on an intuitive but not always very reliable construction system. In fact, it is sufficient to swipe a finger on the touchscreen to create an initial triangular scaffolding, on the sides of which it is then possible to continue with as many equal shapes until the goal is reached. It happens that the game takes boos for fiascos, and it's not uncommon to see bamboo canes appear where you wouldn't want, which forces you to resort to the tool to delete unwanted elements; an inconvenience that especially accompanies the movement of the view, although it is still required to use two fingers to perform this function. Technical uncertainties aside, Tiki Towers 2 does nothing striking to differentiate itself from the formula of its predecessor, which is both a strength and a weakness in terms of global assessment. All the features that have made the fortune of the young franchise make their fine presence here: first of all, the level design is quite inspired and guarantees a stimulating challenge for each stage, often relying on the physical laws that regulate the solidity of the structures that they are going to build. Developing a bamboo scaffolding and then seeing it resist or yield to the solicitations of the monkeys is always fun, and to some nostalgic could bring to mind the sensations experienced by playing Lemmings, although these are fundamentally different titles. Furthermore, the fact that the levels also contain bananas to be collected to increase the score is an incentive for replayability, which however clashes with the total amount of schemes (about thirty), significantly lower than that offered by the prequel. Wanting to draw a parallel between the two titles, in fact Tiki Towers 2 certainly does not come out the winner: once the innovative charge of the gameplay has run out, this sequel takes on all the characteristics of the data disk, putting on the plate a few important innovations and a slightly improved technical look : an effort sufficient to please the fans, but all in all a bit skimpy considering the evolution that gaming on the iPhone has undergone over the last few years.
