The first fruit of this courageous choice is the present On the Wind, a title that only at first glance may seem like a mere clone of that Flower appreciated on PSN. Blowin' in the wind Wanting to stick a label on it, On the Wind could be classified among the so-called endless runners, or that kind of game that requires the user to continue on a randomly generated path avoiding obstacles for as long as possible. Actually the peculiarities of Buttress' work are different, starting with the protagonist: none other than a pile of colored leaves blown by the wind, specifically represented by the movements of one's finger on the touchscreen. The substance of the title is in fact really elementary, with gameplay that simply requires you to lead the leaves through a two-dimensional scenario, trying to reach the finish line without crashing into the roughness of the ground. You play by keeping your index finger pressed constantly on the screen, a solution which on the one hand allows particularly precise control but which on the other is rather tiring, prompting you to often take small breaks: in this sense, the application meets this need, automatically going into stand-by as soon as you lift your finger. Furthermore, especially on the iPhone, right-handed users could suffer a handicap compared to left-handed users, given that they will be forced to choose whether to use their dominant hand, however, covering a large part of the screen, or whether to use the left with all the limitations of the case. Going back to talking about gameplay in a stricter sense, it is not enough to overcome the obstacles to see the end of On the Wind, given that the pile of leaves constantly loses units as you continue: it is therefore necessary to keep the swarm replenished by passing through the numerous trees that populate the environment, adding a pinch of challenge to an otherwise far from intractable progression. Surviving through the four seasons (a goal that can be achieved with a certain ease after a few games) means completing On the Wind, with the only incentives to replay it represented by the search for a better score or by trying to unlock all the Game Center objectives. It certainly isn't much, especially when compared with applications offered at the same price, but the strength of Buttress's product lies precisely in the lightness of an ideal gameplay for a relaxing break from everyday life. From this point of view, the audiovisual sector works perfectly, offering first of all a simple but evocative cosmetic, with the black silhouette of the ground that stands out against backdrops that change color according to the season, all while the leaves move delicately on the screen . The sound is also essential but spot on, with the noise of the wind acting as a constant background and of the single notes that accompany the passage through each tree.", "date": "2012-04-17", "grade": "7.4"}
