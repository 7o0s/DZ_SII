The developers at BeaverTap Games also kept it classic when they created Mikey Shorts; on the classic in every sense, since they focused on pixel art style graphics, which recalled the era of 8-bit systems, and on a two-dimensional gameplay that was not only immediate but also frenetic, in a continuous speedrun to reach the exit of the levels. The protagonist of their adventures, Mikey, is now back on the iPhone and iPad with a new chapter, Mikey Hooks, and as can be deduced from the title, he brought with him an accessory that has always proved to be very useful since the days of Bionic Commando: a grappling hook . So imagine the mechanics of Mikey Shorts between jumps, platforms, enemies and slides, but add to the mix the possibility of clinging to the numerous pins present within the scenarios and swinging from side to side, so as to overcome otherwise unbridgeable distances and access to normally inaccessible areas. Epic Mikey The Mikey Hooks offer consists of two different modes, which we can access from the starting screen. The first is the traditional story mode, with six scenarios each divided into as many levels and a prize system, based solely on speed, which allows us to earn from one to three stars every time we complete one of the ~central~ stages in the interface . The result is frenetic action, in which you don't have to start exploring the locations and collect all the gold coins (although it is a good thing to do so), but rather hurry towards the exit to reach it in the shortest possible time, obtaining as mentioned from one to three stars depending on the result. We would have preferred a more traditional system, which would assign, for example, a star for time, one for having collected all the gold tokens and one for any extra items, but that's fine even if the authors' goal was to focus on responsiveness only. The second mode, Race, instead sees us compete within twelve settings with other characters controlled by the CPU in a real speed race that is won by whoever crosses the finish line first. In both cases, the strength of the experience is represented by the excellent touch controls and by the almost perfect implementation of the grappling hook, which is activated simply by pressing the jump button while we are already in the air, where there is a pin within reach. Hooked to a handhold, Mikey swings more or less quickly depending on the inertia, which makes the outcome of the maneuver not always predictable and prompts us to be very careful, especially in the more advanced levels, which are the festival of chasms and spikes. The three ~hearts~ at our disposal, which can be restored on the basis of what we find along the way, act in the context of an impeccable balance of difficulty, which manages to engage without excessively frustrating. For the rest, the mechanics are the same already seen in Mikey Shorts, therefore rather tested and strong on solid foundations, supported by a technical sector that perhaps is a little too essential in terms of sound, but which instead appears very pleasant, likeable and graphically effective. Furthermore, through one of the unlockable options, you can make the game appear even more ~classic~. Mikey Hooks takes the dynamics of the previous episode and adds new gameplay elements", "date": "2013-08-30", "grade": "8.0"}
