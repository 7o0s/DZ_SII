{"name": "Viaggio al Centro della Terra 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viaggio-al-centro-della-terra-3d.html", "text": "The world of cinema is full of remakes, also and above all due to the possibilities offered by new technologies for special effects. In the case of ~Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D~, however, the film does not take up the plot of the (almost) homonymous 1959 film in a modern key, in turn taken from the famous novel by Jules Verne, but rather tells a sort of ~sequel ~, in which the protagonists set off on an adventure based precisely on the book and on a hypothetical secret hidden for decades. Interpreted and produced by Brendan Fraser, the star of the various ~The Mummy~, the film stands as the first ~live~ experiment in which Real D Cinema technology is applied, which particularly promises three-dimensional settings of great impact and spectacularity. Naturally, a videogame transposition could not be missing: as far as cell phones are concerned, we are faced with a tie-in of the classic ones, created by IG Fun, in which all the most important scenes are represented. The main game mode sees us follow the plot of the film quite faithfully, with Trevor, his nephew Sean and the beautiful Hannah first engaged in the descent towards the point where the gate to the center of the earth should open, then in a series of risky and spectacular situations, in which they will have to use wagons on rails and rafts to overcome impervious passages. Just like in Verne's book, the subsoil hides pitfalls of all kinds, including huge prehistoric animals. The action takes place according to the rules of rhythm games: depending on the case, we will have to press the number key indicated on the screen at the right time. A correct sequence will allow us to gain speed and continue the journey without damage, while a series of errors will condemn us to game over and any new attempt. If the situation apparently changes a lot between one stage and another, the feeling is roughly the same: you have to act on the keys quickly, trying not to be fooled by a not exactly happy choice of characters. The interface shows us the information we need at any time: on the left we find a progress bar that indicates our position within the route, while in the upper part of the screen we can check the goodness of our work so far, using an indicator which must mark the green color for everything to be in order. The plot advances mainly thanks to text sequences in which Trevor, Sean and Hannah discuss what is happening, between one rehearsal and another. Technically, the new product from IG Fun doesn't set new standards within mobile gaming - far from it. The graphics are all in all decent, with fairly well-designed sprites but lacking in terms of animations. The choice of colors in general is not bad, but the locations show an excessive repetition of the same elements, as usually happens in mediocre titles. Moreover, scrolling is often subject to slowdowns and accelerations that indicate the lack of good optimization. The sound consists of some anonymous and innocuous MIDI music, which does not add anything to the gaming experience but does not disturb it either. Unfortunately the volume is not independently adjustable.
