In reality BiA, in terms of gameplay, can be more rightly compared to products in which tactics play a role of primary importance such as Full Spectrum Warrior, Star Wars Republic Commando or Rainbow Six 3 itself. Gearbox's work takes up some elements from all the titles mentioned but proposes an unprecedented alchemy that I'm going to describe immediately. In practice, in the role of Sergeant Matt Baker who we will control directly via mouse and keyboard, we will also have to give orders to the men of our team, indicating places to access, enemies to hit, gather around us, etc. The tactical-strategic component is essential to successfully complete the mission. Forget about acting like in an ~arcade~ FPS like Doom since already being outnumbered by the death of one of your soldiers portends a probable defeat. The tactical element is so important that the programmers have rightly implemented the possibility of viewing the battlefield from above in a sort of strategic map in which we will be able to see all the positions of our men and those of the opponents, as well as the possible shelters for thus study the movements to be performed in the best possible way. There will also be a variation on the theme of absolute importance: we are talking about the missions in which we will have to manage two teams at the same time which can be exclusively of men (in turn divided into ~normal~ or for assault attacks) or made up of tanks. Having to manage two different teams in real time will prove to be rather difficult and will be essential for beating the Nazis on the field, understanding what the pre-set objectives of the two components at our service are. The tactical element is so important that the programmers have rightly implemented the possibility of viewing the battlefield from above in a sort of strategic map in which we will be able to see all the positions of our men and those of the opponents Intelligent Brothers It is a fact that in this kind of games in which our companions, after receiving orders, will implement the movements imparted autonomously, artificial intelligence plays a role of primary importance. From this point of view, the Gearbox programmers have done a good job even if in some situations (fortunately not too many) our men seem to be affected by a sudden lowering of their intelligence quotient which, together with the AI never in question of the opponents can lead to dire consequences. However, our boys almost always manage to independently find the most suitable points to hit the opponent and be protected from enemy barrage fire: it will then be up to us to look for more suitable strategies to surround the Nazis or surprise them with lateral diversionary manoeuvres. Unreal Brothers 2 The analysis of the audiovisual aspect of BiA begins with its graphics engine which, as you may have understood from the title of this paragraph, is Unreal Engine 2. Since the release of Doom 3 and Half Life 2, the terms of comparison as far as the graphic parameters of a PC game are concerned, they are to be placed at a decidedly high level. From this perspective therefore, even if Brothers in Arms has splendid textures with regard to the faces of the soldiers and very large settings without even requiring too expensive hardware specifications, the Ubisoft title is excessively affected by a graphics engine that has almost three years on its shoulders of life. This doesn't mean that it's a bad game to watch, far from it (also because there's no shortage of exciting cinematic moments), but in my opinion it doesn't hold a candle to the current sacred monsters in the FPS field from a technological point of view. Furthermore, not even the soldiers' animation frames fully satisfy the player's eye, proving to be excessively woody in some sets. Very different speech as regards the sound component: absolutely perfect sound effects, more than discreet localization in Italian and epic music at the right point for a war game. The Ubisoft title is excessively affected by a graphics engine that has almost three years of life on its shoulders Fratelli On & Off Line The last aspect to consider before moving on to the final comment is the longevity of BiA. Starting with the single player, it can be said without a doubt that the planned campaign will certainly not beat someduration record given that the actual game time (excluding repetitions for missions concluded in a negative way) is rather short. However, it must certainly be considered that you will have to undergo several unsuccessful attempts, so much so that the programmers have well thought of restoring all the energy and supplies of bullets in the event that the life of your digital alter ego is interrupted for more than three times at the same point in the mission. In this way, the easy frustration that could strike players (especially those less accustomed to tactics and strategy) in BiA is dealt with, a game that is certainly not easy also due to the extreme realism of the weapons' functionality: therefore aiming at the enemy will not be so automatic since we will have in our hands, weapons from the 40s. And then, despite being a tactical game, where most of the firefights take place at long distances, there will be adrenaline-pumping and more action-packed situations in which reflexes will also count for a lot. Finally, as regards multiplayer, this aspect convinced us a lot. Once on the Ubi.com servers (registration and use of the service is clearly free) we found ourselves dueling with many players in games that can predict the presence of 4 ~Brothers~ at the same time. As expected, there will be no modes such as ~Deathmatch~ or ~Capture The Flag~ but it will be a matter of completing various objectives with your team (you can choose to control allies or Nazis) while the other will clearly have to make sure make the mission fail. Although there are some variations on the theme (for example the arrival of reinforcements during the game and the possibility of continuing the mission with another man on the team if our alter ego perishes in battle), a pity not to have implemented some cooperative modes in which all the men of the team were commanded by players. Comment If you've come this far, you've probably read a pretty long review before coming to the final comment. The reason is obvious: Brothers in Arms is a rather particular title that deserved to be explained in the best possible way in all its aspects. The new Ubisoft production could immediately confuse those who expected a sort of new Medal of Honor or Call of Duty: with the two titles just mentioned, BiA only shares the war setting and the historical period of the second war conflict. The decidedly unique element is the gameplay that resembles other tactical games (Full Spectrum Warrior or Rainbow Six 3) but taking an innovative route, in which the strategy blends seamlessly with the first-person action of an FPS. The result is fully successful thanks to a good artificial intelligence of our men and above all of the opponents and some small gimmicks by the programmers to limit the sense of frustration that could especially affect less experienced players. Clearly Brothers in Arms will find the favors of many but not all, given this rather atypical approach for a title set in the Second World War. Therefore, if for the gameplay (and also for the good cinematic appeal, albeit complementary to the style of MOH), the work of Gearbox deserved a full vote, I decided to stop at a few decimals less for some objective limits of the production start with a satisfactory technical realization but which pays for the use of an engine like Unreal Engine 2, today technologically inferior to two titles such as Doom 3 and Half Life that you may have heard of in recent months. The title does not shine excessively even for a high longevity in single mode but in this case to compensate for the lack there is a well-crafted and captivating multiplayer. Pros: Excellent alchemy between strategy, tactics and action Intimate cinematic appeal Exciting multiplayer Cons: Technologically far from Doom 3 and Half Life 2 Very short single mode (albeit bordering on frustrating) Gameplay for many but not for all The first thing to do to get the new Ubisoft title from the right perspective is to clear the field of possible misunderstandings: if you think that Brothers in Arms is a clone of Medal of Honor or Call of Duty, you are absolutely wrong. The work of the Gearbox programmers (the same as the PC portings of Halo and 007 Nightfire) shares with the two games just mentioned only the war setting and the historical period: clearly we are in the ~middle~ of the Second World War, in that France divided and crossed by various armies involved in the greatest conflict in the history of mankind. Brothers in Arms tells us a true story in which we will play the role ofSergeant Matt Baker, captain of a parachute team on D-Day whose orders are to complete the mission successfully, while trying to preserve the lives of members of his entire team. Halfway between the spectacularity of Saving Private Ryan and the greater intimacy of the television series ~Band of Brothers~, BiA undoubtedly manages to empathize with the gamer with a series of rather unusual narrative elements in an interactive digital production such as thoughts aloud of Sergeant Baker between one level and another or the strong emotional charge that will cause the death of a fellow soldier. More than a cinematic blockbuster, Brothers in Arms, from a narrative point of view, recalls war films in which the war is told in all its real cruelty and tragedy.", "date": "2005-04-04", "grade": null}
