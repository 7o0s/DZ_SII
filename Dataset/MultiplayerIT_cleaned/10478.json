{"name": "Bonfire Peaks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bonfire-peaks-recensione.html", "text": "Leave it all behind. Burn memories of a past life and look to the future. Bonfire Peaks, the puzzle game developed by Corey Martin (former author of Pipe Push Paradise and Hiding Spot), talks about this: putting an end to it, without regrets that can somehow block our climb. A common element, that of moving forward and above all upwards, with another game that exploits the puzzle elements and the difficult climb as a metaphor for change, for life: Celeste. The pace of these two works couldn't be further apart, with Celeste calling for a quickness and alertness absent in Bonfire Peaks. A game devoted to an almost surreal calm, as if it wanted to tell us not to rush, that there is change, we are ready to embrace it and there is no need to rush things. A sort of concern, if you will, towards a past that has defined, it is part of us; where Celeste requires hand-eye coordination, becoming more and more impervious step by step as the mountain we are climbing, Bonfire Peaks puts our ingenuity to the test - as if to represent the difficulty in letting go of our memories. The journey we have experienced has been tiring on a mental level and, although some rough edges have not convinced us, overall it is an experience where the puzzles have not only been mere fillers and have represented one after the other the path to take , so that we can look to a new future. While on the one hand everyone could try it, on the other it is a game clearly aimed at puzzle lovers and those who want to take a break, looking (and finding) in the staid rhythm and increasing challenge the right interlude between games in which the speed of action takes precedence over thought.Let's find out how in the review of Bonfire Peaks on Nintendo Switch. Alone adrift Bonfire Peaks, the bonfire is where we'll go to burn our memories Transported by a white swan, we reach the base of our personal mountain. There is no one but us, a solitude that proves that this path belongs to us and to no one else. Waiting for us along the road we find extinguished bonfires, which light up when we decide to sit around them and remember: what we are not given to know, but it is clear that it is something we have to do without, a burden to burn. Literally, since each of the more than two hundred puzzles that make up Bonfire Peaks involves bringing a box containing our memories to the bonfire: each puzzle is characterized by a name, which subtly wants to be a clue on how to proceed in solving it. On balance it does not always go like this and, as we proceed, the names gradually lose their meaning until they are read out of pure curiosity rather than in search of a clue; someone is still able to give us a little help but most of the work depends on the spirit of observation, the ability to exploit what the game teaches us but above all think outside the box. If at the beginning a solution can be identified at a glance, over time it will become increasingly difficult to find the square and it is here that Bonfire Peaks reminds us players of the effort inherent in the message of which it is the spokesperson: go on, let go all behind. It's not easy at all and there will be moments where we want to let go, give up, never touch the game again. These are the moments in which to sit down, virtually, and take all the time we need. Bonfire Peaks doesn't rush, that's the important thing. A sometimes excessive burden Bonfire Peaks, sometimes it's good to stop and take some time for yourself Beyond being finely crafted and equipped with ever new mechanics capable of keeping interest alive, the puzzles of Bonfire Peaks weigh a little more than necessary: a burden that we owe above all to the absence of anything else at stake, to the beyond these puzzles. Although the reward is given by the progression itself and by having taken a small extra step, the loop in which you fall very quickly - proceed uphill, solve puzzles, continue - often takes over and after a few puzzles you tend to losing concentration, then leaving the game aside to perhaps come back later. The lack of something that breaks up this repetitiveness, preventing us from falling into a soporific pattern where in the long run not even the variety of puzzles can do much, especially in the face of the amount of puzzles, plays against the experience: while understanding the underlying message, even in the face of not having to solve all the puzzles to get to the end, we often found ourselves disinclined to continue. Two aspects don't help in terms of game design: first of all, the lack of aa three hundred and sixty degree view. Given the structure of many puzzles, being able to examine them as a whole would have allowed for better elaboration of some solutions. Sure, it's always possible to undo the previous move, even start the level over from scratch, however not being able to see beyond a certain angle is unnerving. Then there is a more practical question concerning the management of the boxes themselves (the physical means with which we build the path up to the bonfire): the game, with all its maps, is a huge grid in which you move by boxes vertically or horizontally, without diagonal movements, and our protagonist has a height equal to two blocks. Bonfire Peaks, the puzzles always introduce new mechanics keeping the challenge alive Within this measure he can collect the crates scattered throughout the levels, therefore from the ground or at eye level, and similarly he can stack them up to where his own height allows him. Climbing any steps can, of course, increase the number of crates stacked on top of each other. The stacked crates are taken and transported all together regardless of the quantity but cannot be separated, provided that they do not encounter obstacles or push them away using another crate as a lever. In practice, therefore, when we are faced with two stacked crates from which it would be enough to take the one at eye level to solve the puzzle in question more easily, we are forced to find a much more cumbersome solution to separate the two parts - or avoid stacking them from the beginning. Essentially, the protagonist is programmed to only pick up the crates at his feet, a complication that we argue somewhat conflicts with his inhuman ability to lift even six at once. A videogame Maciste who however is unable to separate two elements. This is a rather important reason why, while acknowledging the sophistication of some puzzles, the magic of Bonfire Peaks is sometimes broken: the obviousness of a solution comes to us denied for no particular reason, thus weighing on the experience as a whole. Having said that, it remains an enjoyable game and is also well enhanced by the voxel graphics, which for a few seconds manage to make us forget our sorrows, inviting us to sit down and relax.", "date": "2021-10-20", "grade": "7.5"}
