{"name": "Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-mark-of-chaos-recensione.html", "text": "Never leave work half done The situation in the world of Warhammer has never been the most rosy, but never have we been so close to an apocalypse of this magnitude: after decades and decades of wars, the Empire has finally managed to defeat the Army of Chaos in a epic battle, banishing the few survivors to the inhospitable lands north of the Realm. The big mistake that the good guys make is quite simple, as predictable: they decide to sit on their laurels, avoiding the boring task of exterminating the few surviving followers of Chaos, thus allowing one of their Champions to reorganize his own personal army. The plot that will surround your adventures certainly does not shine for originality and therefore do not expect big twists, except for some predictable revelations (could the traitor have been missing?) and alleged moments of suspense. Therefore, although the canvas certainly does not represent one of the best that we have ever seen, a small clarification remains to be made: Mark of Chaos is affected by the syndrome of the anchor for five minutes and, once a mission is finished, you will hardly be able to exit the game , but it will be natural for you to continue on your adventure. A man torn between Light and Shadows (Aren't you hungry?) As is now the habit of many RTS, even the latest effort by Namco-Bandai will allow you to face two distinct campaigns with four different factions: you will be free to impersonate the Army of Chaos and its ally, the Skaven, intent on reconquering what lost, or side with the faithful of the Empire & Co. and worry about securing the borders of the Realm. Each campaign is obviously followed by a completely dedicated story, and will allow you to test the four races made available by the developers, each characterized by particular units and heroes. economic management ends in these few simple actions, also limited by the small number of units at your disposal, for a total of ten for each faction, and all characterized by a slight aftertaste of dejavu... A man torn between Light and Shadows (Aren't you hungry?) Perhaps too worried about launching into something truly innovative, the Namco-Bandai guys preferred to draw liberally from the many masterpieces circulating in the videogame firmament, first of all the stainless WarCraft and Ground Control: all the RPG elements, both for the units and for the hero, while from the latter the total lack of strategic elements, such as the construction of structures and the collection of resources. If this interesting mix can make purists turn up their noses, we can tell you that the mix works quite well: fighting through a map, vaguely Rome: Total War style (but the contact points end here), the more enemies you kill, the more gold you will get and Needless to say, the shiny metal will allow you to buy new troops and upgrades. Economic management ends in these few simple actions, also limited by the small number of units at your disposal, for a total of ten for each faction, and all characterized by a slight aftertaste of dejavu: you will therefore have two units available for ranged combat, two for melee, three for fiercest engagements, and three siege weapons; the ability to customize your troops is of little use, given that after a few victories you will have so much gold that you have already equipped all your men with the best the armory can offer. Who dares to challenge Thornor the Mighty? Regardless of the campaign you choose to face, the gameplay will always remain unchanged: your army will have to move on a map following a pre-established path and, at each stage, a different mission corresponds. That's right: in Mark of Chaos you will do nothing but face missions, in perfect style of the aforementioned Ground Control; fortunately the developers have chosen to enrich the gaming experience with a fair number of objectives, ranging from the siege of an enemy stronghold, to the elimination of the enemy hero, passing through the classic indiscriminate massacre of everything that moves . For originality without a doubt, the possibility of making two enemy heroes collide in a mortal duel: if in the battlefield your brave is sufficiently close to the opponent's one, you can decide to face him in a head-to-head battle: the peculiarity lies in the fact that, only on that occasion, you will have a personalized menu available, where you can generically choose the fighting style (defensive, aggressive, concentrated and so on) and activate some skills, available onlyin case you have chosen to develop them by spending experience points, in perfect RPG style (and WarCraft too). Realism? Likelihood? Needless to say: the focus of Mark of Chaos is the battles; if lately the horrible habit of favoring tank rushing had been lost, that is to say selecting all the troops and moving them en masse, massacring everything in front of us, in this new title it was decided to resume this philosophy. Throughout the single player campaign, both the one with the Empire and the one with the Army of Chaos, the vast majority of missions we managed to finish them simply by selecting all the units and throwing them at one enemy at a time. The reason why this ~technique~ works is quite simple: Artificial Intelligence does not offer a minimum level of challenge since the highest strategy it will be able to develop will be to send its troops to slaughter little by little, making it extraordinarily easy to life to your men, who will find themselves, as a consequence, always in numerical superiority. It follows that the whole phase of disposition of the troops in the field, phase that precedes each battle, is generally skipped at the same time, given the uselessness of deploying your ranged troops in cover and your melee troops in the front line: if you are veterans from a game of Rome: Total War, you will probably be able to defeat the enemy army in a few minutes. Artificial Intelligence does not offer a minimum level of challenge as the highest strategy it will be able to develop will be to send its troops to massacre little by little, making life extraordinarily easy for your men Realism? Likelihood? Even the tactical element, much praised by the developers, is practically absent: except be careful not to collapse the morale of your troops, forcing them to rout, placing shooters on top of a hill or at the bottom of a river will have exactly the same consequently, as well as placing a group of scouts on a hill, considering that their field of vision will remain absolutely unchanged. Therefore, the typical depth of strategy games with a tactical background is missing, but if this does not represent a big fault, but a (hopefully!) precise choice by the developers to prefer arcade battle management, the lack of implementation of an AI is instead very serious able to give a decent challenge even to an average level player, thus seriously undermining the longevity of the title. Old Fashion Mark of Chaos can therefore include a fair number of problems that afflict its playability, but it manages to achieve the intrinsic goal of every video game: to have fun. Despite the aforementioned problems, playing the Namco-Bandai title we found ourselves immersed in an absolutely new and different world, with attention to detail and very, very engaging, typical of the Warhammer saga: we were therefore amused by following the evolution of the simple plot , admiring how our hero, battle after battle, became more and more lethal and dangerous. The involvement also comes thanks to the splendid graphics that animate our men: the units are full of details, perfectly characterized and very varied, to the point that you will hardly notice two absolutely identical men in the same unit, but they will (almost) always be differentiated by small details, such as the presence or absence of a helmet, or a few skulls placed to decorate the shining armour. The battles, however, will never be immense, but will always remain fixed around a few dozen units, removing that typical epic flavor, however, of the clashes between pawns in the board game. A praise must certainly be given for the realization of the models, always rich and particularly evocative, while the animations appear decidedly subdued, especially during the fights: your units will only count on one or two animations per action and in the long run it will be decidedly not very evocative to observe the armed clashes. Alone or against everyone? The other component of the title, namely the multiplayer, is certainly one of the most ambiguous elements of the entire game: once you decide to start a game, both on the local network and via the Internet, you will have the option to face on one of the maps of the single player game your friends, challenging them to a colossal multiplayer battle. If on paper it may seem interesting, in reality multiplayer essentially translates into choosing the composition of your army, customizing it by spending a given amount of gold (set by the admin) and then choosing the type of game: we are not just talking about the skirmish mode par excellence, or rather the indiscri massacremined, but Mark of Chaos will also allow you to face a modest ~Assault on the Castle~, where players can play either the role of attacker or defender. Unfortunately, lacking the tactical component, all the clashes are reduced to a huge cauldron of units upon units intent on beating each other up: if at the beginning it can be fun, after a few games you will have understood the hint and will run for cover by returning to the good old fashioned way single player campaign. Conclusions So the age-old question remains: is Warhammer Mark of Chaos worth buying? The answer is (just to give you a solid point) it depends: it depends on whether you are willing to forgive some large gaps, both in terms of AI and variety, in favor of an absolutely rare involvement in an RTS. It also depends on your passion for fantasy and how much you are attracted to the world of Warhammer: purists of the style of play invented by the Total War series will do better to look towards Medieval 2, while all those looking for simple fun, challenging but not too much Overall, they'll find just what they're looking for in Namco-Bandai's latest effort. Pro Absolutely fun Addictive and pretty simple It's Warhammer! Against inconsistent AI. Bare-bones tactics. Few units Blessed Patches Lately the developers have got into the habit of releasing patches for their titles exactly the same day the game goes out in stores: if on the one hand this work is commendable, on the other it reveals the harsh reality, i.e. the excessive pressure that the publisher exerts to put the product on the market, regardless of its quality: BANDAI Games does not deviate from this philosophy, even proposing 300 MB of patches to upgrade your Mark of Chaos to 1.3. The patch, of decidedly large size, is undoubtedly worth them all: in addition to adding six different maps for your online sessions, it also aims to correct numerous small defects, such as some animation and unit balancing problems, increasing (among other things) the effectiveness of the troops equipped with firearms, really weak and useless in the original version. It wouldn't be a real patch if it didn't also modify the single-player component, adding some new graphic effects, such as copious blood splatters and other goodies of different kinds; despite the readme announcing radical changes to enemy AI, during our tests it didn't seem to us that the computer behaved much more intelligently than it did in 1.0, which is very little. Let's say that, to be a day one, BANDAI hasn't really rested on its laurels: we hope for their continued commitment to transform this rough stone into a real diamond! Introduction The famous Warhammer brand can evoke, in enthusiasts, the epic nights spent with friends making their miniatures collide on wooden and polystyrene tables, but only in the last period has the famous brand attempted to break through even in the community of gamers, with more or less valid results: the latest effort, represented by Mark of Chaos, should definitively consecrate the Warhammer saga in the videogame panorama, but it is known that not all the announced masterpieces turn out to be such.", "date": "2006-11-27", "grade": null}
