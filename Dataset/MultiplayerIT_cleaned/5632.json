If the criticisms initially made by the game's detractors rightly concerned the absence of a certain amount of content, it certainly cannot be said that the developers have remained idle, given that over the months they have been made available to all Battlefront owners a number of free additions. Alongside the latter we find the inevitable Season Pass, thanks to which it is possible to guarantee all four paid DLCs provided for this game: the first is Outer Rim, which the owners of the seasonal package were able to download a few days ago. Waiting for it to become available for single purchase on April 5th, we have tested its contents for you. Star Wars Battlefront's Outer Rim takes us to Tatooine and Sullust, along with Greedo and Nien Nunb! At Jabba's court The additional material introduced by Outer Rim takes its name from the homonymous area of the Star Wars galaxy, in which the two planets Tatooine and Sullust are located. The four new maps included in this DLC are dedicated to them, divided equally between both. The first two concern Jabba the Hutt's palace in detail, reproducing the remittance of the sailing ships and the throne room with the annexed rooms, while the other two are dedicated to the SoroSuub Corporation and portray the industrial structures built by this company on Sullust. If you were expecting other content designed for large-scale Battlefront battles, you will therefore be left dry, because in all four maps you find yourself fighting mainly between tunnels and narrow environments. The confined spaces are therefore privileged compared to the few areas of greater outlet, in which to give life to clashes involving several players. All this makes the use of a strategy that takes into account the design of the maps inevitable, with which the new Extraction mode introduced by Outer Rim obviously goes well. It is a type of game that mixes some elements of those we have already known before, to give life to an experience that we enjoyed while being among those who prefer the broader modes of Battlefront. In detail, the game is played by teams of eight players. Rebel forces must get an important shipment underway by moving a kind of cart across the map to its extraction area. Conversely, the soldiers of the Empire must do everything possible to hinder the advance of the important delivery, taking advantage of the internal areas to plan ambushes and slow down the enemies. Each game lasts a maximum of fifteen minutes and the two forces in the field can also count on the use of their respective legendary characters, to obtain an initial advantage in the case of the Rebels or place a last attempt at sabotage in that of the Empire. Greedo shot first Depending on your position in the eternal debate between who shot first between Han Solo and Greedo, thanks to Outer Rim you can rewrite history. The bounty hunter shot down by Solo in the Mos Eisley cellar is in fact among the legendary characters introduced by this paid package together with Nien Nunb, co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon during the battle of Endor, who later also appeared in The Force Awakens . While being secondary to Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and all the other heroic figures already present, the two novelties go alongside them in all respects. Greedo and Nien Numb are therefore also equipped with special weapons and abilities, which they can make use of in the various modalities that foresee their use, among which for example Heroes against Villains: in this case, the alignments are now populated by four different legendary characters. Not being Jedi, the two mainly make use of game elements already seen, combined in ways that give rise to different results: in the experience we had with Outer Rim the bounty hunter proved to be the most fun to play, thanks to his skills that allow him to discover enemies on the map, use a special impact bomb or hit multiple opponents at once. Nien Numb instead took us a little less, even if we appreciated its defensive capabilities dictated by the use of a proximity bomb, a guard turret and a powerful sniper rifle. To complete the picture of the contents introduced by Outer Rim we find the new Relby-v10 rifle and the DT-12 blaster pistol, together with the star cards Scatter Gun, Granata Dioxis and Adrenaline Stimulant with which DICE hopes to give more variety to the equipment fielded by Battlefront players. In conclusion, we can say that we have appreciated the offer of Outer Rim, even if its contents do not offer anything really new and are certainly not able to change your mind about this title. The price of 15 euros at which the package will be sold makes it a little less attractive for single purchase, given that for 50 euros it is possible to take home the entire Season Pass. We remind you that with the latter there is a hypothetical saving of 10 euros on the total of all four DLCs, in addition to the possibility of accessing them two weeks in advance compared to the other players. However, we leave the final considerations on the purchase to you and your thirst for Star Wars.", "date": "2016-03-24", "grade": null}
