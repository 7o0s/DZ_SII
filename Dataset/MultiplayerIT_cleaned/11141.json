{"name": "Rock 'n' Roll", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rock-n-roll.html", "text": "An interesting study could be made of original characters in the world of video games. Alongside strange but plausible figures such as that of a squat and mustachioed Italian plumber, in fact, we often see creatures that defining ~strange~ is an understatement: blue hedgehogs, hamsters, bears and tigers, but also absurd agglomerations of objects, circles, colored spots or even the red dot that is part of the logo of a (now not so much) famous American soft drink. In such a scenario, taking control of a pebble does not cause a sensation, on the contrary it appears more than normal. In this case, in Rock 'n' Roll we will have to guide this stone within fifteen levels distributed in three different locations, with the aim of collecting all the notes scattered within the stage. The peculiarity of the game undoubtedly lies in its control system: we won't move the stone directly, in fact, but we will have the possibility to rotate everything around it, so that it moves accordingly. By acting on the d-pad of the mobile phone, we will therefore be able to rotate the stage clockwise or counterclockwise, rather quickly, and induce the stone to simply follow the force of gravity, in an inertial context rendered very well by the developers. There's no need to press other keys, it's really all very simple and immediate: you start from an area of the level and you have to move inside it, exploring it all, to collect the number of notes needed to move on to the next stage. As you go forward, the locations become larger and larger and problems begin to emerge: our pebble, in fact, does not have any radar or any indication of where to move to find the missing notes. Not even a compass to interpret the direction of the setting. At that point things will get a little more complicated, and at the same time some variables will come into play: by picking up a small bone, our stone will swell up to have problems in passing certain passages, even if in this way we will be able to better control its movement ; on the other hand, the impact with particular devices will have the opposite result, with the stone deflating until it even disappears, if this occurs too many times. To accompany the main game mode there is a secondary one, in which we will have to face short missions: ideal if we don't have much time to devote to the game. According to the title, Rock 'n' Roll boasts a ~rocking~ soundtrack, of a classic type, but based on MIDI tracks whose quality leaves much to be desired. The bulk of the graphic sector is made up of the scenarios, which have the particularity of being able to rotate quickly to the right or to the left. This works quite well and without slowdowns, even if several animation frames have obviously been sacrificed to obtain this result: the rotation is not very jerky, at least not to the point of being annoying, but greater fluidity would have made everything much more pleasant . The internships are organized in such a way as to always have the same basic colors, unfortunately; colors that change only three times in the whole game: we are far below average, and the visual variety suffers not a little. The expressions of our pebble are nice, but by themselves they don't justify the general flatness of everything else. PRO Simple and immediate Excellent inertial system Our stone has funny expressions... AGAINST ...but the graphics, in general, are just enough Slower and heavier action The quality of the music leaves something to be desired", "date": "2008-10-09", "grade": "S.V."}
