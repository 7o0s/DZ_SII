{"name": "Lost Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-magic_a.html", "text": "A long long time ago bla bla bla LM's first problem is precisely the story, which starts from the most classic and banal canons of Japanese fantasy and does not detach itself from there for the entire duration of the game. Seven Wizards are responsible for the jurisdiction of the seven types of magical energy present in the world of Lost Magic, but one of these, who still remain men in all respects, and coincidentally the most powerful, is attacked by an incurable thirst for power plunging the world into chaos and war. Impersonating Isaac, a fourteen-year-old novice magic apprentice who has, without knowing it, a very deep bond with the Wizards, you will start from what appear to be the daily activities of a universe grappling with the invasion of strange monsters, to get to the end to the salvation of the whole world. The story, which as you can see is very traditional, is still quite pleasant, and is told through old-fashioned dialogues that show the text screen and the portraits of the characters involved. Taito wanted to focus much more on the gameplay A long long time ago This is because Taito wanted to focus much more on the gameplay, on the battles, which we are going to describe. Isaac moves on a map organized in waypoints, to be selected on the touch screen. At any given moment only certain areas are accessible, and in these there may or may not be the need to take the field. Once you have come across the monsters, Isaac will have to be controlled with the stylus, the directional cross being responsible for scrolling the map: with the stylus you will select the character and indicate the point where to go, with the stylus you will select an opponent to see his characteristics, and above all with the stylus you will draw the runes necessary for the execution of a spell, the true beating heart of the game. The system is delightful, both conceptually and in practice: the more precise the rune you draw and the faster its execution, the greater the effect obtained, thus inserting an element of ~real~ practice that goes to the beyond the mere growth of RPG statistics, although present in generous doses in Lost Magic. Another very nice thing is that, although there are only 18 basic spells (for a total of six different schools of magic linked to the canonical six elements each with its particular relationship with the others), it is possible, by experimenting, to combine several runes for a grand total of 400 different spells, with the most disparate effects and potentials. A really good job from this point of view. Come on my brave ones! However, as you will soon learn from the mouth of a ~mysterious~ character, spells are fun and powerful but they are of little use if a monster manages to reach you and strike a blow. The same character will therefore show you the rune necessary for the monster's capture spell, to be performed when it is particularly weakened by battle. Isaac can capture up to seventy monsters, while the number of those that can be deployed on the field depends on the Unit Points that grow from level to level with the other characteristics. Monsters also have different characteristics, and there will be those more inclined to attack as well as those useful for creating real defensive walls, as well as having alignments to different elements and are therefore stronger towards certain opponents and vulnerable towards others. They also possess the canonical experience points, and therefore the more you use them the stronger they become, as well as the possibility of being assigned an object, to be found during battles, which increases specific characteristics. there is no way to know which creatures are suitable until you have faced the battle at least once Come on my brave ones! The control system is very similar to that seen in the case of Isaac: one or more creatures are selected with the stylus and sent in a certain direction by indicating it on the touch screen. Unfortunately, however, everything is undermined by a scheme too tied to the dawn of the genre: the selection of more united takes place only and exclusively by drawing a circle on the screen, other shapes are not foreseen because the game will automatically take care of drawing the circle for you, making so difficult the selection of only some elements in case the groups of monsters at your service are close to each other. The impossibility not only to give orders, but also simply to scroll the map when you pause the game increases the already high difficulty in getting to the bottom of battles, and furthermore the artificial intelligence leaves absolutely something to be desired, with your troops that they won't bother in the least to get around obstacles or to look for other enemies once those who attack them have been defeatedeve indicated. All this affects a strangely calibrated difficulty curve, in the sense that the calibration never seems to have taken place: the same mission can be solved in no time with the right units, while it can require several attempts with those wrong, but there is no way to know which creatures are suitable until you have faced the battle at least once. Furthermore, it will often be necessary to separate the groups, and the not very precise control system makes it difficult to enjoy the frenetic and ~360~ nature of an RTS: try to control different groups of monsters plus poor Isaac who will often have to travel (but he is very slow !) from one end of the map to the other to act as a nurse, without feeling at least the strong need to drop some saint from the calendar Three tigers against three tigers One of the flagships of Lost Magic, which demonstrates the skill and attention with which it was designed, is the multiplayer mode both wirelessly between two nearby consoles and in Wi Fi between two machines scattered around the world. In both cases you can choose to clash with ~neutral~ armies created by the computer to balance the fate of the encounter, or to take the field with your own monsters earned and raised in the single player adventure: in the latter case you will get experience points to keep even in the single player campaign. Playing in multi, the problems of the control system, of the AI and of the very nature of the genre dealt with in such an antiquated way remain, but the frustrating element is missing as we are at least playing against someone who has the same problems as us. Unfortunately, however, the game via the Internet is afflicted by a lag that is often noticeable, which does not affect the games but is still annoying, especially considering that this is the first case of rather heavy lag on DS. Finally, little to say about technical realization and presentation in general: graphics and sound are from GBA, without any exception, and even on the old Nintendo laptop it is possible to see and hear better. Then they also leave the story to be desired, as mentioned, and the chara design, rather devoid of charisma, while the design of the backgrounds reveals a few more sparks, without ever straying from the traditional track. They are not fundamental things, but if they are there they are nice, especially in a game that has more than a kinship with the world of JRPGs. If on the one hand Lost Magic is only to be commended for its so profound structure, which recalls the most complex Japanese strategy games for consoles and as such is capable of giving great satisfaction once all the concepts are well grasped, and for the excellent use which makes the touch screen with the spell execution system, on the other hand the monster control system so limited, the AI not at all developed and the intrinsic difficulty make it difficult for those not accustomed to the genre (but on PC excellent levels of immediacy are achieved while remaining a very profound genre) and for all those who do not want or cannot devote much time and patience to it. The mediocre technical realization and the dull presentation indicate even more strongly a development that has focused above all on the substance, for a title that will be able to give great satisfaction only to those willing to the utmost dedication. In this case the purchase is strongly recommended, in the others it is to be weighed with great attention. Like all innovative or revolutionary ideas in the videogame field, and this is in fact one of the greatest fears when it comes to the upcoming Wii, too often third parties fail to grasp, or at least exploit properly, the innovative spirit of the first shift party. We have seen this for example with Sony's Eye Toy, which didn't give rise to the plethora of games that one might have expected, and partly also with the DS, where apart from Nintendo itself few developers have managed to create titles that truly took full advantage of the presence of two screens and the tactile interface, perhaps accompanying everything to a deep and complex structure. This Lost Magic, developed by the historian Taito and distributed by us by Ubisoft, comes as a bit of a surprise: by combining a Real Time Strategy basic structure with RPG elements, Lost Magic shows off a truly complete and intriguing use of the stylus, as well as a concept clearly studied with attention and great detail, and is a candidate as one of the most profound experiences that can be had on the Nintendo laptop. There's no shortage of problems, thoughOh, as we are about to find out.", "date": "2006-05-05", "grade": null}
