{"name": "Everybody's Tennis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everybodys-tennis-recensione.html", "text": "Let's take the field! Everybody's Tennis immediately imposes immediacy and simplicity, offering in practice only one game mode properly so-called (~Challenge~), surrounded by the possibility of becoming familiar with the control system (~Training~) and by the inevitable multiplayer (available only locally, however: the online has not been entered). While not a real career mode, the Challenge contains numerous elements that involve the ~growth~ of the characters we use, but above all the unlocking of new tennis players, new fields, new clothes and so on. You start with only two characters available, both balanced in skills (a boy and a girl), then as you progress through the tournaments, new tennis players are unlocked. The total number of characters is fourteen, but the game often offers them to us in different variations, especially during the early stages. After a certain number of tournaments, the variable elements begin to be different: fields of different textures, different playing positions (for a while we will get used to playing only in the lower part of the screen, then things will change unexpectedly), even unfavorable weather conditions. The matches are of medium duration, generally best of five games or less, and the game is calibrated so that the difficulty increases very gradually. Even before starting a new tournament we are explained exactly what our opponents will be able to do from that point on, complete with advice on how to win in the most intricate situations.

The character design of Everybody&#39;s Tennis & egrave; high level... [/C] Forehand and backhand Far from wanting to be a rigid and realistic tennis simulation, Everybody's Tennis still boasts solid and thick gameplay, characterized by numerous variables. There are only three buttons on the Dual Shock 2 that we are going to use, in this case X for the quick hit, Circle for the drop and Triangle for the ~lob~, with the left analog stick deputized not only for the movement of the character, but also for directing shots. If the mechanism of quick exchanges, first to the right and then to the left, is assimilated very quickly and ensures the victory of numerous matches, mastering the techniques that involve the alternation of drop shots and long balls is more difficult but it also knows how to generate greater satisfaction in case of success. In any case, don't think for a moment that all the characters in Everybody's Tennis will let you play the same way: each one has certain characteristics, which make him more skilled in baseline play rather than at the net, stronger in serving rather how quick in movement, and so on. You won't even need to do direct tests to test these skills, since the game will immediately show you each tennis player for what his strengths are. The last element to consider, but certainly not least, is the timing of the impacts between racket and ball. If in Wii Sports this dynamic actually determines the type of shot, in ET it is no different and can really make the difference between a deadly shot and a dull one, which will be easily countered. At the moment of the serve, our character will express the outcome of the shot through an onomatopoeia, and the same will happen to our opponent: the right glance will make us guess the nature of his shot, therefore. Technical realization On a visual level, Clap Hanz's new title is presented in the best possible way for what its intentions are: the character design is the master, with very nice, well-animated characters who boast a certain number of expressions and the whose drawing style is typically Japanese. Scenarios have been built around them, numerous and endowed with peculiar characteristics that go beyond the playing field and which are shown in the shots that introduce each match. In one of the stages there is even a railway track near the field, and the noise of the train is overwhelming during the first exchanges... even if, on closer inspection, there is no locomotive passing! Certainly ET is not Gears of War, and perhaps inserting a moving convoy could have invalidated a fluidity that always remains at excellent levels and does not show any decline, despite an excessive use of special effects to represent the shots. It must be said that the characters could have been more numerous, but given the excellent characterization work done on those present, it is a criticism that could not even be moved. The sector areoro perfectly marries the spirit of the game, and the proof lies in the disconcerting simplicity of some music, which does not leave its mark but which does not even appear ~out of tune~ in the context of the games. To top it all off there are good quality effects and Italian speech not without defects in the acting, but all in all above the average we are used to. Comment Those looking for an ~alternative~ video game, light in content but really fun and engaging, should seriously consider Everybody's Tennis. Clap Hanz's new product perhaps lacks in the lack of alternative game modes, but it boasts a really solid gameplay, which will also conquer those who don't like tennis or those who, on the contrary, are passionate about it and prefer more realistic simulations. Technically valid and dubbed in Italian, it doesn't last long in single but can guarantee numerous challenges in multiplayer. For the next episode it will be reasonable to expect an online mode as well as the presence of substantial side game options, but in the meantime it is difficult not to get caught up in the spectacular exchanges of this newborn, at least in our territory, tennis series. Pros: Good character design Playability of unexpected depth A game suitable for everyone, really Cons: Only one game mode, in practice No online The characters could have been more After the popular Everybody's Golf series, the developers of the Clap Hanz team have finally decided to broaden their sports horizons, trying their hand at a tennis title that bases its appeal on immediate playability, cartoony graphics and an unexpected depth . A tennis game for everyone, really.", "date": "2007-05-08", "grade": null}
