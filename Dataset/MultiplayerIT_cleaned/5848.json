Admittedly, ALfheim Online's narrative arc was perhaps not the most inspired of the series, but a direct sequel to Hollow Fragment, set in a world imbued with Norse mythology and with new gameplay possibilities offered by the introduction of flight and magic , seemed like an excellent opportunity for a real leap in quality. The development of Lost Song was thus entrusted to Artdink, who started working on the game already at the time of the second season of the anime and created a very different title from its predecessor. After exploring every corner of Svart Alfheim, here is our verdict on Sword Art Online: Lost Song The rainbow after the storm Sword Art Online: Lost Song takes place immediately after the events of Hollow Fragment and offers an original story set in the area of Svart Alfheim, an expansion of ALfheim Online. The reality of Lost Song therefore remains different from that of the anime, so it is not surprising that the background of some characters is slightly different from the canonical one of the series. But this distance, which on paper could have allowed the creation of a better script than that of the anime, ends up betraying expectations: the main narrative system, in fact, revolves around the scientific research of a child prodigy named Rainbow Arshavin and, despite the premises, it ends up becoming yet another soap opera to allow Kirito to earn a couple of new groupies. An interesting variation on the theme is instead offered by the secondary missions related to the heroines which, rather than retracing facts seen in the anime (the story of Yuuki and Asuna, for example), in some cases allow some brief excursus on Norse mythology, going to bother the likes of Loki, Baldr or Odin himself. It's a pity that so much good material has not been exploited to give greater depth to the main missions and that the character design of the divine characters ends up flattening on the mediocrity of any other non-player character present. Multiplayer: co-op and PvP After the experiment seen in the PlayStation 4 remake of Hollow Fragment, Lost Song offers two online modes. In rooms of up to sixteen players (using the same gaming platform), groups of four can take on some extra missions in co-op, which are basically the bosses of the single-player mode and the missions unlocked at the end of the main story. Despite some frame-rate dips, fighting tougher enemies alongside real players is a lot more fun than doing it alongside AI. For 1vs1 duels to the death, it is also possible to access a PvP mode. What to do? However, the narration is an excuse to go from one dungeon to another and during the exploration of the four areas of Svart Alfheim one is guided step by step in completing each mission: the map immediately indicates the objectives to be achieved, without hiding the uncharted roads, and fellow travelers provide to solve every puzzle in the game. So you end up doing the same things over and over again: clearing dungeons and killing intermediate bosses to finally access the main boss room of the island. Even the secondary missions are always the same and require you to kill a certain number of monsters (often recycled and characterized by simple chromatic variations) or to collect a certain material. No interaction with NPCs, no choices - everything proceeds in a linear and repetitive way from start to finish. Compared to Infinity Moment, the phase of collecting data on the bosses is also missing, which are thus faced blindly and beaten without the need to apply any particular strategy. In a couple of cases you find yourself dueling with a single opponent, but PvP during the story is never a real challenge. The difficulty level is in fact calibrated downwards and, while always playing on difficulty, there are no enemies who follow a logic in the attacks: compared to the lower levels, therefore only the time necessary to knock them down changes. Fortunately, the rich amount of content offered after reaching the end credits, which include the New Game + mode, tricky extra missions and duels against the various protagonists of the game, allows you to fully explore a gameplay full of facets. You can fly! From the management of the abiFrom skills and spells to choosing and upgrading weapons, there are various ways to develop characters to suit different play styles. A rudimentary editor can also be accessed, to create up to three new heroes by transferring to them some of the skills of the rich original cast. Compared to Hollow Fragment, then, the combat system has been made more immediate and frenetic, eliminating the waiting times between basic shots and reducing the importance of the Switch. There is obviously also a system of weaknesses and resistances, but it is not made explicit and you have to go groping to understand which element can be more effective against a given enemy. The most important novelty is however represented by the flight: the fairies of ALO can in fact hover in the air, only outdoors, to reach otherwise inaccessible places and speed up their movements. In air battles this new mechanic offers the possibility of using the arena vertically, but hitting a target in close combat ends up too often depending on chance. Furthermore, some problems of polygonal interpenetration certainly do not help calibrate the attacks: there are moments in which the enemies cross the invisible line of the combat area and, even indoors, it can happen that the monsters escape a sure shot by crossing the walls or getting stuck walking over the heads of Kirito and co. Against the more difficult bosses, the shortcomings of the two AI-driven characters also come into play, who seem to get excited when facing a powerful enemy. While in the early stages of the game they are reactive and capable of actively collaborating, in the advanced clashes they inexplicably stupefy and spend tens of seconds standing still in a point near the flame of the player who has just died. In these cases, all that remains is to hope that they recover or resign themselves to the idea of abandoning the fight and returning to the nearest resurrection point. PSVita trophies Sword Art Online: Lost Song allows you to unlock 43 trophies, including platinum. More than half are hidden because they are linked to the completion of chapters of the game or some particular missions. The others instead aim at the achievement of completionist objectives and require a lot of grind to be obtained. In keeping with the presence of cross-save, trophies are shared between PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV. Is anybody there? In addition to the aforementioned interpenetration problems, Sword Art Online: Lost Song is technically poor in every aspect. The level of detail is below expectations: the open-world nature of the map has led to a drastic reduction in the landscape elements on PlayStation Vita compared to the Hollow Area. The scenarios are thus decidedly anonymous, also due to a polygonal modeling that is anything but soft and due to the absence of non-player characters ready to assign missions or intent on fighting monsters. The frame rate settles at 30 frames per second, with significant drops especially against large bosses. The PlayStation 4 version, on the other hand, enjoys greater fluidity, even in critical situations: the 60 frames per second allow you to be more precise in combat, but struggle to justify the thirty euro difference in the purchase price. The graphics on the home console is in fact only slightly higher than that seen on the laptop, but the benefits are limited to some basic particle effects, the presence of grass on the ground and faster loading. Negative note also on the localization front: the dialogues, to tell the truth always understandable, have been translated into Italian starting from an English version that is far from faithful, and present numerous errors and an almost comical use of informal words such as ~gnorri~ and ~easy~. Finally, the important Lost Song mission is inexplicably missing the Japanese voice acting.", "date": "2015-12-03", "grade": "6.8"}
