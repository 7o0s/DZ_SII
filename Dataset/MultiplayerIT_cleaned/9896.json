Sequel to a title available on the PlayStation Store since the end of 2008 (and preceded by a PC version released the year before), this new work by SideQuest Studios takes up the mechanics of the first episode and once again pushes the accelerator on the spectacularity of the situations , on increasingly gigantic and threatening bosses, on almost infinitely upgradeable weapons and on some extras to unlock. The control system sees us use the analog stick to move the ship, the back buttons to ~scroll~ the three available weapons and the main buttons of the Dual Shock 3 to fire and use the two special attacks, which are activated when we put I mark a certain sequence of strokes. A rather simple approach to the genre, therefore, in which particularly original ideas do not seem to have found a place: where the valuable Einhander for PSone allowed us to adjust the speed of the spaceship to enjoy a better movement sensitivity during the inevitable ~dodges~, or the more recent Ikaruga based its gameplay on the management of the double energy shield which canceled one type of bullet rather than another, Final Prototype chooses a path made of immediacy rather than depth, offering us a flood of situations already seen even if well implemented. Alone against all Soldner-X 2: Final Prototype sees us face a total of seven stages, five of which are immediately available and two to unlock. The scenarios are profoundly different from each other: you go from a background made of gas clouds to a huge frozen cave, from a metal tunnel to a futuristic urban cross-section, passing through a violent meteor shower. During the action scrolling often changes direction, projecting us now forward (towards the right of the screen, therefore), now in a vertical motion, with accelerations and decelerations which unfortunately are not enhanced by a convincing visual effect: one has the clear impression that what happens in the background does not concern us, and that the spacecraft is practically stationary. This feeling is accentuated by the movement of the power-ups, which float in the air and move in our direction too slowly. Speaking of upgrades, their management leaves us a bit perplexed: the increase in power of the weapons occurs very gradually, but following the loss of a ship, the game hastens to give us back almost all the lost upgrades, because obviously without of them it would be too complicated to continue. At our disposal we have something like four different weapons which, however, must find space in only three ~slots~ of the spaceship: the starting blue laser, equipped with a good penetration capacity, which in the end proves to be the most versatile solution for any eventuality; a sort of ~electric discharge~ that hits a large number of targets simultaneously but is unfortunately very weak and therefore should only be used against small and fragile enemies; the classic ~wide beam~ in this case similar to energy bubbles, with a short range but good power at short distances; a green ~wave~ laser that does not differ much from the blue laser. Playstation 3 trophies There are fourteen trophies that can be unlocked in Soldner-X 2: Final Prototype and are obtained by completing the individual stages at any level of difficulty, winning the various challenges, collecting a certain number of rings or finding the hidden keys within the scenarios. The boss's daughter As in any self-respecting shooter, at the end of each stage you have to face a huge boss equipped with more or less dangerous weapons, which moves according to a predetermined pattern that you need to learn quickly. In some titles of the genre it happens that sometimes the bosses are ~infallible~, or that their attacks must necessarily be successful at a certain moment in the fight; which instead does not happen in Soldner-X 2, where enemy bullets generally travel at low speed, giving us the opportunity to avoid them in a not exactly easy but almost way. The design of the bosses is spot on and quite imaginative, even if in this vein we have seen a bit of everything so far and it is really difficult to create something innovative. The high-definition polygonal graphics protect you from the typical limits of the old two-dimensional shoot'em-ups, so the action flows smoothly and without uncertainties even when all hell is on the screen; and the speech extends to the management of the bosses, equipped with limited but convincing animations, as well as various ~layers~ that must be destroyed before the fightment resolves. Our spaceship and the numerous enemy units are well drawn, and an excellent job has been done to make the projectiles always distinguishable from the background, to avoid suffering accidental damage. As mentioned above, the scenarios are quite varied and boast an excellent level of detail, but it must be said that some certainly appear more inspired and rich than others. Furthermore, the direction of the game, understood as direction, unfortunately does not try too much, putting us in situations we have already seen, without any surprises whatsoever. A similar discourse can also be made for the musical accompaniment, based on techno songs which, however, never manage to leave their mark and sometimes are even out of place.", "date": "2010-07-16", "grade": "7.0"}
