We have already told you about our first seven days, when we were still learning the mayor's job, one of the great innovations introduced by New Leaf, or the fourth edition of Dbutsu no Mori, the franchise born in 2001 on Nintendo 64, in Japan, and then converted for GameCube and imported into all the rest of the world with the title Animal Crossing. It's been twelve years since then, and in the meantime we've played it on Nintendo DS (Wild World) and Nintendo Wii (City Folk). A version for the new portable console of the big N could not be missing, of course, but if the transition to 3D is the only news worthy of note you will only know by reading the next few lines. The debt simulator Obviously the stereoscopic effect is not the only addition to Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and although it is well done it does not represent the value of the game at all. From a technical point of view, no great progress has been made compared to the Nintendo Wii edition, but the graphic rendering appeared to us significantly cleaner and more colorful, thanks also to a greater definition of the textures and a whole series of animations and special effects that embellish the overall look of the game. We are faced with a pleasant but all in all simple and essential product, in which the models of the characters are composed of a handful of polygons and express their emotions through small movements and different types of textures for the shape of the eyes. Of course, the graphics sector is definitely not the pivot around which the gameplay revolves, and even in this case it does its duty more than well, already offering us some small innovations in that sense too: Nintendo has in fact adopted new, more slender polygonal models which also include legs and feet, for the simple reason that it is possible to buy clothing for those parts of the body as well. We will dwell on the question later, in the meantime we have decided to dedicate this first paragraph of our review to what we could consider the main defects of the game, and therefore to the graphic rendering, pleasant as we said and little more, and to the question of money, which in Animal Crossing: New Leaf it is even more important than in any other chapter of the series. You see, those first seven days we told you about, and the next seven as well, weren't exactly easy for the Mayor of Everwood, who had to spend the vast majority of his time picking and selling fruit, fish, insects and buried fossils. . A daily routine necessary to satisfy practically every old and new aspect of the gameplay, from the mortgage of the house to the administration fee of the ordinances, passing through the costs of public works and whims such as clothing and work tools. Precisely by virtue of the much greater amount of activities, events and features contained in the cartridge, money becomes fundamental right away, but in the first hours of the game there are very few ways to accumulate it, which traps the player in a repetitive cycle of actions and not a little tedious, also thanks to the shortage of events and holidays in the month of May in which we tried the game. In short, it is a rather tiring first step to climb, both for novice players, who may not know all the tricks and secrets of the series, and for veterans who have already accumulated too much money in the previous episodes . We have to hold on, however, because once we pay off the first couple of mortgages and start struggling with the management of the city, a new world literally opens up capable of sucking us in for much more than the thirty minutes a day we set ourselves to devote to it. The mayor The main strength of Animal Crossing: New Leaf is represented without any shadow of a doubt by the unprecedented position of mayor that is saddled with us as soon as we set foot in our new town (which, for the avoidance of doubt, we have called Everwood, but you you can call it whatever you want). The role and the features that surround him offer two great possibilities: firstly, they allow us to customize the city in a completely new way compared to previous Animal Crossing games; secondly, they represent a goal, a goal to be achieved that stimulates us to play and to accumulate that precious pile of extra stars every day. The office of mayor doesn't just make us the VIPs of the city, recognized and appred by the citizens who will often call us to inaugurate properties and premises, but it also gives us considerable power over its own structure and everyday life through the mechanics of public works and that of ordinances. The first is just what the name suggests: by paying a certain sum to finance the works, it is possible to improve the city by adding bridges, fences, fountains, lampposts and other useful assets that will embellish the appearance of the country and make the inhabitants happier. Some more expensive public works unlock premises and activities both in Via degli Acquisti, the equivalent of the city of City Folk and the nerve center of the New Leaf economy, and in the real periphery of the town: it is a real game interlocking, however, because to unlock some of them you must first build others and satisfy further hidden conditions. The ordinances, on the other hand, make it possible to significantly alter the quality of life in the country, changing the habits of the inhabitants: we will be able to decide to close the shops later, increase the value of the objects sold and bought, increase the activity of the inhabitants in the morning or make the natural environment more autonomous and resistant. The usefulness of the ordinances is not so obvious: at first sight they simply serve to modify the parameters of the game for a purely strategic question; in reality, the ordinances allow the experience to be adapted to the player's needs, respecting the value that the series gives to the real passage of time. A player who perhaps cannot play during the day for work might want to find the shops open even after dinner, without resorting to the date and time change trick, which is impractical and practically contrary to the principles of the game itself. The barbarian invasions Among the various public works that can be built, the dream house certainly stands out. of some fruit that does not grow in its parts. The Dream House feature, thanks to which we will be able to do whatever we want in another mayor's city without having any real effect on it, is a bit of an end in itself, but it allows us to talk about Animal Crossing's multiplayer mode : New Leaf and to give a sigh of relief to all those players tired of being visited by vandals intent on digging holes everywhere, uprooting their trees and stealing their fruit. Since the very first Animal Crossing, and from the objects and fruits exchanged through very long alphanumeric codes, Nintendo has always focused heavily on the social component of the series, making small changes from edition to edition to make it increasingly satisfying and complex. Although some mechanics may still appear rather antiquated today, Animal Crossing: New Leaf represents a real forge for those who love to share experiences with friends that, enjoyed alone, would get bored all too soon. Similar to the House of dreams, for example, is the Sbirciacase district, a special area in which the houses of players randomly encountered through StreetPass appear: we will be able to visit them, admire them and get ideas for furnishing our home, perhaps even ordering the furniture contained within them, in the most complete anonymity. As unlikely as taking advantage of this feature may seem in our area, the Peek-a-boo neighborhood is a clear example of the philosophical direction taken by Nintendo. The sharing system via QR is another: a practically secret feature to be unlocked, it allows you to transform the models created by the players and share them with everyone else, through simple photos of the derived QR code, to apply them to clothes, umbrellas, paintings and more. In Japan it has turned into a craze, and there are already real showcases of templates and QR codes inspired by manga, anime and other video games. In short, the multiplayer component is one of the strengths of Animal Crossing: New Leaf; the procedure necessary to welcome up to three friends at the same time in our country via the Internet will also be cumbersome, but exchanging gifts and clothes with them, going for a swim in the sea, attending K.K. Slider or participating together in the mini-games of the tropical island is certainly a very pleasant pastime, especially if you consider the exorbitant amount of activities, objects and events designed by Nintendo and all to be shared: in dark and pessimistic times like these, Animal Crossing: New Leaf it is a game that rewards generosity and sympathy, making us feel better about ourselves and with others.The 3D effect Without infamy and without praise the stereoscopic effect of Animal Crossing: New Leaf, although in line with the excellent quality of other Nintendo productions. The depth of the image doesn't affect the gameplay in any way, but it makes our ~parallel world~ more alive and engaging. The country of the New Leaf The islet is only one of these activities. This is the bonus area that was accessible by connecting a Game Boy Advance to the very first Animal Crossing for GameCube, back with great fanfare and full of new features. It can be reached by boat after being invited by former mayor Tortimer, and represents a sort of extra area in which to collect new fruit, catch different types of insects or fish and play some nice mini-games alone or in company to accumulate the special currency necessary to buy rather exotic furniture or clothing. It also has another important function: on the islet of Tortimer it is summer all year round. The passage of time and the seasons affect the gameplay of Animal Crossing: New Leaf more than ever, thanks to the variety of activities and events that characterize almost every week of the year. Compared to the previous portable edition for Nintendo DS, the real holidays are back, from Mother's Day to Christmas, passing through Halloween or San Lorenzo: most have been renewed compared to the other Animal Crossings in which it was already present, therefore even veterans of the franchises will have something new to experience. In addition to the festivities, there is a whole series of random and non-random events that offer something new or different to do almost every day: shipwrecked people on the beach, new citizens, visitors from other countries, street vendors, self-styled clairvoyants, fishing competitions and so on and so forth. has more to put. It's an eccentric world, very colorful and full of positivity, in which to get lost even just for a few minutes to take a tour of the museum or talk to a neighbor who will always make us smile. Even our inhabitants, in fact, enjoy an even greater variety of phrases, habits and needs than in the past. Interacting with them is always pleasant thanks also to the quality of the texts and the Italian translation, funny and ironic at the right point: they could offer us to visit them or make an appointment to see our house, they could challenge us to hide and seek, ask us to deliver a object for them, to give us something to repay us for a little letter or a good deed. Every inhabitant of the city has a distinctive character that is expressed through his way of speaking or behaving: we become attached to our neighbors to the point of preventing them from moving, but the curiosity to find out what a new inhabitant could be like is always a lot . In short, the underlying stimulus of the game is always the same: to collect. Collect events, furniture, clothes, fossils, butterflies... experiences. In this sense, we admit that we are happy that Animal Crossing is back in the pocket, especially in this excellent form: it is a game that lends itself well to hit and run games of a few minutes, rather than long sessions of hours and hours. If you're a fan of Animal Crossing, then you've just found a potentially infinite game", "date": "2013-06-04", "grade": "9.0"}
