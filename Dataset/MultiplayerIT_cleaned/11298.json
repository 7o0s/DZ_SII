{"name": "Block Breaker Deluxe - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/block-breaker-deluxe-recensione.html", "text": "Block Breaker Deluxe is available for download on Nintendo Wii WiiWare. Money and bricks The game interface involves the use of the Wii Remote only, proving to be a reactive but also rather uncomfortable system. The bar moves faithfully following the right-left movements of the controller, which simultaneously moves a pointer, useful for collecting bonuses at any point on the screen, or activating particular power-ups (shots or various shots) by pressing the A key. If everything is very sensitive and fast, the problem is given by the continuous strain on the wrist and the lack of a ~support~ point (a neutral zone for inputs) which tends to get tiring in a short time. The choice of the analog stick would have been appreciated, since even the possibility of using the directional cross is impractical, due to the need to keep the remote control vertical anyway, thus making it difficult to press the A button. Access to the levels is implemented through a map, whose points of interest (mostly local always in 80s style) represent each of the collections of sequential levels in which we will have to challenge an opponent in Block Breaker. These levels are obviously configured as simple variations in the arrangement of the bricks to be knocked down, but the great variety in the types of bricks make the experience quite interesting: in fact, there are explosive blocks, blocks that must be hit several times, which have a weak~ and many others, obviously with increasing difficulty, up to real battles with final ~bosses~ at the end of each group of levels. The progression in the game allows the accumulation of money, with which it is possible to buy power ups for our ~bar~ (shot, magnet, extension and variations on the genre). There is a multiplayer mode that allows two players to challenge each other on the screen at the same time, in such a way as to create a sort of mix between Pong and Breakout, an optimal solution if you have a second remote control and obviously a partner. Comment Block Breaker on WiiWare is essentially the same game that appeared, with the same name, on mobile phones around the world. The low-def graphics and slightly glamorous, somewhat naive look screams ~mobile gaming~ from all pixels, on the other hand. The structure is that of Breakout (or Arkanoid), immutable, and therefore a guarantee, and the new grafts are quite convincing, especially as regards the study of the different types of blocks (which force a more strategic approach than usual) and on power-ups, which give something more to the normal dynamic of the game. Less convincing, on the other hand, are the tiring control system and the technical sector, which certainly does not stand out for great care in its construction. Again, there is a lack of support for online which, at least as regards rankings and scores, we hope will (sooner or later) become a standard on WiiWare as well. 800 Wii Points aren't many, but this is in fact a game that can now be played for free via the browser, or in similar ways, and in general finds a clearer justification in a mobile context. Pro Granite gameplay Good new introductions More approach strategic to the game Cons Graphics and sound derived directly from mobiles Tired control system No online leaderboards Few video games can match the structural longevity of Atari's Breakout. If there was a canon of classic videogames, the 1976 production by Bushnell and co. certainly deserves a prominent place, obviously next to the inspirer Pong. Beyond the iconic power of the early days, and the history of its development involving names like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, what amazes about Breakout is its ability to re-propose itself, thirty years later, on the modern market. The idea of the bar line that makes a ball bounce against bricks has proved to be a basic theme, with the ability to evolve even only marginally, but to be able to remain valid over the years. The bouncing square has properly become a sphere, the bricks have changed shape and characteristics, the barline has acquired unprecedented capabilities, but the structure is always the same: freeing the space above from occlusive elements, trying not to let the sphere fall below the bottom edge of the screen. Gameloft's Block Breaker Deluxe is based on this scaffolding, which quickly fills the incomplete absence of a Breakout clone on WiiWare, after appearing on various portable and mobile platforms. Not without a certain conceptual embarrassment, the game tries to connect its typical structure with a setting based on gambling andgood in Miami Vice style, with an 80s patina all colored neon and dance music which, although appreciably melancholy in some ways, remains rather incomprehensible (not to mention comical). We therefore find ourselves performing in Block Breaker games trying to earn money and fame, wandering around various clubs and nightclubs in which, evidently, the discipline of the ~barline that bounces a ball~ represents the coolest pastime of the moment.", "date": "2008-07-11", "grade": null}
