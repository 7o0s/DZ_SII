RealArcade did not want to be outdone, thus giving life to the third chapter of one of its most popular series, Playman Summer Games, which in fact also represents the best exponent of the genre on mobile phones. Unfortunately, there are only 5 specialties available, namely 100 metres, 110 hurdles, long jump, pole vault and javelin throw; in fact, the poverty of available disciplines actually constitutes the only major defect of PSG3, which otherwise is capable of demonstrating at all times the care taken by the programmers. The game structure basically returns to the classic formula, albeit with some interesting variations; in practice the leitmotif lies in the alternating pressure of keys 4 and 6 to make the athlete run, while 5 allows you to perform the action linked to each individual sport such as jumping or throwing the javelin. The difference compared to the usual is that the buttons to run are not pressed alternately, but based on what appears on the screen, thus adding a further challenge factor. Obviously the fact remains that the faster the correct keys are pressed, the faster the athlete will run, thus giving the possibility not only of winning but also of breaking world records or one's best performances. And it is precisely the challenge factor, with oneself and with the adversaries controlled by the CPU, which pushes to repeat the tests numerous times, although in any case there is a fairly solid structure that offers two levels of difficulty to overcome before reaching a particularly Surviving mode demanding. The goodness of the graphic component is instead indisputable under every point you look at it, from the aesthetic variety of the athletes, to the comic style and particularly successful, to the rich and complex animations, up to the well-organized and clear menus. But one of the most positive points of RealArcade's effort lies precisely in an aspect that we have often mentioned on wirelessgaming, namely multiplayer; in this case really essential to guarantee the longevity of the product, fortunately it has been implemented for a maximum of 5 players through the ~pass the phone~ solution, i.e. with the exchange of the mobile phone and therefore ~deferred~. If there had also been challenges simultaneously via bluetooth it would have been really the best, but even so we can certainly be satisfied. Also worth mentioning is the ability to send your own records to a global ranking, with which you can compare yourself with other users, thus finding a further reason for a challenge.
