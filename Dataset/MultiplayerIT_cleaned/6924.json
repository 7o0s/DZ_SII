In short: The Sims is The Sims! The only comparison that can be made is with its predecessors and The Sims 4 is undoubtedly confirmed as the chapter with the most sophisticated playability, even if this new minimal style certainly makes the more hardcore players regret something. Fresh, streamlined and intuitive, The Sims 4 proves to be a successful bet Create your Sim Let's introduce one of the keywords around which everything The Sims 4 revolves: intuitiveness. The new Create a Sim mode has undergone a heavy restyling, gaining in simplicity: the choice of predefined physical traits always remains within the menu, but those are only the starting point on which to model the final appearance of our Sim. In fact, the whole body of our friends can be modified with a simple click and drag, giving life to an incredible variety of Sims, to which you will then also have to assign voice, walk, aspiration and character. The part dedicated to building the character of the Sim is extremely important because, depending on what you choose, you will affect your gameplay: playing with a Sim with creative aspirations will be very different from dealing with a science lover or an animal party.Obviously there is also the part dedicated to clothing and accessories which, as we had expected, does not differ much from what the old chapters offered, thus finding ourselves dealing with many anonymous and somewhat ~cheap~. There was a very nice house... After creating a Sim, the second step is obviously to build a house for our friend. For some this mode, more than the actual gameplay, is the beating heart of the game and for this reason even more significant changes have been made with respect to the phase of creating a Sim, in order to make it more pleasant and dynamic. The dynamism refers to the flexibility that the mode offers to the player, adapting to his needs: if before it was necessary to know all the subcategories of the menus almost by heart (both for the construction part and for the furnishings), now the navigation it's very simple and, thanks to the addition of some clever innovations, you will have various ways in which to proceed in the construction of the house. The interface has evolved a lot: to get an overview of all the items in the inventory, just click on the icon of the desired object that you will find inside the house and rooms scheme, near the navigation menu. In this way, by viewing a room, you will have quick access to all the elements that compose it; in addition to this display order, you can also access the inventory using the classic cataloging by function (all surfaces, all appliances...). If, on the other hand, you are a player who doesn't like to waste time (that is, getting lost in inventories sifting through the entire catalogue), during this part of the game you can directly choose rooms that have already been built and furnished to quickly assemble a house from scratch, however sacrificing its character and customization. Obviously you can add and remove elements to this predefined block and you can also change its size: a very intelligent addition was in fact that of being able to move the walls, and with these also the furniture leaning against them, with a simple click on the arrow of the desired direction , thus replacing the mangy demolition with a simple slip. Through the editor you can also choose the height of the walls (very important novelty for placing windows, paintings and shelves at staggered heights) and the inclination of the roofs, thus creating a variety of structures and shapes that in the previous chapters were not achievable even with the most complex of tricks. Whether you are a player who devotes a lot or a little time to this mode, we are sure that you will surely find an action strategy that is well suited to your way of playing. Sore points: as already widely discussed, it should be noted the lack of various very important elements, such as garages (and attached cars) and swimming pools. In place of the latter, fountains have been inserted, visually very pleasant but with a very different purpose. Although this choice is more or less agreeable, there is no doubt that this lack causes the title to lose some considerable points, especially aware of the fact that, probably,these historic components will be offered to us later for a fee. The last note to report regarding this mode are the game commands, slightly different from previous titles but impossible to use if you are a longtime player accustomed to the ancient command system: fortunately you will have the possibility to choose which one to use from the game options menu. The open world that doesn't exist Another totally different thing, but which this time plays in favor of the title, is the subdivision of the neighborhoods into small neighborhoods. This change is placed between The Sims 2 and The Sims 3: we will therefore be able to view a certain number of buildings in the area adjacent to our Sims' house and visit them by clicking on them, or we will be able to travel to a community lot or a house outside the limits neighborhood. The decision to abandon a totally open world neighborhood in fact allows for shorter loading times and, although many have complained about the additional click to travel outside the neighborhood boundaries, we do not believe that this apparent step backwards will worsen the gaming experience . The districts are therefore more ~navigable~ and graphically very pleasant: new animations have been added both to the scenarios and to the Sims and the building materials (in particular the reflective textures of glass, metal, plastic) are realistic and very convincing. Despite this pleasant appearance, we had the impression that considerable progress has not been made on the graphic aspect, and this especially if we consider the leap made in the transition from The Sims 2 to The Sims 3. Another thing we had already talked about in a previous preview, is that the dominant architectural style is the American colonial one, although there are various buildings built according to a contemporary taste. In itself this is not a mistake, but this stylistic closure has always been strongly present in The Sims and, until now, only developed in the building plans. In The Sims 4, on the other hand, the influence of the American living style is reflected in the complete structure of the default house, both inside and out; it is not clear whether this choice, perpetrated over time, is a deliberate distinctive feature or the result of excessive patriotism, but in our opinion this will penalize the game in the long run because it will bore the players who will not feel represented by American habits and style . The game of emotions There is also a lot to say in relation to the actual gameplay, also revised in many respects but slightly disappointing compared to what we have covered so far. Before the game came out one of the strong points that appeared in every presentation of The Sims 4 was the realism and intelligence of the Sims, but they are not present in the game to the extent that we expected. A great deal of work has been done on emotions, and in fact these are what condition all the actions of our Sims: a discouraged Sim, for example, will obtain mediocre results in every activity we make him do while living that particular state of mind, while on the contrary a satisfied Sim will do great things, earning rewards at work, advancing their skill levels faster and socializing more easily. The mood of the Sims is so important that, within the game interface, it has been loaded with a graphic weight greater than the needs, a choice that we do not feel like sharing given that the state of the Sim (hunger, sleep, bladder ...) has always been central to the gameplay. And again to mark this ~emotion-centric~ choice, there is not only a sometimes too aggressive musical accompaniment but you soon realize how the mood is contagious and how a disgruntled Sim is enough to ruin your day. This is the clear example of the poorly developed realism in the game: the mood is in fact determined by objects or other Sims with a particular emotional aura, but just move away a little or even go from one room to another and the mood suddenly changes , making not only the whole situation unrealistic but above all complicating life for the player, who will find himself at the mercy of his Sim's whims. No significant changes have been made to the automatic actions (clean the toilet, clear the table), which are interrupted as soon as a new command is given or, worse still, if ~inspiration~ strikes a free-willed Sim. An example of successful realism, on the other hand, can be found in the interaction with other avatars, given that now the Sims relate to their own kind in a more natural way: in fact, our friends don't necessarily have to be facing each other to socialize, but can happily chat while you allhenno, while eating, while sharing a bench... in reality these new Sims chat a lot and this is a great benefit for the player. As far as the game interface is concerned, as we said earlier, much importance has been given to mood, which we will find in the main panel at the bottom left together with the actions, the list of controllable Sims, the Simoleons and the mobile phone, with which we will be able to call and text our friends, look for a job and move from the lot we are visiting. At the top right we will have the classic menu, with the image gallery and the notification board, view of the walls, view commands and options. Finally, at the bottom right, we will find the most important part relating to the game interface; or at least, more important before the advent of emotions. In particular we will have the aspiration, career, skills, relationships, simology (the nature of our Sim) and finally the needs. This last grouping and the order in which the various drop-down menus were placed is very reminiscent of the criterion with which they were ordered in the Game Boy chapters. We are therefore no longer dealing with the massive and detailed graphics of the previous chapters but with a streamlined interface divided into various corners of the screen, a choice that certainly makes us appreciate the game in its entirety, but which for the purists of The Sims could be quite uncomfortable. In the inventory will be collected all the objects that our Sims will create or discover as their technical skills increase. There are many types and they are cataloged from the most common to the rarest. One thing the Sims team never disappoints on is musical accompaniment: the background music is always pleasant and catchy, calmer or livelier depending on the mode we're in. As we mentioned before, the sound effects become more intrusive during the actual gameplay because they accompany every single change of mood of our Sims and, having to deal with some too fickle little guys, after several hours of play this pleasant accompaniment it gets a bit annoying. However, the general satisfaction has a bitter taste because until the end we hoped for a surprise collaboration with some famous artist, making us regret a little the high standards that were achieved at the time with the stupendous soundtrack that Black Eyed Peas edited for The Urbz: Sims in the City. Social Sim The multiplayer mode has never existed in The Sims but despite this, the community that revolves around the brand is active and very collaborative: in fact, thousands of players have always tried their hand at creating new objects, accessories and textures to enrich the inventory and the gaming experience, and thanks to the introduction of social activities, doing it with The Sims 4 is even easier. Having an Origin account, in fact, you can upload predefined families, lots and rooms (which you can save with a special command from the build and buy mode) in your Gallery and share them in the common catalog, making your creations visible and downloadable to other players in the community; you can also follow other users and keep up to date with their publications, which will be notified to you in the notification area. At the start of the game, on the main screen, you will find the link ~The challenge of the week~ where you can share the images of one of your Sims created on social networks by following the instructions of the contest and using the hashtag indicated.", "date": "2014-09-10", "grade": "8.5"}
