As usual for every title that takes advantage of digital delivery, the first downloadable content arrives just over a month after its release: Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, a horror-scifi reinterpretation of the post-apocalyptic scenario of Borderlands. The first expansion, available through Xbox Live for 800 Microsoft Points (and on PC and PSN ed), keeps all the feeling of the original game intact. However, the RPG elements, but above all the action ones, have been expanded even further with the addition of new weapons, new objects, new adrenaline-pumping missions that see us as protagonists on the Island infested with Zombies and monsters of all kinds. Once the Gigabyte has been downloaded, the Island becomes visible on the map and can be accessed from any NewU station in the game by simply selecting ~Jacob's Cove~ as the destination. Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is not a simple ~more of the same~, but presents itself as a real game within the game, reinventing the general atmosphere of the Gearbox title and also some mechanics, in a very similar way to what has already happened for Fallout's Point Lookout, another hugely successful DLC released this year. The difficulty of the game is automatic, but rather than being based on the level reached by our character, it takes the progression in the main quest as a reference. This means that all those who have devoted themselves more to the sub-quests of the main game, and although they have not advanced much have already reached a considerable level, will find this Zombie Island perhaps too easy. On the contrary, those who have ~eaten~ the story by progressing without leveling the character will find a decidedly high challenge in this expansion. Visually, regardless of the setting of an extremely different nature from the main quest, it retains the strengths and weaknesses of the original. The style is, of course, always the very colorful and lively Cel-shaded one, with a 3D engine (the Unreal Engine 3) which in some of the busiest and most crowded situations shows the side to evident slowdowns, even if sporadically and absolutely not bothersome. The sound sector, of a high level, is however neither incisive nor memorable: the sound of the shotguns will echo for the entire duration of the adventure on the Island, dominating that of the good background music. Xbox 360 goals This DLC provides the classic 200 points to unlock, through only 5 objectives. The first three are obtained by simply completing three main story missions, while the other two are tied to the ending, once you meet the infamous Dr. Ned. Taking him out will give us 49 points, while ~trying~ to kill him only one point of encouragement. There's no shortage of humor even in the objectives, in this game! More of a more of the same Those who loved the main Borderlands adventure can't help but love this first expansion as well. Zombie Island of Dr. Ned makes extensive use of all the clichs belonging to the zombie culture with references to films, games and characters in an always ironic and captivating way, never really serious and always with a vein of humor that will not fail to elicit many smiles from the players more savvy who share with the authors of the game that pop culture typical of zombie productions. It gets interesting when the Gearbox guys mix the horror imagery of that genre with typical elements of their Borderlands: swarms of Bloodwings, herds of angry Wereskag, and zombie versions of the fast and fearsome Psychos appear in the skies. However, the fauna of the island is much more varied and includes the notorious Defilers, capable of vomiting acid on the players, destabilizing their health, and the kamikazes who launch themselves at full speed on us armed with explosive barrels. It is precisely this variety of enemies that makes the game action more varied and frenetic, accompanying the player throughout the story with a more frenetic and unpredictable gameplay. The story itself, very well narrated and exciting, undergoes ups and downs when it develops in a masterly way but perhaps ends too hastily. Zombie Island of Dr. Zed lasts about 2/3 hours, but can easily go 4/5 if you want to complete every sub-quest (there are many) and explore every remote corner of Ned's island. The excellent level design invites the most curious players to delve into the quests, full of easter eggs and surprises, significantly increasing the longevity of this expansion. Gearbox's graphic designers did an excellent job drawing in mI hear Dr. Ned's Island sublime and giving moments of pure enjoyment to the players who will surely appreciate numerous glimpses and panoramas worthy of the best horror films. The desolate land and the moonlit beach from which you can climb the hospital hill are beautiful, as are all the settings that characterize the island. Zombie Island of Dr.Ned exemplifies how all DLCs and expansions should be done, keeping the solid gameplay of the original game but rambling on the theme with a different setting, a compelling and well-told story, new weapons and enemies but above all the humor and style that distinguish Borderlands, an unexpected surprise this year.", "date": "2009-12-15", "grade": "8.7"}
