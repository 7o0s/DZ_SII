Yet while he shares the same savory origin, the premise behind the protagonist of Pizza vs. Skeletons is much less elegant and decidedly more trashy. In the new mobile game from the US team Riverman Media, the player finds himself having to face an apocalypse of skeletons impersonating none other than a scary pizza with a diameter of three meters, facing a series of more or less original challenges and accumulating enough coins to customize your alter-ego. Without anchovies, thank you. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a pizza! Pizza vs. Skeletons offers a long series of levels based entirely on the protagonist's ability to roll left or right, jump and crash into his opponents. All through an extremely intuitive control system, thanks to which you move by tilting the device and jump with a simple touch on the screen. One of the basic challenges consists precisely in eliminating a certain number of opponents by rolling and jumping, but at the same time trying to dodge dangers such as spears or spikes. This is accompanied by other types of levels: one is purely platform and sees the player use a series of ramps to jump from platform to platform until the end of the path; another turns the pizza into a wrecking ball and asks the player to destroy the walls on the sides of the screen, possibly avoiding hitting civilians in the flesh; or in a challenge you have to rescue three caged dogs and bring them back to the house by overcoming the dangers along the way; yet another, perhaps the most bizarre and only accessible in the second half of the game, sees the player impersonate a slice of pizza capable of swimming in the depths of the ocean. If we exclude a few small quirks in the fast platform mode, the controls always prove to be excellent and responsive, and in particular the use of the accelerometer is calibrated to perfection. At the end of each challenge you are rewarded with a certain number of stars, essential for accessing the more advanced levels, and you have the opportunity to participate in a sort of roulette with coins up for grabs. Coins which, as mentioned at the beginning, can be spent within a rich editor divided into categories: you can buy new and bizarre eyes, hats and wigs, and obviously new ingredients to season your pizza; or you can completely distort the base, thus impersonating a moon or a giant baseball. It must be said that these changes do not affect the gameplay or the protagonist's skills in any way, but the combinations turn out to be so weird and out of the ordinary that the editor soon becomes a fixed stop to visit at the end of each level. Furthermore, compatibility with Facebook and Twitter gives the player the possibility to share his wacky creations with his friends. And this is precisely the strong point of the game: Pizza vs. Skeletons entertains and makes you smile for the silly ideas and trashy aesthetics, for the complete lack of sense and the little gems (it is possible to understand how much energy remains based on the amount of mozzarella on the pizza), all through a series of mini-games that they certainly don't stand out for their originality, but they are fun and enjoyable to play with. However, 100 levels are too many to be able to keep the variety of the game high, and inevitably soon some modes, especially those that are most similar, end up being rather repetitive, although the developers have done their best to introduce new new challenges and elements, such as more dangerous enemies, brains to bounce on and frenetic boss battles, in which the aim is to push the gigantic opponent out of the arena.
