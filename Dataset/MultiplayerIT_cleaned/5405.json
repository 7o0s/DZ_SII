It is the moment in which all the knots are dissolved and the story concludes, with the ending falling on what was previously enjoyed. In the case of Redux, the fifth chapter of Dreamfal Chapters, we are faced with the conclusion of an entire saga, which for mainly economic reasons will probably not be able to go further. The development of the game was troubled and, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, which ended up with more than a million and a half dollars raised, and funding from the Norwegian Film Institute, it was unable to carve out enough fans to stand on its feet. own legs. In short, Dreamfall Chapters has struggled a lot on the market, to the point that there have been several slowdowns in the releases. The episodes were probably carried out more for a form of respect for users than for a concrete prospect of economic return. Even the entire series was given as a gift during the recent sales of GOG (the digital store of CD Projekt Red), to those who spent a certain amount of money. This is not exactly a positive sign. Too bad, because given the background, Ragnar Trnquist's work would have deserved greater consideration by gamers. However, seventeen years after the launch of The Longest Journey, the time has come to take stock. Dreamfall Chapters closes the series and the saga with Redux: we have reviewed it The Longest Journey series This is how The Longest Journey series is composed: The Longest Journey - 1999 Dreamfall: The Longest Journey - 2006 Dreamall: Chapters - from 2014 to 2016, divided into: - Reborn (October 21, 2014) - Rebels (March 12, 2015) - Realms (June 25, 2015) - Revelations (December 3, 2015) - Redux (June 17, 2016) The Longest Journey Home (cancelled - was supposed to be funded through the Chapters Kickstarter campaign, but the secondary goal that included it was not met) Traditions Redux concludes the stories of the characters known in the previous chapters. The player will take turns controlling Zo Castillo, Kian and Saga, in known places and in other unpublished ones. The entire episode is much more driven than the previous ones, in the sense that there are many more cutscenes. Puzzles and interactions, for their part, are reduced to the bone and, in general, are easy to solve. Not that the previous four chapters offered who knows what challenge, but in this case it is clear how the need was felt to make the central story at the expense of the rest. Without going into the details of what is being told, we can assure you that if you love the characters in the game, some situations won't leave you indifferent. Indeed, if you are particularly involved in their stories, you may even come to tears. Unfortunately Redux carries with it some of the defects of the entire series, which have not been resolved over time. For example, the beginning immediately offers an example of the infamous system of blind interactions, with actions that are unlocked only under certain conditions. Anyone who knows Dreamfall Chapters knows what we mean: in some cases you interact with a hotspot without getting anything, only to then discover that to unlock the right interaction you had to do something else first (solve a puzzle, talk to a character and so on), without however that the game has given us no hints in this regard. The result is that when you find yourself in similar situations, you end up interacting repeatedly with all the hotspots to try to keep the adventure going. The first area of Redux does exactly that. Obviously, having reached the fifth chapter, there is no risk of abandoning the game for a similar problem, however the suspicion remains that certain mechanics have been implemented more to lengthen the broth than to intrigue the player. Stories that intersect Once the initial impasse has been overcome, the awaited revelations arrive. Now, if you have played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and enjoyed it you will be comfortable with what is being told. At first glance it may seem quite convoluted, but in the final analysis it makes sense. After all, Trnquist has always loved the logical and lexical intrigues allowed by oneirism. The only character that turned out to be weak and lacking depth is Saga. Not that there is no shortage of strong narrative moments that see her as the protagonist, including a mother scene of a certain impact. But of the three main characters she is certainly the one who appears most detached from the context; whose history, that is, seems to have been forced into the general one. Many expected something more for her than what was finally dedicated to her and the implications of her eventsThey are unexpected, but in the worst sense of the word. Not that he isn't a decisive character, mind you, just that his point of arrival is all too arbitrary compared to what is told. Probably in the plans of the screenwriters, his was to be an exquisitely metafictional role. In part it is, but it is precisely by discovering it that what happened before is devalued. After all, the stories of the other characters amply compensate for Saga's weakness, with Zo completely conquering the scene in some highly dramatic moments. Choices In the approximately five hours that make up the episode, and which make Dreamfall Chapters last about twenty-four hours as a whole, all the situations experienced in the past are found a bit. There is a stealth phase related to Zo similar to those faced by Kian in the first four chapters, there are very dark exploratory sections that represent the most graphic adventure moments of the entire game, there are assorted puzzles, as already mentioned, not very difficult , and there is so much story. Unfortunately, something of what could have been expected is also missing. For example, one discovers with some discomfort that the choices made previously do not have a big impact on the conclusion of the adventure. We understand that inserting moral choices into adventure games is all the rage, because they seem to enhance the player's role by giving him a false sense of freedom, but you also need to make sure that they are given the right relevance, otherwise they end up being useless frills. Another problem related to the choices, in this case incidental, arises from the wait suffered by the players between one episode and another. If you played the episodes of Dreamfall Chapters at launch, some details of the final chapter may have escaped you, unless you have a very good memory. In fact, years have passed since the release of the first episodes, not months. This is a known problem with episodic video games: the more time passes between chapters, the further away you get from the characters. Our advice is therefore to replay them all together, if you like, so as not to miss anything along the way, especially the stories of some secondary characters. You will enjoy the game much more. From a technical point of view there is little to say that hasn't already been said in the reviews of the previous chapters: Dreamfall Chapters compensates for some technical problems, probably due to the production level, with a fascinating style. Some places, though lacking in detail, are excellent in their architectural and conceptual construction. The work done on the soundtrack is excellent, which remains of a high level, as indeed it was in the other four chapters. In short, those looking for an aesthetic experience in a video game, as well as entertainment, will be satisfied.", "date": "2016-07-16", "grade": "7.5"}
