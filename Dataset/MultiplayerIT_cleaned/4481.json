Yet our sense of editor was warning us of a possible danger: Nintendo had already made the mistake of porting Mario Party to the laptop, and the absence of online multiplayer modes weighed like a ton on the overall quality of the production. From Mario Party: The Top 100, perhaps with a little excessive naivety, we expected progress from this point of view: will we have been satisfied or are we faced with yet another soulless package? Ageless content It is always a pleasure to see how Nintendo tends to refine its productions and to adapt them with due care at each change of platform. With Mario Party: The TOP 100 things were even more difficult since some of the mini games in the collection had different control systems and technical qualities that were somehow amalgamated. Two decades have passed since the first Mario Parties and the lowest common denominator that unites all the chapters has always been that desire to have wonderful fun, with ideas as original as they are with a refined design. Not all of the games in Mario Party: The Top 100 are obviously an ode to game design, but many of them manage to rise above the standard that usual party games have been trying to impose in recent years. The user will therefore be able to retrace the history of this mighty intellectual property through a single player mode with a linear board where our character, selectable from the eight present (come on Yoshi!!), will have to make his way from minigame to minigame to overcome all four available worlds. The ultimate goal, of course, will be to collect stars and coins, a task that is not particularly difficult for the more savvy players but which will instead represent a more than worthy challenge for the younger ones. One of the strengths of Mario Party: the Top 100 is in fact to have a heterogeneous selection of game types suitable for all ages and skill levels. They range from simple car races to climbing magical plants where you can dodge objects that fall from the sky, with other events capable of exploiting the touch screen or the microphone of the small Nintendo 3DS. In short, variety is king and it is a pity therefore that in addition to the usual eight protagonists, other unusual Nintendo heroes have not been added, perhaps also drawing from other series. However, a minimal and marginal lack if we look at the package in its entirety, capable of giving you many hours of gameplay if you like the genre. The collection of the coins we mentioned above will only serve you to get new lives and avoid seeing the game over screen, an extremely remote eventuality given that the life will be lost only and exclusively if you finish last: difficult , given the average level of artificial intelligence. Yes but I wanted my friends! It's a collection of mini games, nothing more, but if there's one thing Mario Party has always done well, it's knowing how to join players in a party and keep them having a blast. These editions for portable consoles, on the other hand, always suffer from the same problem, forgetting full-bodied online modes, even completely omitting online multiplayer in this case, an element that would have made this Mario Party: the Top 100 not only an unmissable title but would have made its replayability. So, instead, we find ourselves listless having to fight again against artificial intelligence, limiting the multi-player sector to local connections. Unfortunately, finding four other friends with Nintendo 3DS is not an easy task, although fortunately Nintendo has made available the ability to share a single copy via Download Play. Therefore, if we remove the multiplayer from a party game, there is not much left for us to do, and not even the parallel modes to the main scoreboard help us in this sense. There is nothing original or quite different from what was done previously and throwing yourself into playing a selection of mini-games rather than choosing them from the main board does not change the soul of the game much, even making these options superfluous. Even the Minigame Challenge doesn't offer variety despite presenting itself with a single board and a roll of dice that randomly decrees the minigame to be played, a gimmick for its own sake given that then there won't be the possibility to interact with theboard or exploit it in other ways.", "date": "2017-12-21", "grade": "6.5"}
