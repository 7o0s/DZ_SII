The hopes of a reboot in a big way are high among fans of the franchise that has relaunched the arena shooter genre, and it is understandable that the English developer's minor projects are at the expense. We don't know if this is the case with Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery, a mix of adventure and puzzle game along the lines of Professor Layton. What we do know, however, is that, after last year's good start, the team recently released a second episode that was too short and too poor in content to keep the attention high for a series that had created good expectations. With Jacob Jones we return to the Aquila Piumata campsite to discover the mystery of the Sasquatch To the mountain In the first episode of Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery, the player gets to know all the funny characters that populate the Feathered Eagle summer camp, from crazy kids like Dwayne to Lafonda, up to an unlikely Sasquatch named Biggie. In this new chapter entitled Field Trip, the bizarre gang is instead on a trip to spend a day at the foot of Crackskull Mountain. Jacob and Biggie thus decide to split from the rest of the group to go towards the mountain, in the hope of finding out what happened to the Sasquatch's mother. This time too it's a simple story, which introduces a couple of new characters and which in some places also has a successful touch of black humor. Unfortunately, however, Field Trip ends even before it really begins: the adventure is completed in a scant hour, just long enough to meet an unfortunate couple of beavers and to help the ghost of an old lady find eternal peace. Sure, it's an episode that acts as a bridge for the third and final part of the adventure, but it's really too little for a chapter released a year after the original. Lucid Games has also been tight on the sleeves with regard to the puzzles, going down from the 23 present last time to only 14 in the new episode. In addition to being in smaller quantities, the puzzles also seemed simpler and less original than in the past, although some more interesting challenges were not lacking in the last few minutes. You hardly feel the need to resort to help and clues, but for those who find themselves in difficulty, the developers have re-proposed the same hint system: by collecting cans hidden in the environment, you get phone credits to spend to get in touch with friends and relatives, or to access the Suggestbook, a social network where, among the many useless messages, you can hide a pretty good tip. It must be said that the cans are found in industrial quantities, which encourages the laziest users to abuse them as soon as they come across a slightly more complex puzzle. Once again, completionists can go after the various collectibles hidden throughout the world, such as birds, snails and cans. Too bad that often the latter are positioned so badly as to force the player, even after having seen them, to juggle frustrating moments of pixel hunting while at the same time trying to keep the camera at bay. On the other hand, nothing to say about the artistic style: as already mentioned on the occasion of the first episode, Chris Davie's work is visually delightful, with caricatured characters that look like plastic models in environments made of cardboard, while the puzzles are proposed through completely 2D illustrations. The menus themselves look like they were cut out of an old cardboard box, but unfortunately the end result is somewhat marred by very frequent performance issues. Especially on older iPad models, the gaming experience is anything but smooth, with continuous stuttering and even some application crashes. As a last note, we point out the total lack of an Italian localization, a choice that we imagine is linked to a simple question of costs, but which will dissatisfy those who do not speak English and had appreciated the first episode of Jacob Jones.", "date": "2014-08-25", "grade": "6.0"}
