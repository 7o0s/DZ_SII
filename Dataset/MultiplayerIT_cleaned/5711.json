This is the case with Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers, a black and white scrolling shoot 'em up created by Loomiarts and inspired by the sci-fi films of the 50s, also embellished with live-action sequences. Available now on PC and coming ~soon~ to Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. But let's not waste any more time and launch into the review of Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers. Flying saucers Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers is part FMV Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers is a real sci-fi film from the 50s. You must not think that it only takes up the theme for its gameplay phases and that it applies a black and white patina to make it ~retro~. No, this scrolling shoot 'em up features a series of live-action cinematics right from the start that tell the story between missions. It's about ten minutes of footage in total for a game that offers a few hours of gameplay, but it's more than enough to really get into the mood. The plot sees aliens arriving on Earth, not with the desire to immediately attack but to establish commercial relations. Don't be fooled though, in Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers the aliens are always bad and behind their kind facade lies great cruelty. In the factories they will create, humans are treated as slaves and it will soon be understood that extraterrestrials want to dominate our planet. We will put a spoke in their wheels, with our Squad 51. Over the course of 11 missions we will destroy posts and fleets of primary importance for the aliens, until we reach their leader and make them flee like hell . A clash of Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers Expect a very simple plot and deliberately botched cutscenes, coming from an era where special effects didn't exist yet. Spaceships will hang by a thread, buildings will be papier-mch models, and alien costumes will be less detailed than a carnival mask. Everything is perfectly in line with the sources of inspiration, for a quality final result. The only pity is that a good part of the dialogues are presented during the game phases: they are dubbed in Portuguese (original language) and in English, but even for those who understand the Albion language it will not be easy to keep up with what has been said. The subtitles (in Italian, at least) distract from the game and you can't read them without being destroyed and the sonic chaos of the battles makes it difficult to concentrate on hearing only the speeches. You therefore end up ignoring the dialogues and missing out on some contextualization of the missions. Assault aircraft Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers is bullet hell As mentioned, however, the plot is only a small part of Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers. In terms of gameplay, you can expect all the basic components of the genre. In each level we will have control of a flying vehicle and we will have to eliminate the aliens, with their various saucers and ships, in the middle of a hell of bullets. After the first few minutes of the first level, the game quickly becomes a bullet hell and we will have to dodge and destroy opponents at the same time. Each elimination gives us points, with bonuses in the case of eliminating an entire group. These are not only for bragging rights with friends, but also for unlocking upgrade slots. Even in the event of defeat, each point earned adds up to a total score and level by level you get additional skills such as more lives, better defenses, attack, various secondary weapons such as bombs, missiles, rear flamethrowers and more. Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers offers different types of planes Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers also tries to vary the tables on a regular basis. Every few levels you switch to a different type of flying craft that you control, with different size, maneuverability, and attack power. In some cases, if you don't get destroyed, you slowly get more machine guns, so you can attack in more directions. The end result is a fun and intense game, even if not particularly long and above all not perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty. The whole adventure takes a minimum of an hour and a half to complete, if you don't die once, but we assure you that only the great experts of the genre will be able to do it. Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers aims for a medium-high difficulty, with cenemy attacks and impacts that destroy us in an instant even with various defensive boosts activated. The real problem is that there are real peaks of difficulty in some levels, with others that can be completed without particular hitches. The background environments below vary in Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers There is the possibility of activating infinite lives for those who want to enjoy the game without stress, but clearly it goes a bit against the basic idea. It would have been better to include difficulties that would reduce the damage suffered, so as to give more resistance to those who are less skilled. Also, Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers offers two modes. The basis is simply the campaign, which can be played in a totally free way, moving from one level to another and maintaining the progress made. The resistance mode, on the other hand, makes us play with a maximum number of new attempts and makes us restart from the first level once the last is completed for a maximum of five loops of increasing difficulty, with the final goal of making as many points as possible and compete globally with a leaderboard. Finally, we point out that the local two-player cooperative is also present.", "date": "2022-10-02", "grade": "8.0"}
