{"name": "Esplorando i sogni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154956-dream-esplorando-i-sogni.html", "text": "The list of introspective titles is long and has been considerably enriched in recent times thanks to digital delivery which, not following rigid market logic, also leaves room for real experiments: projects in which the video game is seen as a media that is not exclusively made for fun. The mission of Dear Esther, rather than The Stanley Parable, or Gone Home is to make people think rather than entertain. Dream is also part of this trend, a curious production by Hypersloth, a British software house made up of three university students (a fourth member participated in the development but left at the end of last year). The project began in December 2012 and also failed a Kickstarter campaign, obtaining less than 9,000 British pounds (of which a thousand donated by two very generous backers) against a goal set at 20,000. However, our people have not lost heart and, after a period of apprenticeship on Greenlight and Steam Early Access, they are finally ready to release the final version, which is not so final after all (as we will see later), of this ~ dream simulator~. The player takes the role of Howard Phillips Lovecraft (he is a namesake, considering the contemporary setting of the villa inherited from his uncle). As happens to many, he wakes up after falling asleep on the sofa in front of the usual and very boring documentary and goes to the bedroom (on the desk there is also an Oculus Rift, for which the boys were working on a dedicated version, before Epic interrupted the development of the API for the Unreal Engine 3 used here) where he hopes to finally be able to spend a peaceful night's rest. Here begins the actual game in which we enter our favorite's dreams through a sort of black and white hub: it almost seems to be inside an airport where cubes float in the air between immense columns and where, from time to time, in turn, portals that lead to dreamlike settings, very similar to those that materialize in our thoughts during sleep. The Hypersloth guys are young and talented, but the road to success is still long A dream simulator Dream is primarily an exploration game. At the beginning of each of the three acts that compose it, the player finds himself scouring the labyrinthine levels, in which each corner is apparently identical to the previous one, without the possibility of orienting himself because there is no map. Hidden in some area are objects or tickets that explain the meaning of the locations you are visiting. It is precisely in these situations that the title shows off the best of itself: going against the ~voluntary suspension of disbelief~ it stimulates the player to find parallels between the scenarios imagined by the designers and their own real (or rather dreamed) experience. The landscapes can be suggestive as long as you enter the atmosphere of the game and therefore you are satisfied with walking in a canyon, rather than in a laboratory or a Caribbean resort, all strictly uninhabited, to try to understand the state from time to time mood of the protagonist. Each room has its own reason for being (for example the bathrooms in the laboratory represent a way out to free oneself from evil) which is connected to HP's past, made up of misunderstandings over the inheritance, family quarrels and other conflicts quite common, in which basically each of us can recognize ourselves for some reason. Exploring far and wide you reach the heart of the map, where waiting for the good Howard there are puzzles that represent the most playful and least successful part of the Hypersloth project: these are puzzles that exploit geometric and mathematical logics and that they actually reveal very uninvolving, sometimes monotonous, sometimes frustrating. Once freed ~from evil~ these main scenarios change their appearance and open the door to two secondary dreams, the completion of which, completely arbitrary, could lead to different endings. Between one act and another one then has to face real nightmares set in HP's mansion: in these scenarios the state of anxiety is kept at good levels thanks to clever tricks (apparitions of ghosts, noises in the rooms from which just came out and so on), but even here the puzzles don't go much beyond the classic combination to unlock. A super soundtrack From a technical point of view, Dream uses Unreal Engine 3: a prestigious license that the British boys could probably have spared themselves, given the not exactly spectacular results that could have been obtained even with less famous engines. We have already mentioned the inspired locations; pection that it would have been necessary to put as much care also for the only driving subject, i.e. the player, whose realization is approximate to say the least, above all considering his shadow which instead should have played a fundamental role during the nightmares, from the moment in which they are set in the darkness of the Lovecraft mansion. The soundtrack is completely different, literally fantastic and also offered as a DLC for 7.99. Hypersloth has relied on the Bavarian composer Norman Legies whose curriculum, we can bet, will experience a surge in views after what is heard in Dream. What transpires in the composition of the German artist, in his first work for a video game, is the study placed in the analysis of the settings: each track (there are 41 in total) is perfectly adherent to the context in which it is found and each it is characterized by a strong personality, made up of a mixture of extremely different genres. Our favorite was ~Xvaetvadatha~, the main theme of the second act. The dialogues (or rather the monologues), with which Howard tells his own story in the first person, also deserve praise, recited in English with good theatricality. Unfortunately there are some quite serious technical problems: above all the impossibility of reconfiguring the keys and the very high sensitivity of the mouse (a limit that has been afflicting the game for months and that the English guys are unable to solve); not to mention the imprecision of the pointer which often does not recognize hotpoints. Numerous other bugs, such as system crashes and ~broken~ quests, negatively affect the overall experience and, as a sad custom, poor buyers have to ask the software house to fix the errors. We always try to be understanding when dealing with small independent producers, turning a blind eye to certain inevitable flaws, but we also cannot ignore the relevance of certain problems which in the case of Dream could have been fixed with a more careful beta phase testing. It will take about seven hours to wake up Howard with a smile, a value that can vary slightly depending on whether or not the side missions are completed, but which are generally a bit short for a title that is offered at around 16 .", "date": "2015-08-20", "grade": "6.3"}
