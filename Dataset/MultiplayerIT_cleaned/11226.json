Relationships with others is a recurring theme in Live with Friends, given that our career prospects are influenced by a new system of Reputation and social networking, which directly depends on our ability to interact positively with the surrounding area . This means paying the rent on time (or the landlady will show up noisily at your door) avoiding being too noisy and indeed cultivating new friendships among the neighbours, so as to be invited to their apartments and invite us in turn (provided to have a furnishing up to par...). Obviously, as in the case of roommates, life in a condominium will not necessarily be all roses and flowers, but it will not only be the possibility of ~knocking on the wall~ in case of annoying noises that will come to our aid: to shuffle the cards and give the players an extra weapon magic takes care of it. Witch life? In the past, The Sims 2 has shown us everything from aliens to vampires, from zombies to werewolves, with the possibility in many cases of joining their ranks: this time befriending a witch or wizard will yield us nothing less than a cauldron and pointy hat (not to mention the flying broomstick) and of course the ability to cast spells and access the apartment lots of an exquisitely Potterian semi-invisible ~wizard world~. Spells, in particular, are divided into good, neutral and evil, ranging from healing spells and to instill good mood, to teleportation and transfiguration techniques, up to real curses that can break love relationships, create zombies or shoot flames lethal. Once you have acquired these powers, part of the fun is having fun behind the unsuspecting neighbors, taking advantage of this shortcut to make your life easier... with the possibility, if you wish, to go back to being a simple human being, drinking a special potion. As in the past, the supernatural element remains purely optional, but it is interesting to note how in Live With Friends it - at the discretion of the player - can take on a much clearer importance than in the previous expansions, to the full advantage of an enrichment of playability . Comment Live with Friends is one of the most fun and accessible expansions - even for a layman - to join The Sims 2 release lineup, to the point that it's almost a shame it's only appeared now. The changes to the well-tested gameplay will not be as macroscopic as those of Pets or University, but rather appear as natural evolutions, in a certain sense due and perfectly justified. It is likely that we will find many of these basic ideas in The Sims 3, where the social component of managing multiple families will play a central role. The new dimension of life in an apartment and the addition of magic are in themselves sufficient to make even those who have been away from it for years rediscover the pleasure of the game; adding the wide variety of new content (new hairstyles and animations, furniture and furnishing structures loudly requested by fans, the possibility of customizing the ceilings and so on) you get a playable and balanced add-on that should not be missing in your collection of every fan of the series. Pros Immediate and ~addictive~ as only The Sims can be In-depth gameplay from the new ~apartment-friendly~ dimension The implementation of the magic is well thought out and full of irony Cons Don't expect shocking news Especially dedicated to fans PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Processor: Processor: Pentium IV 1.3 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 32 MB Ram Disk Space: 1.2 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce with 64 MB of memory or ATI equivalent Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400@3.0GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTS Sound Card: Creative X-Fi Monitor: Samsung 19@ 1280x1024", "date": "2008-09-03", "grade": null}
