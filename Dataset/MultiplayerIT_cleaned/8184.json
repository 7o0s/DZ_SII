{"name": "Tempo dei giganti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111125-skylanders-giants-tempo-dei-giganti.html", "text": "When three walls of your studio are devoted to countless shelves filled with Transformers, Star Wars miniatures, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Knights of the Zodiac, Gundams, Revoltech, and an embarrassing number of other assorted action figures, a game like Skylanders instantly takes on a more intriguing than it might seem at first sight. The combination devised by Activision a year ago, on which no one sincerely would have ever bet, has proved to be nothing short of successful: more than thirty million toys have been sold to date and, curiously, not always those who bought them also owned the game. In fact, the franchise immediately went beyond the field of pure collecting, for the simple reason that these miniatures are made really well. With similar success, a sequel was obvious to say the least. The question at this point is another: what innovations can justify the purchase of another ton of characters? They were once bigger Actually, the Giants are nothing new to the magical world of Skylands. In ancient times, the Giants fought against the evil Arkeyan empire but their eventual victory came at great cost, trapping them in a dimension far from Skylands. The old Eon tells us about it, but it's a pity that he doesn't also explain how they are actually back, limiting himself to a vague meta-videogame explanation: we, that is, the players, or Portal Masters, found them when we bought them. Meanwhile, Kaos, whom we defeated at the end of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventures, has returned to Skylands and intends to find the lost city of Arkus to seize the Iron Fist, an artifact that will allow him to control an invincible army. It will be up to us, the Skylanders and our old friends, Cali and Flynn included, to put a spoke in his works. As you may have guessed, the plot of the game is a nice pretext divided into twenty chapters of variable length: it is certainly not the strong point of the game, but it does its duty as much as a Sunday morning cartoon. By now the connections to the universe of the little dragon Spyro are practically non-existent, so much so that even the subtitle of the game has changed, focusing more on the Giants. These Skylanders are in fact the main novelty of the game, although they do not change its structure in a very significant way: they are bigger and slower creatures than normal, but also more powerful and tough, able, for example, to knock down walls and break through floors without resort to bombs or other gadgets. Often some obstacles can only be overcome using a Giant, for example it is even possible to drag entire islands or cut down huge trees to create an improvised bridge. It is substantially not very different from the elemental areas, also present this time and accessible only if we have a Skylander of the corresponding element. Otherwise, the Giants are controlled and progressed exactly like any other Skylander, but the game often forces us to activate one to advance; in this sense, Skylanders: Giants forces us to interrupt the rhythm of the action to change characters a little more often than in the original, but this also occurs because the level design is decidedly more complex and richer than before. For many but not for everyone Unfortunately, it is still impossible to jump, a lack that makes what is in all respects an action game decidedly bizarre in which the platform phases are associated with small platforms that push our character upwards. That said, the presence of puzzles, often based on moving boxes and objects, and superficial RPG elements, in the form of levels and stats to increase, it transforms the game into something more than a simple product for children, as the combination of toys and cartoonish graphics might suggest. Skylanders: Giants is, first of all, very easy to play, and in this case it is anything but a defect. Even the Portal, the essential peripheral for playing, has been overhauled in this version, and now connects via a USB cable to the console which will power it during game sessions. To control the Skylanders, the analog stick and three buttons are enough, the latter associated with the various attacks of the character, which can be upgraded with the money earned by defeating enemies and destroying everything you can. The standard difficulty level continues to be low, even if the highest selectable one can give even the most experienced player some headaches, especially during boss fights, which often require the adoption of particular tactics. Activision, while it was there, also thought of introducing a sort ofmostly optional mini-game, although sometimes it is necessary to play it to progress in the adventure: it is Pietracielo, a kind of board-game in which tiles depicting some creatures of the game are placed on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to capture the opponent's tiles, or stones, so that at the end of the game ours are more numerous than his. It is a marginal but pleasant pastime, although we doubt that it will appeal to players to the point of considering buying a physical version, if this was the not too cryptic goal. The problem with Skylanders: Giants, in the end, is the somewhat too slow pace, punctuated by not particularly brilliant dialogues. The game itself is a pleasant diversion suitable for the whole family, especially thanks to the possibility of playing in two via split-screen (unfortunately still absent an online co-op) both in cooperative mode, in the various chapters of the adventure, and competitive, within special arenas that recall Capcom's good old Power Stone on several occasions. Like the LEGO Traveller's Tales games, it's impossible not to imagine parents or older siblings who are passionate about video games sharing the sofa with a younger brother or sister, perhaps having as much and more fun than them. And this is a great advantage. Playstation 3 trophies Thirty-six bronze, six silver, three gold and one platinum, for a total of forty-six Trophies to unlock in Skylanders: Giants. Curiously, there is no Trophy linked to the possession of all the figurines, and some are unlocked even just by possessing the ones in the Starter Pack. Then just complete the game, win the various challenges and upgrade the characters to acquire most of their powers . A word about toys We close the review with a slightly deeper reflection on the main element of the game: the toys. As always, the initial Starter Pack includes, in addition to the game and the Portal, also three figurines: in this case they are the wooden Giant Tree Rex and Cynder and Jet-Vac. At this point the series comprises more than forty miniatures, including new versions of some much loved characters, branded as Series 2. There is no difference between these and their previous version, other than that some of them ~light up ~ (it's actually a simple game of refractions) when placed on the lit Portal. In fact, it is even possible to play Skylanders: Spyro's Adventures using the new miniatures (except, of course, for the Giants) and, conversely, play Skylander's Giants with the old characters. As usual, the technology devised by Activision stores the progress of each character in its figurine, allowing us to take them to a friend's house a bit like a memory card. The fact, then, that it is possible to reach a new maximum level with each character, old or new, fortunately does not make the purchase of the previous figurines obsolete or superfluous. And that, perhaps, is the point of the whole matter: money. All you need to complete Skylanders: Giants are basically the three characters in the Starter Kit and nothing else. But to unlock various Trophies, find every hat and explore every area you need to have at least one character for each element. And if you want to complete everything one hundred percent, well, you have to put your hands in your wallet over and over again. It is clear that this is a truly perfect strategy, especially if aimed at a very young audience, and the cost of each figurine can even appear a little exaggerated, especially when the Giants cost twice as much as a normal Skylander. But leaving aside the playful component associated with the actual playable character, we must admit that the figurines are really well sculpted and coloured: Activision could have limited itself to a poor and superficial production, instead we have been able to ascertain that the quality of the toys is really above the average. They are not articulated, it is true, but the attention to detail, the precision and quality of the painting, as well as the spectacularity of some inventions (such as the luminous parts of the Giants) in a certain sense justify the cost of the single piece and the simple desire to collect them beyond the game itself.", "date": "2012-11-15", "grade": "8.4"}
