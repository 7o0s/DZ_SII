From this point of view nothing has changed compared to the first episode of the series, which was released on the App Store in August 2010 and which had impressed us well due to the interesting mechanics proposed, in truth much more effective on the large iPad screen than not in the uncomfortable confines of the iPhone and iPod Touch. History repeats itself in this sense, with an experience that can undoubtedly be enjoyed better on the Apple tablet, with a glance that rarely forces you to scroll and/or zoom in on the play area to figure out where the various elements before devising a strategy to make the red and blue spheres end up in the reference container. Each of the over fifty stages that make up the substantial single player mode are characterized by the presence of one or two ~taps~ and the aforementioned containers. The first thing we have to do to solve a puzzle is therefore to observe the position of these devices and the behavior of the red and blue elements, verify that they move according to the force of gravity or, on the contrary, tend to rise towards the top of the scenario , then use the objects at our disposal to apply any transformations and ~channel~ the red and blue spheres within a path that takes them to their destination. From lead to gold The innovations introduced by Forge Reply for Master of Alchemy: Vengeance Front are, unfortunately, not very many. In some stages it is necessary to make sure that the matter comes into contact with switches that move certain parts of the background metal structure, thus configuring the scenario for our purposes. There are also precious gems that we can collect to improve our final score, but which are not essential for successfully completing a mission and moving on to the next. For the rest, the core of the gameplay does not seem to have changed one iota: on the left side of the screen we have an ~inventory~ with the objects available from time to time, to be dragged wherever we want (possibly making them disappear with a double tap) and to be rotated after having made an initial selection to make sure that they lead the red and blue spheres where we need them to move. The controls are not always precise and punctual, indeed they often require multiple attempts for an object to be selected and rotated correctly, but the lack of time limits makes this inconvenience more acceptable, which otherwise could lead to episodes of not just frustration. The graphics have not changed either, which makes extensive use of already seen assets and materials, hand-drawn with an appreciable style but which, in our view, needed a ~freshening~ for this sequel, which, moreover, lacks completely a plot. And the revenge mentioned in the title? Mystery.", "date": "2013-04-17", "grade": "7.4"}
