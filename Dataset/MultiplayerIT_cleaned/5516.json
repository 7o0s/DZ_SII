It is difficult to see room for improvement or the possibility of change where dozens of similar titles are crowded, which seem to have copied each other, whose authors have taken care not to risk distancing themselves from a certain formula particularly appreciated by the players. How many space strategy games have we been able to play in recent years? Countless, yet after a few hours of playing Stellaris we had eclipsed almost all previous experiences, as if we were faced with a new starting point. Stellaris is not only grand strategy, but the story of the expansion of a civilization into space. Stellaris is above all the fascination of discovery At the beginning of a game, after choosing whether to play alone or to engage in multiplayer, it is possible to select one of eight available races, or create one from scratch with the very complete editor included. Already in this phase it is clear how Paradox has really left nothing to chance. The parameters to select are innumerable and, as we will discover by playing, they all have their influence on the relationships that will be established with the other life forms that we will meet in the cosmos. For example, we will be able to choose which model of society to adopt, by selecting one of the available ideologies, which will automatically be reflected on the selectable forms of government. How about running a materialistic society led by a directorate of scientists? And a collectivist dictatorship that admits slavery? If we wish, we can give our society more features, so as to exploit its advantages, but at the same time suffer its weaknesses, which will emerge overwhelmingly when we have expanded sufficiently. Once the government has decided we still have many parameters to select: the morphology of the mother planet, the type of space technology at our disposal, our colors and symbols and so on. Just to warn you that it is not important to report every single option available, but it is essential that you understand how much attention to detail has been placed by the developers in creating a complex and articulated title, which makes each game unique. Once our civilization has been chosen, it is necessary to determine the size of the game universe, by selecting the number of stars from which it is composed and the number of those who will contribute to the conquest of space. A thousand stars may seem like a lot for a handful of civilizations (thirty-two maximum), but we will soon find out that this is not the case. Paradox takes us into space with Stellaris: a strategy not to be missed The rudiments The beginning of each game of Stellaris sees a similar scenario: our civilization, whatever it is, is in the beginning of the colonization of space with a social situation in collapse. The population has grown too much and the mother planet is no longer able to guarantee sustenance for everyone. Large-scale battles are spectacular By examining it we can verify that almost all production boxes are occupied (they can be managed for each colonized planet). We need to expand if we don't want the situation to become explosive. The universe is huge and there will certainly be other habitable places, as well as countless dangers, but first you have to discover them. The starting system itself, whatever it is, is a mystery in terms of resources. The first thing to do is therefore to use a scientific ship to find them by scanning the different planets of the system, and then extract them with the orbiting structures that can be built with the construction ships. Playing we notice a further detail that makes us understand the complexity of the Paradox title: the tutorial. The freedom that is offered to us is so great that it was probably not possible to structure a linear tutorial. The developers have thus opted to create a kind of assistant, which can be deactivated at any time, which gives us information every time we come across a novelty, screen, race or concept, also assigning us missions to verify the level of our understanding. It may seem like a hasty method, but it has proved to be really effective in making us learn the rudiments of the game and in still leaving us with the initiative without oppressing us with constraints (strategist tutorials can be lethal). The alternative, given the amount of mechanics in Stellaris, would have been hours of stasis reading explanations after explanations, which in any case would not have managed to render all the facets of the gaming experience. The universe is our interface At first glance, Stellaris' interface looks very minimal. At the top left there are six buttons that open the classic summary and aspect management screensgenerals of our galactic civilization. You immediately get acquainted with the diary, where game events are noted, or you can select the technologies to research, assigning them to scientists, giving priority to those that are considered most useful for our strategy. Managing individual colonized planets also offers several options Of particular importance is the spaceship editor, which allows us to replenish our fleet by choosing from pre-packaged models, or leaving us the possibility of creating custom vehicles, perhaps to take advantage of some newly discovered technology, or for the pure taste of customization. There are three basic vessels: the aforementioned scientific and construction vessels, to which military vessels must be added. Their functions are clear, but not as obvious as it might seem. All their actions must be managed directly on the map, which turns out to be the hub of the game interface itself. Let's take a direct example. After studying the planets in our system, we can send one or more science ships to explore the surrounding systems. Doing so is very simple: select a ship directly on the map (or from a side menu, convenient when you have many means available), then click on the arrow that leads to the system to explore, finally select one of the celestial bodies and give the order to examine the single planet or all those hosted by the displayed system. In case there are problems, for example there is not a scientist on board the spaceship, or there is an encounter with a hostile alien race, or even some anomaly is found on a planet to be studied separately, we will receive on-screen communications which will allow us to intervene immediately. Each event is clearly communicated to the player, who can manage it in real time or by pausing the action (when many events are happening at the same time, the pause is precious). The charm of discovery The examples we've done so far to help you understand how Stellaris works are small compared to everything the game has to offer. Unfortunately, it's impossible to account for every single option, and honestly, it's not even our goal to do so. What is most important to us is to make you understand the care taken in every single aspect of the game and the study behind the design of each of its elements, i.e. how Paradox has mediated in an incredible way between complexity and usability, to take weight off the interface, while not sacrificing anything that 4X enthusiasts are looking for in a similar title. In multiplayer it is important to know the forces at play As our civilization expands in the universe in small steps, looking for habitable planets, discovering resources and coming into contact with alien races with often original and unexpected traits, so Stellaris expands in front of the player, gradually revealing its cards. Before coming into contact with other civilizations, countless discoveries are made and one remains fascinated by the level of narration. Space is full of races more developed than ours, some with technologies that can wipe us out in an instant, but there are also primitive ones, which can become an asset if managed in the right way (much depends on the form of government chosen) . For example, it happened to us, leading a despotic and militaristic society, all taken up with expansion, to cross a so-called Fallen Empire. Strengthened by our fleet, we ignored their warnings and immediately went to war (also because they wanted us to give up some planets we had just colonized). Unfortunately their threats were not far-fetched and we found ourselves having to leave the battlefield early, taking away what remained of our ~invincible army~, which has not proved so invincible and whose carcasses have become a terrifying reminder for our arrogance. The consequences of the defeat were disastrous: after the escape we had to give up the colonies and we found ourselves with the mother planet in the grip of political chaos. Obviously there are also minor events, some really minimal but told with great care, such as the discovery of corpses of explorers of now extinct races on some planet distant from ours. Warrior diplomacy Stellaris also offers a very rich diplomatic side, inevitable in the 4X genre. In strictly economic and military terms, a bit of everything can be done, i.e. make alliances, unite against a common enemy, exchange goods and technologies, create trade routes, allow allies to cross our territories, obtain the same right from them and so on Street. The spaceship editor is very complete Imagine allthese actions in a game with thirty-one other players, human and otherwise, and you will understand what level of complexity the relationships between the factions can reach. Of course, despite the care taken, it is one of the more conventional aspects of the Paradox title, that is, it does not differ much from direct competition. Maybe something more could have been done in managing the relationships between the various species, but given the freedom left in the creation phase, we imagine that it would have been a colossal undertaking to foresee all the possibilities. Even the more warlike side does not present any particular novelties and, despite doing what it is supposed to, it often turns out to be a mere comparison between the values of the forces in the field. Also in this case, not bad, since making the battles too complex would have distracted from everything else, but a few more options would not have hurt (you will see that some DLC will arrive to deepen this aspect). Speaking of playtime, be prepared to spend many hours on Stellaris. We are not talking about dozens, but hundreds, if you let yourself be caught. You have to put a lot of effort into the game to get the most out of it, even in multiplayer. It is true that you can play on smaller maps and with fewer factions in the field, but the maximum is obtained on large-scale scenarios, where the forces in the field are many and the factors of stalemate or crisis multiply. In general it is fair to note that this is not a game for everyone and that it requires dedication. Another factor that should be noted is the language: Unfortunately, Italian is not supported. If you don't know English (or another of the selectable languages), you will have a lot of difficulty playing.", "date": "2016-05-09", "grade": "9.2"}
