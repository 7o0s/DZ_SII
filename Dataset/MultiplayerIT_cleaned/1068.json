{"name": "Megaman Zero 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/megaman-zero-3_a.html", "text": "The decisive battle? At the end of Megaman Zero 2, the mad Elpizo had found the sanctuary where the lifeless body of the legendary X was kept, and had destroyed it to take possession of the immense powers of the Dark Elf, only to end up defeated by Zero with the help essence of X. Megaman Zero 3 begins a few weeks later: Zero, Ciel and their collaborators are on the trail of the ~children~ of the Dark Elf, the Baby Elves, and an anomalous energy source leads them straight towards a new opponent, Omega. And yet, there does not seem to be Harpuia, the new enemy leader, behind the appearance of Omega, indeed to be honest Harpuia and his companions, Leviathan and Fafnir, have been downgraded: X is back and aided by a wicked scientist seems intent on crushing the Resistance, seizing the power of the Dark Elf and his offspring. But is it really the legendary X who threatens the peace, or just one of his many clones? And what are the intentions of the wandering Dark Elf, who aimlessly wanders the world chased by everyone? The news of 2004 Megaman Zero 3 maintains the same structure of its prequels, integrating it with juicy innovations that improve its gameplay. Once again, it will be possible to play the game levels in the preferred order, in order to exploit the new skills acquired against the next boss at the end of the stage. Zero has his old weapons, to which a new one is added that replaces the Chain-Rod: in addition to the Z-Saber, the Buster Shot and the Shield Boomerang, Zero can now use the Recoil Rod, a short-range weapon that allows you to launch two devastating shots in sequence. The novelty is that, unlike the previous episodes, in Megaman Zero 3 the weapons are not strengthened as they are used and from the beginning they present the maximum offensive level: if in the prequels the upgrading of the tools could have been an interesting feature of Zero, it must be said that you ended up constantly strengthening them at the beginning of the adventure and then having less difficulty for the rest of the game, so Capcom's decision to provide both the notorious loaded shots from the beginning and, for example, the three hit combo from the Z-Saber. Another novelty consists of the Data Disks: scattered throughout the levels, these objects allow Zero to unlock not only information about his opponents and companions (which can be consulted in a simple database), but also to recover the useful and already seen Cyber Elf , once used (and in some cases enhanced with E. Crystals) they guarantee Zero various upgrades such as increasing his vital energy or his movement speed. Also in the Data Disks it is possible to find the enhancement chips which, associated with various parts of the body and which can be activated at will, allow Zero to automatically load his weapons, walk on water and more, a bit like the special armor which Megaman had in the X series. The number of upgrades suggests a greater planning of Zero's actions, necessary in order to complete the levels by satisfying certain requirements on the basis of which, in the end, his performance will be given a score: time spent concluding the stage, damage received, objectives achieved, enemies defeated... everything leads to a final evaluation, on the basis of which it will also be possible to unlock the Ex-Skill of the boss who has just been defeated which, in essence, allows Zero to use a new special move. This mechanic in the other episodes made it frustrating to replay the various levels in order to overcome them with the maximum score, but in Megaman Zero 3 the ingenious level-design, associated with the android's new capabilities, does not make it feel the least bit. Graphics & Sound Technically, there are few differences between Megaman Zero 3 and the two predecessors: it almost seems that Capcom has reached the creative limit. Let's be clear, Zero 3 is a little gem of programming: huge and excellently animated sprites, sometimes gaudy, other times cold, always suitable for the setting, special effects including zooms and non-invasive and well-balanced mode-7 applications... Megaman Zero 3 looks like a game from other times, in which the modest and at the same time accurate and detailed graphic creation leaves room for the game itself, without proposing a show as an end in itself, which is nevertheless present thanks to short semi-animated illustrations . On the musical side, this time Capcom surprises with songs that make the most of the GBA's mediocre sound reproduction capabilities, giving us always spot-on, well-composed and engaging themes, along with some digitized phrases that revive the action, strictly in Japanese. The third episode of Megaman Zero 3 is a must-buy, both for fans of the series and for everyone with thegold who are looking for a surprising, fun and fairly long-lived action-game/platformer. Attention: longevity in Megaman Zero 3 is based on patience, not so much on its actual duration, given that the game can be completed in a few hours but that recovering all the skills or Data Disks will require many more and, in particular, will be It is necessary to start the adventure over again, perhaps at a higher difficulty level (which will be unlocked by finishing the game for the first time). The ingredients of a classically ~Megamanian~ game are all there, and this time Capcom has amalgamated them even better, churning out a title that will certainly not fail to delight GBA owners. Final note: owners of Megaman Battle Network 4 Red Sun and/or Blue Moon will be able to connect the two cartridges to allow Zero to venture into short ~virtual~ fractions of the Megaman Zero 3 stages and face the Megaman.exe enemies of the RPG series of the same name. Bizarre. Pros The best action-game available on the GBA Interesting new features and notable changes compared to the prequels Excellent level design Cons: Technically too similar to its predecessors Duration of the main adventure fair The Zero series of the eternal Megaman saga now seems to have taken the path of its predecessors: it is the third consecutive year that Capcom delights Gameboy Advance owners with what is easily considered the best two-dimensional platform/adventure of this generation. Megaman Zero is the most classic one could expect, yet it brings with it a dose of fun that has not been seen for a long time, combined with a difficulty that is so reminiscent of some classics for the SNES, obviously starting with Megaman X of which it is the natural narrative sequel. Even Capcom's basic idea was nothing short of brilliant: to make Zero, Megaman's eternal friend/enemy, the protagonist, with a renewed look, and to place the historic Blue Bomber as the main opponent. The complex narrative plot of the current trilogy reserves many surprises, delighting fans of the saga and of the blue android with original and shocking gimmicks (those who have played and finished Megaman Zero 2 know what we are talking about), but it is the gameplay that makes it as master: between platforms to jump on and enemies to destroy, bosses to defeat in duels to the death and timed levels in which the precision of a movement makes the difference, Megaman Zero needed only a few corrections to become a small masterpiece. And the third episode exists for this.", "date": "2004-12-30", "grade": null}
