Amnesia: The Dark Descent was the practical application of a series of principles studied with reactions to the two Penumbra series, Frictional's debut series, and the many horror titles that preceded it. In Amnesia the construction of tension was so perfected and effective compared to any other title released previously, thanks to an inspired and studied design that allowed him to express new gameplay solutions, sometimes difficult for the player to grasp, that he did become a reference that anyone who came after had to reckon with and that was looted in every possible way. Without the first Amnesia, games like Until Dawn, Outlast or Alien: Isolation, to name a few of its most famous and commercial ~children~, would have been very different. On closer inspection, some would not even exist. For this reason SOMA was called to demonstrate something more than the competition, first of all the ability of Frictional to be able to overcome the formulas that it has codified itself and that no one has been able to overcome so far. We have reviewed SOMA, the new horror game from Frictional Games ready to break all the molds At the bottom of the sea SOMA plays a lot on the fame of the first Amnesia and does everything to break some patterns, deluding the gamer of a certain conceptual continuity, but shuffling the cards on the table whenever possible. The game begins in a very different place than the actual setting of the adventure, immediately creating a feeling of estrangement and opening the narrative to a fundamental question: how did we end up in an underwater base in such a distant future? Some sequences take place underwater Observing the general ruin that surrounds us, other questions immediately follow, more obvious, but equally relevant for what will then be the construction of the narrative logic of the entire game. We woke up in a place that is completely unknown to us, immersed in an agonizing darkness broken only by a few weak electric lights. We immediately understand that something has happened: the broken glass, some overturned supports and the many disturbing noises with no concrete source are more than a clue. We begin to wander in search of answers. The first puzzle that we face in the new skin is built to make us understand how to continue, as then the introductory phase was used to introduce us to the system of interaction with the environment (you can grab, observe and throw practically everything). It is a concrete example of thoughtful and functional game design in order to give the player the tools and knowledge he needs without resorting to didactic solutions, such as tutorials, screen objectives or placeholders to follow as if we were slothful hunting for signs. What we can define as ~contextual suggestions~ exploit every possibility offered by the setting to make progression natural: lights that can be glimpsed in the distance, a particular document in which the inhabitants of the base tell details that will come in handy in some puzzle, the same monsters that urge us to head towards the next goal. Everything is used to create the smoothest possible experience, where you are never forced to mentally exit the game and risk losing your involvement. Narrativeization There is not a single element of SOMA that is not narrative, that is, that is not constructed according to the story being told. Accustomed as we are to titles with continuous digressions with respect to what is the main plot (do you know the open world?), the care taken by Frictional in the narrative construction of its title is surprising, which from this point of view is a step above any other competitor on the market, without resorting to tricks such as filmed sequences, fortunately absent. The entire story is conveyed by the system of rules that determine the gameplay, used to deal with topics usually touched only superficially by video games. What initially might seem like a simple sci-fi horror soon becomes a profound reflection on human nature. Who we are? What defines us as people? What function does our body have in the perception we have of ourselves? Frankly, it's difficult to talk about the best aspect of SOMA, the narrative one if you haven't understood it, without going into the details of the story told, also because never as in this case is the story the game, but it's the game that lends credence to the story. Everything we do is storytelling. For example, the ~monsters~ themselves are thought of as part of a wider context which not only justifies them, but makes them physiological to the environment, even in their otherness. Indeed, their presence soon becomes another existential theme, as well as the way to deal with them. I'm a monster? Starting right from the monsters, let's open a long parenthesis to try to understand how Frictional with SOMA wanted to try to renew and, in a certain sense, deny, part of the horror precepts dictated with Amnesia. Firstly it should be noted that there are no jumps on the chair due to sudden appearances or other silly tricks of the kind, which are fine for youtubers, but which kill tension for those who want to play the games and not watch them. In SOMA even individual corpses have a history and are not mere decorations Here the horror is built with wisdom and dilated over the approximately ten hours it takes to complete the adventure. The apparitions of the monsters are never sudden, but occur with precise rhythms and according to methods reasoned contextually to the place where one is. Let us give you a concrete example: about two quarters of the way through the game you come across strange creatures that seem unavoidable with traditional action patterns (move silently, observe their movements and so on). It soon turns out, following the suggestion of a character who is still largely unknown to us, that the only way not to be killed is not to look at them. It is as if the game is telling us: my dears, you have to do exactly the opposite of what you have done in all the horror titles you have played so far! It is a brilliant sequence that creates an incredible tension due to the double need not to look at the monsters but to see where you are going so as not to get lost in a maze of corridors and doors! In a very advanced sequence, however, you have to cross a long stretch of ocean (the character can also move underwater). Without too many mysteries we are told from the beginning that there are some very dangerous mutant fish that roam in those waters. The only way not to get caught is to stay glued to the various lights. The reference is certainly to Pitch Black, the film by David Twohy that launched the character of Riddick, played by Vin Diesel. Also in this case we are faced with a clear violation of the expectations of the player, who until now has been kept in the dark about the nature of the dangers to be faced, while now he knows perfectly well what he risks and what is being asked of him is something completely different: running between the lights avoiding being in the dark! Moral choices There would be other examples to give, also because SOMA is substantially made up of a set of very different situations, designed to always keep the player's interest alive, even in moments of greater tranquility. However, you have to be satisfied because otherwise we risk revealing the whole game to you. The inhabitants of the base enjoyed playing very simple video games Returning therefore to a more general level, let us try to address some apparently secondary aspects which are perfectly wedged into the bowels of Frictional's work. For example, how can we fail to mention the way moral choices are managed, i.e. through significant actions? We had already talked about it in the preview phase, and we won't waste time redoing the same example, unfortunately the only one that can be used without revealing important pieces of the plot. In principle we can tell you that the player will find himself repeatedly having to make important decisions that... will have very few consequences on the plot. Indeed, apparently almost none. So why include them? Our reading is simple: we are in a world where the catastrophe has already occurred and what we do is in fact indifferent to the big picture. Thus moral choices have been transformed into something personal, in a certain sense intimate. Don't widen your eyes, because in reality some effects involve them, but they are limited. Yet we can guarantee you that in some moments we are called to carry out actions that greatly distress us for their ethical and moral implications, despite being inside a video game. It is no coincidence that this is the case, since they come after history has led us to reflect on issues that we often take for granted in our lives but which in reality are not. In more than one sense, this is SOMA's greatest merit, namely its willingness to dig into the depths of the human soul without compromise, even choosing anti-climatic solutions where necessary. Quisquiglie and pinzillacchere We just have to talkand briefly about the technical aspects of SOMA. From a graphic point of view, don't expect miracles. Be warned, because SOMA isn't bad at all. Indeed, it often manages to amaze, but more thanks to the stylistic choices made, than for the mere visual power proposed. Particularly successful are the image distortion effects that occur in the presence of a monster or when one has been hit, with the protagonist remaining limping until he manages to heal himself thanks to one of the pods scattered around the maps (these are also narrative , to say). In general we can say that Amnesia has been surpassed by several spans, both in the richness of the settings and in the models of the creatures. The soundtrack is instead exceptional, with an incredible amount of effects that describe the scenario sometimes better than the graphics. The best sequences, from a technical point of view, are certainly the underwater ones, which offer wider scenarios and make intensive use of the available sounds, recorded directly at sea, according to what was told on the developer's official blog. Also noteworthy is the skilful use of focal planes and lighting, both used to dramatize the scenarios and not just to decorate them.", "date": "2015-09-21", "grade": "9.2"}
