{"name": "Vietcong", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vietcong-2.html", "text": "The first impact: graphics and sound. As already mentioned in the preview phase, Vietcong will make us experience the Vietnam conflict through the eyes of an American soldier who has recently moved to the Nui Pek base, which will become his new home. The first impact with the game is undoubtedly misleading, as it puts us directly in front of the graphics engine and its defects. Anyone who has seen the photos (and who hasn't seen them?) already knows that the models are angular, the textures rough and, in general, the graphics are a bit ~dated~. Anyone who has seen the game, however, knows that what you see in a static image is different from what you see in motion. But that goes a bit for all titles, doesn't it? Mean graphics? No, I would say essential but not meager, as each scenario is made up of a large amount of polygons and moving objects. The jungle is thick with vegetation and the details are rich enough to create an environment that really seems to have a life of its own. The faces of the teammates, then, are very well cared for and manage to contain a certain expressiveness of character. So, abandon any insane desire to torment your latest generation ~pipelines~, lay down any conquest ambitions towards the Pixel & Vertex Shader units, present on your cards, because Vietcong is simply impervious to aesthetic frivolities! The sound aspect, then, is certainly intriguing, starting with the music of the menus which is in full 60s / 70s style, and contributes considerably to immerse us in the atmosphere of the game. It is worth noting the presence of a respectable soundtrack, with pieces like ~Hey Joe~ by Hendrix, but remade by Deep Purple, or ~I Wanna Be Your Dog~ by the Stooges, all rigorously mono and in low quality, since we will be able to listen to music only through the radio, but we will talk about this later. The game is very light even on less modern machines, and I believe you, you will say, with such a spartan graphics engine, I would also like to see that I clicked ... but anything can be, so I reassure you that - well yes - Vietcong will also run on your most antiquated PCs! But, as per the centuries-old tradition of the developers, not even this time we have the title completely bug-free, so some rare times you may get stuck in some polygon, but nothing that a healthy grenade on your feet can't solve, as you will sometimes discover some invisible wall blocking your way, but these are always sporadic and difficult to notice episodes. Did I mention that the game is fully localized in Italian? No? But yes, I said it in the preview, but since you're distracted I'll repeat it again: yes, the game is completely localized in Italian, including the dialogues! And not only that, not pizza and figs: the dialogues are exceptional and the voice actors have done an excellent job, in contrast with the Italian tradition of dubbing in an ignoble way, a ciofeca, almost every game in circulation. Ok, this - I imagine - will calm the souls of the most avid players and maybe even of the others. The touches of class are wasted, so when a grenade explodes nearby, the bang will deafen you for a while, producing the classic whistle you hear every time you play Little Blaster with dad's grenades, equally, when the bullets pass you next door, you'll hear its unmistakable hiss and be glad you didn't scratch your ear with the wrong hand. Immersiveness. Take off your fins, the immersion I'm talking about is neither sea nor lake but it is the immersion of a spectator in the emotional and engaging experience of a good film. Vietcong as well as being a good game (ops, I said it... ) is a good film, where we will play the part of the protagonist and where the events will revolve around us directed by the invisible hand of a wise director. The atmosphere is created in a very effective way and we will immediately feel an integral part of a story that will drag us deeper and deeper into its maze. From the first moment, when we landed in the Nui Pek base camp, we will learn to put aside military formalisms and not to salute the superior officer, because the enemy snipers would recognize him instantly, electrocuting him mercilessly. Here in Vietnam there are no sophisticated weapons, nor targeting lasers, here war stinks of earth and rice wine and death has the thousand eyes of the forest. The dialogues are very lively, simple and believable, the interlude scenes, created with the game engine, create an effective Apocalyps Now atmosphere. We will soon become friends with our teammates and the sense of teamwork will create a bond thatit will be of vital importance during the missions. No Americanist bluster, therefore: here the war is dirty and mean and we are very far from the ultra-formal briefings, so dear to the filmography of Schwartzenegger or Steven Segal. The luxurious apartment that will be assigned to us will be a very comfortable furnished two-room apartment dug a couple of meters underground. In the bunker, where we will rest between one mission and another, we will find a huge amount of information not only useful to the game but also simply interesting to know. The unfolding of the entire plot is collected in the pages of a comfortable and exciting diary that will be the protagonist of the game to keep, in a completely automatic way, always updated. Furthermore, we will find indispensable dossiers on the weapons with which we will be equipped and a heap of information available regarding the historical-political situation of the region, of the populations and tribes, as well as extremely useful information on enemy guerrilla techniques. Ah... all this while listening to the radio, with its incessant sequence of great music and brilliant DJ interludes. Well, there's no other place like home. Immersiveness. The entire plot is, therefore, narrated in the first person, both during the interlude sequences and during the actual game, up to the breaks between one mission and another, having the diary available. The characters are animated in a convincing way and the expressions are quite realistic, making you soon forget the small number of polygons used. But before embarking on the real adventure it is advisable to do the training missions, simple tutorials in which we will be able to learn the basic techniques of the game, naturally under the colorful invectives of the more classic movie sergeant (who is the captain of the Nui Pek camp). These missions are a real gem, fun and hilarious, but the very explicit language of the sergeant could annoy some. Indeed, one of the main characteristics of this game is the direct and uncompromising language that is widely used. We know: war is war and crawling in the mud and swallowing dust ends up not being too subtle. Personally I appreciate the idea and I agree with the ~Forbidden to minors of 18 years~ sticker on the packaging, but perhaps someone else could feel annoyed, so it is better to make it clear immediately: you will hear invectives of all kinds and you will hear your enemies with very unflattering epithets, so get ready for a trip to southern Vietnam as you will rarely happen to do. For better or for worse. But above all in the good. Gameplay. We come, finally, to the heart of the review. Now let's talk about how much this Vietcong lets himself be played and how. First of all, forget the action of SoF2 or the precise and millimeter tactics of Ghost Recon, because we are exactly halfway between the two titles. Vietcong judiciously mixes the two ingredients, making the game fluid and fast, but never frustrating or bizarre. We fight, but as soldiers, not as strategists. Here, in the jungle, you crawl through the mud and advance with one eye glued to the ground, to discover any traps, and the other nailed to the forest, before it starts raining lead from the wrong side of the gun. Impressive, as already mentioned, the hiss of the bullets that pass close to us. Talking about ~realism~ for this game is a bit contradictory, because the realism is simplified and so is the physical model and the reproduction of the weapons. It is not only on the realism that the game bases its strength, but also on the convincing setting and combat simulation. Gameplay. We will have to command our men well and be stealthy and silent to be able to defeat the damned charlies, who are everywhere. The weapons, then, are several and all quite simple to use, without too many differences in terms of ballistics, but of course the weight of each weapon will influence our movements when shouldered. So, holding an M60 we will move slower than holding a gun or a simple knife. Furthermore, in the most complicated situations, we will be able to get rid of our weapons to collect those of the enemies, which will certainly be less sophisticated, but we will find shovelfuls of ammunition scattered almost everywhere, especially on their corpses. In short, the lover of military simulation at any cost could easily be disappointed by the game, but the player looking for an engaging and challenging experience will then have bread for his teeth. The maps are well done, richdetailed and well balanced. The exploration alternates with the combat phases with balance and more than once we will find alternative paths to follow and, in general, a discreet non-linearity of the maps. The missions are varied and exciting and we will find ourselves crawling in the dark in underground tunnels, full of enemies, or driving a jeep on a mountain path, to make Colin McRae envious! As you progress in single player mode, you will unlock new weapons and new maps to play in Instant Action mode. Furthermore, in this mode, we will also be able to play on the side of the Vietcong. The first few times we play, we will discover that the gooks are difficult enemies, difficult to take down and often infallible from a distance. In fact, one of the most widespread criticisms is precisely the fact that the Vietcong are too often die-hard and we will have to hit them several times to see them fall definitively. In addition, the almost infallible aim even over long distances, of some shooters, can make the game frustrating in the first moments, but fortunately a hybrid save system has been implemented that will avoid us having to painfully start the mission all over again. The rescue system is hybrid, as I said, because it mixes two apparently conflicting solutions. Mainly, by carrying out certain actions and completing the various objectives, the game will save automatically, using a system called ~checkpoint~, but to this is also added the possibility of saving at any other moment in the game. The difference is that these free saves are limited and the number depends on the selected difficulty level. The higher the difficulty level, the fewer quicksaves are available. Artificial Intelligence is placed on discrete levels, with a good simulation of the most common behaviors and a more than good tactical functionality. The Vietcong are deadly from a distance and the marksmen have unerring aim, providing good cover for their comrades. The enemies are always on the move, they move continuously and know how to exploit the covers provided by the various environments to their advantage, becoming decidedly difficult to track down. Gameplay. The teammates, on the other hand, respond perfectly to orders and know how to give us the necessary coverage when requested, without too many indecisions. The important thing, however, is not to ask too much of their digital brains. It doesn't take much for a friendly soldier to come between us and the Cong, inevitably invading our line of fire. Entering a tunnel or a trench, there is the continuous risk of being behind the whole team, which will have followed us like a line of faithful dogs, blocking the exit. In short, the AI is on good levels, always convincing, but a few flaws here and there affect its functioning in some situations. The interface is spartan and essential, with an unrealistic radar, in the upper right corner, which signals the position of friends and enemies, in the immediate vicinity. The puritst of realism, however, do not worry, since they will be able to eliminate the excess frills and even play with the hud completely bare, using the appropriate item in the Options menu. Multiplayer. That Vietcong is a complete game in all respects is something we have now ascertained, so we can rightly expect it to be equally cared for also from the point of view of multiplayer. The game modes are really many and satisfy almost every type of player. Want the wild, bluntly frag? Ok, then you can launch into furious DeathMatch, without mercy. But the Vietcong is designed for team play, so a mode like the DM can be good for warming up a bit, in spare time and without too much effort, while the others are specifically designed to pit two teams of players against each other . As well as in single player, also in multiplayer Vietcong and Americans clash, so these will be the two factions in the field, then which side to play depends a bit on our sympathies and a bit on the balance of the parties on the server at that moment . Apart from the DM and the TDM (team DM), the other modes include the classic CTF (capture the flag), the Last Man Standing, a variant without respawn of the DM, the Cooperative mode, in which we will be able to face the missions of the single player with human companions, a very interesting ATG (Assault Team Game) mode, which is very similar to the Assault mode present in the first UT and in which each team has assigned objectives to complete, and finally the RW (Real War), in which must be captured", "date": "2003-05-02", "grade": null}
