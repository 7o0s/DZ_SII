Full-bodied, balanced, non-trivial, full of gameplay, the Japanese creature is not as fresh as it might seem: the title was released in 2020 in Japan, but here in Europe we have been touching it for a few weeks. It is evident how the developer and publisher is finally taking courage: after having shrugged off a bit of shyness, the Japanese team wants to face the market head-on, continuously publishing quality products and showing the world that gameplay comes first the rest.Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society collects and refines ancestral mechanics, those playful streams that blend role-playing games with dungeon crawlers, grafted into a path that grows continuously, burns hours like matches, tickles strategy and fantasy, bursts with competence in the perimeter of the most unknown and at the same time interesting products of the luster. In the Labyrinth of Galleria review we tell you why we liked it so much. Puppet master Artistically, Labyrinth of Galleria fully embodies the artistic style one can expect from NIS The narrative frame, as you might expect, is marked enough to intrigue most: Eureka, the chibi protagonist and ideal model of NIS character design, is a spontaneous and naive girl who, in order to respond to a job advertisement, finds herself catapulted on a journey through dungeons of all kinds in search of precious artistic artifacts. An incipit that is a trademark of Nippon Ichi, perennially oriented towards creating a narrative fabric that is very easy to digest, without overdoing it, flooding any of his works with apparent simplicity and immediacy. The apparently superficial technique of the Japanese is actually an extraordinary weapon to focus the heart of each of their products, Labyrinth of Galleria included, i.e. the gameplay. : the team's experience has perfectly packaged a concentration of numbers, statistics, design and playful immediacy, combining a self-explanatory narrative frame with a complex and satisfying journey through corners, doors, underground rivers, enemies and demons, characters and statistics , fighting and exploration. A lot, a lot of exploration: as a wandering spirit, we will be the ones to accompany little Eureka for a walk through the dungeons, creating armies of warrior puppets that can be customized in almost every aspect and, in fact, exponentially amplifying the engagement of this particular mechanism. As simple as it is captivating, the idea behind the product works: a dry playful fulcrum is the basis on which to build and indulge our creative component. Exploration and fighting With an often interesting design, leaning towards a fairytale but dark fantasy, Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society has a good amount of enemies to face Sequel to Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, Labyrinth of Galleria is not an enormously complex title: the difficulty is balanced and an average player familiar with JRPG formulas will have no problem chewing the dozens of hours necessary to complete the adventure. The playful stimulus of the product does not place too much emphasis on the complexity of the clashes, but on the peculiar and fun mix between exploration, gameplay, small narrative between supporting actors and pleasantness of the artistic sector. The navigation of the dungeons is proposed with intelligence, not extremely labyrinthine, identifiable in the right times, interspersed with a correct entry of the enemies into the scene. Obviously, you will have to like dungeon crawlers: Labyrinth of Galleria will offer you a huge number of dungeons, treasures, secret doors, jumps to make and enemies to beat. To accomplish all this, the title provides a sort of forge of puppets, real characters to be created from scratch based on our imagination (following a sort of editor, of course) and to evolve and level up. The combat system, it must be said, cannot be interpreted as the fulcrum of the experience as it is a little drier than others in terms of mechanics and depth, as well as horizontality: we will decide whether to send all the puppets available from each pact into battle or training or whether to use only a part of it. As mentioned, it is also evident from this element that combat sometimes appears more a way to color the experience than an essential essential, but that's okay: exploration is the most fun part and completing each map, finding each treasure and find orEvery secret door does justice to the genre of Labyrinth of Galleria. Underground fantasy Yes, it is likely that Harada's traits will immediately stand out as already seen, but the general style is always a guarantee The average stylistic figure of NIS is now a common knowledge heritage: the titles of the prolific Japanese publisher never lose sight of their well-finished, detailed, well-proposed soul both in the characters and in the environments. Labyrinth of Galleria carries on the tradition with a set of protagonists, enemies and supporting characters absolutely above the NIS average, a nice concentration of style, art, passion and inspiration: the general maturity reached by the team and the specific design ability of Harada can don't excite some palates less averse to Japanese taste, but talented - it's undeniable - there's a lot of it. In addition to the two-dimensional drawings, don't expect much else: the dungeon models, the few effects, the animations in the fights are elements that emanate all the modest aura of the production, the daughter of a design concept from other eras, that PlayStation feeling 2 which still keeps NIS anchored to the ground and never makes it take false steps, or steps longer than the leg.", "date": "2023-04-26", "grade": "8.5"}
