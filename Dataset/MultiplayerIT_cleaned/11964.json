{"name": "Fifa 08", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-08.html", "text": "Strange fate that of Fifa Soccer; after practically inventing modern football video games, the franchise was then overshadowed and forced to chase after Konami's legendary Pro Evolution Soccer, the best exponent of the genre on consoles for years. Not only has the EA Sports production never engraved or left its mark on mobile phones, but it has also been forced on this platform to look down on Gameloft's Real Football which in these days is toasting the release of the 2008 version. Unfortunately also this year, despite official licenses and cotillon, Fifa 08 fails to prove to be a product of at least equal quality to the competition, showing the side to a whole series of historical and decidedly cloying defects. Precisely for this reason we believe that the US giant should have the courage to give a clean slate to a project evidently based on not very valid foundations, developing a new game from scratch that finally lives up to the name it bears. On the contrary, this year too the title is nothing more than an updated and slightly revised edition of the 2007 version, and therefore built around a gameplay that was never able to shine. Not even the graphic component, usually always taken care of in Electronic Arts products, manages to exceed sufficiency in this edition; athletes all the same, limited or simply ugly animations (see the running one), simplistic ball bounces to say the least and in general a look unable to reflect the sensational technical progress of mobile phones that other products have more than amply demonstrated. The sound also leaves us dumbfounded by its practically total absence; in addition to the music in the menus, the only effect during the match is that of the referee's whistle. But it is above all in the playability that Fifa 08 disappoints, offering a limited and at times irritating product. Let's start from the artificial intelligence, really poor both in terms of companions and opponents; seeing players motionless a few steps from the ball is disheartening, and any intention of collective action is therefore soon abandoned in favor of simple solo bucking trying to get to the shot. Even the control system is not convincing, and the use of the 3/4 perspective was not supported by an adequate use of the keys, so much so that even just making the player run in the desired direction can become complicated. The contact between players and the ball, with the exception of the one who directly controls the ball, is also very imprecise and approximate. More generally therefore, playing Fifa 08 on mobile is an experience rarely capable of entertaining, and which at the depth of the contour (European championships and many teams with official licenses, the possibility of facing a season or scenarios in which to overturn desperate situations, etc. ) opposes an excessive simplification of the gameplay. We do not at all reject the idea of opposing the realism of Real Football with a more arcade concept of football; but the de facto possibility of only executing passes and shots, since light tackles are automatic and through balls do not exist, debase the player's ambitions to find something more than a simple turf pinball machine in Fifa 08.
