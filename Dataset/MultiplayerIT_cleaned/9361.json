For us, this game/experience is one step away from excellence, thanks to its own style and a truly perfect combat system. The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile was created as a two-dimensional hack 'n slash set in a world of the future in which horrific creatures move, a mix between cyborgs resulting from experiments by mad scientists and aberrant genetic mutations. In the role of Yuki or his brother the Dishwasher, two excellent fully armed warriors, we are catapulted into this hallucinatory world, with a story interspersed with nightmares and illusions, without a breather with events that are narrated by quick cut scenes between one level and another with the perfect use of ~painted~ screens, in which most of the time one of the protagonists expresses his ideas and next objectives. Having said that, it is clear that you would like to know more about the plot, get to know the dishwasher and Yuki, find out where their desire for revenge comes from and above all know the details of the setting, however you will be disappointed since despite playing the Ska Studios title thoroughly in reality, many questions remain unanswered. The setting turns out to be the Moon, populated as anticipated by violent and corrupt creatures, headed by unscrupulous characters that it is necessary to eliminate gradually. Mysterious plot Connected to an intricate plot, never too clear in the outlines and at times only hinted at, there is a prominent visual impact that only exacerbates the degradation of the setting, the suffering of the protagonists and their desire for revenge. The whole world is gray, shades of color only sometimes appear, the screen is surrounded by black color and only the scene and a small part of the scenery are visible in detail. The real dominant color is blood red, which is ~sprayed~ on our screens after each kill, a tone that also in this case highlights danger and suffering. The succession of tunnels, tunnels, parts of ruined buildings, hockey fields, is a continuous chase for someone or something, a mix between an escape and a chase, a common feeling that completely permeates the game. In this the level design is perfect, given that the sense of bewilderment and claustrophobia is perfectly communicated to the player, even if a greater difference between the scenarios would have helped to make an absolutely top-level product excellent. Xbox 360 goals To get the 200 points divided into 12 objectives it is necessary to spend many hours in the role of Yuki and the dishwasher, not only must you complete the game with both characters but you must also do it on advanced difficulty. A tough but definitely stimulating challenge. Gameplay Coming to the actual gameplay, we can only underline how the combat system is the master in this hack 'n slash which allows you to attack the unfortunate in many different ways. From katana to butcher cleavers, from electric saw to an arm machine gun, passing from an absurd syringe up to devastating spells capable not only of devastating opponents but also of regenerating life points. The real peculiarity in the combat system of The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile is the transmigration of blood, an innate ability of the two protagonists to move in any direction instantly, a sort of teleportation, perfect for dodging enemy attacks, suddenly attacking distant opponents and rising in flight. Thanks to this ability, the fights are very frenetic with the protagonist moving from one side of the screen to the other to carry out combined attacks, grapples and devastating finishing moves capable of spraying the screen with blood. The ~gore~ never leaves the Ska Studios game, for the duration of the approximately 5 hours necessary to complete the main adventure, evidently we are not in the presence of a children's game. The adventure can be played both by impersonating Yuki and the Dishwasher, a pity that between the two protagonists there are no appreciable differences in terms of gameplay, you certainly won't be bored since the enemies to fight are various and above all the end-of-level bosses will give you a lot of hard work. In addition to the main mode, there is an arcade mode which provides a succession of more than 50 different stages in which to test one's skills, called the Dishes Challenge, which is a sort of ~Survivor~ in which it is necessary to survive the wavesdefeat your enemies until the final defeat, obviously accompanied by an online general ranking. The multiplayer is rich since it is possible to play the entire campaign both offline and online in the company of a friend, one more reason to complete the adventure over and over again.", "date": "2011-04-08", "grade": "8.5"}
