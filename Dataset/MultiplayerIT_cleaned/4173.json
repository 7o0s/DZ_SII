{"name": "MotoGP 18: la recensione per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp-18-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "MotoGP 18 also brings to the Nintendo Switch the driving experience developed by Milestone for the new episode of its officially licensed MotoGP series, and it does so naturally by exploiting the strengths of the hybrid console, primarily the possibility to play anywhere and anytime. Once challenged the system and started a game, after having found that also in this case the developers have unfortunately chosen not to include an online multiplayer mode in the package (it is only possible to challenge another user locally), the first thing he wonders, for professional deformation, is how much the launch of Switch, notoriously compatible with the Unreal Engine, weighed with the change of graphics engine recently operated by Milestone, which as we know did not bring the enormous advantages that were expected of see, especially in terms of performance. The second thing, having started a quick event and got on the track, is if it was worth it: in handheld mode the game is forced to run at such a low resolution that it mixes the assets and returns a really annoying ~blurry~ sensation. Below, as has become tradition, an example captured by hand. Graphics and controls Let's try to understand each other: the graphics are not the parameter that will push you to buy MotoGP 18 for Nintendo Switch, but on a platform that runs Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at an unshakable sixty frames per second and full resolution it is reasonable to expect more on the front of the optimization, of the use of expedients that can improve the general visual performance of the product. The recent Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a perfect example of this, also in terms of the cuts that Panic Button had to make to bring MachineGames' shooter convincingly to the Nintendo console. More or less the same thing happens with the Milestone racer, but from a technical point of view the final result is not convincing. Once the system is connected to the dock, the situation improves significantly, fortunately, but some flaws remain: the reduced number of pilots on the track, some visible drop in frame rate, low resolution effects, mysteriously dull colors compared to the PlayStation 4 version , landscapes less rich in elements and a lot of blunders that occur when you fall off the bike, exposing parts of the track that are less well-maintained than in the central areas. We must also add a further element of perplexity, systematic in this case: the absence of analog triggers, which prevents you from regulating braking and acceleration with precision, a fundamental mix to be able to face hairpin bends effectively and gain those tenths needed to recover a bit of ground during a furious chase. The gameplay works the same, but the difference becomes more perceptible as you go up with the difficulty level. Modes and gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, the Nintendo Switch version of MotoGP 18 does not include online multiplayer, but otherwise the offer is practically identical to that of the other editions: it is possible to try your hand at a single race weekend, with an entire championship or with the time attack; or take on the rich career mode. The latter will see us starting from a lower category, at the controls of a customized rider, with the aim of bringing home some important victories, signing for more renowned teams and using the experience points earned on the track to improve various aspects of the bike: engine, brakes, suspension, chassis and aerodynamics. In addition to the upgrades, the setup will be fundamental, which we will be able to adjust manually or by relying on the suggestions of the team engineer, saving the result in order to then be able to recall it quickly. Also on Switch the system boasts a careful detection of the actions and habits in the race, analyzing our performances in detail and producing different results in terms of score; but above all the highly customizable driving model remains, which is now a distinctive feature of Milestone productions, with many aspects on which it is possible to act to make the experience more immediate or more realistic, with a view to a growth path that will invariably lead us to approach the game with an arcade style and then slowly move on to more challenging and satisfying settings. In case of problems, the Rewind function will be able to save goat and cabbage, allowing us to ~rewind the tape~ for a few seconds, so as to perhaps avoid a disastrous fall at the last corner.", "date": "2018-07-04", "grade": "6.8"}
