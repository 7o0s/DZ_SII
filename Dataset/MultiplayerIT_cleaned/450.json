{"name": "Gunbird Special Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunbird-special-edition.html", "text": "Arcade perfect for two, thank you The developers of the Psikyo team have packed a package without too many frills: the player finds himself choosing whether to play with Gunbird or Gunbird 2, with the only possibility of centering the screen, adjusting the level of difficulty and selecting the normal view (with two bands black on the sides), ~wide~ (deformed to fill the TV) or horizontal (to be played strictly with the head tilted...). Gunbird, just like its sequel, lets you control a character of your choice from those available, all different in speed and firepower. Therefore it is possible to opt for an ~agile~ solution, able to extricate itself even in the most problematic situations, when enemy fire literally fills the screen, or for a ~heavy~ one, in which the alter ego is slower in its movements but has the ability to nip any threat in the bud. Eliminating hostile vehicles will allow us to collect power-ups and smart bombs, both essential for success in the game: the former gradually enhance our weapons, possibly adding missiles or expanding their range, and ~reset~ at beginning of each stage (or when we lose a life, of course). The latter have the task of getting us out of trouble when it is impossible for us to dodge attacks: once launched, they nullify enemy fire and produce a highly powerful attack, which is also different depending on the character (and with a different activation time, to be taken into due consideration). At the end of each stage you have to face a boss, piloted by three wacky characters (who in the sequel take on the features of Yattaman's Trio Drombo: a desired thing? Dunno), which every time does not fail to change shape after a first defeat. Gunbird 2 is identical to the previous episode in terms of structure, but differs from it in several respects. The number of selectable characters is obviously greater, with some of them even hidden, and you have a useful extra attack available, which can be used by holding down the fire button and then releasing it. The cosmetics of the game is much more advanced, and this is especially noticeable in the animations, much more fluid, or in the special effects of the smart bombs. Gunbird 2 is also much more difficult than Gunbird, but for the wrong reasons: often, in fact, you necessarily have to resort to bombs because the trajectories of enemy fire leave no way out. Only some occasional slowdown, wanted or not, allows us to emerge unscathed from otherwise lethal attacks. Technical judgement Being the perfect conversion of two year-old coin-ops, it is difficult to evaluate the technical realization of this Special Edition of Gunbird compared to the other PS2 titles currently available. Wanting to go back in time, we can say that the graphics of the games are well done (especially that of the second episode) and certainly functional to their structure. Obviously there is no comparison with what we are used to seeing today... The music, which makes the difference in many titles of the genre, in this case does not convey particular emotions and merely accompanies the action without disturbing. The control system is immediate and quite precise: the left analog stick of the Dual Shock 2 can be used without problems and there is even a button for automatic fire, which is quite comfortable. Both games offer a good level of challenge, but are not very long-lived due to the small number of stages. Comment Gunbird Special Edition is the classic product for nostalgics and for those who want to try their hand at a proper video game, characterized by an immediate approach and which can offer a few carefree hours. There's not much to add: the graphics of the games are nice but it's impossible to compare them to that of current PS2 productions, the music is functional to the action and the overall longevity isn't very high given the small number of stages available (but it's still a coin-op, so it's normal). Recommended for lovers of old-fashioned shoot'em ups. Pros: Immediate and fun Cons: Only makes sense for nostalgics Difficulty poorly calibrated in Gunbird 2 Technological progress has literally transformed video games, so much so that many of them are not called ~games~. Unfortunately you can't go on without leaving something behind, and in this case the products that crowd the electronic entertainment market today have lost many of the characteristics of the video game. It's a bit like going from spectator to actor in the digital theater that we have the passion to set up every day: in the new action games you identify with the protagonist, which often boasts a freedom of movement even greater than ours, and you experience it firsthand. Years ago, however, we limited ourselves to controlling the movements of an often small and limited sprite in actions, paying attention to the ~complete picture~ and the contours of each object on the screen. The argument is even more valid for shoot'em-ups, which not surprisingly are struggling to find a right place in the current world of video games, and continue to present themselves in their classic guise, without any significant changes. This is more than ever the case with Gunbird, which in this Special Edition is re-proposed in its two chapters for the delight of young and old.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
