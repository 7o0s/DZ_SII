The title developed by Stunlock Studios is basically a multiplayer action game, in this case a ~player vs player~ in the arena. Unlike many other PC products that may be similar in setting and philosophy, the game does not use RPG elements to determine the outcome of battles or single shots, nor does it include a character leveling system. Therefore the twenty ~bloodlines~ available in one of the two paid editions (see box) do not gain strength, resistance or particular abilities as experience is gained. Their powers remain the same, as well as their peculiarities: the only variable is the player's skill, his relationship with the chosen character. It is a certainly original and equally certainly courageous approach for the Stunlock Studios title, which at first glance could suggest a substantial lack of depth compared to similar titles, since it opens up without half measures even to ~casual~ players. The reality, however, is quite different: to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of each character you need several hours of experience and numerous attempts; and the idea of rocking the world in the first game soon turns out to be wishful thinking, destined to drown in the blood of repeated defeats. Choose and perish There are twenty characters available in total, and they are divided into four different categories: the ~melee damage dealers~, specialized in close combat, agile and cunning; the ~ranged damage dealers~, equipped with offensive capabilities that can be used almost exclusively from a distance, not very resistant to direct attacks; the ~healers~, who mostly act as support units thanks to their healing abilities; the ~tanks~, very large and heavy, which can act as a ~wall~ in melees thanks to their resistance. There are really a lot of online games and therefore it only takes a few seconds to find one that is right for us (generally the name of the room indicates the minimum level desired: if you are just starting out, it is better to focus on games for newbies). You can challenge each other in two-on-two or up to a maximum of five-on-five matches, with the two teams facing each other in one of the twelve available maps and can access three different modes: ~Arena~, ~Capture the Artifacts~ and ~Conquests~. The ~Arena~ mode is a classic team deathmatch but without any respawn: the two factions fight each other in any area of the scenario until one of the two is totally annihilated. If we are part of one of the two teams and we are eliminated, we can only be content to be spectators for the rest of the round, in short. The 'Capture the Artifact' mode is clearly a fantasy variation on the classic 'capture the flag' theme, with teams having to collect the object hidden in their opponent's base and bring it to theirs to win. Finally, ~Conquest~ is a territorial mode complete with respawn, in which each team must conquer strategic points and keep control of them for as long as possible to score more points than the enemy. Direct control In addition to the complete lack of upgrades (the customizations exist, but have a purely aesthetic value), Bloodline Champions is distinguished by a direct control system of the character, who by default moves by pressing the classic WASD, can carry two of his attacks with the left and right mouse button and the rest using the Q, E, R, F keys and the spacebar. Seven maneuvers in all, therefore, which change according to the selected ~blooodline~ and allow us to act as we see fit. All require a certain recharge period, which however is directly proportional to their effectiveness. We can therefore perform an almost infinite number of light attacks or concentrate on avoiding the enemy to score a heavier blow. Over time, the bar of a special attack also fills up, with devastating effects: better use it wisely. Beyond the single character, to win a game it is almost always necessary to create a balance in the team, divide the tasks and cover each other's backs: solo actions are short-lived, especially if the opponents collaborate. Despite the declared openness towards ~casual~ players, as mentioned above, Bloodline Champions still has a rather steep learning curve: novices will succumb without much hesitation under the blows of the more experienced and it will take a lot of patience to don't leave the game - by the way, there are penaltiesity for the so-called ~leavers~ - and the game. In short, the work of Stunlock Studios expertly mixes simplicity and depth, and does not lend itself to hasty analysis: if you want to try the game (and you can do it for free), do it with the awareness of having to dedicate some time to it . Once you enter the mechanics that regulate the gameplay, you will certainly discover the facets that were precluded to you at first. Compare versions Bloodline Champions can be downloaded and played for free, even if the free version lends itself only to a first contact, leaving the deepening to the paid editions. In the free package there are in fact only four characters, which are available in rotation, a few private slots (for games with friends) and some advertising. To remove these limitations you have to switch to the Champions Edition (which costs 29.99 euros), the most balanced solution for those who want to play long and smoothly, practically without constraints. Then there is also the Titan Edition (which costs 89.99 euros), ~titanic~ in every respect, which also includes the free acquisition of all future characters. Technical realization and performance The graphic style of Bloodline Champions is certainly very effective, especially as regards the characters. Some of them are really original and fascinating, with a decent level of detail and good animations, and their moves can be quite spectacular. The feeling is typical of some RTS, with a three-quarter top view and even the ability to zoom freely, but as mentioned, the difference in terms of gameplay is very marked. The scenarios offer an excellent variety from an aesthetic point of view, but for practical purposes one is as good as the other, especially in the ~Arena~ mode: since ~retreats~ or strategies based on movement are practically not possible, every fight ends up taking place in the middle of the map, with few exceptions, and hardly moving to other areas. Engine optimization represents one of the strengths of the Stunlock Studios production, given that with a modest test configuration (Intel Core i3 350M, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650) we were able to run the game at a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels, with all effects maxed out and a frame rate that never dropped below thirty frames per second. Finally, a few words for the sound sector: well done and with a sure atmosphere, but a little essential.", "date": "2011-02-11", "grade": "8.0"}
