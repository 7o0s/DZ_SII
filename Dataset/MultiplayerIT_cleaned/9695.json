For the house of Osaka it is also a return to the genre that first made it famous all over the world, that of scrolling fighting games, one of the strands that were lost during the generational leap that led to the transition from graphics bitmap (or ~raster~, if you prefer) to the polygonal one. The first episode of Sengoku Basara (known in the West as ~Devil Kings~) for PS2 had the merit of clarifying a simple concept, namely that it was possible to make quality scrolling fighting games, with an excellent sensation of impact and a good system of combat, even in a three-dimensional scenario. The various attempts to re-propose this type of video game previously (think of the discreet Fighting Force for PSone) had therefore failed basically for two reasons: lack of experience on the part of the developers and platforms that were technically too limited to perform at their best in a polygonal context. The sequel to Sengoku Basara has not crossed the Japanese territorial borders, being released in 2006 only in the land of the rising sun for both PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii. Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes therefore constitutes the first step of the series on the new generation consoles, in this case PlayStation 3, while maintaining the convenient link with the huge installed base of the Nintendo system. The result is a classic-style action game, based for both versions on the efficient MT Framework Lite engine and characterized by spectacular battles, in which our character alone manages to defeat hundreds of opponents within a variable number of internships with increasing degrees of difficulty. We are the samurai, samuraaaai! Apart from the ~free battle~, i.e. the possibility of facing previously completed missions again, the game has a single main mode, which sees us select one of the six characters initially available to launch ourselves into a series of battles that will lead to a different epilogue from case to case. The concept of ~conquest of the territory~ is similar to that present in any episode of Dynasty Warriors, therefore you can choose which army to attack and then find yourself in a scenario that must be ~explored~ and cleaned up of the enemies present, especially commanders and lieutenants who can make a difference when left alone with our ordinary troops. The map is always divided into sections, each of which is generally governed by a garrison that we have the task of destroying and making our own: the achievement of this objective will allow us to proceed to the next area, until the decisive battle with the troop leader enemies, which at the end of the story mode will often be added to the selectable characters to bring the total to sixteen different campaigns. We faced and completed this mode with two different ~heroes~, and the extraordinary thing is that completing all the quests alone is not enough to unlock all the weapons, items, special moves and costumes available for each of them . Bearing in mind that each character has its own story and a certain ~alignment~, that it must be completed several times to obtain all the unlockable elements and finally that this must be multiplied by sixteen, it is clear that we are faced with a story mode of great substance. Story mode which can also be played in two via split-screen, but which unfortunately does not have an online multiplayer mode: a pity, it would have been the proverbial ~icing on the cake~. Dynasty Heroes? If from a structural point of view Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes is certainly similar (if not identical) to Dynasty Warriors, in terms of gameplay there are marked differences between the two products. The repetitiveness of the action is common to both franchises, without a doubt: you have to spend hours hitting hundreds and hundreds of enemy soldiers, with very little variation between one stage and another. What changes is the quality of the combat dynamics, the sensation of impact and the number of combos and special moves, all elements that highlight Capcom's undoubted experience with the fighting game genre. If in DW you find yourself always performing the same combos to wipe out enemies, moreover without the impact of the blows being rendered at its best,in Samurai Heroes the same type of action is undoubtedly deeper and more satisfying, crowned above all by boss fights full of tension and spectacularity. The control system sees the presence of two attacks (light and heavy) that can be combined in various ways, to which are added the jump (with related flying maneuver) and three different special moves: the first based on the Basara bar (placed below that of the health), or a devastating combo that can make the difference against the toughest opponents; the second based on the ~rage bar~, which allows us to slow down all enemies for a few seconds and sink the blows much more effectively; the third which works through ~objects~ and consists of a single shot of extraordinary power. Our character gains experience and levels up as he eliminates entire enemy legions: this growth unlocks new combos and new special moves, which together with the weapons and materials collected on the battlefield defines the picture of a basic but interesting RPG component, complete with elementary ~crafting~ and assignment of upgrades. Playstation 3 trophies Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes contains a whopping fifty-five trophies, most of which are secret. Those immediately visible, all in bronze, are won by completing the game with the six initial characters, with Nobunaga Oda and keeping the difficulty level on easy. The secret bronze trophies are obtained by completing the game with the characters to be unlocked, while the silver ones require the achievement of particular objectives, such as the acquisition of all accessories and weapons. The two gold trophies can be won by making all possible alliances and maximizing your character, while finally the platinum trophy is unlocked once all the others have been obtained. David versus Goliath As anticipated during our test in Tokyo, Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes is nice to see on both PlayStation 3 and Wii. Apart from the clear differences regarding the graphic resolution, in fact, the two versions of the game use the same engine and are able to manage a huge number of characters on the screen at the same time. We will be able to face hundreds of enemies at the same time without noticing any slowdowns, with a good variety in the polygonal models and a decent level of detail in the scenarios. The drawing distance on the Wii is perhaps less, but this does not mean that the developers had to resort to gimmicks such as the classic fog to remedy these shortcomings, while the introduction of some gestures to be performed with the Wii-mote and Nunchuk to perform special moves turns out to be apt and does not disturb the gameplay. The animations and hero design are really well done, finally. As far as the Nintendo console is concerned, in conclusion, we can speak of a truly remarkable technical achievement. And on PlayStation 3? Well, the MT Framework Lite is certainly not the MT Framework 2.0 of Lost Planet 2, there is a general simplification of the scenarios (lean and often similar to each other) and a greater attention to the number of objects on the screen and the frame rate , which actually never goes down. Let's say that the final result is functional to the action, including the artistic direction. And while we're at it, it's time to applaud the American voice actors who lent the voices to the characters: a really good job.", "date": "2010-10-27", "grade": "7.8"}
