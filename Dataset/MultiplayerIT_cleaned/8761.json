{"name": "Zen gaming al suo meglio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99064-pixeljunk-eden-zen-gaming-al-suo-meglio.html", "text": "Tested version: PCQ-Games has been delighting us with the PixelJunk series for quite some time now, a sort of all-round creative laboratory in which new forms of gameplay and graphic styles are experimented, paying homage to classic genres that have almost disappeared and tries, in general, to offer users an experience that is different from the usual, rich in content and never banal. PixelJunk Eden stands as the embodiment of this philosophy, and a few years after the original publication on the PlayStation Network, it arrives on Steam with a ~complete~ version, which includes the additional levels of the Encore expansion and boasts a completely redesigned control system for use with mouse and keyboard. In fact, the controller is not really supported, which could make those who prefer this type of approach turn up their noses, but the developers have developed a series of rather effective solutions to convince us of their choices, involving not only all the keys of the mouse but also some convenient keyboard ~shortcuts~. While the leaf-shaped pointer ~indicates~ the direction of our possible movement, in fact, a right click allows us to jump and its continuous pressure prevents the character from hooking to the ~plants~ that are in its trajectory. A left click, on the other hand, results in the release of a ~canvas~ and in a rotating maneuver that is very useful if we want to hit several enemies at the same time and at the same time collect the elements they release following elimination. Elements which then go on to activate the ~roots~ of new structures, which are fundamental for guaranteeing us the necessary support to scale scenarios which gradually develop more and more in height. The mouse wheel can be used to quickly shorten the canvas, for example when an opponent capable of breaking it approaches, while pressing the wheel on its axis activates a comfortable ~undo~ which, in exchange for a little energy, allows you to bring the little Grimp back to the position before the last jump and thus avoid the effects of a wrong move, capable of producing burning episodes of frustration which are also part of the package packaged by Q-Games. The secret garden As some readers may already know, PixelJunk Eden sees us control a tiny creature in increasingly large ~gardens~, characterized by different styles, colors and structures. The game doesn't have a real main menu, so you have to access the various areas using the same platform mechanics that govern the gameplay. A first difference compared to the PlayStation 3 version, in addition to the total number of gardens available, lies in the possibility of deciding which objectives to pursue in a completely free way: you are bound to visit a scenario as soon as you unlock it, but in general you can proceed in the collection of ~Spectra~ as you prefer. The Spectra are precisely the objects that we have the task of finding and collecting: there are five of them in each garden, seventy-five in total, and during the first ~stint~ the completion of a level is determined precisely by contact with one of them, while subsequently it is possible to replay this location without dividing the experience into five distinct phases. To locate the Spectra we must perform the roundabout maneuver with the Grimp, which will ~light up~ during its circular trajectory indicating the direction in which we must move to reach the goal. Completing this task gradually becomes more difficult, because new variables are introduced such as the ~gates~, which teleport us from one point of the garden to another, the flowers which project us very rapidly upwards or some forces which can oppose our movements. Inertia is an integral part of the gameplay, which certainly adds depth to PixelJunk Eden and makes the correct completion of a complex maneuver galvanizing, but at the same time represents a significant problem and will certainly make you curse profusely when you fall following a miscalculated jump. Correctly positioning the mouse and having some space available to move it smoothly will quickly prove to be a priority since, once he has taken a leap, the Grimp can only move left or right in a limited way and only based on the inputs he we provide it through the pointer. It's all very ~delicate~, in short, and at a certain point one almost feels like an artist in ringing combo after combo, disintegrating enemies like a crazed comet and despite everything avoiding losing touch with the roots that keep us close to each other Spectra. As far as the technical sector is concerned, there is little to say: the grafica is essential but fascinating, it moves fluidly while offering us ever more particular shades of color, while the sound (signed by the Japanese artist Baiyon) is almost hypnotic. It is no coincidence that the soundtrack of the game can also be purchased on Steam, separately or in a single, convenient bundle.", "date": "2012-02-14", "grade": "8.2"}
