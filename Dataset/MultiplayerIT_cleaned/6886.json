Many, many, many of which deserved to find an indelible place in our hearts. Our thoughts go to the devastating story poised between a sense of duty and emotional dilemmas of Naked Snake in Metal Gear Solid 3, to the excruciating wounds at the base of Max Payne's explosive cocktail of violence, to the descent into hell of Jackie Estacado of The Darkness, in search of a second chance of Red Dead Redemption's John Marston, to the exceptional betrayal that generated Kratos' blind fury or to that, perhaps saddest and most touching of all, of Shenmue's Ryo Hazuki, who his revenge with every chances are it will never consume it. Then there are different revenge stories, which do not depend solely on what a scriptwriter decides upstream, but put the pen in the player's hand, allowing him to write them himself thanks to the possibility of determining with his own initiative not only more or less important, through trivial book-game multiple choices, but the development of facts, relationships and concrete possibilities of action. It is the noblest fringe of storytelling applied to this form of entertainment, the one capable of elevating the main feature of this medium, interactivity, to a storytelling tool, inserting it into an ecosystem of cause-and-effect relationships capable of generating situations that reflect user action at various levels. This is what happened trying to help The Witcher 2's Geralt of Rivia and Dishonored's Corvo Attano to get rid of the shame of the accusations of which they were unjustly victims, to cite two recent examples of excellence. And that's what happens in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor which is not content to swell the ranks of this virtuous category, but even relaunches itself as the progenitor of a new lineage. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor reviewed rising star of action games and sandboxes Two faces of the same drama More than a story of revenge, in the case of Shadow of Mordor it would be appropriate to speak of ~stories~. In fact, the plot links the events of the ranger Tallion and the elf Celebrimbor, both cruelly killed together with their families at the behest of Sauron. Once they have passed away, the two therefore get to know each other, discovering that they need each other to get on the trail of those who snatched their lives and affections from them. A classic ~together by force~ situation, which lends itself well to giving a narrative backbone to the story, determining the rhythm of the main events, giving explanations and gradually bringing out the personality of the protagonists through the typical ongoing relationship, in which they learn to get to know each other from different points of view (except that with a humorous background, entrusted to interludes with other supporting actors), while their exploits are intertwined with places, characters and background of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. In fact, the two end up being a single entity capable of acting on as many different levels, the material and the spectral, both in the exploratory possibilities and in the fights and in the more mediated approaches to solving problems. And this is precisely one of the peculiarities that helps Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor begin to dig its way, to bring out its identity in the furrow traced by the Assassin's Creed and Batman: Arkham series to which it owes, in unequivocally, very much. From setting movement, fighting and infiltration techniques to the types of tasks, from conquering towers to identify missions and activities to the possibility of using vision similar to Eagle Vision or Detective Mode: these and other aspects closely follow the famous sources of inspiration closely, but Monolith Productions has managed to put its own, thanks to the ambivalence of the controlled character, which allows you to seamlessly pass from a soul specialized in physical attacks and in the use of the sword to a 'another teacher of esoteric practices and use of the bow. Without counting other factors, even more characteristic, which we will discover below. A game for everyone Making video games now costs a lot, and therefore we must try to sell them to everyone, especially if they are triple A. But there is a way and a way. You know, right, the fact that in Batman: Arkham City the ability to remove the visual notification of an enemy's attack has been ~promoted~ to a feature to make sense of the New Game Plus? Present, no, the load of information and visual assistance unprecedented for an FPS (even in the era of the FPS for everyone) with which Far Cry 3 was launched and to which Ubisoft has given a hand post-launch after crowds of, gvery fair, complaints? Or the discussions about whether the game or the video indications in the case of Dishonored and the last Thief were born first? Very good. Monolith, on the other hand, demonstrates great respect for gamers by immediately putting them in a position to enjoy the game in the most comfortable way. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor provides a set of options through which to set up the experience as you prefer. Whether you are fathers of families with little time left, therefore interested in going straight from main mission to main mission, whether you are explorers intending to immerse yourself totally in Nurm, learning to know it inch by inch by orienting yourself on sight, whether you are a beginner swordsmen guns or purists who want to get as direct a feel as possible with their action reading ability and muscle memory should not find you unhappy. Not only that: if for any reason, yours alone, you should feel the need not to overwrite a game, you are also given the possibility to choose from several save slots. The same is true with reference to the license on which this new Warner Bros. intellectual property is based, which in no way represents a barrier to entry or a disclaimer to fully enjoy it: whether you are a Tolkien fundamentalist rather than totally ignorant of his works or passionate in need of a refresher, the game greets you with dozens of illustrations and screenshots with detailed descriptions on basically every aspect you'll stumble upon, from the bestiary to the locations, down to the last of the mushrooms that can be collected or that weird dwarf with obvious problems at the hair carryover, muttering about ~weavers~... Can you recognize innovation? To understand the true nature and real scope of the action game produced by Warner Bros. Interactive, however, we must consider that within it there are not only two stories of revenge, but many, many and always different. The two large regions of Mordor that can be freely explored (Udn and, starting from a certain point, Nurn) are playgrounds populated by animals of various kinds, mostly harmless, aggressive creatures such as caragors, ghl and graugs and, finally, the true ruling race: the armies of Sauron. The Dark Lord's army is made up of a bevy of uruks, each of which has a well-defined name, face and personality, also the protagonists of a personal story waiting to be written on the white paper of that Nemesis System of which there has been a lot of talk in recent months. If one of these happens to kill us he is promoted, climbing the ranks ranging from Captain to Commander with different degrees of honor, getting better equipment, becoming stronger, earning the right to have subordinates, themselves individual entities at all the effects. Enemies also have a memory, and since Talion is already dead, and then on the next attempt he simply resurrects again, with no interruptions in the flow of events like when restarting from a traditional ~checkpoint~, the next time they will prove to remember us , making some jokes, referring to the way we previously tried to defeat them and more. This creates an absolutely spontaneous feeling of mutual rivalry between the player and these subjects. For example, we have been defeated several times by particularly difficult Commanders, and we couldn't wait to make them pay, especially when we were mocked with a particularly penetrating pun, different from the usual. Likewise, units we thought we'd killed may return, perhaps scarred or patched up as best we could, eager to exact their revenge. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Each uruk, we said, is an entity in its own right that can move around the territory, because it is engaged in a mission, on a hunting trip, in a banquet, in the exploitation of human slaves or in settling accounts with a fellow man, towards which tends to have feelings of rivalry for obtaining power. Activities that it performs in total autonomy, regardless of the player's action, and whose results are updated through the Nemesis System screen. We also happened to receive ~notification~ of the death of a Veteran Captain at the hands of a graug, which happened who knows where and who knows under what precise circumstances. Or to involuntarily do a favor to one of our opponents, whom we wanted to ambush while he was executing one of his competitors, because in the heat of the fight we killed the victim by mistake, allowing our nemesis to achieve his goal and make progress in the Military Order of Sauron Chessboard, coThe fact that she then managed to get away with it is also simple. Another symptomatic situation is a mission in which we had to face a certain Commander, who, as we threaded one failure after another, saw his power grow, on our skin, until he became a Legendary Commander: result? At one point we had to go elsewhere to fulfill the task, since with the increase in prestige he was put in charge of a more important outpost. Then there is to consider that the stick can be inserted between the coils of the legions in a more intimate and subtle way, more directly influencing the relations between uruks, through the Brand with which they can be converted to the cause of Talion and Celebrimbor then giving them the order to affiliate as a bodyguard to a superior, to be able to hit him better. This implies that we also have to worry about our pupil's rise to power or even just his survival in that nest of ravenous snakes that are the exponents of his race, through dedicated secondary missions. And here too, examples thanks to which to grasp the substance and nuances of the Nemesis System in the 30 and more hours we spent on The Shadow of Mordor before writing this review would be wasted. We leave you the pleasure of discovering them for yourself, while building your own personal gaming experience. Here we limit ourselves to pointing out that the system works great and in practice it makes a huge difference. It really is a spontaneous generator of playable situations and small stories, a feature capable of pushing the concept of ~sandbox~ towards new playful and expressive possibilities, which we hope will be taken as an example by others, perhaps by re-adapting its mold into new variations. Good first! All of this would fall like a house of cards if there was no level gameplay to support it. Fortunately, a bit like the authors of Batman: Arkham Asylum, who came from Urban Chaos: Riot Squad, on its first attempt in this area Monolith Productions managed to churn out a competent, fun and challenging action game. More: since Rocksteady refreshed the entire genre five years ago by pulling Free Flow Combat out of the hat, Shadow of Mordor is the first title that manages to match its quality overall. Combat is based precisely on that setting, relying mainly on two keys (one to attack, one to counterattack) and the execution of combos based mostly on rhythm, through which to trigger special moves. Essentially none of the bricks that made the gameplay of the Dark Knight a monument of Western action are missing, thanks to which he was able to find his own dignity without limiting himself mostly to badly emulating the Japanese tradition. There is everything: various types of KO, thrown weapons for crowd control, attributes that allow you to shorten the string of chains necessary to activate a special, logic underlying critical hits, input windows and, again, enemies that can being attacked only from behind, others going stunned first, still others blocking attempts to jump over them, and so on. But above all, there is a responsiveness of the commands, a precision of the collisions, an artificial intelligence and a soft lock that work at full speed, almost like the inspiring model, or rather the aspects that clearly differentiate Monolith's work from similar attempts of emulation seen in the past. Not satisfied, the parents of F.E.A.R. and No One Lives Forever added their own. There's a lot of talk about making video games more immersive, spectacular, ~cinematic~ experiences. In Shadow of Mordor the task succeeds, without ceasing to be a video game. First of all for reasons of scale: often the fists can become extremely populated, literally teeming with enemies (present the Brawl challenge at Batman: Arkham City's Luna Park, in Extreme? Here, nice appetizer). Added to this is the Nemesis System: whether a mission that concerns him is in progress or that it is wanted by fate, making him pass by chance, the arrival on the field of a Captain or a Commander, with relative shot cut and dedicated choral music, it is always electrifying. Not to mention the consequences on the actual gameplay, with the subject who attacks or can only be injured in a certain way, who by his nature, for example, gets angry if one of his bodyguards is injured, sees a caragor or suffers of burns. Or, conversely, he may be terrified of it, taking off and sneaking away, leaving us with the choice of whether to try to pursue him or stay in the bedlam, concentrate", "date": "2014-09-30", "grade": "9.2"}
