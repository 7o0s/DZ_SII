And so from the ~Avengers Divided~ saga we moved on to the well-known ~Civil War~, which saw two teams of superheroes opposing each other following the amendment of a law that forced masked vigilantes to ~register~ with the government, from death ( and consequent rebirth) of Captain America we moved on to the ~Secret Invasion~, perhaps the most spectacular work so far born from the mind of Michael Bendis (who is definitely good with the classic Marvel Universe, while I would spread a pitiful quilt on that which he combined with Ultimate Spider-Man). In practice, it happens that the Skrulls, a people of shape-shifting aliens, manage to infiltrate the ranks of heroes and assume leadership positions, replacing some key figures. After introducing a powerful computer virus, they launch their offensive against the Shield and all the planet's defense forces, with the aim of subduing it. Obviously the various Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man etc. they cannot allow this to happen, and so a real war begins in which no one is able to trust their allies anymore, because they could just turn out to be Skrulls. It is precisely on the ~Secret Invasion~ saga that Marvel Avengers: Battlefield Earth is based, the new action game developed by Ubisoft for Xbox 360 with Kinect support and for Wii U. He loves you Once you start the game and stand in front of the sensor, just say the word ~united!~ for the system to start the voice commands, which never seemed to us as well implemented as in this case: ~single player!~ and you enter the single player mode, ~campagna!~ and we look at the list of available missions, to then pronounce their name and access them, all quickly and without any uncertainty. We are not big fans of voice recognition controls where the simple press of a button allows us to perform the same operation in a thousandth of the time (see for example ~Xbox, close the disc tray~), but in this case the developers have really been able to make sense of this feature, which is therefore very nice to use. And if you prefer your hands, things work very well here too and you switch quickly from one menu to another, without unnecessary waiting for bars to load or whatever. In short, our first reaction to the Marvel Avengers: Battlefield Earth interface can be summed up with the phrase ~about time!~ of a peripheral which, framed in a certain way, can give great satisfaction and effectively promote a ~cool~ approach to video games. It is a fact that Kinect was not designed for ~hardcore~ type applications, but don't worry because this is absolutely not the case, given that the game is to all intents and purposes a match fighting game (in tag team, moreover) in which however, the action takes place from the middle distance. But how exactly does it work? We'll explain it right away... Xbox 360 goals There are forty-three Achievements contained in Marvel Avengers: Battlefield Earth, and many are achieved with great ease. In fact, to have 50G it is enough to win a match without taking damage, or to do it using only one of the two characters, or even to win without using the dodge. Completing the campaign earns you a 100G Achievement, while getting the highest rank earns you as much as 200G. My god has a hammer Standing in front of Kinect, at the usual standard distance of about three meters, we are asked to assume a series of positions to activate as many attack maneuvers. The game therefore detects the poses, it does not follow our movements in real time, but this solution proves to be excellent for the purpose: to have fun without too many frills. In the lower part of the screen, some icons remind us at all times of the movements necessary to execute the attacks, each with a longer or shorter cooldown depending on its effectiveness. Each superhero has its own set of moves, but some moves are the same and you can quickly memorize them. The risk is in fact that of playing always looking at the lower part of the screen to have a reference instead of enjoying the actual combat, which takes place according to very rapid and spectacular dynamics. In fact, once a certain bar is loaded, it is possible to stand outand a jump and perform a breaker or an ultra, whose power is amplified if we promptly pronounce phrases such as ~storm of arrows!~ (as Hawkeye), or ~for Asgard!~ (if we impersonate Thor). As mentioned above, the clashes mostly take place from a medium distance, but it is possible to approach the enemy by raising one knee (and therefore hitting him with a running knee) and from there create devastating combos, which we can extend by carrying out the ~ tag~ (left arm raised) and continuing to strike with the second character. As far as the defensive phase is concerned, it is not possible to parry the blows but one must limit oneself to dodging, tilting the body to the right or to the left. Unfortunately, it is immediately clear that the degree of challenge has been balanced keeping in mind a very young and/or casual user, therefore the most savvy will be able to complete the long campaign (there are about fifty stages) in something like three hours and without any particular effort. Fortunately, the playful offer is wide and quite varied: in addition to the single player campaign, Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth offers us a competitive multiplayer mode via Xbox LIVE or locally, as well as a cooperative mode for two players. There are also alternative single-player modes, such as free combat or challenges, and there is no shortage of complete technical sheets of all the superheroes that make up the roster. The technical sector is excellent: the graphics run smoothly and the polygonal models seemed very well done to us, with a good set of animations. However, the lion's share is played by the extremely dynamic view, with constant changes of shot that enliven the action. The sound is also good: the game is completely dubbed in Italian, the music is nice and some sound effects will exalt the most demanding Marvel-fans (see the noise of Iron Man's repulsors, identical to that of the films).", "date": "2012-11-21", "grade": "7.2"}
