It is usually a term that is used to indicate two types of games: the traditional ones, reduced to the essentials and aimed at the widest possible audience, perhaps based on motion control, and those that we could define as ~non-games~, such as Brain Training or Wii Music. Naturally the question is much more complex and articulated, but observing it from the point of view just exposed, Art Academy would undoubtedly fall into the second category: more than a game, in fact, it is a real painting software for Nintendo DS. In this sense, the title developed by Kuju - and in particular by the European division, Headstrong Games, in the past author of Battalion Wars 2 for Wii - is the best that the Nintendo portable can offer: the limits of the interface are the same limits imposed by the DS. The brush/stylus is as precise and sensitive as the console allows it (and never as in this case calibrating it adequately increases the quality of the experience), so there are aporias in the management of shades, the pressure is not always perceived in a satisfactory way , the touch screen does not recognize the inclination of the nib (so much so that from the menu you have to decide whether to draw ~point~ or ~back~), but in general the feeling is more than satisfactory, it is a commendable job, a system control at the height of the best Nintendo games. Brushstroke after brushstroke Aware of these limitations, the developers have made the right choice: rather than creating software with (ambiguous) ambitions for designers and/or professionals, they have attributed a didactic value to everything, in order to introduce anyone to the world of painting. The heart of Art Academy are precisely the ten lessons - plus some secondary ones - which should bring any user, even without any graphic talent, to a decent level of pictorial ability. The techniques presented gradually increase in complexity - we go from chiaroscuro on an apple to managing the lights on a colored figure, up to the reproduction of a real painting - and the various passages are quite satisfactory, in the sense that no lesson is purely abstract, but always leads to the creation of a ~concrete~ design (rather than shading a sphere, in fact, you work directly on an apple). The training is always divided into theory, technical demonstration and practice (in first person). The theoretical component is really interesting: simple and concise but direct and effective, it explains complex concepts in terms that are always understandable (for example the regulation of complementary colors, the management of shadows and the different lighting of an object based on the surface), and above all is supported by the subsequent practical demonstration. Basically, before leaving the situation in the hands of the player, Leo - the ~master~ of the Art Academy - scrupulously shows how the passage just explained is to be performed: it may seem useless or pedantic, but observing in many cases, at least in painting, is very more useful than ~hearing~ the theory. In the following phase, i.e. in the gap between the assimilation of the concept and its implementation, lie the most serious shortcomings of the software: although each lesson is divided into various intermediate sections (the drawing of the outline of the apple, the flat coloring of the itself, the positioning of the shadows, that of the lights, the finishing touches) in some cases there is the feeling that the player is left to himself. It is not easy to understand when the fault is to be attributed to the developers or when, simply, one is dealing with a subject that is too complex to be learned from a product like this (assuming that one can learn in general): the fact is that in many cases we pass from the sketchy form of a dog to the total definition of the same, without the player - provided that, clearly, he doesn't have graphic talent, which the software doesn't provide anyway - can understand or assimilate the various changes. Apart from these unpleasant and rare episodes however, as we said before, the lessons are well done from every point of view, and can also be useful to those who are already (more or less) experts in the field, especially as regards the choice of colors to illuminate or shade. Draw and paint The major problems of Art Academy arise from the fact that it is (whatever the title says) an introductory software to painting, not to drawing, and yet this forces the player to prepare the ~base~ of the painting. Naturally this makes everything more realistic and satisfying, but also more difficult: given the nature of the lessons (which are precisely centered on painting) it will probably beit had been better to leave the possibility of working on a pre-established model. Apart from this, the tools made available are a well-done synthesis between essential and superfluous: there are various types of pencil and brush, a grid to control proportions, but above all an excellent and intuitive system for mixing colors (and the waterfall). Also in this case the developers have acted skilfully within the confines imposed by the DS: the options included are a good compromise between simplicity and freedom. Art Academy tends to imitate the behavior of acrylics, it explains the basics of a technique in detail rather than proposing many in a cobbled way - also because acrylic is the most suitable for learning to paint. Once the main lessons are over, the most interesting method is, of course, ~free design~: here you can build images starting from scratch, using all the tools that - in theory - you should master by now. Although Art Academy is compatible with all versions of the DS, the ideal laptop with which to play it is certainly the DSi: beyond the larger screen, which leaves more freedom in tracing the brushstrokes, the camera gives the possibility to take pictures and use them as a template to make your own painting. The images can be shared (with DSi) and saved - both once finished and in progress - but, given the resolution, they cannot be printed (something which, for some, could be annoying).", "date": "2010-08-11", "grade": null}
