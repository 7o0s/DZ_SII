{"name": "Destroy All Humans!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destroy-all-humans.html", "text": "They came from outer space These are the narrative premises of Destroy All Humans!, a new work by Pandemic which evidently presents itself as a real homage to the B-movies of which the American filmography of the 50s and 60s was so rich. In the role of Furon Cryptosporidium 137, the user therefore has the task of extracting the DNA from the brains of the unfortunate earthlings and then simply making a clean sweep by destroying them all mercilessly. A dualism of intent that is reflected in the two main game sections that make up the Pandemic title, an action/exploration starring our Crypto 137 and the other purely ~destructive~ at the controls of the powerful UFO given to us by the empire. The game is divided into a series of areas (not many, actually) which are different both in terms of the nature of the scenario and the objectives that Crypto 137 will be called upon to satisfy. We then move from the analysis of the physical characteristics of the cows - a real alien fetish - to the kidnapping of the queen of a beauty contest, passing through a whole range of situations ranging from the recovery of objects to the achievement of certain checkpoints. Depending on the tone of the mission, it is possible to take advantage of Crypto 137's offensive or stealth abilities: in the first case, the alien's weapons (a disintegrator, an anal probe launcher and so on) and its powers are the masters telekinetic, while Crypto 137's ability to assume human form, to read the thoughts of the earthlings and to control their minds for short periods, fall into the second scenario. The game is divided equally between the two parts, without however ever reaching great heights in terms of gameplay: the fights are in fact rather flat and monotonous, while the stealth action does not require great skill or offer particularly stimulating challenges. This despite the presence of a GTA-style indicator that signals the level of attention that the land forces place towards Crypto 137: just hide for a while for everything to go back to the way it was. The situation slightly improves aboard the UFO, when all that is required of the user is to destroy every on-screen target  be it houses, buildings or entire neighborhoods  guarding against the attacks of the pathetic human army. It won't be the deepest depth, but at least it's fun. Finally, we must say how Destroy All Humans! offers a very slim main adventure: once the simple and short basic missions have been completed, the player just has to try his hand at the various sub-quests present in the levels, which in most cases boil down to not very exciting checkpoint runs or challenges of destruction against time. Vaporize them! While not unforgettable from a gameplay perspective, Destroy All Humans! however, it manages to carve out the necessary space for itself within the current playful panorama thanks to an excellent presentation from different points of view. Particular praise goes to the guys from Pandemic especially as regards the game setting, the result of the humorous reinterpretation of the atmosphere of the United States of the 50s and the B-movies we have mentioned so far. Everything refers to this universe, starting from the screens that introduce the levels (similar to the posters of such films), to the characters that can be met within the scenarios (from the classic collegiate idiots to the government men in black) to finally arrive at the titles of sensationalist newspaper accompanying game over screens. Humor, as mentioned, plays a primary role within the Pandemic product, and is mainly expressed through the dialogues between Crypto 137 and his direct superior and through the thoughts of humans that the protagonist can grasp with his powers, capable of representing little pearls of insanity. Unfortunately, a large part of the humorous nuances of these situations ends up being lost due to an Italian translation (fortunately only of the subtitles) generally subdued and in some cases even disastrous. Nonetheless, Destroy All Humans! however, it does an excellent job in terms of atmosphere, supported more than admirably by a good quality graphic sector (penalized only by a rather evident pop-up) and by an almost perfect sound accompaniment, both in terms of music and effects sounds and character voices. In short, the Pandemic title is certainly pleasant to see, a little less to play. Comment Impeccable in presentation but decidedly less inspired in terms of gameplay, Destroy All Humans! it is what can be defined as a choreographic title, whose appeal is the main leverpallidly on a more than good cosmetics and above all on an absolutely spot on stylistic / narrative context. Therefore, if the B-movie atmosphere has been perfectly recreated by the developers of Pandemic, and enriched by considerable doses of humour, the same cannot be said of the game structure of Destroy All Humans!, guilty of an evident underlying levity capable to reveal everything that the title has to offer well before the arrival (albeit sudden, given the brevity of the adventure) of the final screen. Pros: Atmosphere and high-level humor Audiovisual sector more than good Large amount of extras Cons: Light and bite-free gameplay Repetitive and boring missions in the long run Very short longevity The Furon empire is the most powerful and ruthless in the entire galaxy, protagonist of countless wars moved for the sole purpose of decreeing its racial supremacy. Gestures that in the long run cost the aliens the ability to procreate, forcing them to use advanced cloning processes to keep their ranks of fighters numerous. Copy after copy, however, the genetic code of the Furon has begun to show worrying signs of failure, making it clear the need to recover strands of pure DNA of the species. Fortunately for the empire, a source of this material has been identified in a population with which the ancient Furon had numerous encounters: humans...", "date": "2005-07-18", "grade": null}
