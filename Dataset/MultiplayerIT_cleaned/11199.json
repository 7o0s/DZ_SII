{"name": "Tony Hawk's Proving Ground", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-proving-ground_a.html", "text": "There are things that really only happen in America. Here, for example, the profession of ~skateboarder~ does not exist, yet in the USA there are athletes like Tony Hawk, capable of turning their favorite pastime into a job. Profitable, moreover. Tony started skating at the age of nine, encouraged by his family, and almost immediately devoted himself to competitions and events reserved for his particular sport. The 90s established him as the most popular skateboarder around, which earned him a large number of endorsement deals, the publication of a biography and, last but not least, the creation of a series of successful video games centered around his figure. The latest of these products is precisely Tony Hawk's Proving Ground, released for almost all gaming systems in September of last year and now landed on our mobile phones. We have two different modes available, in this case a full-bodied ~classic mode~ and a rather simple multiplayer, in which several people challenge each other on the same mobile phone: the one who first sees the insult that was written at the start materializes on the screen loses. In the ~classic mode~ we will have to deal with four different locations (warehouse, school, airport, streets), to be unlocked as the objectives are achieved. These are quite numerous for each stage, and involve the achievement of certain score ranges, as well as the collection of special items. At the end of each session, a certain amount of money will be awarded to us, which can be spent in the shop to buy new tricks, while at the same time our character will be able to count on the enhancement of his basic characteristics. The action is divided into three phases, regardless of the scenario: the ramp, the railing and the normal path. The first will see us perform only and only aerial tricks, with the score being multiplied according to their complexity and the number of chained stunts. The railing provides a horizontal scrolling path based above all on the ~grinds~, but in which there is no shortage of jump phases. The last area is a mix: we will have to perform running tricks, ~grinds~, jumps and so on. To reach the highest scores you have to divide yourself between these three phases; keeping an eye on the timer valid for the end of the session, we will be able to press the left and right function keys to leave the area and dedicate ourselves to the next one. The control system draws from rhythm games and games in which tricks and stunts are the protagonists: the character does not move directly, but you have to press the d-pad in the indicated directions to perform the manoeuvres, and timing is essential. Like several ~stunt~ games, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground makes use of vector graphics for character representation. It is a solution that guarantees a certain fluidity of the animation, unfortunately at the expense of the detail; and in this specific case, we have an essential, often questionable use of colors, with a rather sparse scenario. The animations take care of this, which are clearly very numerous and well done, as opposed to a sound as usual poor in substance. The control system, as already mentioned, is based on the typical mechanics of rhythm games, therefore it is necessary to put the right key combination in place: the response to the inputs is always fast and precise. PRO Fun and engaging Equipped with a certain thickness Great animations... AGAINST ...although the graphics, in general, are a bit sparse Essential sound Only four locations", "date": "2008-09-15", "grade": "S.V."}
