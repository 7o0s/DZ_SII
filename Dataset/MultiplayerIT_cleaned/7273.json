It has garnered acclaim (almost) everywhere, because this software has set foot everywhere, from PC to Wii, via PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, always in digital delivery, finally landing on Nintendo 3DS, in a revised and corrected summa of all previous editions , with discrete improvements and additions regarding controls, checkpoints and, inevitably, the comfortable map on the second screen. Before delving into the intricacies of Theftopolis, a small step back more than ten years long, up to 2002, when Brian Provinciano, creator and craftsman of the project of evident Italian origins, began working on a version of Grand Theft Auto III for the NES, thus coupling his (apparently) favorite game to his favorite platform, giving time and anachronisms a slap in the face in order to make his dream come true. A dream that over the months has become increasingly challenging and multifaceted, given that from NES it passed on to PC, and from a simple ~remake~ it turned into a cauldron of 80s pop culture quotes, while remaining faithful to the initial aesthetics with chiptune and pixel art. Ten years later it finally landed on our screens, starting right from the PC market, so overflowing with references to childhood that it cannot avoid warming the hearts of editors and players who grew up listening to Ghostbusters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Super Mario, Contra, Return to the Future and... that's all, because we had to draw up a list of all the quotes present on Retro City Rampage, whether they are a scene, a text, a part of the gameplay or a simple hill, we simply would not finish anymore. Retro City Rampage DX, or the colorful dark beyond the quotes The 3D effect This time we have little to say about 3D, since it hasn't been included. Not bad, it doesn't mean that it would have improved the experience, and above all this DX version has been refined in many aspects compared to the original, from the controls to the management of the checkpoints, much more substantial aspects. More than a 3D effect, at least in this case, we should talk about a mitigating 3DS effect. Satire in video games Put bluntly, the Retro City Rampage quotes are candy for nostalgia, for the most part devoid of real value, be it satirical or playful. Perhaps the most successful is precisely that of Contra, a reinterpretation of the classic in all respects, harnessed in the crazy and nonsense context characteristic of the entire product. For the rest they are winks and nothing more. Nothing to do, for example, with the bivalent intelligence, both textual and interactive, of a work like Conker's Bad Fur Day, quantitatively less rich, but decidedly more decisive, coherent, profound. This does not mean that the continuous virtual hugs with the public of the same age are not appreciable, far from it, but they have no value in and of themselves and for this reason they cannot be considered merits in an absolute sense, much less can they be expected to justify by themselves the (long) adventure proposed by the game, which in itself, stripped and stripped of all these excesses of love (or cunning, you see), is nothing more than a two-dimensional, weakened and pixel art version of GTA, extremely repetitive in the missions and with a tangled storyline. Speaking of the game, we finally got there, you take control of The Player, a character who can boast a rich arsenal to throw at anything you want, especially people and cars, and is very skilled, lo and behold, in steal vehicles of various kinds, from motorcycles to police cars. Yes, a police that will come after you after each violence, but that you can repay this time with the sound of lead, blowing up cops and vans. This happens both in free mode, a real outlet of violence until death arrests you, and in the ~story~, which in addition to exploration guarantees a huge slew of missions. Objectives that almost always boil down to ~get from point A to point B~, essentially repetitive tasks (with appreciable self-irony on the subject) and extremely difficult. The Nintendo 3DS version, perhaps to accommodate portable gaming, offers a greater number of checkpoints: a welcome introduction, which makes the adventure more fluid. In general, the two real strengths of the game are the controls, reactive even if not very refined, and the high level of challenge. Artistic tribute The other fields in which Retro City Rampage has been extolled are the alleged graphic and musical quality. On the second we have only positive reviews, notable songs and evocative sounds of the time, not lost in nostalgia alone, which prove to be fun and epic if necessaryiches as and more than modern OSTs - after all, it would be enough to listen to the soundtrack of Mega Man 2 to realize the still remarkable potential of these sounds. More than two hours of great chiptune compositions, listenable on the radio in GTA style, created by three skilled musicians: perhaps we can find the bridge that separates the visual component from the sound in this last detail. Provinciano took care of the level design, story, dialogues and even, except for aids and final revisions, of the graphic aspect. Field in which it does not denote any obvious talent, given that in itself pixel art is not an added value, quite the contrary. And stylistically Retro City Rampage is an abyss away from such a wonderful little thing as Cave Story, to present relevant recent examples. And if the justification was that it was a coherent choice to remain faithful to the NES aesthetic, well, even in that case it should be emphasized that, apart from the amount of elements on the screen, had it been released at the time it would probably have gone unnoticed. or in any case it could not have competed with the marvels offered by Super Mario Bros 3, Contra or Mega Man, nor with the ~minor~ Uforia, The New Zealand Story, and many other titles, which although little known, offered unique and originals. A lot could have been done in the visual sphere, given the nature of the project, but Provinciano's graphic incapacity or recklessness meant that everything resulted in an anonymous 80s look, decorated by an overflowing opulence of characters and cars cohabiting the screen.", "date": "2014-03-06", "grade": "6.7"}
