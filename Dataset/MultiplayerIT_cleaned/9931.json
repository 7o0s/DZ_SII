{"name": "Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78720-magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-il-grimorio-sulla-scrivania.html", "text": "Let's start immediately by saying that the rules, the feeling and the objectives of Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalker are therefore the same as the magnificent hobby created almost 20 years ago by Richard Garfield for Wizards of the Coast. Two powerful wizards called Dimension Walkers battle each other using a deck of 60 cards each, at a minimum, made up of lands, spells, and creatures. Each land (there are five types) produces mana, or energy through which it is possible to summon our army, spells and artifacts. Each player has 20 life points, and of course whoever resets his opponent's energy first wins. The rules are simple to learn, but the quantity of cards (on which the criteria for use and characteristics are always specified) and their diversity means that each player can create his own winning strategy: faster and more defensive decks, or slow and powerful, or even sets of cards that focus more on spells. All the charm of a game of Magic is beautifully reproduced on screen. A real pity, however, not being able to create your own library from scratch (this is the name of the deck), but having to choose between pre-established sets of various colors and tactical nature. Following the single player story mode, through which we have to face various challenges, however, up to 17 special cards can be unlocked per deck, which can be inserted or removed from our personal library. There is therefore the possibility of customizing, but it is still very limited and does not leave us the freedom to be able to eliminate some excessively useless cards from the basic set. Rather annoying problem when we find ourselves having an entire side deck unlocked: inserting it into the deck without being able to eliminate other cards only leads to the weighting of the library also in consideration of the fact that land cards are automatically inserted by the computer based on the number of creature cards and spells. Tap the card, untap the card The developers didn't want to compete directly with Magic Online by replicating its peculiar and complex structure that allows you to buy cards just like in reality; for this reason they undertook to find the right compromise that would allow them to be able to play with the classic Magic rules, while leaving the player with a minimum of customization of the deck without overwhelming him with options or leaving him excessively free perhaps with the risk of making him feel lost. The number of digitized cards contained in the game is not very high: they are around 500; decidedly few considering that in reality there are several thousand. The goal of Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalker is obviously not to collect cards. The game is instead an excellent attempt to make the fun and the heart of its ~gameplay~ fast and accessible to all, giving players a small number of cards (and therefore rules) to learn and know how to handle. As in any card game, the luck component is obviously very important. Precisely because Magic is a customizable card game, it is therefore essential to make good use of those 17 extra cards to insert as we please, because they will be the ones to make the difference between a standard set and a modified and enhanced set. The game has an online mode with personalized and ranked matches, but there is no option that replicates the organization of a tournament between several people: it would have been simple enough, perhaps also introducing the possibility of seeing opponents' matches in real time. The intelligence of the CPU is decidedly cunning, and sometimes one gets the impression that it is served by chance in a far too benevolent way, noticing a perfect balance between the output of land cards and artifact / creature cards. For this reason the game is not immediately easy, but it will be necessary to work hard to complete the single player mode. The choice of inserting a local cooperative multiplayer mode is excellent, which allows two people to challenge as many computer-controlled players, or to play up to 4 people online. The use of the mouse to manage the controls is immediate and very functional as it was legitimate to expect from this type of game but it is always possible to use a keyboard to have access to some essential shortcuts, above all the pause and it is also possible to use a Xbox 360 pad. The challenges are always fluid and pleasant, just as if we were sitting at the table at home, playing in the company of a good old friend with cards in hand. The cards in the case Duels of the Planeswalker in the PC version follows in an absolutely faithful way the counterpart for the Microsoft console. I earlnuti are the same even if, at the moment, limited only to the basic version without the two expansions already released on Xbox 360, the first of which, Wizards of the Coast has already announced, is practically in the pipeline. On the one hand it is certainly a limitation that stands out, in particular because it is hardly justifiable, on the other it has allowed us to keep the price of the game low which, we remind you, is available exclusively in digital delivery version on Steam for  8.99. Even from a technical point of view it is not possible to notice any noteworthy differences, apart from a slightly improved graphic cleaning also thanks to the support of higher resolutions. It is also essential to point out a fair amount of graphic options available to the player that allow a good customization of what appears on the screen so as to meet older systems. However, it is necessary to report some sporadic slowdowns of very short duration that occurred with the test system and which seem to be due to some engine optimization problems being completely independent of the actions being done in the game.", "date": "2010-07-02", "grade": "7.5"}
