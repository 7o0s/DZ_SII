{"name": "Crazy Taxi 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-taxi-3_a.html", "text": "What a hard job the taxi driver.. Anyone who has never tried any of the Crazy Taxis will probably wonder what's funny about chasing customers through the streets of a city but they probably don't know that Crazy Taxi is not exactly the simulation of the perfect taxi driver. Unless you live in cities called West Coast, Glitter Oasis or Small Apple, it will be very difficult to find flaming yellow taxis that make their way through city traffic by jumping on other cars or even on the roofs of buildings, running over any object you find on the route or perhaps pointing straight towards groups of people with the vain intention of running over them... however, all of this becomes reality in Crazy Taxi! Despite the variations on the theme, even in this Crazy Taxi 3 we will have to do the work for which we are paid and bring eccentric customers to their destination in the shortest possible time. The equation less time = more money is still valid but fortunately we will still find some special effects to help us which, combined with our skills behind the wheel, will allow us to earn a loaf but above all to have fun. We then find the Crazy Hop (a high jump worthy of KITT's best evolutions in the Supercar TV series), the Crazy Drift (instantaneous U-turn) and the Crazy Dash (irresistible burning acceleration). Let's get into the game Moving on to the actual game, we realize that there aren't many new things being heralded and, indeed, how Crazy Taxi 3 is simply a porting of Crazy Taxi 2 to XBox with some appreciable improvements. To begin with, the control system has undergone a finishing work that makes driving cars easier and more precise and you don't imagine this is important in such a frenetic game. The other novelties are limited to the addition of a new city, new mini-games, some of which are very entertaining, and slight graphic tweaks. In fact, not much seems to have changed either as regards the aspect of the game which seems to move with greater fluidity but which is all too reminiscent of what was seen on the Dreamcast. From the XBox one would expect more, much more. The most positive aspect is certainly represented by the graphics engine of the game, now almost completely free from slowdowns and only in some cases affected by pop-up defects. The sound is instead of the first level, thanks to the songs of Off Spring, Citizen Bird and Bad Religion that offer a musical accompaniment that is always pressing and engaging. The playability has remained the same as the previous episodes and this is certainly not to be considered a defect as the gaming experience is very entertaining. The only problem is that this fun probably won't last forever as Crazy Taxi 3 does not have a very long level of challenge and is not always able to provide variations on the theme. Big bill for Crazy Taxi? Although it is not entirely original, Crazy Taxi 3 retains all the characteristic aspects that have made it successful in the past: lots of frenzy, fun and a healthy dose of madness that never hurts if taken in moderation. It is more than probable that those who have already played the previous chapters will struggle to find any attraction in Crazy Taxi 3, for all the others it is instead an almost unmissable purchase. Old or new, original or not, Crazy Taxi 3 is in fact the best of the series, perhaps too similar to its predecessors, but still able to excite as much and more than before. Pros: It's Crazy Taxi! Simple, fun, frantic... Something new... Cons: ...but not too many XBox can do better Materials US Version Review Preview Image Gallery Tricks Movies Crazy Taxi... and they are 3! Sega's crazy taxi drivers are back to work... save whoever can! I confess that I have been waiting with great interest for this Crazy Taxi 3 but finally my patience has been rewarded with a third episode of the craziest series ever to land on consoles, this time exclusively on XBox, which seems to have all the credentials to become the best of all. Hitmaker has promised us renewed graphics and above all smoother and faster (finally!), a new city, and many small changes that should improve the gaming experience and it seems that at least these promises have been kept. But will all this be enough to make Crazy Taxi 3 a worthy successor to the first 2 acclaimed episodes? The answer a few lines below...", "date": "2002-10-08", "grade": null}
