{"name": "9 Years of Shadows", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/9-years-of-shadows-recensione.html", "text": "Available from March 27, 2023 for PC and Nintendo Switch, 9 Years of Shadows is the first game of the newborn Mexican team Halberd Studios who, as a first project, decided to go back and propose a work clearly inspired by Castlevania, also receiving support by Michiru Yamane, composer who worked on the aforementioned Konami series, and by Norihiko Hibino, who instead took care of the music for Metal Gear Solid. Obviously looking only at the past is not enough and you must always find a way to say something original and personal. Did Halberd Studios make it? Find out in our review of 9 Years of Shadow. Europe and Apino Europa and Apino are the characters but they are also our weapons of attack We are Europe, a young woman who nine years earlier lost her parents following the arrival of a curse that stole the world's colors. The girl has trained to find her own way and is finally right to the immense castle known as Talos where the source of the curse is located. There, however, she is immediately attacked by a monster who is impossible to defeat, Belial, and in her escape she is saved only thanks to Apino, a spirit who resides inside a teddy bear. Apino protects her and also restores the colors inside the castle. The story of Europa and Apino is a classic journey that uses action and fighting to tell the story of life's difficulties and how suffering always threatens to overwhelm us. The castle also has its own mythology, which you can discover if you find a series of giant crystals that tell the story. Overall, however, 9 Years of Shadow struggles to convince from a narrative point of view, often proving to be quite trivial and with various characters not in depth, complete with an Alucard-like character who appears a bit out of nowhere and doesn't have much interesting to say . The setting is a little more interesting, which in an unlogical but certainly satisfying way is divided into various very different areas, with poisoned gardens, lakes, magmatic areas and not only all inside the castle. In purely artistic terms, the Mexican team has done a good job, especially with certain backdrops that are extremely detailed: over the years the style of the game has changed several times as you can see from the development diaries, but the final result is excellent. Even bosses and mini-bosses always have unique visual designs, a pity instead for the common enemies that repeat themselves a lot, a problem that also affects gameplay, since soon there will be nothing new ready to test us. Also, most of the enemies are not very aggressive and fall within a few hits. The problem is also the combat system, which in common clashes is not very interesting since in addition to a single combo and a loaded attack there is not much else available. We do have dodging, but only backwards and without invulnerability, so don't expect to dart between enemy shots while looking for an opening to attack. Europa has a series of shapes/armor associated with various colors (with a design clearly inspired by the Knights of the Zodiac), necessary to unlock locks of the same color or to inflict more damage on enemies, based on the aura around them. Unfortunately this mechanic is not very interesting in common clashes, especially as soon as we have boosted Apino a little, which is our weapon from a distance. The spirit is very powerful and allows you to face multiple clashes from a safe place, so as to bring down the enemy without putting yourself at risk. Most enemies stand in one spot and repeat the only attack available to them The team tried to balance this mechanic by tying it to Europa's shield: the girl has two life points, but the damage is absorbed by the shield first. If this is zero, however, a couple of shots are enough for game over. Attacking with Apino consumes the shield, so you have to be careful, but it is possible to recharge it by holding down a key for a few seconds or with a QTE (not simple but not impossible either). In boss fights the mechanics work because the time available is limited and you have to act judiciously, but in normal fights you can safely stay at a distance and torment your enemies without worry. Considering the lack of variety of common enemies, on average the clashes are not very interesting: it weighs a lot since the enemies reappear simply by changing the area and it is only rarely possible to climb them without a fight. Exploratory powers The Theater is the place where we will be able to power up and meet in NPCs 9 Years of Shadow is proposed as a sort of metroidvania, but you have to understand how you aream used this term. In just over eight hours of play we completed the adventure, with a completion percentage close to 100%. It is a game of small size, given the genre, and the design of the areas also reflects this. 9 Years of Shadow offers a series of new powers from phase to phase that allow you to advance along the levels. What is missing is the need to backtrack, as you can pretty much get everything on the first go. If you are precise and attentive, you can complete the game as if it were a single linear adventure, without having to go back even once. Europa's powers are used almost exclusively to continue in the new area and you can't really decide where to go. Exploration is minimal and the few secrets present are linked to some walls to be knocked down (they are very obvious and often marked on the map) to find a room with a reward, or an object necessary to enhance the life or attack of Europa. Most enemies don't do much else than wait to be destroyed in one hit At least, in the later stages the level design becomes a little more interesting. At the beginning the linearity is extreme and you only have to do a few fights and jump on a couple of platforms, but once we get the armor we will unlock additional movement capabilities, complete with alternative forms such as the mermaid to swim in water, the snake to passing through tunnels that often become microlabyrinths or the phoenix that makes us ride currents of hot air and more. The platform component is actually the most important element of 9 Years of Shadow, even if it will never be too complex. The bosses themselves above all require you to understand the attack pattern, avoid all the blows by hopping between platforms and using the various armor powers and then when the enemy stops inflicting as many blows as possible. For those looking for a game in which you actually have to ~fight~, 9 Years of Shadow is not the right choice: most of the time is spent staying out of reach and moving around the arena. Let me be clear, it manages to be pleasant or even fun for the most part in a couple of situations, but overall we are talking about an unbalanced game, with little content and some elements that are clearly underused, such as the colors of the armor that only in a few boss fights you really need to use them all to gain an advantage. Honorable mention instead for the soundtrack, always pressing that pushes us to run as fast as we can towards the new goal, giving us the charge.", "date": "2023-04-20", "grade": "6.5"}
