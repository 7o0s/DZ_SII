It is obviously the planet on which Red Faction: Guerrilla takes place, otherwise we would not have even mentioned it, and it must be said that the developers of Volition Inc. have excellently reproduced the desolation of the landscape, nothing but hostile rocks and red sand, everywhere around us. It's actually a choice that gets a little tiring in the long run, but this is Mars: rocks and dust. And various buildings and technological structures in which colonists of Mars live and work, but also the Earth Defense Maybe, which by dominating has made a lot of enemies, primarily the rebels of the Red Faction. We, in the role of Alec Mason, will find ourselves allied with this clandestine movement to wipe out the EDF and avenge our brother, killed in action at the beginning of the game. A somewhat dull plot, seasoned with flat characters and predictable developments: in short, a simple pretext to tie together the various missions of the game, all in the name of demolition. Therapeutic destruction The structure of Red Faction: Guerrilla is quite simple, while leaving the player a fair amount of freedom it remains quite linear: the main missions assigned by the Red Faction to our alter ego have the aim of weakening the EDF and diminishing its control over the sector of Mars in which we are operating, are definitely the most intriguing and varied, with often quite original gimmicks, from the simple demolition of buildings to the running destruction of transmitters aboard a vehicle, pursued by dozens of enemies. There are also numerous optional quests, all aimed at reducing the influence of the EDF and increasing our fame: the gratitude of civilians will lead them to lend us a hand in the firefights, at the same time we will have to be very careful not to harm our allies or presumed such to avoid becoming a little too unpopular. The side missions are quite similar to each other: destruction of plants and buildings or support for rebels attacked by the EDF in completely random places and times. The third-person shot follows Alec Mason smoothly, allowing us to have a broad and precise vision of the surrounding environment: the simple and intuitive controls allow us to jump, move, run and hide with the pressure of a few keys; as a result the firefights become frenetic and fun, full of possibilities also thanks to the considerable variety of weapons that can be obtained and upgraded, interchangeable on the fly by interacting on the directional cross. But despite all the weapons available, one will be enough to carry out the main tasks assigned to us by the Red Faction: the big hammer. This simple tool is capable of causing unimaginable devastation because the main feature of Guerrilla is the total destructibility of every building in the game. And it's at the player's discretion: you can pounce on a farmhouse and start tearing down all the walls, or hit that single, realistic point that is the cornerstone of the whole structure. A couple of hits, and an entire building will collapse in front of you. There are no pre-calculations, it's all in real-time: the routine programmed by Volition Inc. means that each building can be destroyed in different ways and consequently collapse. Bridges, towers, vehicles - everything falls apart when hit by hammer blows, controlled explosives, rockets, lasers and more. A tasty element that among other things fits perfectly into the pure action gameplay of Guerrilla, a well-placed bomb is enough to bring down a bridge under the feet of our pursuers, leading them to certain death. A building full of EDF guards will kill them all, if you aim for the pillars, destroying them before your opponents can escape. A devastation under the complete control of the player, even in multiplayer mode: the online component of Guerrilla is well structured even before playing, full of options to customize your games, and proves to be a fun pastime between one mission and another. sometimes exhilarating. The proposed game modes, for up to sixteen players, are variants of the classic one-on-all or team deathmatch or the typical Capture-the-Flag. In addition, Volition Inc. has studied rather atypical modalities in which it is necessary not only to demolish, but also to rebuild some buildings, leveraging teamwork and an intriguing strategic component. Considering the destructive implications of the gameplay, which are combined with some bonuses that guarantee invisibility, temporary levitation or more, Guerrilla's online mode is definitely a plus.Playstation 3 trophies Red Faction: Guerrilla offers 51 trophies, of which 5 Silver and 3 Gold. The easier ones are aimed at completing a part of the primary and secondary game missions, others at raising morale in some sections. Finally, several are dedicated to online mode, such as playing together with a player who has already completed the game rather than playing at least one game on all the game's maps. You can't have everything in life As already mentioned, Mars doesn't exactly offer a great deal of visual variety and consequently our wanderings through the Guerrilla colonies certainly won't surprise us since most of the locations tend to look a bit too similar. The designers of Volition Inc. wanted to tread realism and therefore Mars appears to us like this, naked and raw, without infamy or praise. At least the pop-up has been masked by hills and rises that often obscure our view of the horizon. On the other hand, the buildings and structures scattered almost everywhere reveal a truly realistic architecture: their destruction is made even more spectacular by the routines that carefully manage their physics, making the vision of each demolition truly satisfying, between explosions , metal sheets and clouds of dust. Maybe some people just don't find the simple collapse of a building funny, but the way Volition inc. manages to reproduce it in Guerrilla is very commendable. Thumbs down instead for the flat and aseptic design of the various vehicles and rare mechs that you can steal and drive, as well as the characters, starting with the protagonist Alec, truly anonymous and aesthetically banal. Even on the sound side we remain perplexed: sloppy and unconvinced dubbing (in English, subtitles in Italian instead), dull and repetitive music. But needless to say the sound of collapses and explosions is bloody convincing.", "date": "2009-06-12", "grade": "7.8"}
