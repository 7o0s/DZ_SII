Akira Toriyama's most famous creature has experienced a video game impasse which in reality only partially made itself felt, thanks to the incredible power of the most famous shonen in the world to still attract players of all ages for the mere fact of being able to dress role of Goku and company and perform a devastating Kamehameha. Paradoxically, it was necessary to redo one of the most popular stories ever to be able to draw new vigor from it: in fact, with the Dragon Ball Xenoverse series, the guys from Dimps made us go back in time to relive the most important events of the saga below a new light. The idea was more than good, but the implementation was a bit immature both in terms of the combat system and in terms of managing the game world and its activities. We immediately anticipate that with Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 the Japanese software house has treasured the many criticisms that have arisen in recent years, managing to fill most of the gaps in the first chapter, but unfortunately leaving some unresolved. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 improves the first chapter from all points of view Back from the future Like all self-respecting sequels, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 also follows the winning formula of the first chapter by proceeding on the path of a different and somewhat original approach to storytelling compared to the story already told dozens of times in all sauces. It's been two years since Demigra's defeat, but a new evil duo is using their own ruse by tampering with the timelines, this time aided by other characters from the Dragon Ball feature films including Tarles and Slag. As members of the Temporal Patrol, we will once again find ourselves facing a dangerous threat that modifies the most important events of the past to destroy the present of peace and serenity achieved by the inhabitants of Conton City, the new city that serves as the game's hub. So what would have happened if Raditz had managed to dodge Piccolo's Makankosappo at the last moment and Goku had sacrificed himself in vain? What if Nappa and Vegeta turned into apes destroyed the Earth? To answer these questions we have to take on the role of a character of our own created from scratch through the editor before starting the game. The parameters to choose from are very similar to those of the first Xenoverse, with five available races that differ in types of skills and statistics: the small and resilient Earthlings, the powerful Saiyans with their numerous transformations, the Nameccans, the aliens from lineage of Frieza and the soft Majins. There are also various aesthetic customizations to give more character to your virtual alter ego such as the hairstyle, the color of the skin and the clothes, some facial features and a handful of accessories; just a few more options than in the previous chapter, but nothing more. There is also the possibility of transferring the data of the previous character who, however, will not take part in the adventure but will limit himself to a few fleeting appearances in the company of Trunks, assuming the role of the great hero that everyone adores and to whom a statue has also been dedicated holographic in the city center. The progression of the story is entrusted to the old Kaioh who from time to time together with the Kaiohshin of Time will send us to a different era to face one or more enemies to defeat. The missions all consist of multiple acts, each of which coincides with major changes in the scenario of the encounter. A one-on-one fight can quickly escalate into a heated brawl if Jeeth and Guldo are joined by the other members of the Geniew Squad, or a complete change of setting could occur as in the case of the battle against Frieza in which the planet Namek is devastated below in our eyes. All the scenes are accurately reproduced and highly evocative, inevitably bringing fans back to the manga tables or to the images of the anime from which the sequence is inspired. Despite this, participating in the action in the guise of a new mysterious warrior who comes from the future to help the noble protagonists remains highly intriguing, even if in the end many events overlap with what has already been seen in the first Xenoverse. Supreme Techniques When it comes to throwing hands,Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 marks a substantial leap forward compared to its predecessor, which particularly suffered from an unrefined control system for a fighting game. The response to the commands has now improved, the action flows fluid and overwhelming shaped by spectacular combos made by devastating kicks, punches, sprints and special moves that chain together seamlessly thanks also to the granite 60 frames per second. The vast and well-characterized arenas offer the possibility of fighting freely on the ground or floating in the sky, favoring high-speed movement and pursuits with the possibility of escaping the enemy to catch your breath and recover some energy. Once familiar with the commands and skills, the on-screen show will be very satisfying for all fans of Toriyama's anime: the feeling of power that comes from the supreme techniques is remarkable, as well as that of the most devastating energy waves capable of exalt and excite despite being introduced only by a very short loading sequence. If at first sight this choice might seem to be detrimental to the show, in reality it allows the Xenoverse 2 gameplay not to lose pace and rise even more strongly from the panorama of botched tie-ins, confirming itself as a rich and complete three-dimensional fighting game, capable not only to satisfy Dragon Ball lovers, but also those looking for a fun, immediate and satisfying, yet not trivial combat system. Dimps has worked a lot on the balance by retouching the attacks and special skills which, as in the past, consume vigor or aura, even though some techniques are still inevitably more effective than others. Thanks to the renewed collision system, exchanges of blows in flight are much more enjoyable than in the past, even if a general uncertainty remains with opponents located at a certain distance who sometimes do not get hit by long-range attacks despite being locked on. The melee clashes, the real problem of the first chapter, are decidedly more manageable; in this case the only limit is given by a still too problematic management of the camera which sees the shot quickly splash from one side to the other when the battle moves near imposing obstacles such as mountains or city structures. Likewise in the clashes with giant enemies such as Vegeta and Nappa transformed into apes, the target locking system is too confusing and we had a lot of difficulty directing our blows on the tail of the two Saiyans, the only weak point to put an end to their destructive fury. Playstation 4 trophies There are 50 trophies in Dragon Ball: Xenoverse 2 with 36 bronze trophies, 11 silver, 2 gold and platinum crowning the collection. It doesn't seem very difficult to conquer them all as long as you invest dozens of hours in completing primary and secondary missions and unlock all the characters, costumes and abilities. Quests for all tastes Although the basic structure of the game is the same, Dimps has increased the content and fixed numerous problems that we did not quite go down in the first chapter. The main missions are obviously the core of the experience, but diving headlong into them will prove unprofitable as the difficulty level rises rapidly due to increasingly longer battles and opponents who evolve or reach their final form when they evolve - see the duo Frieza and Cooler - give a lot of trouble. On the other hand Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is not only a successful fighting game, but also a valid RPG and the growth of our virtual alter ego is an integral part of the gaming experience. By completing missions, whether you win or lose, you earn experience points and level up, also receiving points to spend on improving your character's main stats. These can also be improved through the costumes, some exclusive to the classes while others can be used by any character: for example, we can also make our Namek character wear Saiyan clothes, drawing an increase in health and power of the basic attacks at the expense of aura shots and force. Fortunately we will no longer have to face the same mission repeatedly in the hope of finding useful rewards as happened in the first chapter, but upon completing each assignment we already know in advance what will be added to our inventory between new costumes and unlocked skills. It therefore becomes natural to get lost in the dozens of side missions that are entrusted to us by a plethora of random and famous characters scattered throughout Conton City. It starts from the individual workouts - a sort of advanced tutorial that unlocks the supreme techniques of the characters who are our masters - up to real side quests that develop with greater consistency. The latter are not accessible directly from the city but concern places in the past where there have been strong temporal anomalies that we must resolve as soon as possible. A trick that allows us to revisit historical places in the Dragon Ball series otherwise not accessible in the temporal era of Xenoverse 2: for example we can go to Namek to help the Elder Sage defend his people, or infiltrate the ranks of Freeza by climbing the hierarchy of his army to the sound of clashes, or even join the team of Great Saiyaman becoming true champions of justice. Then there are other types of less demanding missions that wink at the historical fans of the series, including the milk deliveries organized by Krillin, the search for food for the insatiable Majin Buu who wants to start a family and the various tasks entrusted to us by Mr. Satan to test our tenacity. In short, many small gimmicks and diversions that greatly enrich the contents of the title. All mine the city! Such an overflowing offer was only possible thanks to the new city, much better than the old Toki Toki City fiercely criticized by the gamer community. Conton City is seven times larger than the previous one, is much better structured and can be freely explored thanks to the hoverboard to be used while waiting to take the flight license. To keep us company we find up to 300 non-player characters who, in case of connection to the servers, become the avatars of other online players. A very large gaming hub, therefore, but also well organized with the shops taking center stage together with the reception area: here it is possible to organize multiplayer matches and put together one's own team for cooperative missions, practically ~incursions~ into miniature in which to fight together with six other players against gigantic bosses. Then there are a series of peripheral districts that are divided by type of proposed activity, such as for example the Orange High School in which the tutorials are concentrated or the Kaiohshin of Time building where to accept the main missions. Overlooking the city is the altar of the Seven Dragon Balls, but there are other places that symbolize Dragon Ball such as the Capsule Corporation, Master Roshi's Kame House and the World Martial Arts Tournament stadium, the attraction main for PvP. In multiplayer, in addition to our character created for the campaign, there are over sixty characters to be progressively unlocked: starting from the classics of Dragon Ball Z, passing through Dragon Ball GT and animated films, up to the Super series currently in production by Toei Animation . Where provided there are also all the mutations and evolutions of the case, dramatically expanding the park of wrestlers that can be used in clashes; pity that important faces such as Doctor Gero, Baby Vegeta and Uub continue to be missing. On a technical level, the various areas of the Conton City do not excel in quality and richness of detail, but thanks to the cel shading and the bright colors, the glance is always pleasant and in line with that of the anime. Greater care has been placed in the polygonal models of the wrestlers, painstakingly made also with regard to costumes and accessories, and really perfectly animated. The same goes for the effects of light and the particles of the various energy waves and supreme techniques capable of catapulting us directly into the anime. A small regret remains for the locations of the clashes still lacking in details and only marginally destructible despite the devastating power of our most spectacular shots.", "date": "2016-10-25", "grade": "8.2"}
