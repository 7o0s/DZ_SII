This word can sum up the initial impact of Spring 1999 when the first Superbike came out, given that the graphic aspect was one of those that dislocate your jaw! A graphic detail of those levels had never been seen in a ~homemade~ game, with very detailed pilots (thanks to a higher than average number of polygons) and amazing textures, astride even better cared for motorbikes! Obviously, even the backdrops were no different and trees, houses, stables and all those elements that make up part of the videogame package for this kind of games made with this type of game had never been seen in a PC (and 32-bit console) motorbike game. class. However, Milestone knew that a graphics engine not up to such visual beauty would have turned all the dreams of motorcycling enthusiasts into the worst nightmares, if everything moved with a number of fps equal to the fingers of a hand, but still once these fantastic Italian programmers did not fail to amaze us: the excellent graphic engine was very scalable, so 5 minutes were enough to find the right compromise between graphic resolution, details and fluidity, obtaining an average of about thirty even on medium-powered machines of frames per second with the graphic detail at least at discrete levels. The 2000 edition, considered a simple update as an annual EA habit, practically amazed everyone by presenting simply excellent motion capture animations (certainly even more believable than those of the previous edition), decidedly more refined tracks and bikes and better artificial intelligence , since perhaps it was the only field where he felt that he could do even better. An absolute novelty was the inclusion of the head-to-head mode via split screen, with a loss of detail and fluidity that was all in all acceptable (only for powerful PCs anyway). But if Sbk2000 is so beautiful graphically what could Milestone do with the 2001 edition of their little gem? They just made it even better! The pilots are composed of roughly the same number of polygons as the previous edition and the quality of the textures is still excellent, but try to see how many more animations they have now (especially with all the movements and gestures they are able to perform) ! The detail has increased a little everywhere while maintaining the excellent fluidity of the prequels unchanged, always taking into account those who do not have ninja PCs. One thing that was missing before has finally been added: rain! Attention, we are not talking about cloudy weather or wet tracks but real rain, also done pretty well (it is not easy to make rain in an excellent way), which takes the graphic quality to very high levels! Still not convinced? Try playing using the dashboard view (one of 8 available) or admire the beautiful refraction on the track, not to mention the aforementioned magnificent animations of the pilots when they fly off due to an accident or when they show off their repertoire of gestures. I conclude on the graphic side by telling you that to play with this pearl you will need (box and manual in hand) at least a P 266, 32 mb of ram and a 4 mb video card; the recommended requirements settle on a P2 350, 64 mb of ram and 8 mb accelerated video card; the undersigned tested the game with a P3 500, 256 mb of ram and G 400 Max, obtaining an almost perfect fluidity with all the details at the maximum at 800x600, provided you play with 13 opponents and no more, given that with 25 opponents on screen, Sbk2001 certainly can't guarantee hair-raising speed! As far as audio is concerned, the music is catchy but certainly not beautiful, and the speech is reduced to the bone; these are not the important things in the sound section, since the roars of the engines are excellent and if, like me, you use an S.B. Live, you will enjoy it all with the beauty of Creative's EAX sound system. Playability and longevity Sbk offered 2 very distinct game modes, one distinctly Arcade and the other decidedly simulation. The first for coin-op fanatics like Sega's Super Hang-on or Namco's Suzuka 8 hours since, unlike the other mode, the setting of essential parameters typical of simulations was not important in this one. Sbk 2000, and now the 2001 edition, eliminates the distinction between these 2 game modes, making the game even more customizable than the prequel through various levels of difficulty and the presence of numerous functions that can be activated or deactivated as desired by the usernte: you can insert or not the assistance brake, accelerator, the automatic movements of the pilot, complete accidents, damage to the motorbike and a whole series of rules, such as the false start. From the point of view of the game modes, we point out the presence of the ~Training~ mode now available as a type of game in its own right, not within other modes, complete with a tutorial that can be activated via pause. These choices make Sbk 2001 appreciable both for the user who doesn't want to redo the damned curve 100 times that always makes us lose control of our Honda or for anyone who has to test his Ducati at least 50 times on a certain route before deciding its final structure, thus making it usable by anyone, without distinction. Previously there was talk of present modes, so after the aforementioned ~practice~ mode, we have the championship (with the teams, tracks and drivers updated to the 2000 season) and the ~classic~ single race, while on the multiplayer side we have the aforementioned split -screen and Internet and Lan modes via tcp/ip up to 6 players (even if the box shows 8, but with very poor performance). It must be said that the artificial intelligence is discreet but once again it is not excellent and if you play without aids the greatest difficulty will be to keep your vehicle upright! Final considerations In summary, we therefore have 7 motorcycle stables, 13 tracks (3 of which are new), completely customizable playability and excellent longevity guaranteed by the variety of tracks, excellent playability and various game modes with your friends. If you then want to become the perfect masters of your vehicle, you will have to spend a lot of time in the saddle! The purchase is highly recommended to all fans of the genre and not, slightly less if you have the prequel, but if you manage to get rid of it or (like many) want to collect the series, take a seat and ask yourself if Milestone ever in a possible update for 2002 will still be able to improve this little made in Italy masterpiece! Milestone story! Several years ago, when the PC was not yet seen as a gaming machine as is usually done lately, an Italian software house, under the Virgin label, programmed Screamer. This excellent arcade racing game was so successful that it led to an excellent sequel and a spin-off, Screamer rally, which was the direct competition of the PC conversion with the most played coin-op of those times, the legendary Sega Rally by Sega. After a dark period, Virgin loses this talented group of programmers called Milestone who migrates to the number one videogames producer in the West, i.e. the giant Electronic Arts, founded in 1984 by Trip Hawkins (currently boss of 3do studios after the unsuccessful attempt to establish itself in the console market with the very unfortunate 3do). The game that Antonio Farina and his team was preparing, a very accurate motorcycle simulation, then enters the EA sports series and after a fairly substantial delay, Superbike finally comes out in shops arousing unanimous enthusiasm everywhere and thus giving life to a new sports series of the American EA. This excellent release was followed shortly after by the sequel which demonstrated how the franchise could still be improved in terms of the game structure, the options present and, to everyone's amazement, even the graphic detail. Now it's the turn of Superbike 2001, the third release of the Milestone racing game, to enter the field and once again it's a show!", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
