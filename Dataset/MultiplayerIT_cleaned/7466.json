Not content with presenting the simulation side of racing games, Dan Greenawalt, creative director of the team, also oversaw the publication of Forza Horizon, an excellent 2012 foray into the world of arcade racing by Playground Games, a team formed by a group of excellent releases from Codemasters, Bizarre Creations and Black Rock Studios. It was easy to imagine that at the launch of Xbox One there would be a driving game, a very important genre for both the European and American markets, but not a few (including us) were surprised to see that even for this two-year period Forza would not missed the appointment, showing up with a brand new episode. After playing it several times around the world, we finally sat down to play the final version. Back to racing with Forza Motorsport 5 for Xbox One: here is our review! There is to sweat To understand the fundamental difference between the structure of this episode and that of the previous one, the best thing to do is to start from the numbers of cars present, given that we have gone from 500 in 2011 to 200 this year. You understand why as soon as you start moving between the screens: the cars are really well done, made down to the smallest detail with care and a quantity of polygons that was simply not possible before, especially considering that in every race there there are sixteen on the track. The models, according to Turn 10, have all been heavily readapted and with them the study of materials, textures and the many details that animate the bodies, from the doors to the engines passing through the interiors. What Forza Motorsport 5 has in addition is that the Autovista mode - now Forza Vista - or rather the hyper-detailed presentation of the cars by the Top Gear types (with the possibility of walking around them, as in a car showroom, listening to presentations and audio documentaries about the houses and models) is included for every single car in the game, whereas previously it was only included for about twenty-five cars. Fewer models, therefore, but all cared for in the same way, from the compact sports cars to the Formula One cars that are making their debut. The game structure is therefore modeled around the importance given to each one and that the player literally has to sweat, given that the cars are divided into eight classes, each of which is roughly the protagonist of one of the eight championships in which one can participate. Each championship is divided into series, for a total of forty-one, which are in turn divided into multiple races with additional special events ranging from one-on-one competition with Top Gear drivers, to special activities such as racing on a crowded track civilian or street bowling which involves knocking down a set of pins with cars without losing speed. The championships are all available, but the cars to participate in are not available and must be bought according to the credits that are won by placing at three levels: bronze is taken from tenth to eighth place, silver up to fourth and gold if you finish on the podium. You don't have to win anything, you simply have to aim for the best possible placement to get more credits (they increase with the level up of the driver and the affinity with the different car manufacturers) and thus be able to buy better or simply different cars that allow us to participate to other leagues. Cars cost even more than a million credits, starting from 50,000 (a Ferrari from the 80s costs no less than 140,000), and for a race without multipliers, around 6,000 credits are won. Being short of money, one can resort to upgrading and tuning the car and here this episode is certainly not stingy, the opposite if anything. The add-ons are divided into engine, handling, traction, tyres, aerodynamics and conversion of the engine, traction and intake for a total of thirty-one sub-categories which give access to numerous settings in different ways. To go up to a higher category, therefore, instead of saving for a super car, you can work on another one you already own. The other way is to spend the credits that can be bought on the market place with microtransactions and we are sure that they will be widely used by the most impatient to get the most expensive satisfactions. Artificial intelligence? Given that in the first ten hours of play we managed to buy four cars and that, unlike in the past, once a championship is finished you have a bono credits, but no car as a gift (if they won three in the fourth chapter), the way to score more conspicuous prizes is to decrease the driving aids or increase the level of artificial intelligence of the drivatars, or opponents of game. Running increases what is called synchronization of your drivatar with the Microsoft Cloud servers and in practice the game collects information on our driving style which characterizes a virtual driver who runs when we are not connected and who gives us cash prizes , which are collected every day and grow as the driver's level rises, depending on how many races he does and how well he places. The same also happens to the other players and the ones we find on the track are their drivatars who have inherited their style, skills and flaws. Before the game you can decide the skill level of the pilots among eight available and the bonus in credits goes from -10%, if you are really bad, to more than 65%, but already playing at a normal level, with the bonus equal to zero, you he immediately notices that the music has changed compared to the past. It's not just a matter of more tenacity from your opponents, of the fact that you have to work harder to be able to win or to escape from the sandwiches that the riders organize to close a trajectory: it's that the already excellent artificial intelligence in the series takes a further step forward and those rules, or tricks if you like, to which we had become accustomed over years of racing, seem to be worth a little less. Our rivals are faster than us even if they go off the track, if they cut a few corners, if they have behaviors that you wouldn't have expected in similar situations. We don't know how much of this is due to the Cloud for real or better AI routines, but racing in Forza Motorsport 5 is really fun. Then, of course, to win more credits you can act on the driving simulation factors to get up to 60% bonus, inserting a manual gearbox, uncontrolled traction or mechanical damage that also lead to tire or fuel consumption and to break down, making the cars that are impossible to drive (the cars overturn due to the strongest impacts) however, there is still the possibility of going back in time to correct a wrong curve, but in that case the credits won decrease. For those who let themselves be conquered by the driving model, by the pleasure of driving and of collecting cars, Forza Motorsport 5 could turn into a kind of Rocksmith of the steering wheel that spurs them to set ever more difficult parameters to accelerate the conquest of credits through the many races and events. However, the only fourteen settings for the forty-two available tracks must be taken into account, these too diminished like the cars because according to Turn 10 the graphic transition to Xbox One required a lot of work. Seeing the result on the screen is to understand them, but in light of the twenty-six settings and the more than double number of cars in Forza Motorsport 4, this can only be seen as a defect. Online As usual, credits and experience points to level up are also earned online by participating in the playlists of tracks and events divided by car category or by creating ad hoc games in which you can set any parameter for three options screens, from collisions, to damage to the number of laps to the number of drivatars (up to 15 in addition to the driver), the car classes, the rules for victory, the division of the drivers into more or less numerous teams up to the supported driving aids. You can also participate in competitions involving cars of categories that we don't own, renting them with the only deterrent that you will not accumulate credits and experience points. Here too, you can resort to quick upgrade by spending money to properly upgrade one of the cars in our possession. If on the one hand, at least in the current online state, there was no possibility to create Clubs between users, the Rivals modes are back, which allow you to download the ghost tests of online players to challenge them, beat them and win credits with everything a social sprint that will give lifeblood to the Forza Motorsport 5 community. Also for online there is the possibility of taking photos and sharing them and the same can be done with replay videos, but with the possibility of creating your own clips and share them on the internet (we're pretty sure this possibility will go into the background). We can customize the bodies with a thousand colors and shades of paint and, once again, with the popular vinyl editor, which can be shared and which the game suggests, choosing from the most popular (you can vote), every time youand buy a car. If desired, the only flaw is that the system has not been adapted to the new graphics resolution of Xbox One and up close, when playing, the drawings tend to grainy. A joypad in the sunset light The real protagonist of Forza Motorsport 5 is the joypad which joins the renewed physics and the study of tire wear, creating a truly innovative experience in tactile terms. We see that Turn 10 worked closely with Microsoft for the new controller with the vibration distributed between four points, two on the palms and two on the analog triggers. The cars are even heavier, aided as they are by the details of the bodies, and feeling the pad start to vibrate in front when entering a corner, braking by touching a curb to the right with more intensity, and then unloading at the exit makes very pleasant feeling. Every time you change gear, a lighter vibration starts from the triggers and is distributed to the rear, always ~listening~ to the vibrations you can better dose acceleration and braking because the pad vibrates more intensely when you lose control of the car and , if all the aids are removed, we realize that Forza is even more difficult than its predecessors, always with a view to making the game more challenging. The internal view marries again with Kinect's head tracking following the inclination of the pilot's head, optionally, and thus helping to see around curves when drifting. On the technological front, it is known that Forza Motorsport 5 is the only title among the three big ones of the launch to run at 1080p and at 60 frames per second, constant and unshakeable even when there are sixteen cars on the screen with a top view and always with that feeling of speed that made the series famous. What we still don't know is the work done on the lights, which are extremely hot (less well in cloudy England for example, where everything is a little duller) and on the thousands of reflections they produce even inside the cockpits. Noticing the hands, the pilot's helmet and parts of the dashboard, which are reflected on the glass if the sun is in the right position or noticing how the whole backdrop is consistently reflected on the bonnet of the car at that speed and fluidity is truly a show. The backdrops, reflecting the choice of the typology of the almost all track machines, are almost all real circuits and in this sense the Nrburgring is missed. To see details from next gen, you have to go to the Swiss Alps, to the Australian circuit at sunset and, above all to Prague, the only city route in the game and which keeps pace with the others especially for the colors that are released when you pass over to the river that divides the track in two. There are no night races and not even the variable weather conditions, consequently having reached the fifth chapter, moreover on Xbox One, these are shortcomings that it is right to report. The music, as already for the fourth episode, is a light classical commentary that does not disturb the excellent noises of engines and braking.", "date": "2013-11-20", "grade": "8.8"}
