{"name": "Monster Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-jam.html", "text": "The Americans have always had a great passion for engines: they like them huge and extremely powerful (after all, they have always paid less for a gallon of petrol than we pay for a litre...), they like the spectacular aspect of racing and he likes to see cars crash. It is probably to satisfy these tastes that the Monster Jam championship was born, i.e. a series of events in which numerous monster trucks challenge each other in races of a different nature: on the one hand those based on speed and on crossing the finish line first, on the other those based on stunts and total destruction. We've also seen it on television, haven't we? There are these daredevil pilots who shoot at full speed up ramps and wreckage, trying to pull off as many tricks within a time limit, with a judging panel awarding them points at the end. And that's exactly what we're going to do in this mobile reduction made by LemonQuest. Monster Jam doesn't get lost in chatter: once a monster truck has been selected from those available, we will launch ourselves in search of the record score: in fact, to move on to the next stage, it will be mandatory to place first. We will therefore have to pay close attention to the arrangement of objects and vehicles within the track, trying to destroy as many things as possible before crossing the finish line. At the end of the session, a summary screen will show us the rewards for each action performed, calculating the total. The game control system is very particular, we don't know why: our vehicle accelerates by pressing the d-pad up (or the 2 key) and brakes or goes into reverse by pressing the d-pad down (or the 8). While moving forward or backward, you can ~wheelie~ by pressing the left (4) and right (6) buttons, a maneuver that is often necessary to climb some ramps or to better deal with an interactable obstacle. The session is completely free, in the sense that it is possible to stop and go in reverse without problems, with the only obligation to respect a time limit (always plenty). Our truck is equipped with an energy bar that drops when we take damage, in this case when we land badly after a jump or when we collide with one of the numerous explosive cans that are found within each stage. We can recover some of this energy by collecting the wrench icons, but in general we'd better learn the route and establish a strategy. Technically, the game is unfortunately far from spectacular. Apart from the sound, made up of a series of poor quality and rather anonymous MIDI music, Monster Jam's graphics do their job with lots of bass and few trebles. The vehicles are designed in an unobtrusive way and boast a good animation regarding the behavior of the tires and shock absorbers, but the stages are really terrible, full of redundant elements and with an approximate design. Moreover, during the test we experienced an alternation of slowdowns and sudden accelerations, a clear sign of an optimization work done too superficially. To this speech must be added a control system that is anything but immediate, with an arrangement of commands out of the ordinary for this kind of game. PRO It is the official game of the <strong>Monster Jam</strong> championship Good level of challenge Simple and immediate action AGAINST Technically mediocre Linear and without thickness", "date": "2008-10-21", "grade": "S.V."}
