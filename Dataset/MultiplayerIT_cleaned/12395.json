{"name": "Def Jam: Icon - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/def-jam-icon-recensione.html", "text": "Born from an idea that can alternatively be judged as brilliant or completely absurd, the young Def Jam series has enjoyed considerable success in the USA with its first two chapters: on the other hand, the combination of beat'em up and hip- hop certainly could not leave indifferent an audience that literally engulfs every product belonging to the two categories. Now, the EA fighting game arrives on the new generation of consoles with a substantial technical and playful restyling, maintaining a single link with the previous ones: that is, black musicians who give each other a thrashing ... Iconoclast Developed by EA Chicago, Def Jam: Icon differs from the two prequels primarily with regard to the setting and storyline, which the game producers themselves stated they wanted to make more plausible and realistic. We leave it to the reader to judge whether the scenario offered by the previous titles was more credible, with rappers who wrestled in the slums, or the one presented by Icon, which sees the user impersonating a ~jack of all trades~ of a record label engaged in shootings, confrontations with crooked cops, political intrigue, and cordial relationships with hip-hop artists and silicone girls. The fact is that, while in the prequels the setting was all in all compatible with the playful action offered by the products, in Icon the clash between the wrestling matches and such a stereotyped and over the top plot is all too evident. But it's always about beat'em up, so it's not worth putting the EA production on the cross due to the inconsistencies of your scenario; rather, it is necessary to do it to underline the various deficiencies of the game structure, which first of all proves to be orphaned of an appropriate tutorial mode. The strength of Icon is represented by the background music, which dynamically affects the match Iconoclast A serious lack considering both the background of the development team (responsible for the Fight Night series), and the gameplay and control system of Icon, far from intuitive. The commands include high and low attacks with two degrees of power reserved for the four keys of the pad, while the right stick manages grips, special blows and the so-called directional attacks, or moves capable of inflicting considerable damage and momentarily knocking down the opponents. A cumbersome system of blocks and counters instead fits into a ~rock paper and scissors~ style context, with one type of attack neutralizing another and so on. The peculiarity and strength of Icon, however, is represented by the background music, which must be chosen at the beginning of each round and which dynamically affects the match: in essence, each wrestler can vary the accompanying beat with a particular move (performed by characters on screen as a kind of scratching on an imaginary record), thus granting the possibility of inflicting double damage in the presence of one's song. An action that causes not only the spectacular flight of the enemy from one part of the arena to another, but also the equally galvanizing visual reaction of the environment, which destroys itself and changes to the rhythm of the music. A feature, this, which saves the gameplay of Icon from the abyss of mediocrity, given that the basic combat system certainly does not shine in terms of depth and responsiveness. In short, even if technically far from flawless, the brawls of the EA product cannot be denied a considerable choreographic value and a discreet fun factor. Hip hop is dead Def Jam: Icon is basically divided into two main sections, a versus mode for one or two users in which it is possible to impersonate the likes of Big Boi, The Game, Ghostface Killah, Redman, Sean Paul, Ludacris and company, and the so-called Build Your Own Label. In this curious career mode you are first of all called to build your own alter-ego using an editor that is not too complete, and then launch yourself into the little credible story we mentioned at the beginning, in an alternation of cutscenes with obviously scurrilous dialogues, timid managerial phases and badly justified fights. It will therefore happen to fight to defend one's protg from a harassing fan, or to launch a warning to an opposing label, etc. clothes and bling bling worthy of a real gangsta. Evidently diluted as much as I can, the Build Your Own Label mode still proves to be sufficiently engaging and interesting, even if harassed by very frequent and not exactly lightning-fast uploads. However, the real sore points come when playing Icon in two, especially online:Where the EA Chicago title is practically unassailable is in the field of technical realization Hip hop is dead during these sessions, the lack of balance of the combat system is mercilessly exposed, both for the ~rock paper and scissors~ dynamics that we have described previously, and for the evident disparities in terms of effectiveness between a fighting style and the other. If already in the clashes with the CPU the tactic is not part of Icon, in the versus even minimally cerebral gameplay can even prove to be counterproductive, with the benefit of a more casual button smashing. Where, on the other hand, the EA Chicago title is practically unassailable, it is in the field of technical implementation, which is really well made. First of all, the polygonal models of the various characters are cared for down to the smallest details, resulting extremely faithful to the real counterparts, just as the movements of hair and clothes are likely; the animations, on the other hand, are a little less exciting, slightly too ~slow~ and sometimes visibly unrelated to each other. However, an important role in the visual impact of Icon is played by the backdrops, which are not only dynamically influenced by the progress of the music, but which actively intervene in the clashes, offering petrol pumps that explode on contact, cars that run over the wrestlers, lap dancers who kick like horses and so on, with a decidedly effective final result. On the other hand, the task performed by the camera is less successful, which with its rash movements and zooms would like to give pathos to the action but which instead only ends up making some phases all too confusing. Unsurprisingly, finally, the richness of the sound sector should be noted, equipped with numerous tracks that will make every hip-hop enthusiast happy and with vocal samples from the same artists who are the protagonists of the fights. Comment Let's get one thing straight: Def Jam: Icon is a product that plays almost all its cards on the presence of leading personalities from the hip-hop scene and their music, and which therefore inevitably ends up attracting fans of the genre and alienating everyone. the others regardless of its playful qualities. Which, incidentally, are certainly not unforgettable: Icon is an imperfect fighting game, inserted in a context that involuntarily leads to the ridiculous, but nevertheless the EA product still proves to be extremely spectacular and finally enjoyable. A technical sector of good impact then provides the definitive lifeline to a title that has the main fault of being a lot of smoke and little fire.
