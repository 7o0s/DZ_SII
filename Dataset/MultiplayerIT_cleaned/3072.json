{"name": "Crucible", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crucible-recensione.html", "text": "Much was expected from the first Amazon Games title. The funds were there to make something truly memorable, the possibility of enlisting the very best developers as well and even access to technology and servers didn't seem to be a problem. Yet, in its first appearance on the market, Amazon fails the blow by presenting itself with a product with a strong flavor of already seen and lacking all those mechanics that players now take for granted in competitive hero shooters. The Crucible review therefore speaks of a title that arrives on Steam in a rather hasty and decomposed way, forging ahead and forgetting to probe the ground for a few more months through open beta, so as to collect significant feedback. A new game as service to try freely given its free, but will it even be worth your time? Let's try to find out together. Welcome back to Crucible The element that most left us stunned when starting Crucible is that feeling of constant dj-vu. The heroes seem to have already been seen in a thousand other games, the menus have nothing scenic or particularly beautiful from a graphic point of view and even the game modes and the structure of the Season pass perfectly follow what was seen on Fortnite and associates. The main problem of our very cold approach to production therefore comes from here: from not being able to find among the ten heroes available any face that could make us fall in love with this new universe, taken as he is by never wanting to dare even to stay in safe territories. So there is the soldier with an assault rifle, the thug with a minigun, the raccoon with invisibility and poisonous shots and a handful of other heroes that can easily be traced back to other sui generis characters. Inventing something new, nowadays, is certainly not easy but it is also true that if you want to be able to hook your target right away, you need an extra effort in this respect. Nor can this situation be justified with the desire to try something innovative since dozens of other games have already followed the same path in recent years, all of them, among other things, failing more or less miserably. Paragon, for example, crashed for exactly the same reason and if we think that not even an excellent and original design like the one seen on Gigantic managed to save production from oblivion, we really don't see a way out for Crucible, except for total upheavals in the next months. In this case we are not even talking about just personal tastes but about a simple analysis of how the market has responded to similar titles in the more recent past. But what exactly is Crucible and why might it interest you then? It is still a free to play hero shooter, available only on Steam for the moment and devoted to competitive with PvE grafts, in an attempt to make the games more varied. The game comes today with two main modes and a secondary mode in the arcade section, among other things probably the most successful one. The core of the game involves four players facing each other on a fairly large map in an attempt to conquer the hearts of the hives, objects obtainable only after destroying special alien nests from random spawn in the play area whose arrival is timed to give time players to perform other activities in the meantime. Once in the arena, the players will have to coordinate by collecting experience from killing monsters, from conquering extractors but also and above all from killing opponents. Unlike any other MOBA however, there is no shop where you can buy items and upgrades and even the different builds are limited to two or three extra passive skills to choose from. Everything would therefore seem perfect for a superfine balance but it is not like this and often we find indispensable characters in the team and other absolutely useless characters, both as a utility and as a damage output. Another huge problem that the developers will have will be to be able to find a balance between the characters, with a mode aimed at teams of four and a battle royale on the other side which involves clashes only between groups of two players. The single skill is then filed by the common pool of experience points which, just like in Heroes of the Storm, will level up all the players on a team in unison. The basics are missing The thing that left us stunned the most is seeing how in such a game the essential foundations for communication between members of the same team are completely missing. There is no integrated voice chat and there is not even a text chat to converse with your compabout the strategies to adopt. Last but not least, the lack of a mini-map on the screen will continually force you to always open the game map, thus limiting your view of the battlefield, a very uncomfortable solution for a game of this type. There is a ping and indicator system but this too is cumbersome and inaccurate, for an absolutely insufficient global result. Even matchmaking should be reviewed which now matches players completely at random, with differences of dozens of experience levels and without real punishments for those who leave the keyboard during games. With weapon feedback unfortunately things are no better. The amount of damage to the target is never clearly disclosed, with the exception of crits, and there is the exact same depth problem with melee hits already observed in Battleborn. On the other hand, the good thing is the polygonal modeling of the characters, the aliens to defeat and the setting, things that are still marginal in the face of an uninspired level design. All for a single map at our disposal, with random events inside it that do nothing but make a basic strategy superfluous, instead accentuating the need for adaptation, impossible to carry out precisely due to the lack of suitable tools for communication. Fortunately, the game is completely free on Steam and during this pre-season the Battle Pass is offered to you, with the possibility therefore of redeeming skin prizes and tokens so as to play for free essentially indefinitely, spending exclusively on aesthetic elements such as skins, audio or capsules of landing. A poor consolation.", "date": "2020-05-27", "grade": "5.0"}
