The first step was the drop in price of the portable console, followed by the Ambassador program which prevented a few hundred thousand pissed off users from chasing Nintendo bosses with torches and pitchforks. Questionable as it may be, the Ambassador program has demonstrated the intent to make amends from the house of Mario, further evolving into what is a truly unmissable opportunity for all fans of Shigeru Miyamoto's second most famous franchise. Until February 20, 2012, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DSi owners will be able to download the remake of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords for free, specially designed to celebrate the twenty-fifth birthday of the saga. But is it a simple re-proposition or a real gift? We were 4 friends in Hyrule This new edition of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords is not really a remake, in fact, but an enriched port of the original optional multiplayer mode added to the Game Boy Advance version of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Confused? Let's go in order: when Nintendo brought A Link to the Past to the Game Boy Advance in 2003, they thought it well to include a multiplayer mode called, precisely, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords in the cartridge. What was supposed to be a simple mind-chilling bonus was a huge success, leading to the development of a revised and corrected version for the GameCube about two years later. Four Swords basically allowed four players to join forces, controlling four differently colored Links, to solve the usual puzzles and puzzles spread across a series of short levels. It was a truly original vision of the franchise, which has been entirely revived in this new edition with significant changes that make the experience more rewarding, while betraying the limits of Nintendo's foresight. Firstly, needless to say, cables are no longer needed to connect up to four consoles; on the other hand, and this is the reverse of the medal, this Anniversary Edition does not exploit the Internet connection capabilities of the handhelds: the need to be in the immediate vicinity to fully enjoy the level-design of the game is a serious thorn in the side which, again, is grossly overrated. Fortunately, the developers of GREZZO have had the foresight to modify the game so that it is not necessary to play in four, but not even in two or three: the main problem of the original Four Swords was in fact the total absence of a mode single player, a defect that on this occasion has been stemmed, even if not completely, by the possibility of playing alone by controlling two Links simultaneously. The Clone War The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords 25th Anniversary Edition in fact offers a short tutorial and the same levels faced in the original, this time however randomly composed of a certain number of sectors, in order to propose a combination of maps that is almost always different. For better or worse, Four Swords proposes the typical puzzles of the series, which require a certain amount of timing and intuition in the use of the various gadgets, which in this case it is possible to carry one at a time, and in the clash with the enemies that populate Hyrule and its dungeons. Designed for up to four players, the adventure cleverly balances cooperation and competition: each Link's contribution is required to solve the puzzles, but the canonical rupees acquired individually are counted at the end of the level to reward the most cash-hungry player. There's really no reward for this achievement, which basically just adds a layer of competitiveness that makes the games more peppery. The complexity of the riddles and puzzles scales according to the number of participants, so the experience remains more or less intact, even if a bit less chaotic and fun, even if only playing for two. More fascinating, however, is the solution designed for solitary users: in practice the player controls two Links, acting directly on one at a time, and switching from one to the other simply by pressing a back button. By alternating the control of the two Links it is possible to solve all the puzzles, although the experience is clearly more repetitive and at times even a little boring: fortunately, the simple pressure of a key immediately teleports the other Link to our position, relieving the backtracking weight and excessive ripstitions. It is not the only novelty present in this edition, given that surprisingly Nintendo has well thought of including a series of brand new contents in the form of the Realm of Memories and Hero's Trial. The first is certainly the most interesting, it is in fact a series of brand new levels inspired, also visually, by the original The Legend of Zelda for NES, Link's Awakening for Game Boy and A Link to the Past for SNES. The stages offer maps and sprites adapted in an 8 and 16 bit key, for example, complete with an original soundtrack, offering a real fan service for nostalgics. If the difficulty of these bonus levels already undergoes a moderate surge compared to the initial stages, it is nothing compared to the infernal Hero's Trial, characterized by a quantity of enemies and obstacles that makes single-player games practically impossible if not simply frustrating.", "date": "2011-10-07", "grade": "8.0"}
