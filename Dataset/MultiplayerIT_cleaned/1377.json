{"name": "Nfl Street", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nfl-street.html", "text": "When the game is hard In NFL Street, as previously mentioned, we will lead a team made up of seven players, perfect strangers, NFL stars or old glories from the past, with the sole purpose of scoring more points than the opposing team. However, the way we carry out our actions is fundamental: style above all. We will be able to perform, using the very valid control system, the most varied performances, of moves never seen and which will never be seen on an official football field: dribbling like a basketball star with an oval ball is not for everyone the days and also the steps behind your back are not seen on television. But this is just one example of what awaits us and what can be done in the game. Why is style important? First of all because it makes you laugh to see super athletes who behave in the most light-hearted way possible, then because all these evolutions, which we can perform at any moment of the race, will make us earn precious points that will increase the GameBreaker level. Once the bar indicating the Gb level has been filled, we will be able to perform this super move by pressing the X key on our joypad, which in reality is not a super move but is more of a possibility that is offered to us to make our game much more effective in attack favoring a try, or in defense creating the possibility for a turnover. The attacking game is simple to manage, you choose a pattern on the play book and then try to execute it in real time, above each runner the image of a joypad button appears and when you press that button the ball will shoot out of our quarterback's hands towards the runner. Having taken the ball, the player will try to go to goal by dodging the opposing defenders with various pirouettes and sneers. This is the spirit of EA gaming. If the attack is so immediate, the defense will need a few more games to be managed in the best possible way, it is not easy to understand the behavior of the opponent and use the right counter-moves. The whole game will take place on eight fields, different both in locations and in size and we will go from soft grass to rough sand, from long and narrow fields to wide and short fields. This obviously will affect the choices of our seven players, and the possibility of having the real champions play in a decidedly inappropriate role adds another pinch of madness, as if there weren't enough, to NFL Street. Mode Pickup Game The seven players of the team are chosen among 40 NFL stars, the captains have the possibility to choose who will start the ball (don't laugh, it's essential!) Quick Game It's the classic quick game between two NFL teams NFL Challenge Take a team from the ground up to become the best team around. Oronzo Can teaches. tough guys dress badly The EA title supports up to four players, alas it does not support live but unfortunately it is known, and fun is truly guaranteed. What is not typical of all sports games is being able to always be fresh and interesting even in single player mode. NFL Street does it, managing to involve the user in a complete way. The various types of game are indicated in the box alongside while here we want to focus on the NFL Challenge mode. We will find ourselves leading a team made up of seven unknown people on average scarce and particularly truzzi. We will have the task of making their potential blossom and, game after game, transforming them into a legendary team. The path we will follow will be marked by overcoming some challenges such as making the first try, scoring a certain number of points within a time limit or reaching a certain level of style. After each challenge won, we will unlock precious points that will help us upgrade the characteristics of our players. We will also be able to fully customize our group: from the team crest to the runner's hair and clothing. The results are extremely hilarious and you can create characters so trashy that just looking at them will cause you disgust. Furthermore, in this mode, defeating all the teams in the first division will unlock another category and so on until you become the absolute champions of the game. A tough challenge, but definitely intriguing. From a technical point of view there are no big notes to make to the developers, who have worked well and perfectly characterized the different NFL stars, usually unrecognizablebile inside gaming armours, and which here instead stand out in the most disparate looks. However, the polygonal models are deliberately caricatured and fit perfectly into a game like NFL Street. The animations are accurate, as much as the style and clothing of the various characters. Overall, the title is decidedly enjoyable, therefore also from a graphic point of view and in any case what matters most is the control system which, decidedly well studied, manages to give us the necessary immediacy. The soundtrack is really perfect, hip hop tracks mix with songs by Korn and Jakk Frost managing to capture us completely; don't be surprised if you find yourself following the rhythm of the music with your feet or with the movement of the body in general, we did it too. Engaging. Comment The Ea title, we affirm it without fear of being contradicted, really deserves: fun, fresh, immediate like few other titles out there. It is perfect for bringing non-enthusiasts and those who are scared of schemes and technicalities closer to American football, but it is also suitable for lovers of this sport who will be able to have fun in a carefree way. The only obvious flaws are the failure to enable Xbox Live and the non-localization in Italian. But, if for the first point there are no more saints to appeal to, given that EA and Microsoft do not agree, an extra effort could certainly be made for the second question. NFL Street is still promoted and rightfully enters the list of the best arcade sports titles on Xbox. Pros: Immediate and engaging Multiplayer for 4 players Exceptional audio compartment Cons: No live no party To defend well you need a lot of training Lack of localization Football as you've never seen it! Teams of 7 contenders without pre-established roles who challenge each other in catching the oval ball, leaving out the very complicated playbooks and placing the emphasis above all on show and trash style. Electronic Arts, Big section, is used to amaze us with special effects by removing the more formal form from the sports titles it deals with, to cover them with a good dose of healthy arcade entertainment to increase, by simplifying the rules, pure fun and usable follies by us users. If this operation was perfectly successful for the American house with NBA Street, read the article to the end to find out if the target was hit again this time.", "date": "2004-03-05", "grade": null}
