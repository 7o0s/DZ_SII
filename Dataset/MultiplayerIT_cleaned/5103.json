Ungainly and tongue-in-cheek, the title put the player in the role of a surgeon performing a handful of operations in unfamiliar scenarios such as operating rooms and ambulances. But its originality was all poured into the particular reinterpretation of the concept of simulator: controlling the doctor's hand was a disarming difficulty and interacting with the dozens of tools at his disposal transformed in an instant into a nightmare for lovers of precision and fussiness. However, a very few minutes were enough to realize that the simulation was only in the player's head since Surgeon Simulator was more of a fun and light-hearted sandbox of surgical operations than a serious replicant of real activity. There was no need to worry about how to make cuts or delicately remove organs, much less carefully proceed to replace diseased or defective ones. As soon as you became familiar with the atrocious commands, the game transformed in an instant into a real massacre and a generator of paradoxical situations with lungs thrown left and right, surgical tools used on each extremity and organ of the patient, competitions for who could insert more objects into the stomach of the unfortunate person lying on the couch and so on. The objectives of the individual scenarios took a back seat and everything was in the name of the maximum possible chaos to amuse themselves or the spectators. Obviously the Bossa Studios guys couldn't miss the opportunity to take full advantage of the virtual reality peripherals and here we are ready to review the VR version of their little and best-selling jewel entitled Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality, ER for friends and which follows after a few months the free experiment Meet the Medic released in partnership with Valve and focused on the Heavy of Team Fortress. Surgeon Simulator: ER transports the game into virtual reality with few gameplay additions You again? Let's start immediately by saying that absolutely nothing has changed in terms of gameplay. The view remains the same in first person and our avatar is in the immediate vicinity of the body to be operated on. A whole series of adjustments have been made to the geometry of the spaces to allow the player to move easily within the environment and some furnishings and elements with which it is possible to interact have been brought closer or placed in easier positions. Furthermore, using Vive or the Oculus Touch controllers will have both hands on the screen instead of the single limb seen in the basic version of the game. Otherwise this VR version is absolutely identical to the normal one, including the complexity of the controls. The Bossa guys were in fact very clever in transferring the same frustrating imprecision already experimented with the mouse and keyboard, joypad and touch to the new controls and in fact trying to squeeze a tweezers or a scalpel taking into account that the thumb, forefinger and the remaining three fingers of each hand are manageable through three different buttons, is a determining factor in the playability of Surgeon Simulator ER and above all in its generation of hilarity. Among other things, we add a peculiar element of virtual reality which, especially with Vive, reaches its peak: the movement of the player's body and extremities in the simulated space. It will very often happen to try to insert the hands into the patient's cavities, however failing to get them to pass correctly for a few centimeters perhaps due to a bone or some appendage of flesh and the result will be to see our hands transform into a skeleton and lose any physicality . This ploy, in addition to generating a sense of frustration that has practically no equal in the field of VR, is essential for setting up that ~trial and error~ phenomenon that makes the title very replayable especially if you want to reach very high levels of idiocy. However, it is obvious that the same criticism leveled at the original game and its iOS version can also be brought to this VR edition: if you are looking for something realistic or that in any case has a certain level of challenge and conveys a sense of progression, Surgeon Simulator is absolutely not for you. By making an effort in a couple of hours you will have seen all the operations and scenarios that the game can offer and the small bonuses included in this VR version absolutely do not justify the higher price with which it comes.and sold and which is exactly double the launch cost of the original title. Weren't we supposed to see each other again? Even from a technical point of view there are no big changes between what can be observed inside a viewer and what was experienced at the time through a monitor. The points of interaction with the scenario have obviously increased dramatically and a truly excellent cleaning of the scenario can be seen, especially when compared with other exponents of the VR market. In particular, the minimalist style of the game, made up of polygons with angular and well-marked geometry, helps to clean up the graphic aspect of aliasing phenomena while reducing the presence of low-resolution textures. You don't even notice the consequences of the use of the Level of Detail which significantly lowers the quality of the elements on the screen based on their distance from the observer, a phenomenon very present in most VR games and all this certainly contributes to making Surgeon Simulator : Experience Reality a title that is still pleasant to look at, however sparse and unpretentious. At the audio level, it is all a swarm of sounds that further enhance the splatter element of the game and its bloody vein while it should be noted that the Italian localization is present. It being understood that the texts are really reduced to the bone.", "date": "2017-01-03", "grade": "7.0"}
