It has been just over a year since the game's debut on iOS devices and Android, and it's nice to note that in the jump on the Japanese hybrid console the authors have not sacrificed anything from the point of view of content, indeed adding a couple of very interesting features, in this case the local multiplayer via split-screen for two or four players and motion-sensing controls. Also surprising is the decision to keep the original free-to-play setting and therefore land on the eShop for free, with the same characteristics of tolerance and elasticity of the freemium model appreciated in the mobile sector. In case you were wondering, this means that you can download the game for free and try your hand at all the races you want; provided you pay attention to the amount of fuel available in the tank of your cars, which precisely determines the possibility or not of taking to the track. Each car offers six attempts that recharge over time, but which can be restored by leveling up (a very simple thing, especially during the first few hours) or by spending the game's hard currency, which is also given quite generously. Gameplay and environments Asphalt 9: Legends is a pure arcade, a racer that knows no realism and that involves right from the start in exciting races, which take place within visually stunning scenarios and rich in dynamic elements, some of which can be destructible. The gameplay focuses on the correct use of the drift and the nitro: the first, and the tricks in general, fill the indicator of the second, allowing us to make prodigious sprints forward and score that last overtaking before the finish line. On Nintendo Switch, the 30-second races clearly appear too short, designed as they were for use exclusively on the move, but advancing through the seasons of the various chapters that make up the rich career, it happens that you also try your hand at longer-lasting events, which take advantage of the urban circuits included in the package in their entirety and impose a more conservative approach on us. If you want, you can momentarily free yourself from your opponents by performing a 360-degree rotation or ram them while shooting forward with the nitro, or even build an advantage by exploiting the numerous shortcuts, jumps and alternative routes that characterize each of the scenarios. In short, there is a fair degree of variety during the action and the eight locations (San Francisco, Scotland, the Himalayas, Cairo, the Midwest USA, the Caribbean, Rome and Shanghai) are revealed in a very progressive way to fill in as well as possible the many events available in the single player mode. The over fifty cars present must be unlocked by collecting parts of the related projects within specific events, as part of a very solid progression and only marginally touched by the presence of microtransactions: some cars are only obtained paying with valuable currency and therefore you have to wait a bit to be able to have them for free. Extra modes and options As mentioned at the beginning, the Nintendo Switch version of Asphalt 9: Legends can count on some interesting new features, first of all the competitive multiplayer mode via split-screen, which allows two or four players to challenge each other using a single console. This feature will soon be joined by an online sector in real time, but the Clubs are already present with the relative challenges, special events, quick races and all the rich outline that allows, if desired, to carry out the grinding necessary to obtain credits and essential components for upgrading cars. After increasing final speed, acceleration, stability and nitro by spending the virtual currency at our disposal, in fact, we will be asked to recover specific projects in order to continue improving the car. Once on the track, the substantial difference between this edition of Asphalt 9: Legends and the mobile one lies in the controls. If in fact on iOS and Android it is possible to play with the controller but always in automatic acceleration regime, on Nintendo Switch the car can be managed as in a normal driving game, using the right trigger to increase the speed and the left one to brake or , in combination with the analog stick, drift. You can also use the accelerometer to control the wheel, by tilting the Joy-Cons from side to side - the system works surprisingly well. The svThe developers have even brought the TouchPlay system to the hybrid console, which allows you to automate all the mechanisms apart from the activation of the drift and the channeling in the alternative paths: an interesting solution to let people completely unrelated to video games try the experience. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, the Gameloft title is still very current and has not lost its charm in the slightest. On the occasion of this review, we re-downloaded the application on the iPad Pro in order to be able to make a comparison: it must be said that on the Apple tablet the resolution is higher and there are no episodes of aliasing or uncertainties in the frame rate, but otherwise we are talking about a very well done conversion, which remains truly spectacular thanks to the abundance of effects used to enrich the scenarios and the cars. The developers have been able to perfectly mask the limits of a non-extraordinary polygonal count, putting the right textures in the right place and dumping water, rain and motion blur on the screen when traveling along the coastal areas at maximum speed. The end result is excellent especially in portable mode, while on the screen of an Ultra HD television some knots come to a head within the aforementioned resolution, but the game is still a great sight. Finally, the action is accompanied by a signed electronic soundtrack, very pleasant if you appreciate the genre.", "date": "2019-10-07", "grade": "8.5"}
