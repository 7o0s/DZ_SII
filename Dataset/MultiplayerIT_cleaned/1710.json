In the memory of millions of people, the conflicts of the 20th century have been forgotten. Relegated to history books and dusty archives. Become subjects for film. Stories told by old grandparents, who seem less and less important in this glittering new world of global terrorism and international conflict. But not everything that has been buried is dead. Old hates endure. Old mysteries remain unsolved. And old enemies rear their heads, reinvigorated and ready to use the tools of modern terror to continue their old battles. Only one barrier separates the world from terror old and new: Rainbow, an international task force dedicated to fighting terrorism in all its forms. A top-secret organization made up of the best counter-terrorism agents at the disposal of the United Nations. Rainbow is the most powerful weapon in the world's arsenal. Backed by the most advanced technologies available, and trained to the limits of human capabilities, they are our greatest hope in the fight against terror. Maybe even the last one... Once again you will be called, not to arms, but to head the Rainbow organization, united against the fight against terrorism. When you are called, it means that an extremely important mission awaits you, and that all other options have yielded no results no failure is permitted. Nocs for the first time Milan, 19 March 2003. The special forces of the Italian State Police, the NOCS (Central Security Operations Unit), enter an action video game for the first time. Alongside all the international police forces, our NOCS will be committed to crushing the nightmare of terrorism in every corner of the planet. For the adaptation of the video game, the NOCS gave continuous advice and provided detailed indications to the game designers and programmers of Ubi Soft to guarantee a result that reflected reality as much as possible. Thanks to the study of the positions that the men of the team have to assume, in fact, using a modern motion capture system, we will be able to ~really~ see how they will move and how they will use their weapons. Dozens of photographs and video footage were taken to digitally recreate the counter-terrorism elite operating modes, just as all the uniforms with the official crests, weapons and equipment actually supplied to the NOCS men. Thanks to this collaboration, a patch will soon be released (available from April on the websites www.poliziadistato.it and www.ravenshield.it ) which will allow you to use the same NOCS operatives in your missions (multiplayer or otherwise). Pure realism? Not always.. Errata Correction: Following a prompt and timely report from UbiSoft Italia we wish to correct, and clarify, the fact that although Unreal 2 and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Raven Shield both use the so-called Unreal Warfare engine, they use two versions of it different. Unreal 2 is powered by version 2.0, while Raven Shield takes advantage of the previous evolution 1.5 So, although in the course of the review one could be led to think that the two games use and can take advantage of the same graphics routines, we report the fact that, instead, the engine graph used does not appear to be the same. Precisely for this reason, directly comparing the graphic aspects of the two titles - as was done in the course of our review - could be misleading. What do Unreal 2 and Raven Shield (commonly called Rash) have in common? At first glance they are two completely different games, yet, a not exactly marginal element unites them unequivocally: the graphics engine. This splendid engine has already been exploited, albeit not to the fullest, by Unreal Tournament 2003 while, as easily imaginable, it was admired in its maximum graphic splendor in Unreal 2 (well, were there any doubts? Matt's note). Thanks to its enormous potential, this graphics engine will also be used in other future great titles such as Thief 3 and Deus Ex 2. In short, not bad credentials. The Ubisoft developers, aware of the quality and potential of Unreal Warfare (the ~code~ name of this engine), have decided to purchase the rights to use it, to be able to use it in the development of the new Rainbow Six episode. After this brief introduction to the great Unreal Warfare, let's examine the graphic side which, although not the main aspect of a Fps, is the most visible sign of the various changes made to the third chapter of this series. From the first minutes of the game you will notice csure that the aforementioned engine is not being used properly. The textures, theoretically of high quality thanks to the Unreal 2 graphics engine, on the contrary, turn out to be of very poor quality (in this regard, read the dutiful corrigendum at the beginning of the paragraph, Matt's note). But this is not all, the ~curious~ side consists in the fact that; in some maps, especially those dedicated to multiplayer, the quality of the textures is quite good and the graphics engine is used properly, the remaining part of the maps, at least 80%, have very bad and very poor textures. Personally, I think Ghost Recon is a lot better, graphically speaking, even though it doesn't use Unreal Warfare. But, not only Ghost Recon outclasses this new chapter of the RS series by a lot, even in Rogue Spear, in some cases, much better textures could be admired. The multiplayer maps, oddly enough, are quite good, every now and then you can admire the main features of this engine, and even the textures turn out to be quite realistic. Perhaps, the Ubisoft guys have relied on the wrong mapper, given that this engine is excellent for managing realistic textures. (see Devastation) Luckily, the same editor used in UT 2003 and Unreal 2 is included in the game. Thanks to this and the various mappapers around the world, you will see maps that are far superior to the original ones. Cover fire! Leaving aside the serious imperfection due to the carelessness of the textures, on the contrary, the ~audio~ side of the game is perfect and cared for down to the smallest detail. Beautiful sound effects of weapons and impact effects on various objects, recreate a perfect atmosphere, suitable for this type of game. Each weapon has its own effect, perfectly sampled, which will give an idea of the power or type of ammunition used. The different impact effects for each material are splendid, from the dark and subdued blows generated by woody materials hit by bullets, to fantastic acoustic distortion effects on the various types of metal. Obviously, this side could not be overlooked, given that in any self-respecting fps the sampling of firearms is almost always of a good standard. The voices of the teammates are quite good, identical to the old episodes, even if for fans of the series, lovers of various English terms, hearing a ~Via via via!~ is ridiculous compared to the famous ~Go go go!~. However, this small flaw is linked to the localized version in Italian and, as you know, purists don't always like the localization. Tom Clancy, the legend.. Tom Clancy was born on April 12, 1947 in Baltimore, Maryland, and since childhood he has cultivated a passion for everything military, but due to a very strong myopia he cannot pursue a career in the Army. Since college (Clancy has the equivalent of a BA from Loyola College, Class of '69) he had toyed with the idea of becoming a writer, but decided to pursue the safer life of an insurance agent. His office is littered with military photos and strategy books and games. In 1976 the news of the attempted desertion of a Soviet frigate in Sweden inspires what in 1984 will materialize in the best seller The Hunt for the Red October. Since then his road as a writer has been going downhill... He claims that his life hasn't changed much, as he is allergic to the novelists' Jet Set parties. He has four children and lives in a mansion on Cheasepeake Bay (Baltimore) in Maryland, and does the housework that ~puts him in perspective~. He has a large collection of military caps and loves to shoot his Beretta 92 at his personal underground range. He has always written his novels with a Macintosh (with the most up-to-date model for the times). He owns a Hummer and an M60 tank!) Today Tom Clancy is regularly consulted by international experts in naval strategy and the CIA, he is always welcome on submarines, jets and ships of the US Navy and, many of his books, they are studied at the American War Colleges. Although he has always declared that his incredible culture derives exclusively from public sources and that he has never gone beyond national security, he has finally admitted that he has come into contact with what he himself calls ~The Great Chain~, or a network of soldiers, government employees, Pentagon officials, CIA men and entrepreneurs, from which he draws information. Everyone stop! Snipers fire! In Raven Shield, you lead an elite unit of the international  codename Rainbow. We take control of the mission commander, before and after each mission and plan every detail of the missions. The choice of operatives, divided according to the specialization: Assault, specialized in combat with the use of all weapons other than sniper rifles, Reconnaissance, specialized in stealth movements without being detected, Sniper, specialized in combat with the use of sniper rifles, Demolitions, specializing in the placement and defusing of explosives, Electronics, specializing in the placement and manipulation of electronic devices. After choosing the operatives to be sent on a mission, we will have to give them the most suitable equipment for the type of mission to be performed: The primary weapon, the operative's main weapon, which ranges from sniper rifles to reliable machine guns, the secondary weapon, which ranges from any type of pistol to small machine guns, the assignment of objects, ranging from grenades of all types to technological objects such as the heartbeat sensor. After equipping our operatives, we'll move on to the mission planning area. The planning room is where we set waypoints and create an action plan. When we don't control a squad, they follow waypoints and the mission plan. In this room, the map window has been added, a small view of the situation, in very low resolution but useful for understanding what situation and place you are in. The final phase, before entering the field, is the ~execute mission~ room where we will choose which team to command, or whether to view the mission in spectator mode. As soon as they enter the core of the operation, the operatives of the other two teams will follow the planned route. Our current waypoint appears on the screen as a floating circle with an indication of the distance in meters. If the waypoint is out of sight, an arrow appears along the edge of the screen, indicating the direction in which we should go. A useful change from the past is that if we have a special action planned for a waypoint, such as a Wait for Code-Go Alpha or a Throw a Frag Grenade, it appears in the center of the screen when we reach the waypoint. This way we will no longer mess with the planned actions. We will also be able to keep all the operatives under control, thanks to a small menu arranged under your health, which will keep us informed of every action they are taking. We will have to give them the various Go-Codes and green light to the snipers when they have targets within range. After having given the various orders, we will have to lead our team, we will almost always be the first to go into action, even if, thanks to a simple command, we will be able to advance our operatives, rather than expose ourselves directly. Another very useful command, certainly appreciated by purists, is the possibility of opening the doors little by little, rather than opening them directly. Thanks to this it will be possible to adopt new types of tactics. The system used to ~shoot~ has remained unchanged, the reticle is always used which will enlarge or reduce depending on many things that could influence the aim of the weapon. The last words Raven Shield, in every respect, has nothing to envy to any other title of the genre and, despite presenting the serious defect due to the poor quality of the textures, it is still an excellent title, certainly capable of opening a gap among the greats of the type. The Ubisoft guys have done a good job, in spite of an almost unchanged title, certainly focusing on the multiplayer mode rather than improving the single one (a striking example lies in the fact of the great graphic difference of the multiplayer maps). The last words Pros Improvements made to gameplay Excellent sampling of firearms and impact effects Excellent multiplayer mode Excellent localization and soon to add NOCS Cons Some medium quality textures Short single-player mode The time has come to return.. After a huge and exhausting wait, Ubi Soft is proud to present a new chapter of the most acclaimed and discussed series, Rainbow Six. The title in question is Rainbow Six: Raven Shield, the third chapter of the much loved playful series based on the works of the famous Tom Clancy. What will this title bring next? Unreal II has opted for a splendid graphics engine, capable of animating high quality textures, the innovation of Project IGI 2 consists in", "date": "2003-03-25", "grade": null}
