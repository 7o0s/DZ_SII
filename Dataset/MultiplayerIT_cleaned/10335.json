All when he was just seventeen. Originally from Essex, England, O'Sullivan has not only had moments of glory in his career, however: he had to serve a two-year suspension for assaulting a tournament director, and in 1998 he was stripped of victory by the Bensons & Hedges Irish Masters because he tested positive for cannabis. Hiccups that did not prevent him from conquering the title of world champion in 2001, a result repeated in 2004 and 2008. The series of video games dedicated to him, Ronnie O'Sullivan's Snooker, arrives on the iPhone and iPod Touch after convincing on mobile phones Java-compatible, without getting thunderous applause. The approach to the touch screen of Apple devices seems convincing from the first game, however: just ~drag~ horizontally or vertically respectively to change the view on the pool table and to change the shooting angle. The precision with which these operations are carried out is surprising, therefore one never feels the need for an alternative control for infinitesimal adjustments (which is present in the form of ~zoom~ anyway). The behavior of the balls is realistic, but in many ways it appears ~permissive~ and therefore it is possible to go into the hole even when in theory there should be a rebound. The power of the shot can be adjusted in a very simple way, by moving an indicator located on the left side of the screen, while it is possible to add effects to the ball by touching the relative icon and thus modifying the impact of the cue. Ronnie's story Once the game has started, the available modes are frankly not very many: you can try your hand at the classic quick game, retrace Ronnie O'Sullivan's career from the beginning or jump into multiplayer (present both locally and online). On mobile we have seen much richer and more varied products, especially those developed by Gameloft. The career is the most substantial mode, as could be expected, and is divided into a large number of stages whose difficulty increases gradually, interspersed with challenges in which we have to achieve a certain goal within a time limit. The games we play are the ones that really characterized Ronnie's career, so it's a bit of a ~scenario mode~ as it reproduces real situations that we'll have to try to solve in the best possible way. The artificial intelligence is of a good level but appears a bit fluctuating: sometimes our opponents manage to score points after points without batting an eyelid, other times they miss the simplest maneuvers and provide us with a frightening assist to close the contest . As mentioned at the beginning, the touch screen control system performs very well both from the point of view of immediacy and practicality, and from the point of view of precision: making a mistake because we were unable to ~aim~ in the right way it is something that very rarely occurs. The technical realization is of a good level, even without doing miracles: the visual rendering of the table and the balls is good, the management of the view is agile and fluid but the outline made up of the players, the scenario and the public is very much missing: most often the table is in the middle of nowhere. The sound accompaniment is limited to being functional to the action, therefore it spices up our shots with some good effect but doesn't dare to go further.
