{"name": "Severance: Blade of Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/severance-blade-of-darkness.html", "text": "Introduction Let's go by stages, starting from the graphics engine. It's not that of ID software for Quake 3 no sir, it's not even that of its direct competitor Unreal Tournament so it will be Monolith's Littech Engine? No sir, it's a brand new engine, like you've never seen before and it won't be a classic ~first and last time~ case anyway. Be more than sure. Perhaps what we are about to say will be something hackneyed for those who have seen trailers, screenshots, previews (I hope mine too!^_^) or, better yet, who have tried the 100-odds mb demo (if not you still downloaded it, it's the right time with our fantastic files engine, brand new!): graphically it's amazing!! Maybe it will be that 20 years of playing videogames have made me go crazy (actually, definitely! ^_^) but the thrill of unwrapping the courier package with this piece of videogame art inside with a barbarity (it's really the case to say) typical of when one expects a killer application is something incomparable. When almost 1 gig of your hard disk will be gone, after an exhausting wait of almost 10 minutes (despite my 40x!), a more than good quality full motion will show you the sword of evil which, perhaps for the happiness of being finally on monitors around the world through Codemasters, it will weep tears of blood almost like a fountain. Once you select one of any four heroes at your disposal, it will take less than 3 minutes for you to scream with happiness for some of the most beautiful textures ever seen, for simply magnificent refraction effects and for a panorama so damn vast and well made. Only for graphics so should we praise this Severance? Absolutely not, so after this dutiful first smattering on the visual quality of this new videogame jewel, let's start by rattling off the story behind this Severance, coming from the caliente Espana. History nova Long, long ago the Lord created Chaos, formed by a good part and an evil part, the latter ambitious to extend its power beyond belief. After a very long war, the Lord with the help of the good part (evolved as the Spirit of Light) won the bad part of Chaos (evolved into the Prince of Evil) and the longed-for peace has arrived... having not given up however, the Prince of Evil continues to rage in the world created a long time ago by the Lord, until a legendary hero equipped with a sacred sword finally beat him but at a high price: the hero was now mortally wounded and was therefore burned together with his powerful weapon from his friends in a temple. Centuries have passed, but something strange is happening, an unmistakable sign of the return of the forces of evil! Will there be a hero to rise to the occasion? How do you say? There are four of them (end of season sales in those parts too^_^?)! The 4 champions of the round Almost as a tribute to scrolling fighting games (Golden Ax in the first place, given the setting and the type of enemies), we will be able to choose our virtual alter ego between the indomitable knight, the wild barbarian, the very squat dwarf and the beauty on duty, in the guise of an Amazon. Let's analyze them in a little more detail! Sargon, the knight Always at the service of kings, knights are people devoted to order, justice and truth! Their ideal armament is made up of a sword and shield (although it is obviously possible to come across other types of weapons in the course of the game) and before you know it you will also be wearing a very shiny armor! If you choose this mustachioed thug (as if he were Orlando Furioso from the Chanson de Roland!), you will start your adventures inside a cell and your monstrous strength will be the only way to escape from it. It goes without saying that although you ended up in prison unjustly, you won't have the time to explain it to the guards Tukaram, the barbarian This very strong guy (eerily similar to his colleague from the beautiful Golden Ax trilogy), equipped with a 2-handed broadsword, begins his adventure in a very fascinating location due to the high hills that surround it, as well as the various lakes therein. In folk tales, the barbarian is second to none in strength and ferocity in battle as well as being a great walker (you travel from country to country on foot, for instance!!); they do not believe in divinities, they do not recognize those in power as their rulers and they believe strongly in strength. Zoe, the Amazon This busty damsel begins her adventure near a temple whose decorations (made with textures from panico) and its architectural structure recall the Aztec age that developed in South America centuries ago. Being an adventurer, she is obviously attracted to myths and legends, better if there is a treasure as a final reward (reminds me of a certain Lara Croft). How do you say? Do you want his mobile number? Sorry and then with a girl armed with a Bo (long fighting stick, it seems to me of Japanese origins) and a bow and arrows I don't think it suits you very much... Naglfar, the Dwarf Dwarf dwarf, take it easy!!! Er you should know that at the beginning of the game, in which case you will select this funny moustached guy, you will perform an inelegant fall from a crevasse complete with a typical fall from a comic film! However, as the old adage said, the dress doesn't make the monk, so don't underestimate this proud craftsman; for those who are not very accustomed to RPGs, fantasy stories and so on, let's deepen, as already done for the other protagonists of Severance, the figure of the dwarf. Since ancient times they have always worked with the most diverse metals, building weapons, tools and (perhaps for their wives ^_^) jewels of all kinds. Even if they are brave warriors, divided into clans (sometimes into tribes), they are not violent beings, being pacifists at the bottom of their surly hearts. Our friend's aim will be to look for something important, to help him understand what is happening in his lands... Graphics If you are part of that group of people who buy games only for the beautiful graphics, perhaps to get edited with friends well, this is the game for you, without the slightest uncertainty. Let's start from the sprites: every single character is made with an excellent number of polygons but what really amazes is the quality of the textures, simply magnificent. To give you an example: if you are repeatedly wounded by your enemies (whose healing cure is not far from the one instilled in your alter ego) your meat and clothes just bought at the sales will start to get ruined or get dirty with blood. Speaking of blood: it's been a while since we've seen such a violent videogame, surely there will be a lot of talk about it; if you manage to hit an opponent's arm or leg, the limb in question will come off with a fountain of blood (unless your parents have entered the parental lock ^_^) and you can use it as a weapon! Even more grim is that while the enemy is still staggering you can, in the truest sense of the word, tear him apart!! This speech introduces one of the best features of this first effort by Rebel Act Studios, or the excellent level of interaction with your surroundings. In addition to the macabre detail mentioned a few lines above, you can use torches, stools, vases as a throwing weapon, you can eat chickens, cheeses to restore your energy level and much more. It goes without saying that you will have to deal with keys, switches and locks, that is everything that makes a very ~Tombraiderian~ video game! Returning for a moment to the objects that can be thrown, even if many people will not pay attention to them, it is good to underline the extreme realism of the throwing force: throw a vase with little force (by pressing the default key ~Q~) and this will just bounce, of course in a hyper-realistic way; use all your strength, perhaps not too far away, and you will see that it will break into a thousand pieces. When you kill an enemy you can also play jackals, taking possession of his weapons, food and everything that can come in handy later. Still remaining on the visual theme, let's continue with what is certainly the strong point of the engine created by the Spanish coders: the real-time lighting and refraction system. I had never seen shadows so ... so ... realistically (but also perfectly) generated on the ground or on the walls, with equally super-convincing light effects, sunbeams filtering in open environments or torches in narrow dungeons. If you think that from a strict editor he has become a softie who gets excited easily, I give you a little suggestion: when you find a lighted torch on the ground, try to do the following: pick it up, move with it and see how the walls, the ceiling, the prisons whether they reflect its light The praises don't end there and in addition to the most convincing fog effect you have ever seen, one cannot forget to mention the effect with which the liquid surfaces are made: they reflect you, your enemies, the caves beside you, the sun, the moon, even the smoke (when presente), also beautifully done (perdindirindina). In short, if you hadn't understood it, graphically it is a very monstrous title, something that even 128-bit console users would drool over to have. The only problem, which is not a small one, lies in the hardware configuration required to play Severance and I think it is totally useless to list the minimum requirements to take home the title distributed by the Anglo-Saxon Codemasters. So I hope you have at home at least a P3 500 with 128 mb of ram and a nice video card with 32 mb of memory that works properly in Direct 3d. I personally tried the game on my P3 500, 256 mb of ram and both with a G 400 Max and with a GeForce DDR it gave me no problem with all the details maxed out at 800x600x32. Sound Equally excellent work has been done on the sound side: the extremely atmospheric music adapts to what is happening on your trusty monitor (now full of drool): explore a prison and the music will remind you of a classic film with spies as your master, always in an adventurous and medieval key (of course); engage in battle and it will rise in BPM, galvanizing you a lot. The quality of the sound effects is sincerely little more than decent, so forget the sound cleanliness of Quake 3, just to cite an excellent example among the many present in the PC videogame market but the atmosphere is rendered very well; for example in prisons it is easy to feel electrified by a drop dripping from the ceiling or hearing an enemy snoring will make you hold down the ~stealth~ button to be able to advance silently in order to kill him easily. The review copy used for this review is not localized in Italian like the version already in stores so I can only tell you that the English dubbing settles on more than valid levels even if the Spanish one present in the demo and in the beta version used for the second preview was definitely more appealing. However, another gem of the audio side dates back to the magnificent implementation of surround sound for the lucky owners of SB Live with at least 4 speakers, a feature comparable to the lighting and refraction effects of which the graphic engine is capable: approach a waterfall or torch and start spinning around to hear the sound coming from everywhere! This is a great thing and other software houses should learn from Rebel Act Studios how to implement surround sound in a video game. Playability and longevity Even from this point of view, Severance has not disappointed its ambitious premises; the playability draws heavily from the (recently) not very flourishing genre of scrolling fighting games since for most of the time you will beat your enemies like damned, taking possession of everything they leave on the ground, i.e. weapons, shields, keys and stuff to eat to restore your life bar. Occasionally you will have to make some very accurate jumps here and there and, as in Tomb Raider, you will also have to hang yourself in the most disparate places. The presence of puzzles is also inherited from the (alleged or certain) Core Design killer game that defining elementary is an understatement given that generally it is a question of finding the right path between a few jumps and some enemies to be torn to shreds. Oops, I forgot, there is also some key to use after finding where to enter it! As if that weren't enough we also have a sprinkling of experience points that will increase as we kill our opponents. The moment we reach the number of points necessary to level up, a blue aura envelops us making us recover all our health points and making us stronger and more resistant. This mix of quite different playing styles works quite well and you may have some problems at the beginning only because of the multitude of keys you use, practically the entire keyboard but fortunately the keys are all remappable. At first because of this fact I thought that fighting was difficult and a bit frustrating because in addition to continuously directing your hero you'll have to use the 1 mouse button to attack and the right ctrl key to use the shield (if you have one). Fortunately, the Spanish programmers love us and a key has been inserted to frame a single enemy so as not to worry too much about your movements, you just need to use the key to attack and the one to defend yourself! If all this is not enough for you, know that it is possible to take advantage of a well-implemented training mode and a multiplayer mode through fights in the arena where it will be possible to challenge your", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
