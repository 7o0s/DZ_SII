This second iteration seems to have smoothed out some career progression issues, setting everything up in a more rigorous and strict perspective, where instead of normal and master stars to be obtained, progress between the various championships takes place on the basis of a generic experience, without too many barriers to prevent us from free navigation between the various tournaments. Cars and tracks Let's start right away with the numbers. The tracks are undoubtedly many, the roster includes both real and invented circuits, all with relative alternative configurations. Alongside Monza, Silverstone, Donington, Spa, Suzuka, Brno, Brands Hatch, the famous Nurburgring in all its guises, we also find less famous tracks such as the steep and winding Bathurst which generally hosts the V8 Supercars or even Enna Pergusa, with its shivering detachment. In addition to these there are a whole series of street circuits (London, Shanghai, Miami) and various other ~secondary~ tracks such as fame, but no less demanding to cover, relating to various American championships. Net of the different configurations we stop at thirty-five tracks (double compared to the first chapter), if we add the variants we take into account another forty tracks, perhaps not too different from the basic one. The track design is therefore decidedly varied and capable of exalting all types of riders in the most diverse situations. Speaking of cars, however, the numbers are still high, but not very high compared to the competition. The developers have made a different choice compared to the usual suspects, not to insert fundamentally ~useless~ cars to focus directly on cars that have something to say on the track, skipping utilitarians, compacts in the basic version and more generally everything that doesn't reaches 200 km/h. In this sense, if you choose Audi, the basic model is the S3, while for BMW it is the 135i Coup, in the same way for Volkswagen we find the Golf GTI and for Ford a beautiful RS Cosworth from a few years ago. If we also consider the real supercars, we arrive at 145 cars for a total of 36 manufacturers. When visiting the dealer, the search filters help us to understand the various types of car. Alongside the geographical and general performance subdivisions, we find the Modern, Retro, Muscle Car and Legendary categories, plus the one hundred percent racing ones as Need For Speed Shift 2: Unleashed has won the rights for the GT1 and GT3 categories. It is useless and difficult to read here to make a detailed list, but the list of car manufacturers includes, for example, Lamborghini, Porsche, Maserati, Aston Martin, Pagani, Bugatti, Alfa Romeo, Shelby, Dodge, Maserati, plus a whole series of ~ exotic~ brands such as Radical, Alpina, Koenigsegg, Gumpert, McLaren and many others. In short, the best of the extreme covered-wheel cars is present, the lack of the Maranello red weighs a little though. This is a perfectly acceptable choice of ~only~ 145 cars and which has the advantage of not boring us in the first stages with very slow cars that mortally reduce the pace of the races. In short, we start immediately quite strong in Shift 2, we don't fall asleep on board of small city cars. Dominance on the track As mentioned at the beginning, the progression has been revised - for the better - and now it advances in a decidedly more homogeneous way. There is, except for a few events, the worry of first position at all costs, but you must always bear in mind that the lower you get in the standings, the less experience points you get; the less points you get, the less money you earn to spend on new cars or in the large mechanical customization section of the vehicle. The old setting with stars and multiple objectives has been removed, of which only the implementation of extra points remained in the case of perfect driving of the guideline and departure, of at least one lap in the lead, of an impeccable lap without bumps and of the in which a curve is dominated. All this works because it doesn't involve us directly in the spasmodic search for the single ~achievement~, but with only careful driving we can bring home even in the first instance a good part of the ~objectives~. The events are quite varied, in addition to the classic races, single or in series, we can test our skills with two types of race against the clock, alone or with other cars on the track, participate in elimination races, in which the 'last of each round is excluded, or start throwing away ptires with drift challenges. There are no real one-make races, but competitions based on the type of car, such as those suitable only for Muscle Cars or Retro ones. A separate competition is dedicated to tuned cars, which you can buy from the dealership, or tune your own. Particular attention should be paid when you put your hand to your car. The addition of pieces can change the class to which it belongs (from ~D~ to ~A~) until you get to a real tuned car. Obviously all this is important in view of participation in certain types of tenders. And if the progression dictated by the career weren't enough for us, we can rely on the Autolog, an evolution of the one seen in Hot Pursuit. This allows us to keep an eye on the game progress of our friends, and therefore to always have our times and theirs at hand (and for comparison). With this in mind, Shift 2 will notify us of where and what has been beaten at each start, giving us the opportunity to immediately get on track to recover that record that was stolen from us. A really useful implementation to dramatically increase the longevity of the title and which will unleash furious fights on the edge of tenths of a second. You can also recommend a particular track to your friends, share photos and replays. It goes without saying that every action Autolog takes contributes to our level increase and earns us money. Level that makes us put a lot of money in the bank, prize cars, new paint, chrome and liveries. Win and buy But going to tighten are we faced with a game that keeps its simulation promises? Shift 2 is very honest in this sense, it immediately puts us to the test with a couple of races of a certain difficulty to test our abilities and automatically set how and how real the driving model should be, but at all times, setting pause, we can act on different parameters. In addition to the level of difficulty it is possible to adjust steering and braking assistance, as well as ABS, traction and stability control and the incidence of damage. By choosing to deactivate all the assistances, the cars turn out to be decidedly grumpy, the game tolerates excessive openings on the curb very badly, not to mention putting two wheels on the grass. The braking becomes very dangerous, more generally driving is really demanding, even class D cars (Focus, Golf and so on) require a certain commitment in short. As you level up, as the cars gain power, things get really tough, and when you have a high-performance racing car at hand, perhaps with rear-wheel drive, everything will become terribly complicated, you'll start tailing badly, yes they feel all the roughness of the track that breaks down the car, oversteering and the pendulum effect could become the norm, and it will be necessary to work on throttle choking, avoiding the aforementioned brutal openings. To meet everyone Slightly Mad Studios has therefore inserted a good scalability of the driving model that allows us to decide how to run, always with a view to a simulation desire that avoids too high arcade drifts. By playing with the ABS, traction control and stability settings, it will be possible to find the most suitable setting for each player, and even by activating all these aids to the maximum, you will never race on velvet glued to the track. The goodness of the driving model therefore returns an excellent physicality of the car, obviously amplified by the peculiar view from the helmet, but more generally, over time you will have the sensation of being one with the car. However, a rigorous simulation requires, in addition to the driving model, at least two other sectors in which realism must be present, namely the setting up of the vehicle and the damage. There are many parts in which to spend our earnings: suffice it to say that the heart of the car has eight sub-sections in which to work, each with different levels of upgrades. In addition to camshafts, mufflers, valves, filters, flywheels and even a complete engine replacement, we can play mechanic by engaging with the brakes, bodywork, suspension, transmission and tyres. It is possible to calibrate the car precisely, all explained in detail in the menus given that not everyone can have high-level mechanical skills. Once the car has been set up, we have the possibility of saving the configuration, setting particular filters to associate it with one or more tracks or particular types of track. Off the hood On the aesthetic side we will be able to change the livery, types of rims and paints. Aesthetic tuning is therefore present, but that's not the pointtitle strong. The damage, which in the preview seemed rather random to us, seems to be rather spot on for how they have been implemented. A certain arbitrariness remains at times in the range between slight damage and extreme damage, but it is appreciated how they are really effective, and how they immediately change the behavior of the car. They are in fact ~level~, a hit on a low wall can make the car lean to one side, a lot or a little depends on how hard we hit it, an excessive rear-end collision can compromise the efficiency of the engine. If, on the other hand, there is really serious damage, the car can go very slowly, or in the event of loss of wheels, it can remain planted where it finished its run. The interesting thing is that everything is returned without screen indicators, the pad (or steering wheel) sensations in the hand are really strong. From an aesthetic point of view, the shocks are clearly visible on the car, especially on the front, with the hood blowing off, the windows breaking, the engine which can even crumple in the most dramatic cases, while on the sides and rear it seems that the programmers they wanted to be less furious. Xbox 360 goals Need For Speed Shift 2: Unleashed rewards the player with 40 achievements, both in single and multiplayer. Achievements are earned by leveling up, winning particular competitions, accepting challenges via Autolog, racing all tracks at night or at dusk. More generally, by thoroughly dissecting the game you will be able to obtain all the various objectives without excessive difficulty. Digital or human? It would seem like a perfect title Need For Speed Shift 2: Unleashed, someone could argue that the fleet is not as large as it should, or that at the simulation level we are not on the (extreme) side of the developers' pedigree, it being understood that the game is aimed to a much wider and decidedly more heterogeneous audience than the PC niche one. The most important problem of the title is the artificial intelligence. The work done by Slightly Mad studios is completely free from trains and parade arrivals, unfortunately, however, the resourcefulness of the opposing pilots often verges on impropriety, with the result of being touched and ending up off the road. The overtaking fregola of the opponents is so urgent and their driving cleanliness so poor that it is not uncommon to be slammed onto the grass even in full straight. Seeing the silhouette of an opponent in the mirror gives you shivers more than tension because you are at the mercy of the skill of those who are on your heels, and if by chance our trajectory is not optimal, we widen a bit too much, or we delay braking for cross the strait, well there's a good chance that someone will take us in full force by canceling the efforts made so far. The first moments after the start of the race are exemplary in this perspective: we will find ourselves forced to restart the competition over and over again. Obviously not all impacts are the same, Shift 2 often tolerates ~leaning~ and rear-end strikes, as well as rear-end collisions even at high speed, but as long as they are no longer ~flat~ and ~centered~ to unleash violent tails at least. spin and off the track all too often. It is possible to partially remedy this problem by raising the level of difficulty, making sure that the opponents are faster and run away, but this does not completely solve the problem, with the plus of the increased difficulty. The interesting thing is that artificial intelligence has little regard even for itself. The drivers engage in duels and make a lot of mistakes, it's a real show to see them fighting, excursions on the grass and carambola are the order of the day, all too much since it is not uncommon to be the victim of out of control cars with the result that we can all imagine . The intentions of Slightly Mad Studios are certainly worthy, from the point of view of the search for realism this is truly appreciable, it almost seems that the developers have implemented digital opponents that are truly similar to human ones in terms of unpredictability and ~unfairness~, but when this goes to the detriment of fruition coming close to frustration there is obviously a problem. Still talking about the mistakes of the opponents, it is necessary to highlight a criticality that can be defined as a real bug. As previously stated, damage ~progresses~ in stages. If the one who plays reaches the total uselessness of the car, or at a level of failure such that while remaining on the road the car does not go straight or at most makes eighty per hour, the solution is simple, Start and Restart Race. But the same obviously doesn't apply to the computer: if an opposing car has an accident so serious that it can no longer move there, it remains", "date": "2011-03-29", "grade": "8.0"}
