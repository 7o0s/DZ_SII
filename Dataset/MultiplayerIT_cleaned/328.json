{"name": "Tenchu  Time of The Assassins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-time-of-the-assassins.html", "text": "Acting in the shadows, in the role of a ninja chosen from a list of several characters, initially limited to the four protagonists but destined to expand after a few games, the video gamer must face a series of missions aimed at unmasking the intricate conspiracy put in place by some individuals to overthrow the lordling we work for, Gohda. These missions have different goals and objectives to achieve, and generally consist of tracking down and killing a particular enemy or collecting certain precious objects, etc., in order to allow the plot to unfold slowly. Each scenario is structured on multiple altitudes, and studied in such a way as to offer a good level of challenge to the user, who will have to plan their actions in the best possible way from time to time, trying not to attract the attention of potential enemies around the various areas. Too bad that from an aesthetic point of view many scenarios appear too sparse, geometrized, not up to the potential of PsP. At least on the outside. Let's think, for example, of the neighborhoods where some missions take place and the relative homes: they are a long repetition of screens with side gardens bordered by the usual dull walls, or still crossed by straight streams. Luckily things change a bit in the interiors, which have more than decent details and in the animations of the characters. But let's get back to the gameplay part. We were talking about the importance of acting in the shadows by exploiting the various natural elements behind which to hide and strike in silence. In these situations Tenchu unfortunately shows what are its most obvious shortcomings. Gaps that largely undermine a possible totally positive judgment. The camera is one of the worst ever seen in a video game, and it doesn't matter if it can be controlled by the user with the R key. The protagonist occupies too much of the screen and the action is shot at eye level: in this way everything that is in front of us is absolutely invisible, or almost, which, combined with the shallow depth of the visual field of our poor ninja, which he doesn't see a few meters in front of him, he contributes to the unnerving phases of alternation between the subjective view and the normal one on the part of the video gamer, in an attempt to at least understand how to move. At the risk of being caught. On the other hand, in fact, the peasants of the villages that we will visit for some missions are able to see us tens of meters away, ranting so long before we can silence them, and alarming the guards. The latter have a fairly primitive AI, to the point that it will make them perform rather illogical actions, involuntarily ruining certain actions planned with painstaking patience, which staked everything on the surprise factor. And thus forcing you to abandon every minimal stealth aspect of the current mission for chaotic ~cut & kill~ frontal clashes. In addition to the ~Story mode~ in Tenchu - Time of the Assassins there are, as mentioned just now, other interesting game modes, such as the one called ~Mission mode~, which consists in making our Pg, chosen among those available, carry out a long series of small tasks not linked to each other by any plot, structured in such a way as to put the gamer to the test, and the ~Multiplayer~, which allows four owners of Playstation Portable (and relative UMD of the game - Editor's note) to challenge each other in death-match mode within different arenas, many of which you can create yourself through the appropriate Level Editor. The only flaw: the absence of the same mode for online play. Side note for the audio sector, which can boast a good dubbing in English of the cut-scenes and musical pieces that accompany both the main phases of the game and the selection in the various menus. Conclusions Tenchu  Time of The Assassins is a game reserved almost exclusively for the most inveterate fans of the series. While revealing on balance the best Tenchu of the saga, with its settings and its great longevity, the title From Software is flawed from a technical-structural point of view. The limited depth of the field of view and the poor AI of the enemies risk immediately demotivating casual gamers or first-timers with this series. Overall, therefore, Time of the Assassins is a good portable adaptation, but being now technically outdated, it is penalized by some programming and gameplay flaws. Pros: Very high longevity. Virtually huge level editor. Nice setting. Cons: AI enemies to review. Very bad camera handling, which directly spoils the gameplay. Sometimes frustrating. There are things that change over time, and others that rhymethey remain as they are for centuries. This is also the case in the world of video games: the years go by but there are some things that remain unchanged: one of these is the game structure of the Tenchu series. If most serial video games have been able, some more, some less, to evolve, grow, adapting to the needs of today's videogamers and the ~ex~ next-generation console's, the From Software title has remained almost the same as the first appearances on Psx . The proven action / stealth structure inaugurated by the first chapter for the first Sony console, in fact, has never been updated, updated, so as to remain anchored to its past. For some this may be a good thing, since ~innovate~ does not always rhyme with ~improve~. For others, on the other hand, it could mean a limit, given that technology advances, and the tastes of enthusiasts change, and what previously seemed beautiful over time can turn out to be ugly, obsolete. Tenchu  Time of the Assassins focuses a large part of its gameplay once again on ~tradition~, on a concept that makes strategy (when at least the stupidity of the opponents does not make it vain) seasoned with a moderate speed of execution of the actions its strength.", "date": "2006-10-18", "grade": null}
