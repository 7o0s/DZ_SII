Escaped from prison with the help of a group of loyalists, Corvo wants to find out the truth about who organized the regicide and save Princess Emily, kidnapped by the conspirators and taken who knows where. To complete his mission he will have to coordinate with his new allies and wear the ~mask of the assassin~, which covers his face to prevent enemies from understanding who is attacking them. We were saying, Bethesda's intention was clearly to build a basis to prevent Dishonored 2 from arriving on the market without many users knowing the origins of the story and the implications related to the new co-star; however, the method used to make the Definitive Edition was that of the laziest remasters: a simple port of the Game of the Year Edition for PC, the one we reviewed a year ago. Dishonored: Definitive Edition is the lazy and listless remaster of a game that is still highly enjoyable today Bonuses and penalties Apparently Dishonored: Definitive Edition includes, in addition to the expansions, also all the DLC originally reserved for pre-orders at various retailers. This means that during the early stages of the adventure we will be able to get hold of a series of upgrades that end up altering the balance of the difficulty, giving us the possibility to activate a greater number of perks and to get hold of a nice nest egg to spend on weapons and upgrades. Our suggestion is to pretend nothing happened and avoid what in the end turns out to be an unfortunate shortcut compared to the progression thought by the authors, much less rapid and therefore capable of giving even greater satisfaction. The ultimate killer Corvo not only has conventional weapons, but also supernatural powers that are given to him by the mysterious ~External~, an entity that manifests itself immediately after escaping from prisons and that gives the protagonist a brand to control these abilities, all of which can be upgraded through the use of runes scattered throughout the levels. The repertoire of the character therefore ends up being composed of a large number of alternatives, which combine the use of the sword, the gun and the crossbow with the power to teleport for short distances, visualize the position of the enemies behind the walls, take possession of animals , slow down time and control powerful gusts of wind. The setting closely resembles the one used in the BioShock series, even if in that case the plasmids almost all had an offensive value, while in the Arkane Studios title they lend themselves more to the exploratory phase and stealth mechanics. In any case, the solidity of a very well thought-out combat system remains, which manages Corvo's right and left hands through the use of the respective triggers, assigning the parry to the right bumper, to be activated at the precise moment of the enemy blow for an effective counterattack. The shrewdness of the opponents is also surprising, who on more than one occasion don't just charge by brandishing their sword, but resort to pistols and grenades, or else they throw Molotov cocktails at us and use whiskey on a flame to spit fire. The result is a considerable degree of challenge, which makes the direct approach much less convenient than one might think. Good or bad? Speaking of approach, in Dishonored: Definitive Edition the goodness of a gameplay that avoids chaining us to a linear progression and indeed spurs us on in every mission to find alternative ways and methods is still clear. To give a trivial example, our first assignment will be to assassinate a corrupt high priest, who also intends to poison one of the few honest guards present among the Dunwall troops. We will be able to reach his rooms by opting for different routes, acting in silence or by facing the sentries who control the perimeter head-on, and once we reach our destination we will be able to proceed by unsheathing the sword, scoring a crossbow shot from a distance or, slyly, exchanging the glasses of wine that the priest has prepared to hit his potential victim. Then there is a further, important element that concerns our conduct: if we choose to take a ~brazen~ path and to assassinate a large number of people, at the end of the story we will bewill end a gloomy ending, where instead by stunning the enemies or avoiding the fight altogether we will be able to aspire to a better conclusion, for a total of three main variants. However, these are only some of the many possibilities that will open before our eyes during a rather long campaign, further enriched by the presence of the expansions The Brigmore Witches and The Dunwall Dagger, as well as the challenges of the Dunwall City Trials package, which will bring the total duration of the game easily over twenty-five hours. Xbox One goals Given the presence of the various DLCs, there are eighty Objectives present in Dishonored: Definitive Edition, for a total of 1640 Gamerpoints. Some of them are obtained simply by proceeding with the story and eliminating certain characters, but many achievements are instead linked to the replayability factor and depend on the conduct we choose to take during the adventure. Lazy remaster In short, on the gameplay, structure and narrative front, Dishonored is still a step above many recent productions, and this Definitive Edition is undoubtedly an excellent opportunity to recover the game if, for a reason or for the 'other, you missed it. At the same time, however, we are faced with extremely lazy work as far as the technical sector is concerned, practically translated verbatim from the PC version but with one important difference: the frame rate locked at thirty frames per second instead of sixty. The latter is a performance that can also be obtained on medium / low-end configurations, therefore it is evident that there has been very little effort on the part of the developers to push an old and well-run engine like the Unreal Engine 3 on the hardware of the consoles of new generation. In terms of definition, the differences compared to what was seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are clear, both for the resolution brought to 1080p and for the presence of obviously sharper textures, but the game drags behind shortcomings that today stand out in such a way particular: the flatness of the surfaces, daughter of a very little sophisticated effects, and the use of rather woody animations, made with largely outdated methods. In short, if in 2012 the strong artistic characterization saved the technical sector of Dishonored, three years later it is difficult to justify it, especially in view of a remaster made in this way.", "date": "2015-08-31", "grade": "7.9"}
