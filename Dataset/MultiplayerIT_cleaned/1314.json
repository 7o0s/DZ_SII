{"name": "Smash Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/smash-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Sometimes the innovations are simply the result of an intersection, a mix of things that have already been widely seen but perhaps not in that specific context, not with that type of implementation. As you are about to read in our review of Smash Legends, the new title developed by 5minlab for LINE corresponds perfectly to this description. In fact, we are talking about a multiplayer-based game which on the one hand strongly winks at the mechanics of Super Smash Bros., including the ~rocket start~ of the defeated opponent; on the other hand, it uses a Brawl Stars-style structure (which, however, in turn refers to various other productions) to involve us in the gradual unlocking of characters, upgrades, maps and modes. Structure Smash Legends and its cel-shaded characters inspired by the world of fairy tales. The wide and varied progression system of Smash Legends, as mentioned, gradually provides for the unlocking of new characters, maps and modes. The first is a three-versus-three in which two teams must compete for control of a small square in the center of the scenario, occupying it for enough time to score four points. The second mode which unlocks quickly is a mini battle royale open to eight players, in this case without respawns and with the simple objective of eliminating all other participants to remain alone. After that, as you collect more medals, comes a traditional three-on-three deathmatch, a kind of Capture the Flag and even a one-on-one duel. Smash Legends, the first territory-based mode. Progress and openings that are supported by a roster of characters currently made up of ten Legends, all freely inspired by the world of fairy tales: starting from a Peter Pan armed with a huge saber, then passing through a Little Red Riding Hood with the ability to hide and attack opponents with huge energy scissors, or even Captain Hook, with his double guns that make him unapproachable. The references to monetization and microtransactions are very evident and it is clear that whoever pays gets substantial in-game advantages, but all that Smash Legends has to offer can also be obtained simply by playing, ringing victories and opening the traditional chests: after a few hours you will find yourself with a rather complete set of contents. Gameplay Smash Legends renders hit impacts very well. So let's come to the gameplay of the game and its references to the aforementioned Super Smash Bros. It starts with a very simple and well-implemented touch control system, with a repositionable virtual stick on the left side of the screen and four buttons on the right side for jumping, attack, special and super move, the last two subject to cooldowns. Fighting in Smash Legends is more a question of timing and precision, because you have to hit your opponent at the right time and maybe concentrate your maneuvers together with a partner for the maximum effectiveness. Also in this case the ring-out costs a life, but unfortunately there is no double jump to be able to recover on the fly. Smash Legends includes the ring-out mechanic, so be careful not to get kicked out. The yield of the impacts is excellent and well valued, which helps to make the clashes fun and returns a great sense of satisfaction when we manage to launch an attack capable of literally sending an enemy left with little vital energy into orbit. The respawn times, however, are short and do not create frustration. The various modes that can be unlocked undoubtedly have the merit of adding variety to the experience, otherwise limited to a few scenarios and the same situations as always, but unfortunately it happens that the matchmaking is highly unbalanced, in one way or another, resulting in excessively easy or literally impossible matches. Technical realization Smash Legends is available not only on iOS and Android but also on PC, although the latter version does not seem to have thrilled users who are now accustomed to other competitive productions. Cross-play, however, gives rise to some of the balancing problems we have just talked about, which will only be resolved if the game reaches a very large audience, especially on mobile. Beyond these aspects, the technical implementation of the game is really excellent, with very well characterized characters, bright colors and cel shading to give the whole thing a real cartoon look, with a frame rate that always remains fluid on the iPhone 12 Pro. The only flaw perhaps the scenarios , a bit dull and devoid of high notes, while the music effectively accompanies the action.", "date": "2021-04-29", "grade": "7.8"}
