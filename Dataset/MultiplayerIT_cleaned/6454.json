The first DLC, The Jaws of Hakkon, does not differ from the original system, on the contrary, it is grafted onto its skeleton, adding a series of missions that mix with the others, if you have not completed them. The Jaws of Hakkon, DLC for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Here is our review! Not for newbies If you want to try your hand at the epic feats of expansion, we show you how to reach the starting area. Meanwhile, it is essential to make sure you have reached at least level twenty of your character. Go to the ~Skyhold~ fortress and call up the war map; in the area to your right, i.e. in the Ferelden region, the related mission in the Frost Basin will appear in the lower left. In reality, as you know, the level of the enemy adapts to yours, in fact, however, as for the rest of the game, if you take the field to the minimum level required, a few drops of sweat may drip. Those who have demonstrated their dedication to the various campaigns, arriving well above the basic request, will wipe out any enemy with their hands tied behind their backs. A real pity that, also in this sense, there has not been a better balance of difficulty. The story invites us to explore the mystery of an inquisitor, Ameridan, who disappeared eight hundred years earlier. An interview with Professor Bram Kenric, a sort of archaeologist, but above all a scholar of the University of Orlais, kicks off the mission. The area in which you will be immersed is truly breathtaking, with some apparent climatic changes and related iconic landscapes in which, if you were on site, you would hardly not take a selfie. The sidequests are perhaps the most inspired ones, also to better understand the troubled events involving the conflicting relationship between the villagers and the ~savages~. Ultimately, your task will be to run from one point to another on the map, repeating the same actions (or the same massacres) for quests with different names, but almost always doing the same things. Without wanting to reveal anything, it is right to know that in the final part, but only in that, the attention will return to rise above the guard levels, both from the point of view of the plot and for the tactical work required to eliminate the latest threats. Ultimately, we honestly had other expectations for the first Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC. If on the one hand we note BioWare's willingness to introduce small improvements through patches, even in beta - to prevent fans from committing suicide over too many changes - on the other hand we would have expected greater care for a DLC than it's not too cheap either.", "date": "2015-03-27", "grade": null}
