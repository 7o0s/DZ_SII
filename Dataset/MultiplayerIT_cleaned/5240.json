It's just the beginning: the Dark Gods and the forces of Chaos want to throw the whole world into darkness, and only a handful of valiant heroes will be able to oppose their evil designs. Let's talk about the protagonists of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, the cooperative-based action game released exactly one year ago on PC and now making its debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The debut of the title developed by Fatshark had definitely impressed us, thanks to the quality of gameplay that closely resembled the mechanics of Left 4 Dead, however putting at our disposal five very different warriors from each other and capable of a complex progression, through the unlocking of weapons and equipment components, as well as their enhancement. However, only four of them will be able to try their hand at the battle for the destiny of humanity, immersed in the gloomy and fascinating atmospheres of the franchise created by Games Workshop. Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is an exciting co-op action game, but with some limitations on consoles Here is the cast The cooperative multiplayer of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide allows four users to participate online in the same game, but the roster of characters is made up of five interesting figures as mentioned: the witch hunter Victor Saltzpyre, armed with a sword and a double pistol ; dwarf ranger Bardin Goreksson, swift but devastating with ax and shield; the witch of light Sienna Feugonasus, capable of throwing fire projectiles at enemies and finishing them off with a magic blade; the elf sentinel Kerillian, infallible from a distance thanks to his bow, but able to defend himself even in melee brandishing two daggers; and finally Imperial Private Markus Kruber, who goes about armed with a mighty warhammer and a musket that can wipe out more than one Skaven. Choosing one character rather than another translates into a very different approach to the game, given everyone's unique skills and the need to maintain a certain balance in the team, especially when you have to face almost infinite waves of enemies and watch your back. continuous. Certainly there is the element of specialization, which translates not only into an increase in the level of experience of the individual warrior, but also into the unlocking of new and more powerful weapons with which to equip him, which can be further improved thanks to the forge found in the Inn of the Luna Rossa, the hub from which you can access matchmaking and where you can meet between one mission and another. Mission Impossible? The console version of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide includes all the content released on PC over the months, which means that after choosing the character you can access a quick game, with a random map, or refine your search and select the mode between ~Adventure~ and ~Last Stand~, as well as the level of difficulty. The ~Adventure~ mode represents the fulcrum of the Fatshark title, with a set of rather large and complex scenarios, characterized by different situations and objectives. We will be asked to explore deserted neighborhoods and eliminate all the Skaven and special enemies present, activate switches and resist waves of opponents, collect objects and place them in certain areas, all until we reach a location from which we can escape aboard a chariot. Even structurally, in short, the similarities with the shooter produced by Valve are wasted, and there are even the deadly tanks, which announce their entry into the field through ferocious grunts and require quite a few well-aimed shots to be able to be shot down. Similarly, some special enemies can isolate one of the party members and attack them, reducing them to the point of death, until a teammate arrives to free them. Even the use of objects, which can be passed from one user to another (see the classic example of the medkits), follows what was seen in Left 4 Dead, together with the presence of bombs and potions that increase the strength or speed of our character. The variety of situations is still excellent, and playing together with friends proves to be an exciting experience. The ~Last Stand~ mode, which is unlocked only after completing the mission ~The Horn of Magnus~, instead offers a horde within two different maps, ~Citizen Council~ and ~The Fall~. The objective is therefore to resist the onslaught of ever more numerous waves of enemies, who assault the stronghold we guard from all sides and must be absolutely rejected, all at degrees of difficulty onhigher than normal. An option for expert users, in short, in which strategy and coordination count for a lot. Playstation 4 trophies The achievement framework of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide sees the presence of forty Trophies, obtainable through the completion of all missions as well as the achievement of specific numerical objectives: destroy five hundred objects, use ten medical supplies on allies, kill five Skaven with a grenade, reach the hundredth rank, smelt twenty-five items in the forge, and so on. The console version If from a structural point of view the console version of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide has nothing to envy to the PC counterpart, from a technical point of view the matter is different. The game uses graphic elements taken from Games Workshop productions for its interface, which will certainly please fans of the Warhammer universe but which does not marry perfectly with the accessibility criteria required by a product of this type. During the review we talked about how graphically the Fatshark title wasn't exceptional, since it uses fairly generic assets and fails to enhance settings that actually boast a certain potential in terms of effects. However, since the technical aspect was purely functional to the fun and immediate action of the game, he gladly turned a blind eye. Unfortunately on consoles it goes from the original sixty frames per second to thirty, and this further depresses the visual quality of the experience, which becomes extremely chaotic and confused during the most agitated phases. With a little practice you manage not to notice it too much, after all there are no significant drops in fluidity, but it is clear that this leaves you disappointed. Also because the frame rate directly affects the combat mechanics, which are a bit of a dance of blows and parries, in which you move back and forth to avoid taking damage when the opponents are few or more tough than average. and relying on less precise timing can have dire consequences. Another problem we encountered in the testing phase concerns the matchmaking, which in custom games takes too much time to get going, not to mention the ~Last Defense~ mode, which is very sparsely populated. The territorial selector, present in the options, should in theory guarantee the possibility of finding matches even in areas other than ours, but the doubt is that today, thanks to a price that is not exactly accessible, there are not many online users.", "date": "2016-10-12", "grade": "7.5"}
