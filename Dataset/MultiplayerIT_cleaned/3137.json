Now, with the expansion finally available on Magic: The Gathering Arena (physically it will arrive in May due to the problems with the COVID-19) we are therefore ready to give you our opinion. An extremely inspired content that also introduces the Kaiju in collaboration with Toho. Monsters and news Therefore, after having visited the plane rich in classical mythology of Theros again, the action moves to the plane of Ikoria, a world in which men and monsters coexist in an unpeaceful way and vie for control of the territory. In this scenario it is therefore easy to understand that the center of the expansion is a massive advent of (non-human) monster cards that dominate the scene. On an artistic level we are faced with a huge customization work with disparate monsters with the most absurd sizes and features that take inspiration both from monsters of legends and from creatures of ancient iconography and from personal inspirations of the artists. In this marriage of madness we can find huge winged saber-toothed tigers, mutant megalodons and very dangerous smiling otters. On a practical level, however, these cards bring with them several new features and a welcome return: mutation, mechanical counters, companion and cycle, the specific keywords of Ikoria: Land of Behemoths. If as regards Cycle we don't have much to say, it is in fact a mechanic that returns after having been widely present in the past, on the other hand, on the new mechanics we can see an excellent amalgam both with the Ikoria cards that do not have these characteristics, and with cards from the previous expansions, thus creating one of the best synergies in terms of variety in deck building, truly commendable. Speaking of these new mechanics introduced, Mutation is certainly one of the most central: in fact, it will allow you to use a card with mutation as an enhancement of another card (by physically placing it under it) by offering the superior card its own abilities or to use the card with mutation as a shell to absorb the special abilities of another card (by physically placing it on top of it). To do this though, the creature card with mutation will be played for its mutation cost (such as three random mana and one red) rather than its normal casting cost (such as two random mana and one red). Together with Mutation (but also alone) you can then find the mechanics of Counters with Keyword which offer the same functioning as +1/+1 Counters, for example, they allow you to assign an ability to a creature (trample, fly, etc. ). Last but not least, the Companion mechanic, which is a mechanic that takes up what happens in Commander mode, but changing several aspects. In Ikoria: Land of Behemoths there are ten legendary creature companion cards that, if used, will become part of the sideboard, starting the game like Commanders. To be played these cards oblige you to compose your deck following specific dictates and, once the card has been followed and played, it will behave like a normal creature and can therefore be eliminated, put into the graveyard, exiled, etc. Unlike what happened in Theros where the Devotion mechanic outclassed the others in terms of effectiveness and use, in Ikoria all the aforementioned mechanics, at least so far, are having an equivalent use in decidedly competitive decks. Speaking therefore of the cards and of what Ikoria brings as a side dish, we must say that these days we are witnessing a full-bodied dominance of blue decks with great use of Cycle and Companion with for example the ~Mono Blue Kraken Cycle~ or ~Companion Gyruda ~ that are dominating Standard format. However, what is perhaps the main novelty of Ikroia lies in what the expansion brings with it as a side dish: the Kaiju. In fact, the partnership with Toho has made it possible to bring special promo cards linked to the Godzilla universe into the game, with the famous King of The Monsters who dominates from the top of his legend. As we have also had the opportunity to explain to you in a dedicated special, the Kaiju cards are promo cards (obtainable on the Arena in a random way in the bundle of sachets) which have only a graphic effect by associating themselves with a specific legendary creature card and modifying only its appearance, becoming a full art of the Toho Kaiju in question. An example is the aforementioned Gyruda which in the Kaiju version becomes Gigan. We are therefore not faced with a use of the Kaiju because they are effective on the ba fieldsize, but rather a use if necessary for the beauty of the art of the cards and for the satisfaction of fielding some of the most iconic Kaiju in history.", "date": "2020-04-20", "grade": "8.8"}
