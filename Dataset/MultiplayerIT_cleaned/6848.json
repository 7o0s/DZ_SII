Last week we told you about the excellent Endless Legend, a big surprise, qualitatively speaking, for the world of Civilization-style turn-based strategy. This week it's the turn of Starpoint Gemini 2, another title from which we didn't expect much, but which in the end managed to involve us. Having to describe it briefly, we can define it as a space simulator with various role-playing game aspects, in which you can take part in a campaign with missions to be tackled in sequence, or wander free through deep space in search of objectives and secondary missions in full autonomy. The goal is the classic one of the genre: to get richer and richer to buy ever bigger spaceships and, perhaps, get to have a real fleet with which to dominate. In reality, the beginning is not the most exciting. The tutorial is quite useless for understanding all the game mechanics and the introductory part makes requests expecting the player to already know how to move and what to do, or to read pages of dialogues to find the information he needs. Unfortunately, this lack of clarity is felt until you have mastered the controls and understood the different aspects of the game perfectly. Let's say it takes about two hours to effectively kick in, but that's two hours well spent. Fortunately, Starpoint Gemini 2 has a lot to offer in terms of content and once entangled in its coils one completely forgets the initial difficulties, free as one is to wander through deep space. We tried Starpoint Gemini 2 for at least five thousand light years and it didn't seem bad at all Space, the final frontier Another unconvincing aspect of Starpoint Gemini 2 is the single player campaign, made up of a long sequence of missions that tell a very unexciting space-scale revenge story. Of course, the first missions are useful for learning the basics of the game, but otherwise we are not dealing with a very rich title, narratively speaking. Unfortunately, many information known only if the first chapter of the series has been played, especially those concerning the background of the warring factions, are taken for granted. Trust me: leave the campaign as soon as possible, perhaps even completing it, why not, and select the freeroam mode, because this is where Starpoint Gemini 2 blossoms and reveals all its potential. Faced with infinite space, man feels less than a microbe. It's kind of the same feeling you get when you look at the Little Green Men Games title map, where thousands of space stations revolve around countless planets located at sidereal distances from each other. At first you don't have access to the whole map, i.e. you can't easily go where you want. To travel in hyperspace you have to use the T-Gates, too bad they cost a fortune! Before leaving on a long journey, it is therefore necessary to accumulate enough resources and, perhaps, obtain a better ship than the initial one, possibly equipped with a T-Drive to speed up travel. Fortunately, the widening of the range never feels forced. Indeed, it is managed in a natural and satisfying way, with the player always motivated to explore new areas in search of enemies, especially pirates, and resources to sell in the stations. Progression The progression of Starpoint Gemini 2 is typical of space simulators: it starts with a very small ship with limited firepower and ends up with large transport ships or real war cruisers. Meanwhile there is the whole game, which is the hunting around hunting for missions and commercial affairs. From this point of view the possibilities are immense: do you like the action? Then you'll always find a bounty to hunt, or a target to take down. Do you want to live from trade? Then you just have to study the most convenient routes and bring the goods from one part of the galaxy to another. Do you like the idea of living illegally? Take up smuggling or space piracy. The only flaw of the system is a certain basic repetitiveness of the missions, which after a few hours all begin to look alike. It must also be said that the genre does not allow too many flights of fancy and that in the long run what matters is the exploration and the ability to plan one's moves, not so much the individual missions. Moreover, there is a large margin of autonomy in things to do andone can safely progress without worrying too much about filling oneself with homework. What matters is the money, whether it is obtained with honest trade or with brutal acts of piracy is up to you to choose. Fight The combat system also allows for a good level of customization. At the beginning of the game you have to choose a class among three (Commander, Gunner and Engineer), giving priority more to direct action or teamwork, so you have to move around avoiding attacking too powerful enemies with a small, ill-equipped ship and planning ambushes and direct assaults. During the fights, Starpoint Gemini 2 allows both to have every aspect managed by the player, and to leave the task of shooting to the crew. Each class has its own talents, but none are fixative. Let's say that the gameplay from this point of view is well balanced and, even if it is not possible for us to show you all the feasible choices, we hope you have understood that the level of customization is very wide, with a myriad of weapons, armor and various gadgets which ones to choose, even by raiding them from enemy spaceships, and with a quantity of tactics that can be used to achieve one's objectives hardly counted elsewhere. Just to give a couple of examples, you can face an enemy ship by transforming it into a space hulk, or you can board it by killing its crew and reselling the vehicle to make more money, perhaps keeping something useful for you. So much variety and freedom is reflected in a longevity that reaches hundreds of hours, with the player becoming more and more aware of the implications of his choices. Not bad, apart from a few jolts.", "date": "2014-10-10", "grade": "8.0"}
