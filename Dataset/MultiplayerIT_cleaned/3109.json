A welcoming home for all those small productions, even successful ones, which today have a second chance to shine among the pages of a store that is still not excessively crowded and on an innovative console, capable of highlighting some peculiarities not fully expressed on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One. Today is the turn of the Book of Demons review, a hack 'n' slash similar to Diablo in some respects that introduces unique and interesting mechanics, capable of making it a video game to try at least once. In our review of the PC version a few months ago, we highlighted both its strengths and some weaknesses, is it different this time around? Welcome to the Cartaverse Take a large amount of Diablo, add a pinch of board game and season it all with a splash of card games: here is the basic recipe for Book of Demons. The original idea and the concept are extremely intriguing, above all because at first contact you find them to make a product capable of standing out from the crowd, they were really all there. The 505 Games title could have revolutionized a genre, bringing a breath of fresh air and becoming the hitherto missing link between classic hack 'n' slash and more innovative titles such as Slay the Spyre, also present on Nintendo eShop for quite some time. Unfortunately, however, Book of Demons is lost in the game structure, resulting excessively simplified and at times unnerving. On Nintendo Switch Book of Demons remains unchanged in its main components, in history, in longevity and even in the defects, however, sharpening that feeling of woodiness that already on PC had prevented it from totally invading our hearts. The story slavishly follows that of the Blizzard title and will pit us against hordes of undead, spiders and demons, accompanying us in a fast descent towards the final battle against a huge red devil. The references are endless and they are abused all too often, so much so that when you meet the first boss, a butcher demon, there will be no surprise and amazement effect, especially in long-standing players. Those that were meant to be homages become so continuous dj-vu that they do nothing but take away the freshness of a title that would have deserved a clearly distinguishable soul of its own. In short, much of the originality in the characters and in the story was sacrificed to play on the nostalgia effect, an awkward way to saturate those eight hours of gameplay required to complete the main campaign. Even the interface, with the two round vials of life and mana, is all too closely reminiscent of Diablo, although the use of the resource for spells is used here in an extremely diversified way. In your descent into the underworld you will find magic cards and equipment that you can wear to become stronger, to be further developed during the adventure, an all in all fun loot hunt capable of giving its best in roguelike mode, where weighing up the he correct use of the cards becomes of paramount importance and where the randomness of the treasures offers that added challenge that never hurts. Inconvenient controls Therefore, if for better or worse the game follows perfectly what was seen on PC, this new version suffers from additional problems, derived from a less comfortable control system than the mouse and keyboard combination. Instead of being able to simply attack enemies by selecting them with the mouse, your pointer will this time be linked to the analog stick, making the already not too clear combat phases a real hell if you are surrounded by multiple enemies at the same time. The impossibility of moving freely then, anchored to pre-established corridors in your descent into the underworld, will make everything even more mechanical and difficult. The last problematic piece is the selection of the cards through the interface, delegated to the rear bumpers, with a system that has nothing immediate and practical, as is customary in this kind of games. If from the point of view of the controls on Switch we are not there, the Flexoscope manages to shine more on this platform. This is basically a level duration calculator that learns and adapts according to your play, providing you with a very accurate estimate of the time it will take you to complete the next dungeon. This feature, which on PC actually didn't make any particular sense, marries beautifully with the idea of a portable console, being able to know in advance how long your next game session will last and thus avoiding having tohaving to abruptly interrupt the descent into hell.", "date": "2020-05-04", "grade": "6.5"}
