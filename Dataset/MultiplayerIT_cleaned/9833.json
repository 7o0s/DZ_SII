{"name": "Grow: Song of the Evertree", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grow-song-of-the-evertree-recensione.html", "text": "The exchange of influences within the world of video games is constant and the contamination of ideas, mechanics and atmospheres between different productions is a fundamental part of every developer's creative process. Many games can be compared due to substantially coincident characteristics, at least on paper. However, the identity value of one game out of another hundred is given by the way in which these elements are united, merged into a single amalgam capable of standing out from the competition (or rather, from the rest of the available offer). This is one of the themes that made us think the most as we tried to identify the nature of Grow: Song of the Evertree. Inside we found a bit of everything: from great titles like Animal Crossing, to other perhaps less high-sounding ones like Stardew Valley, to even get to a whole series of management and city builders (we even saw a game that the most have forgotten, i.e. the Toy Story 3 tie-in, precisely in its ~Toy Box~ mode). Let's see if the title developed by Prideful Sloth and published by 505 Games has managed to find its identity in this review of Grow: Song of the Evertree. Classic fairytale storytelling Grow: Song of the Evertree has its narrative roots in the most popular and often abused fantasy. In an imaginary universe lost in the folds of time, a dark and evil evil, the Withering, has struck the Eternal Tree, a huge plant that can hold entire worlds on its branches. At the base of the latter, a long time ago, there was a large community, but the disease that struck the tree forced the inhabitants to abandon their homes. We play the role of an alchemist, the only one able to understand the needs of the Eternal Tree. Our task is to eradicate evil from the land of our ancestors and free the heart of the mammoth plant of life. An incipit, this, which by now tastes stale, but which still remains functional for narrating those particular types of stories that are not excessively complicated and capable of immediately involving the little ones. Don't expect an intricate story full of twists and turns. What you will be faced with is a concise and direct narration, which focuses on expressive simplicity, carrying out its task honestly, without infamy and without praise. A managerial nature Grow: Song of the Evertree: Fishing is one of the activities that we can do in the game The first contact with the game immediately brings to mind a parallel with Animal Crossing. Between watering cans, fishing rods, hatchets and nets for catching insects (complete with a sneaky approach), the first hours of the game seem like a copy (not necessarily a caricature) of the successful Nintendo series. However, the game then has the opportunity to redeem its independence when one realizes a more accentuated management complexity not only of one's own resources, but of the world that one finds oneself saving with harmonic songs and maximization of the harvest.Grow: Song of the Evertree is divided into two distinct sections: on the one hand we find the thriving city that we have to rebuild, on the other the branches on which we have the task of planting new worlds through magical seeds. The management of the village has the traits of a city builder, with the possibility of constructing new buildings, of decorating every corner of the available space and of managing both the residence and the working occupation of the inhabitants. The more the passions and interests of citizens match the jobs assigned to them, the happier they will be: the better their happiness, the greater our earnings (in game currency) at the beginning of each day. The goal is to expand the city until all seven districts are freed from the clutches of withering. Grow: Song of the Evertree: We can rebuild the city at the foot of the Tree in any way we like The branches of the tree, on the other hand, are a bit like our personal garden. Here we have to clean up the area and cultivate new plants, so as to bring back the specific fauna of that natural habitat, determined by the elementary combination of the seed of origin, which we have the possibility of composing in our laboratory with the various ~essences~ (obtained taking care of our ~garden~, or thanks to the completion of objectives). As we manage to free the heart of the Eternal from the Withering, the tree will grow again, providing more and more spaces to ~terraform~. Once the potential limit of the small micro-world created has been reached, we can choose whether to eliminate it and make room for a new biome, or whether to continue obtaining resources from the latter (also thanks to the help of some small workers from the Eternicus community, the first inhabitantsof the Eternal Tree). If the city management manages to convince, the mechanics of the worlds are very repetitive, given that we find ourselves practically always performing the same actions, day after day (uproot the weed, plant the seed, water sprouts, tame creatures, catch insects, and so on). A repetitiveness that we have found (in a much less invasive and unnerving way, it must be said) also in the diary of objectives to be completed and in the missions that are assigned to us by fellow citizens. In essence, variety is more of a visual frill than a true foundation of the individual gameplay macro-sets that make up the game. How many video games in a single video game? Grow: Song of the Evertree: The game has several game situations, but the connection between them is very weak When you start to feel the weight of some repetitive actions, you are quite amazed, because in any case Grow: Song of the Evertree presents a certain variety in the presentation of the game world (mostly derivative). We have caves to explore, puzzles to solve, platforming sequences, chests to open, alchemical recipes to prepare, structures to customize, not to mention the aforementioned management forms. In short, there is a little bit of everything. But a variety in the structure of the game does not imply a variety in the situations that we actually experience. The title seems separated into watertight compartments, completely separated from each other. Each section works, in its own way, but lacks that binder capable of uniting so many different and, often, even discordant elements. The deception of the overall impact Grow: Song of the Evertree: graphically the title is quite pleasant, if you don't get too close to the game elements Technically, Grow: Song of the Evertree has its strengths. At least when you look at it from a distance. Indeed, the title is graphically quite effective when you have an overview of the game world. Walking around your own city, with the imposing structures that compose it, perhaps at the first light of dawn and with gigantic creatures moving on the horizon, is certainly fascinating. However, as soon as all those directorial choices that lead the game room to get excessively close to environments and characters begin to appear, the visual flaws arrive. This result is given by a certain crudeness of the models, compensated (mainly in terms of distance) by good texture quality. This fluctuating technical workmanship can be found in the creation of the animations, excessively crude, as well as in the management of the lighting, which is overall functional, but sometimes truly unbalanced and poorly cared for. Grow: Song of the Evertree: the winged creature that allows us to travel quickly One thing about which, however, we have nothing to say about is the soundtrack, derivative as much as you like, but extremely effective and perfectly fitting with the spirit of the game, evidently divided between East and West. The Italian localization was also definitely appreciated, with a very varied and adequate terminology (despite some ~hiccups~ during the implementation of the texts within the game).", "date": "2021-11-19", "grade": "7.0"}
