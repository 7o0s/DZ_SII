Kentaro Miura's manga, whose Japanese publication began way back in 1989, in fact lends itself excellently to the typical structure of Omega Force productions, given the abundance of ~one against a thousand~ style fights and even the bosses that characterize the original work. Well, after several hours of play with a view to a campaign made up of four different narrative arcs, which cover the events up to the Italian volume number 63, we could only confirm this impression: Koei Tecmo hit the mark in winning this license, although for obvious reasons we are unlikely to see a sequel anytime soon. Will it take another seventeen years, like the ones that have passed since the release of Sword of the Berserk: Gut's Rage on the Dreamcast? Let's hope not. Berserk and the Band of the Hawk demonstrates how Kentaro Miura's manga was perfect for a musou The King of Wishes The plot of Berserk, for those unfamiliar with it, revolves around an unbeatable Black Warrior, Gatsu, who wears the so-called ~symbol of sacrifice~ on his neck, a sign that attracts evil spirits and Apostles: human beings who have exploited the power of Bejelit to transform themselves into immortal monsters, sacrificing what they held dearest in the world in order to embrace a ruthless darkness. Gatsu's mission is to find and kill them using the Dragonslayer, a huge sword that only he can wield, making up for the lack of his left arm and right eye thanks to an effective iron prosthesis (which hides a cannon! ) and battle experience like no other. In fact, Gatsu's story begins a long time before: raised by a mercenary, he was used to fighting since he was a child and always using swords larger than normal, going through a series of vicissitudes that led him years later to join the legendary Squad dei Falchi, an army led by the charismatic Grifis, a splendid leader with ephebic features. Endowed with boundless ambition, Grifis will at some point lead to a devastating event for Gatsu and his companions, becoming the target of the blind fury that characterizes the protagonist when we meet him for the first time in the comic. This initial narrative arc, called ~The Golden Age~, is accompanied in the game by the sequences of the three animated films produced between 2012 and 2013, whereas for the subsequent storylines this important support is missing, replaced by cutscenes in Still good quality game. Zodd's prophecy As mentioned at the beginning, Berserk and the Band of the Hawk features a single player campaign that follows the events of the manga in a relatively faithful way, modifying the traits of the protagonist as the story progresses and consequently equipping him with new weapons and ability. The four narrative arcs are divided into over forty missions that take about fifteen hours to complete, provided you immediately select the ~hard~ difficulty level. In fact, using the normal degree of challenge we come across what has always been a defect of the various Dynasty Warriors, that is very simple and trivial clashes even against the bosses, who rarely manage to corner us or even force us to use the parade. Where the ~berserk~ level is excessive, given that the many enemies (over one hundred and fifty) that can crowd the screen at the same time just one hit each is enough to reduce us immediately to the point of death, the ~hard~ degree turns out to be the right choice for a worthy challenge. With this parenthesis closed, let's move on to the gameplay, which is the traditional one of the Musou and suffers from the same limitations, in this case a great repetitiveness. By making your warrior grow, it is true that you unlock new combos, but in any case we are talking about maneuvers that are carried out by pressing only the Square and Triangle keys, trying to raise the rage bar and therefore unleash the fury of the berserker: a mode in which our character feels no pain and cannot be stopped (unless he suffers powerful attacks), and which in turn leads to the loading of a devastating super move capable of cleaning up the scenario almost entirely, solving situations in an instant intricate. There is the classic on-screen map view, with hot spots to reach and enemies to take down, although in this case the goal is to defeat certain opponents or, more rarely, protect your companions or escort citizens to safety , instead of conquering sectors of the scenary like in episodes of Dynasty Warriors. The desired increase in thickness is therefore lacking for a combat system that does not particularly emphasize blows, or at least remains distant from the rival productions of Capcom (Sengoku Basara), also putting on the table a series of ranged weapons (the arm-cannon, the repeating crossbow, bombs, throwing knives and so on) which are however less effective than one would have expected. Added to this is a loot and crafting function that allows you to equip a series of items, fuse them to multiply their bonuses and improve their effectiveness by using precious stones in exchange for the money earned in battle: an element implemented in a somewhat boring way, but which in the more advanced stages proves to be fundamental in order to be able to defeat the toughest opponents. Beyond this, there is undoubtedly the great advantage of being able to count on a rich and inspired bestiary like the one born from the visionary mind of Kentaro Miura, a factor that manages to always guarantee great interest to the experience. In fact, the developers of Omega Force didn't have to do much in terms of design, limiting themselves to translating the monstrous Apostles into the role of boss on the screen, starting with the unbeatable Zodd to get to the Count who is seen in the first issues of the manga, to the mad inquisitor Mozgus and gradually to the other formidable, gruesome opponents of which this work is full. Playstation 4 trophies As a good musou, Berserk and the Band of the Hawk allows you to unlock many of its forty Trophies by performing an increasing number of kills in battle, as well as of course by completing the narrative arcs that make up the single player campaign. There is no shortage of achievements related to character enhancement and the collection of objects, for those willing to replay the same missions several times. Everyone has to chase a dream The Berserk and the Band of the Hawk campaign is supported by two support modes, the Free Mode and the Endless Eclipse. The first simply allows you to replay all the completed missions using the characters unlocked up to that point: there are eight plus two variants, so we are very far from the numbers of the various Dynasty Warriors but it is possible to count on a good diversification, given that each warrior has different combos and specials. The Endless Eclipse mode is instead a curious survival in which we will find ourselves facing the monsters that populate the Eclipse, the event in which the components of the Hand of God are summoned, with the possibility of advancing and selecting ~dreams~ by counting from a part on the support of the mysterious Skull Knight, on the other on a single bar of vital energy which generally cannot be restored, sending us back to the starting point in case of defeat. It is a fairly rich side dish, in particular the Endless Eclipse, but whose charm is relative: where the limits of the campaign are compensated by a powerful plot, these modes cannot count on the same narrative support and playing them therefore turns into a practice reserved only for die-hard musou fans. On the technical front, the splendid characters and the highly inspired monsters created by Miura's pencil, as mentioned, are very well represented on the screen thanks to a now mature use of cel shading and the exploitation of the capabilities of current generation platforms, which have substantially limited the phenomenon of the pop-up of enemies a few meters away which characterized the chapters of Dynasty Warriors until some time ago. The game runs at a fairly stable sixty frames per second, with no noticeable dips even when there are literally hundreds of enemies on screen, but the quality of the scenarios remains mixed - in the end, these are mere backgrounds for the classic action of this genre of games, but more attention in relation to the locations would not have hurt. Yes, some maps have a fair degree of detail and the foreground textures never lack definition, but in terms of geometry there is still a lot of work to do. In the specific case of Berserk it is also necessary to criticize the censorship: despite the PEGI 18 classification, the developers have cut certain sequences of the anime (with the only exception of a very bloody scene, but which probably had an important role for the characterization of the protagonist) and likewise the in-game graphics have a lot of blood but no real dismemberment: the enemies are thrown away rather than falling into pieces under the blows of the Dragon Slayer, but since the animated trees happen to be cuthalfway through it seems to be a decision that has nothing to do with the purely technical aspect. Sin. As far as the sound is concerned, the music is well made and the dialogues in Japanese convey the inevitable intensity to which Japanese actors have always accustomed us, but a localization in Italian is completely missing, given that the texts are in English.", "date": "2017-02-21", "grade": "8.0"}
