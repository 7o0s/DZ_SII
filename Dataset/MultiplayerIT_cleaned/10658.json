This time they are digitized, of course, and through Microsoft's online distribution platform they have the opportunity to relive good times to rusty old fans, or to challenge those who still today enjoy the wonderful hobby created by Richard Garfield for Wizards in multiplayer. of The Coast. The rules, the feeling and the goals are therefore the same. Two powerful wizards called Dimension Walkers battle each other using a deck of 60 cards each, at a minimum, made up of lands, spells, and creatures. Each land (there are five types) produces mana, or energy through which it is possible to summon our army, spells and artifacts. Each player has 20 life points, and of course whoever resets his opponent's energy first wins. The rules are simple to learn, but the quantity of cards (on which the criteria for use and characteristics are always specified) and their diversity means that each player can create his own winning strategy: faster and more defensive decks, or slow and powerful, or even sets of cards that focus more on spells. All the charm of a game of Magic is beautifully reproduced on screen. A real pity, however, not being able to create your own library from scratch (this is the name of the deck), but having to choose between pre-established sets of various colors and tactical nature. Following the single player story mode, through which we have to face various challenges, however, up to 17 special cards can be unlocked per deck, which can be inserted or removed from our personal library. There is therefore the possibility of customizing, but it is still very limited and does not leave us the freedom to be able to eliminate some excessively useless cards from the basic set. Xbox 360 goals Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers is also giving away the canonical 200 points to be obtained, through 12 objectives. Apart from a few rare cases, in which we have to perform particular game actions (infuse 20 damage in one turn, or reach 30 life points, not very easy to obtain), all the other objectives are unlocked by winning matches in single mode, moving forward in multiplayer (5/10 games are enough, not hundreds, fortunately) and completing some winning matches in the company of a friend. Tap the card, untap the card Replicating the complex structure of Magic Online (a platform that allows you to buy cards just like in reality) was decidedly difficult to be able to achieve on Xbox Live Arcade: the developers therefore thought of finding the right compromise that would allow you to play with the structure and the classic Magic rules, but also to let the player modify the deck. The number of digitized cards contained in the game is not very high: they are around 500; decidedly few considering that in reality there are several thousand, but we hope (indeed, we are convinced), that the manufacturer will release expansions and new sets of cards on the Live Arcade. The goal of Magic: Duels of the Planeswalker is obviously not to collect cards. The game is instead an excellent attempt to make the fun and the heart of its ~gameplay~ fast and accessible to all, giving players a small number of cards (and therefore rules) to learn and know how to handle. As in any card game, the luck component is obviously very important. Precisely because Magic is a customizable card game, it is therefore essential to make good use of those 17 extra cards to insert as we please, because they will be the ones to make the difference between a standard set and a modified and enhanced set. The game has an online mode with personalized and ranked matches, but there is no option that replicates the organization of a tournament between several people: it would have been simple enough, perhaps also introducing the possibility of seeing opponents' matches in real time. The intelligence of the CPU is decidedly cunning, and sometimes one gets the impression that it is served by chance in a decidedly too benevolent way, noting a perfect balance between the output of land cards and artifact / creature cards. For this reason the game is not immediately easy, but it will be necessary to work hard to complete the single player mode. The choice of including a local cooperative multiplayer mode is excellent, which allows two people to challenge as many computer-controlled players, or to play up to 4 people online via Xbox Live. The key mapping is comfortable and functional, and the rhythms of the original mode ~from vivo~ have been more than respected by exploiting all the buttons of the Xbox 360 pad very well: the challenges are fluid and pleasant, just as if we were sitting at the table at home, playing in the company of a good old friend with cards in hand.", "date": "2009-07-03", "grade": "7.5"}
