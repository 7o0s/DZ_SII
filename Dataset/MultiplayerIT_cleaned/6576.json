In the case of Grow Home, however, the goal to be achieved will be different from the usual. At the command of the little robot B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid), we will in fact be transported to the surface of an alien world in order to grow a gigantic plant, the Star Plant, until it reaches the stratosphere at an altitude of two thousand meters. How? Going to identify a series of ~buds~ on the surface of the enormous plant, stimulating its sudden development and guiding them as if they were electric cables to be connected to an energy source. The latter is represented by a series of floating rocks, which under a stone armor hide an amber-colored soul capable of fueling the growth of the Star Plant. Each height level corresponds to a certain number of these peculiar ~islands~ suspended in the void, and once they are all connected it will be possible to reach a higher altitude and observe the new scenario that will open before our eyes. Trying not to look down. Born by chance That of Grow Home is a somewhat particular story, given that the Reflections title was born as a sort of tech demo in which technologies such as procedural animation and mechanics such as the ones we have just described were experimented. However, some senior Ubisoft executives noticed the product, fell in love with it and pushed for it to be marketed on Steam even if, as we will see shortly, at a price (7.99 euros) that does not exactly correspond to the contents included in the package. The experience offered by the game is in fact rather limited, in the sense that we will be dealing with a single scenario and it will be possible to complete the run of the Star Plant within a couple of hours, also bearing in mind some mistakes along the way. Clearly the duration will expand when we try to focus attention on discovering all the secrets of the setting, from the various types of plants that can be useful during the mission to the hidden quarries, passing through the collection of precious crystals set in the rocks. It is a real currency, which we will be able to use to unlock useful special abilities, such as the possibility of enlarging the view, so as to capture any areas of interest more immediately, and use a jetpack with a limited charge, but essential for avoid the frustration of having to start a long, long climb to the sky all over again. Grow Home boasts a solid concept and great potential, but it needed to be elaborated rather than sketched A drunk robot We were talking about the procedural animations, which characterize the movements of B.U.D. and make them truly unique. The robot behaves as if it were made of cardboard, practically weightless, in a context that seems subject to strong winds ... but in reality it is not. This translates into a crooked walk like that of a drunk, which during the climbing phases sometimes becomes an unwatchable rubbing and ~rolling up~ on the surface of the plant to which we are clinging. Is it something that is pleasing to the eye? In our opinion not, and the sensation that one gets from this type of animation, applied moreover to a completely smooth polygonal model, aims once again to highlight the ~experimental~ nature of the product; a product whose gameplay is also characterized by a disproportionate amount of inertia, so much so that there is always the risk of slipping and falling down, even when in theory the surface we are on should be flat and stable. In short, our little robot moves in a strange context, which in some ways seems like an environment with reduced gravity, but which fails to be coherent in all its facets. You certainly get used to it, with the help of the magnets mounted on B.U.D.'s hands, but it is difficult to see this as a feature rather than, precisely, the consequence of a work in progress. Much more successful is the yield of the climb, which using a controller (strongly recommended) works by acting on the left and right triggers, which correspond to the android's arms. When you get the rhythm of the operation, it feels a bit like milking a cow, which is quite funny. The problem is that in many cases the hook is not infallible and you risk falling undeservedly, finding yourself having to recover height by restarting the climb from the last checkpoint. Ladder that passes you We have referred several times to the situation where B.U.D. he plummets and has to climb the Star Plant again to reach his previous height. This is a rather frustrating eventuality, even more so when it occurs due to a malfunction of thecontrols or a visual glitch, which sometimes ~stucks~ preventing us from seeing exactly where we are. However, it falls within the perspective of a balance that could not ignore this punitive element, because otherwise the completion of the mission would have been even faster and the experience hopelessly ethereal. Finding yourself hundreds of meters lower than where you were before means having to take advantage of flower-catapults and a couple of accessories useful for gliding (the flower or the leaf, to be picked up around) so as to quickly project yourself up, hook onto to the surface of the plant and begin the slow ascent again. However, it is essential to understand when a fall is too serious to put a patch on, in which case you can resort to the self-destruction of B.U.D. and restart the game from one of the checkpoints reached. Speaking of checkpoints, to use them you need to activate the special devices that are found on each new ~level~, and which are signaled by a pulsating red light. The whole context, from the vines to the floating rocks, passing through the streams, the leaves, the flowers and the giant mushrooms, is rendered graphically in a simple but very colorful way. Evidently you don't need high-resolution textures and advanced effects to be able to offer breathtaking landscapes, such as those that in Grow Home we can admire simply by looking down and observing what we have ~built~ up to that moment.", "date": "2015-02-11", "grade": "6.8"}
