{"name": "Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Bloody Ties", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dying-light-2-stay-human-bloody-ties-recensione.html", "text": "Arrived on the market as a true underdog in 2015, the first Dying Light managed over the years to capitalize on an apparently boundless following of enthusiasts, becoming one of the most successful survival horrors of the eighth generation of consoles as a pure rookie. This fortune certainly derives from the very great qualities of the base game, but a large part of it is instead to be attributed to the fruitful post-launch support that poured an overwhelming amount of unpublished content into the streets of Harran, capable of keeping the community busy for all the years following its release. Knowing this dowry of Techland, it was therefore entirely reasonable to expect great things for the post-launch content campaign of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, called in some ways to redeem the not exactly stellar reception reserved for this sequel. As happened seven years ago, the Polish studio took off quickly by publishing a series of updates within a few months that enriched the game's offer and introduced some key features such as the new game plus and the photo mode, but the he community attention was naturally focused on the first DLC in Aiden Caldwell's story, Bloody Ties, now available on all platforms at an affordable price, 9.99. Is the expansion a valid reason to return to Villedor? What new content does it introduce? But above all, is it worth the ticket price? In our review of Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Bloody Ties all the answers to these questions. Aiden's new adventure As with Dying Light 2, Bloody Ties also focuses on story and characters The Bloody Ties DLC had presented itself to the public for the first time with a trailer that had left part of the community perplexed, due to its similarity to the Horde of Bozak, one of the least appreciated expansions of the first Dying Light. That content focused on a very banal arena mode that put players in front of countless waves of infected without any real narrative involvement, and the fear of many is that Techland would replicate the error in this case too, given the focus of the DLC. The great protagonist of Bloody Ties, in fact, is the Carnage Hall, a majestic arena created in the heart of an ancient opera house, which the survivors use as an amphitheater to stage brutal and violent fights to the death. found among those who were waiting for the DLC with a pinch of apprehension, the good news is that unlike the Horde, Bloody Ties puts its narrative component at the center of the offer. Carnage Hall and the clashes in the arena are just the background of a completely new story that will lead Aiden to interact with a cast of new characters whose fates, as in the base game, will largely depend on our choices. The incipit is not overwhelming, but the story has at least initially a good pace and has managed to gain all our attention. For fame, glory, and money, Aiden begins hanging out at Villedor's fight clubs and meets Ciro, a fighter whose family seems to have more than a few ties to Carnage Hall. Broadly speaking, the purpose of the whole adventure is to work your way through the hierarchies of the arena to become its new champions, yet the performances are somehow unrelated to the progression of the story. Each meeting is separated from the others thanks to a small number of particularly structured plot missions, which carry on the narrative exposition by shedding light on the secrets of Ciro's family and on those of Astrid, the bloodthirsty leader of Carnage Hall. We don't want to reveal too much about the plot of Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Bloody Ties, however we have to admit that after completing it in about four hours, we expected something more from the expansion considering how it wants to focus on its narrative component. The story starts off convincingly, but as soon as you feel like you're finally at the center of events, everything suddenly accelerates, to the point that some main nodes seem almost rushed, not very thorough. The strictly limited duration of the expansion is the direct consequence of the sum for which it is sold, and although we still consider the relationship between quality and price positive, it is really a great pity that the history of Carnage Hall has remained trapped between the thresholds of production values not up to a story DLC. Bread and circuses In Dying Light 2: Bloody Ties Aiden will face countless dangers before emerging as the champion of the arena Given the fears of the community, it is almost paradoxical to see how the true value of the DLC is consolidated around the fights in thearena, which are in no way comparable to those already seen in Bozak's Horde. To climb the ranks of the Carnage Hall and deal with the terrible Skull Face, the true antagonist of the DLC, we will find ourselves engaged in a series of 16 spectacular performances all hand-crafted, and which never expect to eliminate random waves of monsters generated by the computer. Divided into four sub-categories, they can ask us to perform an intricate parkour obstacle course to be completed within a time limit, or to eliminate some specific monsters among those crowding the arena, or even to prevail in bloody boss fights against rare species of infected. The most fascinating exhibition, however, is the one known as ~Show~, and involves tackling special scenarios with themed objectives. Just to give you an idea, in one of these Aiden has to emulate the exploits of Kyle Crane in an arena modeled after Harran, a bit like when in Gladiator the battle of Zama was reproduced between Hannibal's mercenaries and the legionaries of Scipio Africanus. Exactly as happened in the Colosseum, where sometimes even naval battles took place, the arena of Carnage Hall changes its face with each performance, which is why you never perceive that sense of immovable repetitiveness that characterizes almost all wave modes of video games. The fights are fun, challenging and exhilarating at times, also thanks to a design choice that we fully share. In battles, Aiden does not carry his weapons with him, but uses standard equipment and is always motivated to exploit the resources hidden in the four corners of the setting to survive the threats that populate the arena. That's why the DLC is aimed at everyone, whether you've finished Dying Light 2 long ago or just finished the prologue. In Dying Light 2: Bloody Tiles the character of Astrid will have a leading role Winning performances earn Opera Tokens, which can be spent in Carnage Hall's shops to obtain exclusive rewards provided with the DLC, such as Aiden outfits, weapon packs, armor and blueprints. Tokens are obtained in large quantities by repeating previously completed shows, while unfortunately there is no mechanic capable of procedurally assembling the arenas so as to have infinite replayability of the fights. This is not a discounted item, but it would certainly have graced the final Bloody Ties offering. More news The Demoman Gorilla, one of the new infected introduced with Dying Light 2: Bloody Ties The DLC introduces a new map, which however is largely confined to the opera house and does not include the typical open world dynamics seen in Villador, since the area is almost entirely controlled by survivors. The palace garden is teeming with events and challenges, but you will rarely find yourself enticed to explore the surroundings of Carnage Hall as you will mostly be forced to do so by the 10 side-quests that accompany the main story. Like the latter, the secondary ones are well made but will never make you tear your hair out of enthusiasm. A new element that closely affects the gameplay is the Slaughter Sleeve, a new object that is obtained at the end of the story and which it can be inserted into the slots reserved for accessories. The Channel basically adds some depth to the combat system, putting in Aiden's hands three additional skills that are activated in certain circumstances and which are fully customizable thanks to three slots for modifications. We report the introduction of two new variants of infected, the Gorilla Demolishers and the Goon Cataclysms, of various variants of melee weapons, and of a new item that has all the potential to revolutionize the way you navigate through Villedor: it is hand in glove with a fundamental junction of the plot so we don't want to tell you anything, just know that it will make the happiness of those who love to move stealthily between blankets and blankets of infected. Final considerations A glimpse of Dying Light 2 Making an arithmetic balance of the qualities and defects of the DLC, Bloody Ties could come out of it as an expansion to be avoided at all costs, above all because it aims to focus on the plot by failing to pack one of real value. Despite this, the low price and the incredible quality of the arena fights make the expansion a good buy for Dying Light 2 fans. If you are desperately looking for a reason to return to play with Aiden go ahead without hesitation, while if you are not particularly nostalgic for Villedor, carefully evaluate the idea of waiting for a new package. We are only at the beginning of post-lan supportcio of this second chapter, and if Techland has taught us something... then we will see some good ones.", "date": "2022-11-18", "grade": null}
