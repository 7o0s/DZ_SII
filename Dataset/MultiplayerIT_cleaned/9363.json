It was perhaps this reason, or the possibility of working on lesser-known and inflated characters in addition to the classic Anakin, Obi-Wan and Yoda, that prompted the now expert developers of Traveller's Tales to base this new episode of LEGO Star Wars right on the animated series ~The Clone Wars~. From a narrative point of view, it is certainly a good choice, given that the humorous cutscenes typical of this franchise can now count on unpublished or at least ~fresh~ situations compared to the classic sequences of the original trilogy. These films also make extensive use of the 3D effect to create the results that we usually see at the cinema with glasses, thus giving us very pleasant and engaging moments. Moving on to the actual game, the structure of LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone War is practically identical to that of the previous episodes of the saga, so let's start from a command center (explorable at will, with devices for creating new characters ) and we can gradually access the new missions, with the possibility of replaying them later to reach areas that were initially closed to us. A breeze Each of the thirteen levels present is divided into three ~acts~, but in reality the action is further broken up due to small-sized scenarios, which must be ~solved~ individually to move on to the next location, a bit as if it were a a series of challenges of increasing difficulty. However, ~difficulty~ is a misnomer in this case, since you have infinite lives available (immediately resuming the game, without even returning to the last checkpoint), the degree of challenge is very low and therefore completing each stage becomes purely a matter of time. The idea that LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is a product intended for a very young user becomes even clearer during the ~puzzles~, given that the system tells us each time which character to use to activate a certain switch or it is produced in visual puzzles that defining trivial is an understatement. The latter consist in using the touch screen to turn a ~wheel~ on which LEGO bricks appear, to be matched one at a time with those represented at the top of the screen. As for the puzzles above, these are basically areas in which you have to exploit the unique abilities of the various characters to build a passage, open a door and so on: the Jedi on these occasions will use the Force, while other characters will be able to use a grappling hook , bombs, or a reticle sighting system. The boss fights, from this point of view, are emblematic: we found ourselves facing, for example, a huge monster that practically remained stationary in its position, without attacking, waiting for us to activate the mechanisms necessary to defeat it. The 3D effect LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone War makes intensive use of 3D, exploiting its spectacularity both during the cutscenes (as already mentioned) and in the actual game, with a large number of objects that ~pierce~ the screen and acquire a certain position in space, more or less distant from our eyes. In some cases the title of Traveller's Tales even exaggerates in this sense, giving depth to elements that arrive on the scene very quickly and which are therefore difficult to focus on instantly, also creating a bit of confusion and annoyance. Never change a winning team The gameplay is identical to the various video games of the LEGO series, with the ability to instantly switch from one character to another (by pressing the back buttons) but sharing the same vital energy bar. The Jedi defend themselves using the inevitable lightsaber, which also allows them to deflect projectiles (making them almost unbeatable compared to most of the opponents), while the soldiers are equipped with powerful but difficult to manage firearms (the automatic aiming system turns out to be questionable again). Finally, the small robots prove to be useful above all for activating switches or crossing chasms thanks to the integrated thrusters. The mechanics of destroying objects, and the often resulting ~rebuildingne~ of the same in different forms, do not present particular novelties and therefore know of ~already seen~ for anyone who has already tried their hand at a ~LEGO something~ previously. And the shooter sections unfortunately do not shine. From a technical point of view, the The Nintendo 3DS version boasts good sharpness, albeit without a miracle, but suffers from dramatic drops in frame rate as soon as something chaotic happens on the screen.We also tested the Nintendo DS version of the game at the same time, finding it essentially identical (including slowdowns ), apart from the slightly closer view and some details here and there. Both lack a multiplayer mode, and if in the case of the DS one could perhaps turn a blind eye (but at least locally it could have been), the thing appears very more serious on 3DS, given the online capabilities of the new Nintendo handheld.On the sound sector, finally, nothing to say: the music is excellent and has a great atmosphere.", "date": "2011-04-08", "grade": "6.8"}
