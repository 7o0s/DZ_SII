The bone of contention that has accompanied the discussions of video game enthusiasts, owners and potential buyers of PlayStation 3 for so many years (almost four since the famous and indicted video shown during E3 2005) can finally be dissolved, from our review but above all by all those who will play it starting next February 25th. With a not exactly excellent business card, such as the predecessor for PlayStation 2, Killzone 2, we can already unbalance ourselves, it's impressive from a technical point of view, but also a good game. Helghan belongs to Helghast The story of the title developed by Guerrilla Games has its roots in a universe created ad hoc and ideally located in the future, where the human race has begun to colonize other planets in search of new habitable places. Among the companies involved in this colonization was the Helghan Corporation, which over the centuries became independent and placed its bases on a planet of the same name and on Vekta, a satellite node extremely rich in resources. The story follows a series of interstellar wars between this corporation and the ISA, the Alliance for Interstellar Defense, for control of interplanetary routes and resources owned (often not legally) by the corporation itself. Following a heavy defeat, the inhabitants of Helghan have maintained control only of their home planet, within which over the decades they have undergone some genetic modifications due to the adverse conditions of the territory (hence also the use of masks), also living in a condition of absolute poverty. That was until the rise of Scolar Visari, the son of one of Helghan's few wealthy families, who quickly took charge of the situation, becoming a charismatic leader and instilling a nationalistic spirit in the inhabitants of this country. We also owe him the creation of an extremely well organized military regime called Helghast, from the name of the planet and from the Old English adjectives ~gast~, spirit, and ~ghost~, fear. Hence the attack on the planet Vekta (story narrated in the first Killzone) and the countermove of the ISA, where the organization decided to immediately attack the planet of the Helghast, in order to stop the destructive machine and the orbital space. There are constant references to dualism that we can see, for example, in a second world war, with the Helghast as a totalitarian people based on war and discipline, determined to the death to defend their planet, and strongly influenced by Visari, who continually recalls the history of their planet and the fact that now the Helghast are no longer human, but something different, superior, to be proud of. The universe of Killzone 2 (which can be further explored on the official site), while being quite stereotyped in its foundations, is quite interesting and endowed with a good personality, which is reflected in the game characters, in the decadent, disastrous and gloomy structures of the planet Helghan (forget about encountering lush or forest landscapes) and in the beautiful introduction movie, which is the prelude to the actual game. Guerrillas? FPS? The best representation of this battle could only be entrusted to the inflated genre of first person shooters. There is some news, and we'll talk about it later, but in general the game scheme follows the classic canons, showing a credible world in its basic fiction and leaving little room for bosses or particularly unrealistic situations. If we had to make a parallel with other productions of the same line, Call of Duty is the title that comes closest, above all for the idea of participating in a conflict, but in the case of Killzone 2 the so-called scripted situations are visibly lower, in which an infinite number of enemies appear until certain points are reached. In this sense, the variety offered by the game is very good, with sections that alternate the simple cleaning of certain areas, passing through assaults and defenses from sieges, rather than sections aboard some vehicles (which we do not anticipate in the review, but which you can find in our films), battles in narrow tunnels in which, in any case, you always meet teams of enemies, who are not placed there at random but who react credibly to what the player has done. In fact, the artificial intelligence of the opponents is rather good, who have the commendable characteristic of moving continuously between one shelter and another, of remaining uncovered only for the time necessary to fire and of not skimping on throwing various types of grenades into player directionand, in order to modify its cover and its attack position. In this regard, we have noticed that in the first two difficulty levels, Recruit and Soldier, the excellent AI of the enemies is somewhat mitigated by the fact that many hits are needed to knock our alter ego down (indicated by the fact that the screen fills more and more with blood in the direction of the blow received), which in some situations can favor a slightly more ~hard-hitting~ and less interesting approach from the point of view of the challenge. The situation is different by selecting the Veteran and Elite Soldier difficulties (the latter available after finishing the game at least once) where the clashes reach a very high level of satisfaction and where in each area you have to stop and methodically attack the most easy to reach, and then dedicate yourself to the more difficult ones, also because depending on the type of opponents (fair but not exceptional in terms of quantity) their strategies also change, between encircles, cover fire, direct group assault, sniping from afar. To the excellent artificial intelligence is added a remarkable sense of physicality of the clashes and of the weapons, reduced to the minimum terms in terms of load capacity, with the possibility of carrying, in addition to grenades, a knife and an ordinance pistol with infinite shots, only a main weapon. Among those available we have different types of assault rifles, submachine guns, sawed-off shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles. Few concessions to the most extreme fantasy, with a weapon that releases projectiles capable of harpooning the opponent and then exploding, and the classic mega lightning gun, capable of emitting high voltage discharges. The limited carrying capacity of weapons therefore implies a more parsimonious and decision-making use of resources and what to choose when faced with supply points or other. To help this structure, Guerrilla has decided to create sections of levels almost in watertight compartments as a typology, such as the one in the Suljeva desert, where a considerable number of enemy snipers are faced, or where the lightning gun, definitely the most powerful in the game, is the best solution and where the timing of its reload counts rather than the skill in hitting enemies. empathy! Killzone 2 places a very strong emphasis on identification, greatness of the clashes, satisfaction derived from firefights with a high level of challenge, very little downtime and good variety. In some situations you find yourself taking part in firefights rarely seen elsewhere and this is the greatest incentive to continue the adventure. Even the motion sensor of the Sixaxis pad is used sparingly and in an identification key, for example to trigger some bombs by following the natural and realistic movement of their activation, or while using the sniper rifle, where holding the pad still implies a greater stability of the viewfinder (available in two configurations) and consequently greater precision. In the game, as mentioned, there is a great sense of physicality, also derived from the fact that the weapons react to all the solicitations both of their own, such as recoil and rapidity of fire, and of what happens on the screen, such as explosions and the fact of take or not take hits during the clashes. In this sense, you need to have good aiming skills and use the appropriate precision mode, which depending on the weapons increases the zoom or provides a viewfinder to help. The real novelty in terms of FPS is represented by the cover system, absolutely necessary to escape the constant bombardment of bullets and the like by enemies. In its basic configuration, by keeping L2 pressed, you go down and ~hook~ the corresponding ledge or wall, at this point with the left analog you move under cover, until you point in the ~free~ direction. lateral or vertical, to expose yourself more and therefore be able to shoot with the R1 key. At this juncture, however, it almost always becomes necessary to also use the aim key (R3) to considerably increase the ability to hit enemies, especially those further away. Due to the large number of keys to be used, this system needs enough practice to be used naturally and with good results. The key mapping does not help much, since it is not fully configurable and only has four predefined configurations which, at least in our opinion, are more uncomfortable than the one proposed as standard. For example, by choosing the configuration that associates the aiming mode with the L1 key, a new button is added to manage, and it is sometimes uncomfortable to presssimultaneous of L1 and L2 in conjunction perhaps with the two analogues. In any case, the cover system is an interesting introduction and the best and most immediate way to catch your breath and jump back into the fray, as well as the only one to avoid frontal blows and naturally switch from attack to defense. However, it remains halfway successful, due to the lack of customization mentioned above and because inexplicably in some points, which can clearly be used as cover, this system does not work and the classic FPS style must be used, suggesting that the points where to use it have been decided at the table in the level design phase. Group strategy A war cannot be defined as a war without teammates, and in Killzone 2 Sergeant Sevchenko has some who are part of the main story (Rico and Garza, for example) and who follow the protagonist for much of the game, helping out in almost every fight. However, they didn't seem very clever to us, especially in situations where their help would have been more welcome or at higher difficulty levels. Fortunately, friendly fire is not punished with the restart of the mission (at Call of Duty, to be clear) and it is always possible to revive them when knocked down by the enemy, which however does not happen on the contrary in the event of one's own killing. Stupid and ungrateful therefore, which makes the lack of what in our view represents the biggest flaw of the single-player campaign even more: a cooperative mode for two or more players. Also because the structure of the game goes well with this feature, and would have at least doubled the longevity of the single-player campaign, which can be completed between 8 and 10 hours of play depending on the skill and difficulty level selected in first joke. Not to mention its replayability, which in this way is relegated to the collection of some briefcases scattered throughout the levels and the killing of some emblems, as well as the pleasure of reliving certain game situations (and obtaining the relative trophies) while enjoying the great beauty technique. Eye shimmer In fact, we have spent many words on the story and gameplay of the game, but in reality Killzone 2, since the dawn of PlayStation 3, has always been highlighted for the technical sector, for its ambitions to become the most graphically impressive title ever appeared on consoles. Without any doubt we can say that the title developed by Guerrilla for large stretches offers an absolutely devastating graphic impact, especially for how everything implemented is proposed on the screen. The thing that is most striking are the filters adopted and the management of the light sources, the meticulous care for a whole series of details that may not immediately catch the eye, the fluid and convincing animations of the opponents, the explosions and particle effects that they make the scenario alive, believable, visually satisfying. To give a couple of examples, in the Suljeva desert it is impressive to see the sky and the presence of different sources of light, many moving objects, sand blowing in different directions, buildings made up of a large number of polygons. And again, on the Lazar Highway, seeing such a detailed and moving sky, ruined buildings in the background, lots of splinters moving in the area and in the middle a firefight between at least a dozen people, including those using machine gun emplacements, those bombs, who uses their own assault weapon. Looking with a more attentive eye, it is not difficult to run into some textures that are not up to the others, rather than in low resolution shadows or (too) pre-calculated animation, or even in subterfuges that are beautiful to look at but not very interactive, such as shooting on the 'water that do not interact with it, but what matters is the overall result, and situations are not rare in which one is surprised by so much graphic beauty and movement on the screen, so as to make the impact with the game a step above any other other production belonging to the same genre on consoles. To this we can add an audio sector which, as far as music and sound effects are concerned, still manages to achieve excellence, with numerous filters applied to shootings such as reverb and distortions during explosions and more, up to full support for technologies such as Dolby 7.1, which make the title a pleasure even for the ears in the presence of a good home theater system. The dubbing is entirely in Italian as regards texts and audio, outside the opening movie (subtitled) and does its honest job, but lacks that bite that is instead given by all the remaining technical sector. close", "date": "2009-02-01", "grade": "9.4"}
