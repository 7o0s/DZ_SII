{"name": "The Walking Dead - Episode 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111648-the-walking-dead-episode-5-sangue-e-lacrime.html", "text": "We have seen many people die since this adventure began. Over the months new comrades joined the group, while others left it forever. Saying goodbye to some of them was devastating. Let's think of Kenny's son, for example. In many cases it was not an accident but the consequence of our choice. And now that the reckoning is near, one thing is certain: if we lied, if we sinned, it was only for Clementine. We would have sacrificed everything and everyone to save her, right? Well, we're about to find out, because No Time Left is ready to ask us the highest tribute. It will be an escalation of pain until it reaches the ultimate decisive moment, and we dare you to get through it without shedding a single tear. Of all the episodes, this is the shortest: the puzzles are absent because the direction does not allow for digressions, and the rare moments of respite become opportunities to close the loose threads, give voice to the secondary characters and allow each of them to finish the his story arc. Kenny and Lee know them well, we've been with them since the beginning, and now we're going to see them changed. They lived and evolved. Even Christa, Ben and Omid will finally find the space they deserve, coming out of the background. Who knows if there won't be a second half for Christa and Omid. Because this won't be the last season of The Walking Dead. That would be unacceptable. We are too hungry for emotions and, as with zombies, one bite is not enough for us. The first bite is never forgotten Every time we say that it couldn't get worse than this, but this time, it really couldn't get worse than this. Clementine has been kidnapped and Lee bitten by a walker. And we are only at the beginning. Compared to previous episodes, No Time Left has tight control over the action. We play even less than usual, but when we are given the floor, each sentence becomes a chisel stroke that defines Lee's personality. If at the beginning it was a blank sheet, now it has its own dimension, although always and only in relation to Clementine, who has highlighted its humanity. Finally their bond, which grew one episode after another, has become as precious as that between a father and his daughter. Or between a mentor and the mentee. Telltale has sown well and everything we taught the little girl now comes back justified and believable in the final. And speaking of closure, No Time Left is consistent with the spirit of Kirkman's original work, which has never discounted any of its characters. The Walking Dead is a brutal and unfair world, there is no room for anything other than the struggle for survival. You will have understood at this point that Lee and Clementine are at the center of No Time Left (and it could not be otherwise). Unfortunately, in order not to lose pace and lead us to the apex of the story in the right time, Telltale rushes the action a lot. The sense of urgency does not give the right time to some situations and characters, which have somewhat unusual reactions compared to those we are used to. Furthermore, the finale struggles a bit to connect with the events that precede it, but this does not detract from what is the truest, most intense and memorable moment of the entire season. And in any case, in the fifty minutes that precede it, we will be able to tremble in front of that infected bite, experience the best zombie scene and confront Clementine's kidnapper, who will confront us with our guilt. From the answers we will give, the meaning we want to give to Lee's actions will emerge, our vision of that upset world that each of us has experienced in a different way, weaving our own personal story from time to time. If The Walking Dead is a masterpiece we owe it to the always brilliant dialogues and to the exceptional voice actors who have done their best to bring out every possible nuance from the characters. In fact, they are the marvel of the series. This game could be talked about for hours and rest assured that it will still receive a lot of attention in the future, because it could have opened a path that goes beyond its genre. What more can we say - it's just one of the best games of the year. Thanks to the efforts of the amateur translation group CrybioLab, PC owners can download patches to play the first four episodes of The Walking Dead with Italian subtitles. The patch for No Time Left should also be available soon.", "date": "2012-11-29", "grade": "9.0"}
