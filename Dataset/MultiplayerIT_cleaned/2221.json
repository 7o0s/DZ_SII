{"name": "State of Emergency", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/state-of-emergency-6.html", "text": "The game is essentially based on action and simplifying everything we could say that we are facing a new generation scrolling fighting game. And what a brawler! Here it even comes to real fights! Think that up to two hundred and fifty (250!) people can be on screen at the same time! Until now I don't think this has ever happened in any 3D video game. It goes without saying that the game sessions will give you a tremendous adrenaline rush: you will find yourself alone in the midst of hundreds of people running away, screaming and you will be able to interact with each of them! The means of ~dialogue~ are almost infinite since you can use in addition to conventional weapons (pistols, machine guns, Uzis, Kalashnikovs, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, baseball bats, sticks, pepper spray, Molotov cocktails and so on and so forth) they will be able to use a disproportionate number of ~furnishings~ present on the screen: signs, waste bins, household appliances, benches, barrels, stools, etc. There is no shortage of classic kicks and punches, stuffed with some easy-to-execute combos. I suggest you start with Mayhem mode just to get the hang of the controls (which are still intuitive), learn how to use the combos and get into the spirit of the game. Then you can go about your missions. And in truth it must be said that these will bore you after a while despite being quite varied. In total there should be one hundred and eighty-five, and they range from destroying something to escorting someone, or recovering some objects. The problem perhaps lies in the little possible planning: whatever the mission to be completed, it will always be a matter of leading your hands and extricating yourself from the crowd and at the same time avoiding or countering the attacks by the police and enemies which will become more and more frequent. The positive side is that in any case it is pleasant to resume it from time to time to go a little further in the story and perhaps unlock new levels. And if you are with friends, a few sessions with the Chaos mode will be right for you. Technically the game must somehow be understood. The structures, the characters and all the rest are not in fact detailed as in some titles that run on PS2 lately and the textures are not exactly state of the art. However, nothing to worry about and the particular comic-style graphic style, as well as the frenzy of the action (you won't even have time to think about the graphics) will help not make you turn up your nose. If you then take into account the enormous number of ~extras~ on the screen, the possibility of destroying even buildings, the valuable special effects that accompany the shootings, the absence of aliasing and the constant update at 60 fps without slowdowns, it could happen that even to think that it is a small miracle. A dutiful thanks must be made to the programmers for having thought of us poor Europeans: just go to the options menu to find the much appreciated 60 HZ video refresh mode. And without the annoying black bars. Unfortunately, those who decided for Italian subtitles only weren't as ~kind~ as they were. In truth, in a game like this based mostly on action you don't miss it too much but those who don't understand English will have some difficulty understanding the voice incitements to perform certain actions which, in Chaos mode, give you precious extra points useful for unlocking secret characters and new locations. The sound is quite particular because the noises of the screaming crowd will mostly dominate, while the disco or rock audio tracks serve just as an accompaniment. In conclusion, those who were expecting a variant of GTAIII could be greatly disappointed, while for all the others it is a very valid game, a pleasant pastime useful for relieving the tensions accumulated during the day. I highly recommend the purchase to lovers of the old scrolling ~rollers~. Still a hub for Rockstar Games! Pros: Fast-paced Fun Good technical realization Cons: Missions get boring in the long run Some camera inaccuracies in following the action Maybe it won't be sold in Australia! The vein of violent games has found many admirers in this period due to a certain GTAIII which has shaken the videogame universe by offering a very interesting gaming experience. Building on this success, Rockstar tries again with State of Emergency, developed by VIS. If GTA made you pTraveling a juvenile delinquent's rise to fame in an almost perfectly recreated world, S.of E. puts you in the shoes of a group of ~revolutionaries~ who want to free the population from the oppression of a despotic government known as the Guild. After the short introductory movie you will be taken to the main screen which presents the usual options menu and the two modes provided (there is also a secret one): Chaos and Revolution. Chaos will be very useful for letting off steam when you're down or when things go a little wrong because it allows you to destroy anything that gets in front of you within a given time limit (three or five minutes, however, which can be increased by collecting the appropriate power ups), while Revolution, the main mode, sees your character (in both modes you will have to choose one of the two characters initially available) to face the missions that are assigned to you by some guys in a way not too dissimilar from what happened in GTAIII: just talk to your ~ employer to get a mission. The difference with GTA lies in the fact that, while in the latter you could get new missions even if you failed in the assigned one, in State of Emergency you have to repeat the same mission until you successfully complete it.", "date": "2002-03-06", "grade": null}
