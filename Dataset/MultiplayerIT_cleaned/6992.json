What to do? Simple, just arm yourself with courage and go in search of the culprit of this crime, accompanied by a gang of very nice little monsters; this is the premise of Monsters ate my birthday cake, a puzzle game developed by SleepNinja Games, a small team made up of only three people. So let's see how our heroes fare in this colorful adventure. Monsters Ate my Birthday Cake is a game that will make both kids and adults happy Cuter than Pokmon The gameplay of what in effect is a puzzle game is as simple as it is captivating: the main objective is to recover all the pieces of cake scattered around the mazes that we have to face. The first missions are more like real tutorials that help us understand the skills at our disposal, and every time a new little being is added to the group we are given the opportunity to understand the characteristics that make it unique, such as the ability to dig underground tunnels, freeze the water or block the passage of enemies. The challenges gradually become more difficult and require a good dose of inventiveness to be solved: at the beginning our task is to move blocks that activate switches scattered around the level, while later on we are forced to avoid traps, get around opponents, use lasers/ rainbows and take advantage of the quirks of our allies to collect all the bites of the cake. We can use a maximum of four monsters per labyrinth and we are given the opportunity to select any character we want at any time, in order to solve the puzzles and reach the finish line. The villains have abilities that we have to use to our advantage in order to complete the puzzles, but the variety, in this case, is less when compared to the care dedicated to the ~good~ characters: after all, you always see the same four or five opponents. In addition to all this it is also possible to explore our small town full of secrets and find some useful objects and characters to complete the game 100%. The graphics are very colorful and the design of the creatures is clearly dedicated to the little ones, inevitable given the production by Cartoon Network, but don't be fooled by appearances: the game is not easy. To complete all the levels it takes just a couple of hours and a few attempts, but to unlock all the characters, secrets and costumes of little Niko you have to sweat a lot. It is undeniable, however, that the target targeted by the developers is young people, considering the dialogues full of jokes that focus on humor based on flatulence, burps and teenage slang; it cannot be said to be a real defect, but we do not deny that we have left out most of the speeches, given the low-level comedy. Sore point the controls: sometimes too cumbersome - to select a block you have to click twice and the same number to deselect it - while completely ineffective and confusing when two characters are next to each other. Finally, the lack of ~pay to win~ mechanics can only be greeted with great applause, given the recent trend that is plaguing mobile games.", "date": "2014-07-23", "grade": "7.8"}
