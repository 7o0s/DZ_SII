The graphic novel signed by Studio V is all focused on investigations, intrigues to foil and narrative crossroads capable of changing the course of events. The small local company, founded in 2016 by Giacomo Masi and Samuele Zolfanelli, worked on the project for three years and is finally ready to reap the benefits of the work done. The title is in fact close to its debut on PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One. Follow us in our review to learn more about all the peculiarities of the work. Greyscale dystopia The year is 2066. Nova Polemos is an avant-garde city from a technological point of view, yet still a slave to particularisms, intolerances that have never died down and have their roots in the folds of time. It is also a reality where the control of government institutions, of large corporations, has silently put a noose around the neck of public opinion, increasingly subjugated by manipulations, by the search for expendable scapegoats. A place where lies thrive in the form of apparent good intentions, while characters of dubious morality plot in the shadows to achieve their goals. In this magnum sea of hatred, as sharp as a razor blade, Mordred Foley, a private investigator who fell into disgrace due to a murky affair that has never stopped feeding the city news, navigates on sight. Alongside his trusted assistant Hera Kairis, the man carries the burden of a past that is difficult to forget. It's been four long years since his seemingly brilliant investigative activities ended up sending two innocent people to the electric chair. The opportunity to go back on track, to find redemption, presents itself when the personal assistant of the political leader who holds the reins of the city peeps into his office. The Bande Nere party is infamous for its extreme and nostalgic ideas, especially on immigration. The organization works behind the scenes in an attempt to clear its front man of charges involving him in a brutal murder case, and this is where the protagonist played by the player comes into play. Yes, because the new story seems somehow connected to the one that discredited him in the eyes of public opinion four years ago. It is the so-called Pandora case, in which a dangerous serial killer is involved who loves to kill his victims by recalling Greek myths. After apparently vanishing into thin air, the monster seems to have suddenly returned to the headlines, and it will be up to the protagonist to get busy trying to solve a rebus that not even the Nova Polemos police seem to be able to untangle. Dialogues and narrative crossroads Let's start immediately by saying that in the final version, as promised, both the interface and the subtitles in Italian have been introduced. Certainly a nice incentive to purchase for those who do not speak English or simply prefer to enjoy the plot effortlessly. In the test phase we had already remarked on the emphasis placed on the collection of clues and on the dialogues essential to be able to reconstruct the events in an organic way. Studio V has taken care to arrange as many as 150 ramifications that lead to three different epilogues, for an overall longevity of around twenty hours. The work done on the texts is respectable, if we consider that more than 750 pages of screenplay were needed to complete the project. One of the winning points of Dry Drowning is in fact its ability to put the player in front of decisions that will somehow have tangible consequences in relation to the unfolding of events. The dialogues with the characters are carried on through the appearance of cartoons, while accessing the Investigation item activates the exploration of the screen where the protagonist is located. By selecting the various points of interest distributed for the location with the cursor, it is possible to receive further information and functional evidence for the resolution of each case. In order for the investigations to continue, it is necessary to clean up the area by collecting all the useful material, while in other cases it is necessary to solve small puzzles and thus find further information that is fundamental for the purposes of the investigations. Even with all the limitations of the case, Dry Drowning has the advantage of presenting a good variety of solutions as regards the composition of the cases to be solved, which offer an interesting alternation between the collection of objects, the archivingand data and finally the union of all the pieces of the puzzle when you are ready to expose who is lying, based on incontrovertible arguments. Added to this is the presence of narrative crossroads, which give way to influence some details of the story through solutions that involve the choice to keep certain characters alive to the detriment of others, to share or not certain secrets with individuals of whom one does not know the certainty of being able to trust or even to make agreements that will have their role in the continuation of the adventure. Clearly we must never lose sight of the fact that we are talking about a graphic novel, and that therefore the interaction has really been reduced to the essentials. Since environmental exploration is not foreseen, one has access exclusively to a multitude of fixed screens on which the subjects with whom to interact appear from time to time, placed in different contexts. By accessing the Investigation button it is possible to move the mouse cursor around the screen in search of details regarding the crime scenes and more generally all those places where evidence worthy of being analyzed by the attentive Mordred could be hidden. The locations that can be visited are marked on a map, but to move from one place to another, all you have to do is access the appropriate screen and choose one of the destinations available at that moment. Lies to be unmasked with talent The particular deductive skills of the protagonist are also expressed through his ability to identify when the interlocutor is lying. This is because macabre animal-like masks suddenly appear on the faces of the interrogated. In these phases it is necessary to bring the deception out into the open using a series of arguments that necessarily refer to the objects and information recovered throughout the investigation. In this case, however, there are only three errors available before the game ends in a stalemate, forcing the player to reload from the last save. As also happens in other titles that include crossroads, at the end of each chapter the choices made during the game are listed in an analytical way, so as to have a summary picture of the situation before proceeding further. In order to vary the pace of the story, the developers have also introduced some mini games. In fact, at a certain point the Be a Good Citizen mode will be unlocked, integrated into the Aqua OS viewer which can also be used for investigative activities. Basically, by accessing this section you must complete a series of levels which involve activating cells within a grid. Each of them must be organically connected to the others by rotating each single block until the correct combination is identified. However, there are also some ideas directly extrapolated from the investigations, such as the possibility of selecting portions of sentences of the dialogues to receive further clarifications from your interlocutor. Sometimes it is required to compare different crime scenes to identify the peculiarities that distinguish them, or even to reconstruct a radio signal by matching repeaters on a grid. These solutions help to break the pace and diversify the activities to be carried out, even if in our opinion they deserved a little more organic management. On a graphic level, we appreciated the sketches of the characters, not only well characterized and distinguishable from each other, but also excellently contextualized with respect to the dystopian context that hovers in the background. In fact, we find that the shades of gray with which the individuals were represented, as opposed to the colors of the settings, was a stylistically apt choice, as well as a good way to make the game more recognizable. Certainly less convincing, on the other hand, are the locations of Nova Polemos, poor in flashes capable of making us remember them once the game is over. It is also worth spending a few words on the soundtrack, which offers over two hours of original content for a total of fifty audio tracks adapted to each situation. After having worked on the final version, we can confirm that the music of the game effectively accompanies the plot, giving the investigations a varied and coherent background with the context.", "date": "2019-08-01", "grade": "7.5"}
