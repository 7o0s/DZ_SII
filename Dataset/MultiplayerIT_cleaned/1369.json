{"name": "The Elder Scroll III: Morrowind GOTY", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scroll-iii-morrowind-goty.html", "text": "THE OLD Ten races coexist in Vvardenfell: the reptilian Argonians immune to disease and poisons, the Nordic Bretons specialized in the alchemical arts; the Dunmer or Dark Elves who specialize in the creation of magical weapons; the Altmer or High Elves of Summerset Island from which comes Tamrielic or the current language of the Empire, the cultured Imperials who starting from the cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil have subdued all the others, giving life to that monument to peace which is the Glorious Empire; the Kahjiit, big cats unrivaled in their acrobatic skills and therefore unsurpassed thieves; the barbaric Orcs, the proud and pardoned Red Guards of Hammerfell; the agile Wood Elves also known as the tree people and finally the aggressive and proud Nords in whose culture battle is ecstatic joy. Each character is characterized by eight mental, physical and magical attributes that are implemented with experience, on the basis of which the nine practicable magical arts are based; the latter are joined by nine arts of combat, nine elusive arts and as many exclusive arts to master. Classes (21 in all) define a character's lifestyle and most important skills; each of them has a specialization, five main skills and five secondary skills (skills) that can be increased not only with experience, but also through training that can be performed upon payment of a sum of money to the ~master~ on duty. ~Learn~ is the keyword of Morrowind; you never stop learning and experience is always the best medicine. The interaction with background and non-player characters is the most sophisticated ever seen in an RPG: except for sex, there is no aspect of real life that hasn't been transposed into Morrowind, but in spite of a behavioral freedom whose nuances they are truly infinite, in front of a crime you pay. Obviously one must be caught red-handed, but when this happens the imperial law will intervene to straighten out the culprit: in the face of serious crimes, such as the murder of an honest citizen, even with prison; obviously the inactivity due to the cell will have negative repercussions on our physical strength, constantly threatened by multiple catchable diseases. Furthermore, a bad reputation will cost several closed doors in the face, which will greatly complicate research for the world. Numerically unquantifiable religious searches and pilgrimages. In addition to the main quest, it is possible to tackle those proposed by the Guilds of warriors, wizards and thieves, as well as those proposed by individual ~privates~; however, opening several of them will not be a problem since they will be automatically annotated in a diary that can be consulted at any time. Morrowind more than an exceptional RPG is a parallel life. THE NEW Let's go into the details of this Game of the Year Editino with a necessary premise: your old Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind saves will be automatically recovered and we have not encountered any compatibility problems in this regard. To avoid misunderstandings, it is necessary to reiterate that the package in question does not include only the two expansions, but also the original title; in practice, a neophyte would find a sort of deluxe version on his hands. The upgrade includes new play areas, new missions, creatures, weapons, items of all kinds, the inclusion of pack animals, the possibility of being able to enlist mercenaries and to transform into a werewolf. It is possible to undertake the main quests of both Tribunal and Bloodmoon at any time. Being more demanding, the advice, although obvious, is not to tackle them first. The first expansion will come to life as soon as you decide to rest: sleep will, in fact, be interrupted by an enemy attack. As soon as you turn to the first imperial guard you come across, investigating the attack (or attacks, since there may be more than one), and the Tribunal main quest will open. Bloodmoon will instead allow you to transform into a werewolf by contracting the sanies lupinos, similarly to what happens in Morrowind with the porphyric hemophilia which transforms those infected into a vampire. The life of the werewolf is not exactly roses and flowers: in addition to not being able to access the inventory, or use objects, weapons or spells of any kind, an animal hunger must be appeased, killing an NPC every night. One recommendation: never let someone see you shapeshifting or you will be attacked on sight even once you return to human form. And watch out for silver weapons, of course.THE NEW It is absolutely not necessary to abandon the old quests to continue those of Tribunal and Bloodmoon: the player can follow them in parallel or give precedence to the ones he prefers. The unpublished locations include the capital Mournhold and the icy lands of Solstheim, an island permanently covered by ice located northwest of Vvardenfell. This last location is perhaps the most suggestive of the entire playful package and can be easily reached by embarking at the port of Khuul; for those particularly stingy and swimming enthusiasts it is also possible to do without the ship. In the capital, on the other hand, it will be possible to hire a mercenary who will follow us everywhere, fighting alongside us, with whom it will also be possible to share the inventory, therefore carrying many more objects. You can equip and equip it as you see fit and even its equipment will be subject to wear and tear requiring periodic repairs. Obviously he will also have to be adequately paid: if the Profit value drops below zero, you will end up with one less friend. Still in the capital, it will also be possible to purchase pack animals for the transport of heavier loads. From a technical point of view there are no particular implementations to report. Scrolling is slightly faster (constant 60 fps indoors, some unavoidable stutter outdoors), which doesn't mean smoother, while the texture update of mirrors and streams has undergone a slight implementation, in the sense that if before they changed unpleasantly abruptly all the time, now they are more stable although not fully optimized at the update level. Ah, I forgot... Enemies finally have a nice energy bar visible on screen. And with that I think I've really listed all the most significant upgrades. On the other hand, no variation is recorded on an exceptional sound front in itself. THE NEW Comment I quote a note from the Morrowind team reported in the manual One of the first questions players usually ask themselves is: what should I do in this game? Our answer, inevitably, is: what would you like to do?. Yes, because The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year is not only ~The game of the year~ and ~The rpg of the year~, but it is much more. It's a parallel life. The deepest and most sophisticated experience that a gamer can currently afford. I perfectly understand that it is not exactly what can be defined as a game for everyone, but the finest palates have really found what can delight them. There is no right or wrong way to play Morrowind, there are no schemes, constraints or constraints of any kind: all you need are training references of a certain thickness, an Xbox and lots and lots of free time. Pros: The largest and most sophisticated off-line RPG available on PC and consoles Remarkable depth and freedom of choice/action Theoretically eternal Cons: No significant improvements on the technical front The dish is only for strong stomachs Who didn't appreciate the basic version, he has no reason to backtrack Anatomizing the contents of Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in a conventional way, while nevertheless sticking to a modest number of characters, presents itself as a dramatic undertaking to say the least, but pronouncing with the same restrictions on this award-winning Game of The Year Edition is decidedly a something heroic. The play package packaged by Bethesda Softworks is a bulky, physical, tribute to the Microsoft branded console, including the original digital world of Vvardenfell and the two expansions Tribunal and Bloodmoon: it goes without saying that although the original game already does not know a real own final, in spite of theoretically comparable products, here we would have to play for real for a lifetime. Yes, because Morrowind is played. No cut scenes and whims: Morrowind is afilmic, nasty, dry, burnt and especially deep like no existing or existed RPG; I say this by ideally cutting the entire historiography of the video game. For those who have never heard of the original, know that it is in front of the extensively and quantitatively the biggest, longest and widest offline product ever conceived in living memory, whose salient feature is the most incredible and sophisticated freedom ever offered to the gamer. Freedom of action, freedom of movement and free will. No invisible walls, no bottlenecks, no moral constraints: there is nothing that cannot be done at Vvardenfell, right or wrong that an action may result from a purely ethical point of view, just as there is no place that cannot, in one way or another, be achievedgere. Said like this, it seems that the product can also be considerably distracting, and the good thing, or the bad thing, is that it is: the choice depends only on one's training references and on the degree of nausea that simmers silently during all the years spent in front of a monitor .", "date": "2004-03-16", "grade": null}
