The natural paradise is unfortunately in the hands of a wicked dictator who is ready to do anything to maintain absolute power. To decree the end of the bloody regime, not too in tune with the United States of America, the CIA decides to send one of its best (and more ~forcefully~ glamorous) agents on a mission, Rico Rodriguez who, in order to succeed in the mission, does not he will have trouble allying himself with both Marxist guerrillas and drug traffickers. The first few minutes of the game immediately give us a way to understand what atmosphere we will breathe during Just Cause: launched from a plane in flight with a parachute, we won't even have time to land before we'll find ourselves having to dodge the bullets of military. Once landed, our contact immediately makes us get on a vehicle and orders us to take command of the machine gun present and shoot anything that moves. the spectacularization present in Just Cause is really at very high levels Stunt action The spectacularization present in Just Cause is truly at very high levels: to what are the typical possibilities of a free roaming title such as stealing vehicles (present in very high quantities in JC with helicopters, planes, amphibious, land, water and other the more he has, the more...), the Eidos title implements the novelty of actions worthy of the best action movies with our Rodriguez climbing onto the roof of a car and jumping onto another vehicle, or clinging to the wing of an airplane and dives through the air as if nothing had happened. From this point of view, Just Cause truly represents an innovation in terms of freedom of action since we will be able to use any possible solution to complete a mission (primary or secondary). Stunt action In the list of merits of the work of Avalanche programmers, the incredible vastness of the game environment should certainly be noted. We are talking about a complex of islands whose exploration can take up to about an hour despite moving with high-speed vehicles and the wonderful news is that our movements will absolutely never be interrupted by any loading. in the list of merits of the work of Avalanche programmers, the incredible vastness of the game environment should certainly be noted Even if not too original, the quests (the secondary ones are not essential but they give us the opportunity to have new means and weapons at our disposal) to complete are quite varied, which can be solved in various different ways and the obligatory conquests of the government strongholds with guerrilla warfare or drug traffickers certainly have a rather high appeal. At this point in the review you are probably starting to convince yourself that perhaps the time has really come for GTA to be ousted from the throne. Unfortunately this is not the case since after the list of positivities, the time has come to highlight the many flaws present in Just Cause. the general feeling is of an excessively approximate product precisely in the playful component, which is rather serious for such an ambitious title Freedom? Let's start with the presumed total freedom of action. We are rather disappointed when, having abandoned the roads, we decide to reach a goal by passing through a grassy expanse or a mountain path, an action that in a title such as Test Drive Unlimited takes place without any kind of problem. In Just Cause, unfortunately, this is not the case at all: the feeling is that of forcing the dynamics provided by the game, with interactions very similar to bugs in the case of slopes or other. Try launching yourself off a mountain cliff with the motorbike and when you see the two wheels go down in a ~static~ way (i.e. without any set of animations) and without any damage to the vehicle and the rider when you get to the valley, you will understand empirically what am i referring to... Just play? As if that weren't enough then, the gameplay fails at all to reach the apex present in GTA: the driving of vehicles is too unconvincing with ~inconsistent~ responses between one vehicle and another and, even more serious, there is the bad feeling lack of enjoyment during the interaction. Things don't go too much better during the shootouts. Also in this case the interaction takes place in an excessively approximate way and the intelartificial intelligence proves to be really not very intelligent with situations that are nothing short of grotesque: just attack a government post with campesinos and you will thus experience first-hand paradoxical and confusing moments so as to make the player's interaction absolutely chaotic. The general feeling is of an excessively approximate product precisely in the playful component, which is rather serious for such an ambitious title. the PC version unfortunately turns out to be the worst of all Evils from personal computers... Approximation that unfortunately is also highlighted from a technical point of view of the PC version which, as you will find written in the multiplatform box, unfortunately turns out to be the worst of all. In fact, on our computers, the graphics engine has not been optimized to guarantee standard performance on the various possible configurations: here on a high-end PC with the graphics parameters set to medium-high level, the title will tend to be excessively fast with animations almost comical. However, this does not prevent Just Cause from shooting conspicuously in the most chaotic situations and guaranteeing physics in step with the latest productions. Even under the ~static~ aesthetic aspect, Just Cause alternates qualitatively very different elements: if we can promote without hesitation the excellent light effects, the vast settings and everything concerning the background of the action, the same cannot be said for the quality of vehicles and characters, decidedly below average (except for our sufficiently well-groomed alter ego) especially from a design point of view. Fortunately, the long list of Just Cause problems ends here since before moving on to the commentary, we can promote the game's sound component with full marks, full of ~epic-Latin~ musical compositions that blend perfectly with the present action and with an Italian localization of the dialogues absolutely up to par. we can pass the sound component of the game with flying colors Cross-platform As anticipated in the article, the PC version is undoubtedly the least optimized, so much so that on PlayStation 2 and Xbox (with the latter as always slightly higher in terms of graphic quality), beyond the high definition, the results are better thanks to a better balance and speed, even if even in these versions there are some annoying slowdowns. The Xbox 360 version, on the other hand, is in an absolute sense the best of all (high definition and more optimized than the PC) but in the quality / technical specifications ratio it does not reach the ~old gen~ consoles. Therefore, with respect to the final vote, remove at least 4 decimal points if you intend to buy the PC edition. Final comment The feeling you get when playing Just Cause is undoubtedly that of being faced with a wasted opportunity. The incredible spectacularity of the action and the immense game map unfortunately cannot hide the flaws of the title represented by a much more limited freedom of action than one might believe, the lack of optimization of the PC version and a decidedly too approximate gameplay . Nonetheless, Just Cause doesn't deserve a complete rebuff as much as a sharp earful to Eidos and Avalanche for over-rushing the game's release and not avoiding some problems that could have been easily fixed with a little more attention. Pros Spectacular like few other titles Huge variety of media Monumental game map Cons PC version not optimized Rough gameplay Limited freedom of action Magic words Free Roaming, the magic words of the 2000s in the video game field, the hope of free action for players and big profits for software houses. After the success beyond the wildest expectations of Grand Theft Auto, the variations on the theme to the well-defined supporting structure have become more and more frequent. Today is the turn of Just Cause, a title produced by Eidos and created by the Scandinavian programmers of Avalanche which tries to combine this trend with another very popular one in recent times, namely the exotic setting.
