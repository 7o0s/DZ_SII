As we are used to seeing by now, to build buildings and train units we necessarily need a certain number of these goods, without which therefore it is not possible to do anything. However, the player must also keep an eye on another parameter, also known by veterans of the genre, which will vary according to the faction used, essentially indicating the maximum number of units simultaneously available to us on the map. If between Empire and Beasts the difference is not so much in managing this situation, based on the usual system of construction of buildings used for this purpose, the system of the Fallen deserves a small mention: in fact, these are linked to some units that we could see as of the ~central brains~, which in addition to building the various infrastructures can, through a mutation, allow us to increase the number of units at our disposal. Another characteristic of this army is also that of preparing the ground before building it, always through appropriate buildings, which is absent for the other two factions. Despite the diversity, which in any case contributes greatly to making the game more long-lived and interesting, we can still state that the balancing between the three armies has been carried out in a more than good way, leading none of the three to be clearly predominant over the others and offering very good stimuli for multiplayer games, where you can bring together the strengths and weaknesses of the three armies with adequate tactics. Among the buildings available we do not find anything new, given that we start from the usual main ~worker-churn~ building, and then move on to the training ones such as the barracks and finally to those like the blacksmith, which add various bonuses to units or other buildings. Violent punches One of the things that certainly strikes everyone after a few minutes of play is the difficulty: even the most experienced will in fact be surprised by the speed with which the computer will systematically begin to attack the camp controlled by us, thus making a strategy aimed at maximum possible speed in setting up one's defenses, without the possibility of making mistakes. If for the more tenacious all this could be an added value to the game, for most people it could prove to be a double-edged sword, causing the classic RTS frustration that forces you to abandon the campaign that was undertaken by focusing on a more immediate and fresh multiplayer. Also for this reason, I won't hide from you that I much preferred to play a few more games in skirmish mode rather than struggle forward in the plot, which also resulted from the fact that as we said at the beginning of the article, this one doesn't offer anything exceptional. However, those who want to get to the end know that they will have to face 36 different missions, divided between the three races. One of the things that surely strikes everyone after a few minutes of play is the difficulty Violent punches The artificial intelligence has turned out to work on alternating current: if on the one hand, in fact, after a movement order, the units will position themselves in such a way as to find the best ones in close combat in a more advanced position (we will therefore find, for example, soldiers in first line with the archers in the rear), on the other hand we are faced with the usual problem of finding the paths to follow to get to a certain point, faced in a very rough way by the units that we often see making absurd turns to get to a certain point . The laziness of the units also left me particularly perplexed by the AI, which tended too much to wait for a specific attack command despite being with nearby enemies: you will understand how this can become a big problem when we find ourselves in the situation of having to check a large number of soldiers. The only novelty that Black Hole has tried to insert into AoE was the idea of developing each map on two levels: the one in the sunlight and the underground one. Although pressing the TAB key is enough to switch from one to the other, this feature will immediately be awkward to use especially in hectic phases, where in addition to having to control a more or less large number of units, the player is forced to squirm between underground and sunlight, risking only to be in a big mess. The show has yet to beginThe technical point of view is certainly the one that AoE can boast the most, especially the graphics. The whole map is treated in detail and even the atmospheric agents that we will find ourselves admiring are made very well, just as units and buildings can enjoy a high level of detail. Even the animations, including the very cinematic opening presentation, can easily be described as noteworthy. Limiting this marvel a little is the 3D engine, or perhaps I should say the non-3D engine: to a practically non-existent zoom (unless you want to define it as an imperceptible approach of the camera) you add the absolute inability to rotate the shot around a fixed point. However beautiful the graphics may be, many of the units bring to mind characters already seen in other RTSs, such as the Fallen who look a lot like the famous Zerg. While not reaching the levels of graphic detail, even the sound is appreciated through quite well characterized voices and the classic battle sound effects. Staying on the subject, know that the game is only subtitled in Italian. The whole map is treated in detail and even the atmospheric agents that we will find ourselves admiring are made very well, as well as units and buildings can enjoy a high level of detail Comment If AoE had come out before its predecessors, we would probably be talking about it in a very different way: unfortunately the deja-vu effect is felt and not a little, bringing the mind to the obvious comparison with the titles of mother Blizzard, from which AoE comes out decidedly defeated not for the technical shortcomings but for the absolute absence of new elements if we want to exclude that of the implementation of the maps on two levels, which as we have already said creates more problems than anything else. Unfortunately in 2005 all of us have already had ample opportunity to see many of the features of this game in other titles and I am sorry to admit that the RTS genre is momentarily short of ideas, which I would not be surprised if in the more or less near future they were to come from the famous developers of Warcraft. In conclusion, I would recommend the game to lovers of the genre who are always thirsty for new challenges and new strategies, while to all the others I would at least recommend a ~road test~ before buying it sight unseen. Pros: Good graphics Quite long-lived Cons: Knows everything already seen At times frustrating for novices and non-3D engine practically absent RTS, cross and delight Real-time strategy is a genre that for some time now seems to have become the exclusive prerogative of Blizzard, which thanks to titles like Starcraft and Warcraft, real sacred monsters, has managed to create a real monopoly. Even the other developers seem to have adopted as a ~de facto~ standard the characteristics that made the games we mentioned above immortal, taking up at least some ideas and very rarely trying to offer something really new to the general public, which in any case always seems to have hunger for RTS, given the success that this genre continues to enjoy despite everything. As we will see in more detail later in this review, Armies of Exigo (AoE from now on, but be careful not to confuse it with Age of Empires!) also inexorably submits to this rule, despite Black Hole Entertainment's attempts to offer a little something again. All this starting from the plot: the story takes place in the world of Noran, where after winning the battle called ~The Rage~ against the faction of the Beasts, the Empire seems to live a period of peace, until orcs and other monsters villains do not decide to set foot again in the territories of humans, forcing the latter to return to war again. Given that, as the old adage says, between the two litigants the third enjoys, here comes the army of the Fallen, made up of underground creatures and other strange beings, determined to impose their dominion over the other two contending armies. Obviously it will be possible to play with all three factions in the field, trying their hand at the usual singleplayer campaign to follow the evolution of the plot or in the multiplayer modes: from the classic ~skirmish~ and ~capture the flag~ to two other calls ~melee~ and ~ king of the hill~, where we will have to try to get the better of the enemy through continuous attacks or defend a stronghold from assaults.", "date": "2005-03-18", "grade": null}
