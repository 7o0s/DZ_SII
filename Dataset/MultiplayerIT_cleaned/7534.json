{"name": "Evil Dead: The Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-dead-the-game-recensione.html", "text": "That of asymmetric multiplayer is a now consolidated trend, which adapts particularly well to the dynamics of a horror, as Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th: The Game have brilliantly demonstrated. The guys from Saber Interactive have thought of creating a product of the same kind, based however on the famous saga of La Casa. Created by the visionary director Sam Raimi in the late 70s, Evil Dead combines demonic possessions and Lovecraftian elements, blood and punches , horror and humor within an iconic trilogy for fans, with a truly out of the ordinary protagonist played by Bruce Campbell, who a few years ago returned as Ash Williams for one last adventure in the Ash Vs. Evil Dead. Right from the start, the game presents itself as a real love letter to the series, drawing liberally from all the cinematic chapters and from the aforementioned television series to deliver us a truly faithful experience full of references. but at the same time capable of withstanding the asymmetric starting formula? We reveal it to you in the review of Evil Dead: The Game. Structure Evil Dead: The Game, Ash Williams in one of the artworks included in the single player missions As we wrote in the Evil Dead: The Game trial, the core of the experience is obviously represented by its multiplayer modes, playable in cross-play both against human opponents and against artificial intelligence, accompanied by real users or bots. A four-against-one of a kind that is anything but classic, given that we will be dealing with a rather large map (in two variants) and the bad guy of the moment will be able to stay by our side without being seen and then launch his own assault at the right moment. The Survivors, divided into four classes (Leader, Warrior, Hunter, Support), each with their own special abilities and a dynamic upgrade system during the match, boast a roster composed of three versions of Ash, Annie Knowby, Lord Arthur, Scotty, Henry the Red, Ed Getley, Kelly Maxwell, Amanda Fisher, Cheryl Williams and Pablo Simon Bolivar. The Kandarian Demon can instead opt for three classes (Necromancer, Puppeteer and Warlord) and as many bosses, namely Evil Ash, Eligos and Henrietta. The match, characterized by a duration of thirty minutes, sees the Survivors explore the scenario in search of weapons (firearms and for melee), ammunition and equipment, as in a battle royale, then go to the indicated areas from time to time time to collect three fragments of the map thanks to which they will be able to locate the lost pages of the Necronomicon and the Kandarian Dagger, a magical weapon that will allow them to destroy the origin of evil and complete the ritual by defending the book of the dead from the attack of a final horde of enemies. There are several variables in the field: in addition to the health bar, the ~good~ ones have a fear indicator that rises as they expose themselves to terror or move alone and in the dark, and which can only be emptied by using matches to light a fire. In fact, where the fear should exceed a certain threshold, the Kandarian Demon will be able to take possession of our body for a few long seconds and injure the other players. Evil Dead: The Game, an undead controlled by the Kandarian Demon However, this is only one of the many options available to the ~bad guy~, who can navigate the map quickly, remaining completely invisible and moving like the famous first-person shots by Sam Raimi in the La Casa saga, collecting magical energy and spending it from time to time to control monsters, vehicles or even trees, enhance their skills and get to summon groups of undead or a powerful boss with which to face the Survivors directly. In addition to the multiplayer modes, however, there are also five single player missions , to which new ones will be added in the coming months, which take up iconic moments from the films and the series for us to practice, asking us to collect certain objects and defeat specific creatures. We are talking about challenges with a degree of difficulty that is anything but trivial and which in the event of a game over must be played over again, but which allow you to unlock some of the characters on the roster. Gameplay Evil Dead: The Game, the character selection screen before entering the game: yes, they are all Ash Considering the size of the map, the different objectives to be completed, the cooperative dynamics or the strategy necessary to take on the role of the enemy on duty, the gameplay of Evil Dead: The Game takes some time to understand and some ' for extra patience when deciding to controll the Kandarian Demon, since we will spend most of the time silently observing our opponents before launching an offensive that is in any way effective. As already mentioned, the combat system works well but already after a few hours it reveals some limits precise: we tend to kill enemies using always the same combinations of shots and the finishers, which change according to the weapon used, are often not decisive. The action therefore becomes very repetitive and does not hold up when fighting in groups, triggering really confusing sequences. Evil Dead: The Game, the elderly Ash of the television series in one of the single player missions Compared to the launch, the server and matchmaking situation seems to have improved slightly and finally we find ourselves in the game with people who have the slightest idea of what needs to be done to get to the end of the match, but the usual rule of cooperative online experiences remains valid : if you organize yourself with a few friends you will be able to get the most out of the game, otherwise you will have a little luck and you may end up with groups that are completely denied or in which everyone does what they like. Collaboration is in fact an essential ingredient of Evil Dead: The Game when playing with the Survivors: by themselves the characters see the terror bar rise, they can become victims of sorties by the Kandarian Demon and remain on the ground waiting for someone to revive them, which however may never happen because maybe they are on the opposite side of the scenario, the distances are long and the available vehicles are also not lightning fast. Evil Dead: The Game, one of the monsters available to the Kandarian Demon The role of the villain is more complex, because as mentioned most of the time is spent collecting energy and buying upgrades that allow you to summon the undead or the boss on duty, thus waiting for the right moment to launch your attack instead of activating portals in continuation seeing the heroes rout our units without major problems. Well, at least we'll have wasted his time a bit though. Having a separate, definitive upgrade system for characters that you can access between games is an interesting idea, and we doubt it will have any pay-to-win style implications, also because there are no microtransactions and it is therefore the experience that rewards users who grind the most hours, allowing them to become progressively stronger. However, it is already clear by now that some new content will be needed to keep interest alive. Graphics and sound Evil Dead: The Game, the PC version options include DLSS but with the most extreme presets the definition collapses We don't know how Evil Dead: The Game runs on consoles, but unfortunately on PC the game has quite significant technical problems, which to date have not been resolved. The strong stuttering typical of titles in Unreal Engine 4 fortunately seems to have decreased, or at least we have noticed it little in the last few days, but the flaw relating to the resolution persists, which seems well below the declared 2160p judging by the poor definition of the elements visible on the screen .On our configuration we were able to run the game at 4K (nominal, at least) and 60 fps with all the presets on Ultra without problems, we imagine precisely because the effective resolution is actually lower, but who owns less components fast will be able to count on NVIDIA's DLSS to significantly improve performance while further sacrificing sharpness, which as already mentioned at the outset on an Ultra HD screen leaves much to be desired. Evil Dead: The Game, Lord Arthur and Henry the Red In general, the graphics can count on an artistic sector and on a direction worthy of note, capable of resuming the atmospheres, scenarios and suggestions of the film saga with also an avalanche of nice easter eggs (see the traps with mini- Ash or the hands that jump on you, or the trap door closed by a chain under which Henrietta is agitated in single player missions), but at the same time we are talking about an old-gen staging from different points of view, from animations to 'effects, and with a lot of glitches. Nothing to say instead for the sound sector, which in addition to the amusing dialogues interpreted by Bruce Campbell and the other actors (often the original ones) also boasts an extraordinary adherence to the materials starting point in terms of sounds and music, so as to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Evil Dead right from the start: an extra of undoubted value for fans of the franchise.", "date": "2022-05-18", "grade": "7.4"}
