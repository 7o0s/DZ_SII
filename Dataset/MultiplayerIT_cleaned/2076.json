{"name": "Roland Garros 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/roland-garros-2003.html", "text": "Game options and graphics Once the installation is complete, before embarking on the real challenge, it is necessary to set the configuration options and the keys to be used in the game. For the occasion, therefore, we are shown a window from which we can choose the video options, the levels of detail and configure the controls. The operation is rather inconvenient, especially the key assignment, but necessary even if it would have been better to be able to access it during the actual game. This fact, therefore, does not allow changes to be made on the fly, during games, so if you want to change a certain parameter, you will be forced to exit the program and manually launch the configuration panel. Game options and graphics Having done this preamble, we can see in detail what this latest chapter of the Roland Garros series looks like. The three-dimensional engine has the advantage of having to manage very limited areas, substantially rectangular, and without calculations that are too elaborate for the processor. Furthermore, the level of detail is scalable and allows for good fluidity even on less powerful machines. The player models are really well done, with plenty of polygons and great detail, and have realistic and convincing animations. To give the touch of class, then, the shadows take care of it, which reproduce the movements of the players and really give the idea of watching a match on TV. Too bad only for the stands with a flat audience and, more generally, for the level of detail of the fields which is a bit low, giving a general feeling of incompleteness. And just as if we were on TV, we will be able to benefit from close-up shots and transitions between different floors, complete with different animations for various occasions. Thus, if a player commits a foul we will see him yell and, perhaps, throw his racket to the ground in the grip of a moment of anger and, otherwise, if he earns a point we will see him cheer and greet the public. It's just a pity that the replays are missing, otherwise the direction would have been really complete. The game engine, then, manages to manage the different types of terrain very well, giving each of them a distinct characterization not only linked to the color but also to the way in which the ball bounces, giving a more realistic imprint to the game. Ultimately, I would say, from a strictly graphic point of view, Roland Garros defends itself well and offers a series of details that make the game session pleasant, which otherwise could become rather monotonous. It is interesting that the speaker will speak, from time to time, in the language of the country hosting the race. Tournaments and career The most obvious aspect, the one that immediately catches the eye, of this Roland Garros 2002 is that it allows you to impersonate and challenge a fair number of world champions, among whom we will find six men and four women. As soon as the game is launched and the introductory movie is finished, we will find ourselves faced with a menu full of interesting items that we will be able to navigate with the keys but not with the mouse (remember that it is always a conversion from PS2). We will be able to choose immediately whether to play a game alone, in single player, or challenge some friends in multiplayer mode. For now we decide to do some practice on our own... The possibilities made available to the player are various and all interesting. Just to stretch our fingers a bit, let's start with a quick game, without worrying about tournaments and statistics. The Arcade option offers us just that, that is the possibility of choosing a player and immediately throwing ourselves into the challenge against a series of different opponents, in a wave of increasing difficulty. Tournaments and career But, we can also choose different types of game, going from the simple Exhibition, which will allow us to play a single game, selecting the players to deploy and the field, up to the Career mode in which we will have to commit ourselves to climbing the rankings, participating in the most important. For those who don't feel comfortable with the controls yet, there is also the always welcome Training mode, with which we can practice with the ball shooter or against the more classic block. So let's decide to go big and embark on our career as world-class champions... The first thing we'll have to do, therefore, is to choose a face that best represents us and give it a name that's not too funny. Within the Career mode we will have other training options, more complete and, above all, specializedin different playing techniques. We will be able to train in the simple service, or in the passers-by or in the lobs (lobs). We will start off as Amateurs and will only be able to play on the minor courts, but as we progress and win our matches, we will advance in the standings and be able to start challenging the better players, all the way up to the top seeds. We will participate in the Australian Cup world tournament and, in the meantime, also in Roland Garros, the British Classic and the US Open. Gameplay As far as the certainly most important aspect is concerned, that is how much fun this game is and why, we can start from a quick observation: Roland Garros 2002 is a title that was born for consoles, therefore it prefers an immediate approach to a more complex one, therefore we will not find dozens of lines of statistics to take care of nor will we find contour elements that will distract us from our main activity, tennis matches. The matches are held in the name of credibility (perhaps realism is too much) and the arcade control system does not fail in this purpose, indeed it makes the matches faster and less demanding. The best way to play is to use a pad (but okay?), but good results are also obtained with the keyboard, provided, however, that you choose the keys with a minimum of criterion. Each type of shot has a distinct button, so we'll have one for top-spin and another for lob, for example, and hitting the ball while setting the swing is quite simple. Gameplay The players react quite naturally to our commands, without thinking too much but without doing their utmost in improbable circus stunts to hit a ball too far away. So we will see them jumping, moving, running but all in a natural and believable way. The opponents, depending on the level of difficulty, are more or less approachable and even if they might seem like cyborgs at first, they actually make mistakes and fouls like us. Perhaps the most difficult thing, which we will have to get used to right away, is coordinating our commands with the players' reactions which are not always immediate. Beyond the simple matches, which in any case will constitute 90% of our activity, the different game modes will keep interest alive, starting with the career which will give a sort of common thread to the various matches that we will have to play, to be a kind of 'report card' with which to constantly compare ourselves, up to the possibility of organizing personalized mini-tournaments and championships, so as to be able to start and finish a challenge that is not too demanding. In short, different degrees of playability are made available to us in order to always provide the player with the most suitable entertainment. Yet, in the best tradition of the consoles, the various bonuses to be unlocked also take care of pushing the player to enter the field. Therefore, we will have to work hard to be able to see the hidden fields or to play with the new champions. Tournaments among friends A not at all secondary feature of this game is the possibility of playing against human opponents and creating real tournaments or championships between friends. Roland Garros 2002 supports the game on LAN or on the same PC, up to four players at the same time, but unfortunately it doesn't allow you to play on the internet. Obviously, if you don't have an abundance of joypads, playing in four on a single PC becomes practically impossible, so it remains a valid option only on the PS2 while PC owners will have to gather in an alan to be able to organize a good tournament. The game options offered in multiplayer are basically the same as those offered in single player, only that it is possible to enter more than one human player at a time. In reality, in the long run the single player game can become boring, even the career mode, because in the end it is repetitive and you always find yourself doing the same things, so the possibility of challenging friends becomes the fundamental resource. if not definitive, to keep the interest alive in a game with a not too long life. Conclusions So, let's see what we can say about a title that fits so well into console stereotypes that it's almost fiendishly embarrassing on PC. The many game modes offer an always continuous challenge and it is quite difficult not to get passionate and not to leaveintrigued by the possibility of organizing the tournaments we want, not to mention the ultimate challenge of unlocking the various bonuses hidden but ostentatiously displayed in the various menus. Playing the first few times is even exciting, then that remnant of television direction that has been introduced, the complete and detailed animations of the models and the ever-present challenge element contribute greatly to creating moments of strong emotion during the games. Conclusions The possibility of playing with other people, then, is that extra element that can make the difference between a game and an event. But how many of us actually have the ability to organize a LAN to play with friends? So, the other option available to us is to play on the same PC, but obviously it becomes more difficult and you will almost always find yourself playing two at a time, so goodbye to doubles between four people at the same time. At this point one wonders if this multiplayer mode will ever be used properly by PC users and one also wonders how the game would have been if we had support for the online world. It wouldn't have been bad at all to be able to compete with players from all over the world and experience a REAL and constantly changing challenge. Maybe, but here we are in the field of speculation, it was possible to organize actual tournaments complete with rankings and charts. Too bad because it was a wasted opportunity. In this way, then, we are faced with a product that is designed for an audience that is different from the one to which it is sold and which, therefore, suffers from it in the long run. Therefore, after the initial passion, you will begin to notice that the direction always repeats the same shots, among other things there is not even the replay, you will notice that the players are always the same, that the rotation of the fields does not offer new stimuli and that you have already played all the playable tournaments. Then the initial fun can dangerously turn into boredom and, without having a constantly evolving element of challenge, as happens with other games that have multiplayer modes that keep you glued to the monitor (without bothering the two Tribes, we can think of the recent Jedi Outcast) , then the life of this Roland Garros, on our PCs, risks becoming dangerously short. Mind you, to be funny it is, but after a while it is likely that there will be no trace left on your hard drive... Great Tennis comes to PC Roland Garros renews the annual tradition with a new chapter dedicated to the most famous sore elbow simulator. Also this year, therefore, one of the most famous titles dedicated to the game of tennis arrives on time and brings with it a wide range of interesting features. Born on consoles, Roland Garros is a fairly explicit conversion, to the point that the authors didn't even bother to hide the PS2 logo in the menus. This fact, as we shall see, influences playability in a decisive way and imposes the use of the gamepad as an optimal control solution. But let's proceed in order. We will be able to choose to play as one of the ten world-class champions present, with names of the caliber of Gustavo Kuerten and Elena Dementieva and organize challenges on the most important fields of Roland Garros and the US Open.", "date": "2002-06-25", "grade": null}
