This is only the first of the reviews that will be dedicated to Battlefield 4 and that will be published on Multiplayer.it in the coming days. What you are about to read is the review for the PC and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, based on an event held in Stockholm. In the coming days, as soon as Electronic Arts sends us review codes for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, we will proceed with the review of the latter, while for the evaluation of the Xbox One version you will have to wait until November 12, the expiry date of the embargo of processing. Reviewing Battlefield 4 is no easy feat. It wasn't even doing it two years ago on the occasion of the third (highly anticipated) chapter; but today, thanks to the arrival of the new consoles, the expectations are far different. DICE has an even more difficult task: ~to lift the morale~ of Electronic Arts after the debacle of Medal of Honor, but above all to affirm technological superiority in situations in which special effects are essential to grab the less ~hardcore~ audience. But behind an exceptional cosmetic that enhances both (and this is obvious) the PC and PlayStation 4 (and this is not at all) hides the usual and solid ~made in Sweden~ mega-project. Solid but, alas, also with a double face: next to a multiplayer sector that keeps what was promised in previous meetings, we find a campaign that, despite everything, is still half a disappointment. Of course, those who buy Battlefield don't do it mainly for the five hours of single player, but there is no doubt that the campaign has the advantage of showing the muscles of the graphics engine and that, like it or not, it is an important part of the gaming experience that we paid, and which must be evaluated with the same attitude as multiplayer. Consider this incipit a small disclaimer to meet considerations that will surely appear over and over again in the comments. Battlefield 4 is the triumph of teamwork but there are some shadows The (un)story... Battlefield 4 is therefore single player and multiplayer, plus the very welcome addition of the test field to start getting familiar with everything we'll encounter in the course of the game, including means. The campaign, lasting between five and six hours, has the hard task of making us forget the mediocre, but technically exciting if played on a properly pumped PC, of the previous edition, undecided between the television approach to Generation Kill and cinematic look a la Call of Duty. With Battlefield 4, DICE is still undecided about what it really wants to propose and if a part of what were the main defects of the past have been taken care of, at the same time others are presenting themselves, between new and old problems not yet effectively resolved. The quality of the narrative is the campaign's biggest weakness. The story revolves around a coup in China, which eliminates the exponent most open to dialogue and moderation of the party, sending a hawk to power, which as per the textbook can only be cynical and ruthless. Who to blame? To the Americans, what questions, who are not invaded, but see a large part of their Pacific fleet completely at the mercy of Chinese attacks. From here unfolds a story that sees us fighting by sea and by land (thankfully never in the air, given the bad memories of the past) in which the small team of marines of which the protagonist is part is tossed between Azerbaijan, the ~Coastal~ China and the hinterland, to find and rescue those who can restore the natural order of things. In short, the classic fantapolitical story, complete with a phoned double game, however narrated in a pedestrian way, with the characters tossed from one place to another for the sole purpose of varying the setting; with ~supporting~ but important players entering and leaving the scene only to advance the script. All then with zero pathos, without the player taking that empathy with the protagonist necessary to tolerate a laughable story. And when DICE wants to tell the human side of its protagonists to try to stage something more than simple two-dimensional figurines useful only to attract enemy fire, it falls into the same mistake as Medal of Honor: Warfighter, that is, it transforms them into ridiculous characters, cloying and out of context. It's not enough to make a soldier compassionate to give him depth, it's not enough to make him sacrifice in the most anticlimactic of endings to make him a tragic hero: never like now we find ourselves faced with full-blown caricatures. In short, the narration is the most forgettable thing about the package, and even if we certainly expected from Battlefield 4nte a focus on multiplayer, here we have really crossed a border rarely seen in products of this kind. But despite everything, as written at the beginning, small steps forward have been made. The pace is finally on good levels, there are no more completely negative missions like the one over the sky of Iran in Battlefield 3, and more generally DICE has been good at keeping downtime almost always below guard level, throwing into mixes borderline situations that often change during the same mission, up to even touching the ~stealth~. We're certainly not talking about a miracle of inventiveness and variety: a setting is practically recycled a couple of times and more generally there is a constant feeling of deja vu, but at least, taken by themselves, the missions are all in all quite fun. Hard to die The level design does its bit to improve the situation, thanks to moments in which the spaces widen a lot, giving the player a wider range of possibilities than the usual routine of the scripted first-person shooter. The battle in the hangars, the complex and enthralling crossing of the city gates on the border with India, the ~outing~ in the high mountains... these are short moments, but really well staged, very funny, capable of galvanizing even the player more allergic to this type of gaming experience, with the map becoming a sort of ~mini sandbox~ in which to move freely. When spaces get tight these qualities are less, making Battlefield 4 decidedly conventional, but without a doubt this choice by DICE was spot on. A little less successful is the possibility through the right backbone to ~tag~ enemies in Far Cry 3, even through walls, thus making them always visible on the map and making things much easier, without forgetting that with a quick press of the same key we can also issue a suppression order, particularly useful for flanking the enemies stationed (the construction of the environments encourages this strategy). However, the large spaces also highlight the obvious difficulties of artificial intelligence. Scripted behaviors are particularly visible; enemies often run towards us without seeing us because their routines require them to hide behind a certain shelter; others expose themselves in plain sight or launch themselves in single file against us, or if hit once they continue undeterred to remain impaled on the same place, getting up and shooting because they have been commanded to do so, perhaps without noticing the shelter that is crumbling underneath of them. This is not always the case, of course, and indeed the enemies often put us in difficulty since they are always many and very fast in moving between one cover and another. Talking about circumventing movements to track down the protagonist is excessive, but it should be noted that they often have the bad habit of appearing in previously cleared areas to surprise us from behind, which is particularly irritating when you are about to arrive at the checkpoint and you die at because of someone who in theory shouldn't be there. Our companions, on the other hand, just do their homework: they have good aim, but often they are not particularly quick to follow us and - what is even more frequent - they throw us out of our shelter if that is their designated place. Another thing we didn't like very much is the rendering of the weapons, not in terms of visuals and audio, but in the excessive amount of lead needed to knock an enemy down, both from close range and from afar. In short, there is a hitbox problem, which unfortunately is also repeated in multiplayer. A shot to the head alone can instantly chill an enemy, otherwise even at point blank range a shotgun does little damage, the same thing goes for the assault rifle, of whatever type it is. Even the sniper one seems to tickle the Chinese, only sniper guns are always effective in any situation. It's strange to see opponents who continually get up after two, three repeated bursts and even who feel nothing when instead our projectile should be lethal. It seems that sometimes our shots are lost in thin air. The feeling, however, that each gun brings as a dowry has been reproduced impeccably; or rather, each of them is peculiar, it's up to us to choose which one best suits our style of play. Talking about choice is right given that with the progression after each killing (in a similar way to what was seen in Bulletstorm) the game calculates a score, thanks to which it is possible to gradually unlock new weapons, to be changed on the fly in the game by accessing convenient refuelingentities with which the levels are dotted (we will find guns and gadgets, to be understood as rocket launchers, mines and much more). The difficulty level didn't seem particularly challenging to us: playing ~normal~ the hardest obstacle are some distant checkpoints, in conjunction with the sudden ~spawn~ of enemies, and even in the most advanced missions you can play quietly without particular worries. Provided of course that you take advantage of all the possibilities that level design offers. Finally 64 players So far Battlefield 4 has little or nothing to offer the seasoned player, in addition to a cosmetic that as a textbook acts and will act as a real benchmark for everything that wants to be ~next gen~. Where DICE has amazed us is obviously in the multiplayer. The heart of the gaming experience is what we all know, finally equal both on PC and on the new consoles. So 60 frames per second and sixty-four players can be enjoyed by everyone, except obviously for owners of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. We could define the multiplayer sector with one word: huge. And not only referring to the size of the maps, but above all for the endless variety of gameplay it offers to the player. To immediately clarify the heart of the game, it is enough to have as a reference two maps that we have played in recent months and which are paradigmatic for the entire Battlefield 4 project, namely Paracel Storm and Flood Zone. The heart of everything is not the ~minute~ destructibility, that of less resistant covers and buildings, however used in large quantities everywhere, but the so-called Levolution, or rather the important changes to the map, scripted but triggered by the player, which destabilize the level during the game. In Paracel Storm a storm slowly builds, the wind whips the palm trees, visibility is reduced by the water spray, the high waves do not allow us to aim steadily using a dinghy or a motorboat. Thinking of swimming to silently reach the capture point on the furthest islet is impossible. Without forgetting the ship anchored offshore that we can crash to create an obstacle on the shore. In Flood Zone, on the other hand, we can destroy an embankment and flood a small neighborhood, reducing the labyrinthine complex of buildings into real islands, thus passing from wheeled vehicles to amphibious ones and enhancing the hot spots located on the roofs: real ~ killing zone~, well structured, full of shelters, extensions and raised points. These are the most striking changes, but also in the maps where the destructive events are less pyrotechnic and more hidden, the level design, the breadth of the battlefield and the tactical union between land and air vehicles, make Battlefield 4 something great. Let's take Golmund Railway: an endless map, probably the largest in the package, in which everything revolves around a railway that cuts it horizontally, where a conquest point is an armored train carriage, which moves and forces us to chase it, for defend or attack it. But it doesn't end there. Golmund would seem tailor-made for the means, both for planes and for tanks, but the infantry also has its place in the sheds below, but above all on the hill where two objectives are next to each other on real terraces. where houses are perfect for close quarters combat; all then perfectly reachable from several points, both on foot and with carts. Tanks that, on a map like this, are the perfect nemesis for infantry when they're out in the open on the wide grasslands at the foot of the hill. However, the vehicles now have weaknesses that can guarantee critical hits more than in the past. They can be blocked, but they can shoot but not move, in short, the novice engineer equipped with a rocket launcher will be able to hit a vehicle three or four times and do little or nothing to it. The veteran will aim at his ~soft parts~, perhaps immobilizing him with a single well-aimed shot. Returning to the maps, another of the ten present at the launch and which particularly impressed us is Rogue Transmission. Smaller than the previous one, but really ingenious; suffice it to say that it focuses on a gigantic parabola similar to that of Arecibo, where it is possible to fight both above and below it, and which, being destructible in several points, can be used to hit those who are below and vice versa. Here too a perfect ~killing zone~, not trivial, with many access points, which can also be traveled by vehicles, and perfectly delimited by three conquest points protected in some structures that are paired with those below the antenna, difficult to conquer and defend due to low light and sc terrain", "date": "2013-10-29", "grade": "8.7"}
