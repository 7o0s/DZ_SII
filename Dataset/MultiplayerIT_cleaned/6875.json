With a very clear choice that has already aroused very strong controversy in the reviews of the application on the various online stores, the Canadian giant has decided not to retrace the same path with FIFA 15, maintaining the free download but eliminating any content beyond of the Ultimate Team, which is no coincidence that it has become an integral part of the title of the game. Right decision or pathological case of short arm? More cards, less football Evidently convinced that Ultimate Team is the most popular mode by FIFA users, EA has therefore decided to bet everything on it, building a free to play model around it, however not too inclined to put its hands in the players' pockets. As many will already know, Ultimate Team combines a managerial structure with mechanics inspired by collectible card games, with the user having to try to make his team evolve starting from a roster and a modest technical staff with the aim of bringing the inside the club the biggest stars of the world football scene. To do this, it is necessary to purchase packages from the appropriate in-game shop containing a certain number of random objects (not only footballers, but also balls, stadiums, uniforms, bonus consumables and so on), of a value proportional to the cost of the item same. There is also a section dedicated to the market, where it is possible to sell excess stickers or buy the cards you want without necessarily having to rely on the fate of the packs. Everything is managed through the by now very well-known dual currency system, with gold coins to be earned simply by playing and credits which are mainly obtained by using a credit card. In principle, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team can be played for free without major problems, as there are no waiting times, stamina indicators or other various tricks to push the user to spend money in order to continue: it is also obvious to point out that the most valuable and the hottest names on the transfer market are sold at prices such as to require infinite times in order to be obtained only with virtual currency. If anything, the limit of the EA title is another, given that a network connection is always required to access the application. It's still the best mobile soccer, but FIFA 15 is a step down from last year's edition Whether you like the Ultimate Team mode or not, it is clear that this latest mobile version of EA football has a lower offer than that of FIFA 14, given that even by paying a surcharge it is possible to choose your favorite team and use it in solo matches or multiplayer. A limitation that will make many turn up their noses, but which (wanting to see the glass half full) has allowed the developers to focus exclusively on a single component, making it complete with all the features of the PC and console versions of the game. The matches can be simulated, but obviously there is still the possibility of taking the field directly by taking control of your team, a situation in which - unfortunately - FIFA 15 Ultimate Team does not show great improvements compared to the last edition. Technically, we are more or less on the same levels as last year, with graphics that therefore offer convincing animations and stadiums with a good glance but which also lend themselves to polygonal models of the athletes that are still rather angular and lacking in detail. In terms of playability and the control system, then, it is clearly seen how the EA developers have not yet managed to fully hit the target. In addition to the classic virtual pad inherited from FIFA 14 (including all actions via taps and swipes on the screen that are reconfirmed to be very impractical), there is now the possibility to choose a simplified command set, which reduces inputs to three keys placed in the lower right corner of the display: a choice that undoubtedly makes things simpler, but which at the same time cuts the legs to any attempt to set up the game in an elaborate way, making it an inappropriate solution especially if you play at higher difficulty levels.", "date": "2014-10-03", "grade": "7.5"}
