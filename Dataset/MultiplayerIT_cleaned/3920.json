The level of involvement guaranteed by the Sports Interactive series is in fact well known to those who have been sitting on the virtual bench for many years, so taken by tactics to adjust and talents to unearth that they never want to part with the football manager that has by now become a piece of history of the video game. However, getting your team to the top of the world is a job that takes a long time to complete, to which the Touch version of Football Manager wants to facilitate access especially for those who are often outside the home, but not only. To understand that it is a game designed for those on the move, it is enough to look at the platforms for which it is available: in addition to the inevitable PC, we also find Android and iOS tablets as well as the one for Nintendo Switch. The Grande N portable console was the one chosen for our Football Manager 2019 Touch game sessions, carried out while sitting comfortably on the sofa, on the train and on the ~throne~. To read our opinion on the matter, all you have to do is read on. The gameplay: simpler tactics If you have already read the Football Manager 2019 review, you will know that among the most important additions of this year's edition is the overhaul of the tactics module. This work also finds an outlet within Football Manager 2019 Touch, where the predefined play styles arrive that coaches can use as a starting point for building their own game module. Choosing between tiki-taka, counter-attack, gegenpressing and other philosophies you can select one of the suggested tactics to best suit the style of play you have in mind, then modifying its default instructions. As in Football Manager 2019, the latter are divided into three phases: attack, transition and defense, with dedicated submenus to give a precise identity to your team's game in the moments of the match they identify. From this point of view, Football Manager 2019 Touch is therefore completely identical to its older brother, with respect to which the section dedicated to training changes instead. Giving up the complexity of the daily programs present in Football Manager 2019 was a desirable thing for those who intend to play the Touch edition, which in fact offers a lighter version divided between team and individual training. To these two subsections is added another one dedicated to tutoring, in which by forming groups made up of expert and young players it is possible to make sure that the latter learn from the former, letting themselves be influenced by them in their attitudes and style of play. It's a pity that this year too there isn't a spring team that allows for the selection and proper care of tomorrow's champions. Continuing in parallel with the game seen on PC, Football Manager 2019 Touch completely eliminates the manager's interactions with the players and the media, thus leaving aside the press conferences and the speeches to be made in the locker room before, during and after the match. Although as we wrote in the Football Manager 2019 review, these interactions need to be completely renewed, it must be said that their total absence is a bit felt. While in the home edition guessing a speech during the interval can allow you to overturn a game born wrong, in the portable one you have to rely only on changes to the tactical plan and substitutions to try to overturn an unfavorable result. Graphics and Controls: New look, with some tweaks The aesthetic aspect of the menus of Football Manager 2019 Touch follows the predominantly purple color of Football Manager 2019, with respect to which Sports Interactive had to carry out an optimization work to ensure that the information on the screen is adequately accessible even on the Nintendo Switch screen. The good result obtained is combined with a control system made up of some shortcuts associated with the keys of the two Joy-Cons, thanks to which it is possible, for example, to press the continue key or access basic menus such as that of tactics directly. In the case of complex operations, you can still make use of the left analog stick, whose movement emulates that of the mouse, or use the touch screen of the console to drag elements and scroll faster vertically. The control system takes some getting used to during the initial stages, but after the first few games of the seasonit's pretty easy to navigate. The less experienced can also count in Football Manager 2019 Touch on the new tutorial called Manager Induction, designed by the developers to gradually introduce those in front of the console to the sections of the game. In fact, it is activated when you access the main sections, showing the primary operations with a wizard that succeeds in avoiding overloading the player with information. Still with regard to the interface, we point out from time to time some slowdown in navigation between the various screens. As far as the 3D engine is concerned, the game performs quite well, net of the same defects found in the analysis of Football Manager 2019. Compared to the latter, the developers wanted to prevent the player from selecting the type of shot with which to see the pitch, thus making only the television view available. The technology linked to the use of VAR has also been introduced in Football Manager 2019 Touch, which appears in the leagues that use it (including our Serie A). Speaking of defects in common with Football Manager 2019, the Touch edition also seems to suffer from the problem of too many injuries (our poor Genoa has been decimated), as well as some occasions in which the players on the pitch make choices that seemed to us little sense.", "date": "2018-12-03", "grade": "7.8"}
