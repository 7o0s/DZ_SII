This is demonstrated by Gamelion, which presents itself in the eShop panorama with a small puzzle game that is very simple in terms of concept, but extremely demanding in terms of the commitment it requires: after all, this has always been the hallmark of great games, especially as regards first decades of the medium. And that Hazumi both winks at the golden age of video games is also demonstrated by the delightfully retro aesthetics. But without anticipating the final judgments too much, let's take a closer look at what we have in front of us. Hazumi is a cute and fresh puzzle game that hides an evil second face Rolling balls We were talking about Breakout. Do you remember? That historic coin op, later also converted for electric toothbrushes, in which we controlled a platform via trackball, on which a ball bounced which had to destroy all the blocks in a level? Well, Hazumi's concept is practically identical, at first glance: there is a ball in constant movement from top to bottom and vice versa, and a whole series of blocks to eliminate. Only that the buffer is missing, and the player directly controls the ball by giving it a movement to the right or to the left. The other different rule is that the blocks are of various colors, and therefore before eliminating, for example, the red ones, the ball must touch the switch which will make it red. So much for the basic concept, which the game quietly introduces you to in the first levels. Soon, however, other elements make their appearance: circular saws that don't really do any good, blocks that cannot be destroyed but only moved, bombs with relative detonators, teleporters, various accelerators. In short, you understand that all this makes the experience much more complex than it might seem at the beginning, even more so when one considers that the layout of the levels gradually becomes more complicated until it becomes labyrinthine: a great dexterity of hands, coldness and also the ability to reason and plan moves will be necessary after only a few of the hundred levels present. The 3D effect With such simple and entirely two-dimensional graphics, stereoscopy can only be limited to detaching the game plan from the backdrops, adding a nice depth effect and nothing more. Like all the rest of the technical department, however, the 3D effect, while still not being amazing in the eyes of anyone, is very well rendered and fits beautifully into the context. In life you have to be demanding As difficult as the levels may be, if one puts himself through them sooner or later he will overcome them all. The real problem arises when it is not certain that we can manage to face them all! Let's see why: like many other games in the genre, Hazumi requires the satisfaction of some requirements to gradually unlock new stages. In this case these requirements consist of a certain number of stars bestowed up to a maximum of three per level. The calculation system for these stars is a bit particular, and is based on time: in practice, each star represents a certain amount of time, which is recharged a little each time a block is destroyed, but if the first star, even with an extraordinary performance it cannot be recharged and therefore a maximum of two stars can be obtained, and so on. Already the difficulty of the title does not help to stock up on stars in each stage, to this we add requirements that the more one goes on the more demanding they become, and here it comes out how much Hazumi is a really demanding game, which can lead to frustrating for less skilled and patient, definitely not for everyone despite the gameplay itself being very, very enjoyable. The other side of the coin is that with only 4 Euros you take home a long-lasting product, with the added possibility of creating your own levels with a complete and intuitive editor. Inexplicably, however, one's creations cannot be shared in any way with the world, except by sending around one's Nintendo 3DS. And even then, only 12 edited levels fit on the SD card. The appeal and potential of the excellent editor are thus considerably limited. At first glance, even the graphics sector would seem limited, due to the pixel art and vintage taste, but don't be fooled: certainly the engine is not a performing beast with billions of polygons, but the glance is vibrant, bright, rich in color and very clear and clean. The sound is also vintage, which does not leave you speechless due to the quality of the compositions but which presents an interesting solution of interaction between the effects and the music.", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "7.0"}
