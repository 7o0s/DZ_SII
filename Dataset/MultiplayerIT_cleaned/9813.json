And Dragon Age: Origins had left us with questions that the most stubborn fans had tried to answer, surrendering to the inevitable certainty that everything would be clear only when BioWare mother wanted it. And the announcement of Witch Hunt, declared as the latest additional content for the first episode of the franchise, promises with great fanfare just the answers that players wanted, bringing back to the scene one of the most beloved and controversial characters: the witch Morrigan. So, mysteries revealed or hoax of the year? To find out, read on, but we warn you: in case you haven't completed the main chapter yet, this article contains a few previews of the ending. Reader warned... Looking for Morrigan? The starting point of Dragon Age: Origins - Witch Hunt is the old house of the deceased Flemeth, where your protagonist (or a completely new one, in case you have decided not to import the save from Origins or Awakening) will learn of the last movements of Morrigan thanks to an elf who finds her guilty of the theft of an ancient text. The elf, Ariane, immediately joins your party along with the trusty hound from the original campaign and it won't be long before the trio becomes a quartet with the entrance of a wizard named Finn. In fact, Ariane and Finn are probably the best element of this additional content: as far as the short duration of the adventure allows, the characterization of the two new characters is very good thanks above all to the various exchanges of jokes and interactions that animate the journey and they recall the comical interludes with dear old Alistair. The plot then revolves around this brief search for ancient artifacts connected to Morrigan's plans, which appears only in the last minutes of the narrative to answer your questions vaguely and evasively. Due to a bug the game sometimes doesn't take into account the choices made at the end of the original campaign, but in case you are lucky enough not to run into this unpleasant problem you will discover that the witch hunt ends as hastily as it began, without close just nothing. Even the two new characters, and the dog of course, are forgotten by the sudden ending, which merely hints at a future return of Flemeth and little more, proposing a vague epilogue that fuels new questions instead of providing answers. Final recycling At least from a purely content point of view Witch Hunt certainly does not make one cry out for a miracle but still offers a certain variety. The new adventure unfolds through four very short dungeons, recycled from the settings previously explored in Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening. The four dungeons are of a different stylistic and thematic nature and each offers a feature that characterizes it compared to the others. In the library department of the Circle of the Magi, for example, you will have to face immortal enemies, at least until another unit in the field is defeated. In another dungeon we will have to interact with light sources that will reveal the points of interaction from time to time; the elven ruins, on the other hand, mainly offer enemies capable of attacking from a distance while the last location will test our strategies against cultists, dragons and a disturbing, how gigantic final boss. In reality, the threat of these dangers is quite contained and the adventure offers well-equipped supporting characters with balanced skills (Finn, for example, is an excellent attacker but also an excellent healer) which make this campaign decidedly simple and smooth , naturally enhanced by the excellent combat system of the series. In short, it is a pity that such a modest and incomplete DLC was used for the grand finale; fortunately, the dialogues and additions to the Codex have the usual obsessive care and quality of BioWare and fans will still appreciate this new excursion into the Dragon Age universe, despite the decidedly limited duration: in fact, it takes just under two hours to complete Dragon Age: Origins - One hundred percent Witch Hunt.", "date": "2010-09-13", "grade": "5.5"}
