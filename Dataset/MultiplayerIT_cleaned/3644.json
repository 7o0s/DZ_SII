And if you don't know Sio (pseudonym of Simone Albrigi), it's useless to go around it, some problems immediately arise: not only have you always ignored the existence of one of the most famous Italian cartoonists and YouTubers of the last five years, but you also lack the basics to play Super Cane Magic ZERO. The videogame in question, developed by Studio Evil and by Sio himself, is ultimately proposed as a definitive tribute to the latter's work, a cauldron where all the ideas, themes, crazy characters and absurd situations that any reader of nonsense comics has come to love by now. If you have never read Sio's comics, therefore, you risk misunderstanding the underlying spirit of the production: set aside the videogame genre, gameplay and technical sector (and it is no small thing, after all) that it is possible to talk about with a certain rationality, the plot, characters and way of telling of Super Cane Magic ZERO remain, which quite simply do not make any sense. And it is precisely for this reason that they are immediately recognizable and that have made their author famous: we will highlight it in the review, trying to understand how and how much they can also work within a video game. Plot, wizards and a dog AAAH! A video game is not a comic. When the Super Cane Magic ZERO crowdfunding campaign was launched back in 2014, completed with excellent results, this aspect perhaps took a back seat. A Sio strip of the simplest format (four panels narrating a short skit) is born, explodes in its nonsense humor, makes everyone happy, and then fades away. It's difficult to go back to reading it more than once, because then the joke (or the situation itself, usually bordering on the insane) is no longer funny. The video game instead requires you to structure a broader experience right from the start: Super Cane Magic ZERO lasts the beauty of twenty hours, to which others can be added if you choose to replay it or find all the secrets hidden in the various levels; and more, if you decide for some reason to start running tournaments in your local PVP arenas. It must not have been easy to find a common thread capable of uniting the absurd characters born from the author's twisted (but brilliant) mind: Sio did it by bringing together in a roughly sensible plot (at least capable of proposing a beginning, a and an end) some of the most famous characters of his comics. Suffice it to say that the initial narrative cue consists of the dog AAAH! (already famous for a series of videos on YouTube), which barking combines the most absurd disasters. The narrative premises will perhaps help you to understand immediately whether or not Super Cane Magic ZERO tickles the strings of your imagination. It all begins when in the magical world of WOTF! the mighty Pie Wizard dies, suddenly, while eating pie salad (and that's okay). His dog was present and goes crazy in pain, becoming a magical dog: from that moment on, every time he barks, he does something very strange and destabilizing for the order of things and the world. Among the most recent disasters: it covered the moon with an impenetrable layer of chocolate, it froze a volcano, it started the fall of meteorites full of canine magic. In short, everything must be brought back to normal (or to what in this bizarre world comes closest to normal), and to do that you need a hero. The hero is of course the protagonist player, who in the meantime had plenty of time to create his alter ego by choosing from some unthinkable characters called Coso, Cosa, Giancoso, Annacosa and so on. Initially devoid of memory, the hero will begin a series of daring adventures sometimes driven by a minimum of internal coherence, sometimes by pure chance: he is imprisoned in a space prison, then freed, wanders the plains, reaches distant realms through portals and much more before facing the bad guy on duty and restoring peace. Gameplay: RPG (for real) Now, if the narrative premise of Super Cane Magic ZERO can be liked or not, and especially the author's fans can like it, it must be noted that the video game in and of itself is a fairly solid action RPG, unexpectedly deep and rich in content. Sio's production is an RPG, an RPG accessible to all, but real: just consider that each character has parameters, game class and powers that are very different from each other. Everything is always guided by the nonsense context, the same one that in the gameplay still manages to justifypay attention to the variety of game aspects offered: Annacosa, for example, belongs to the influencer class. Her stats are not the same as Coso's, a simple wizard: the two characters will therefore give their best using a different type of equipment in battle. Accessories, weapons and clothing can be modified at any time from the inventory, provided you find objects worthy of interest in the loot left on the ground by enemies: they too are crazy, but the advantages they provide in battle are tangible. A male character can easily wear a pair of grandfather's underwear or a bra, and the latter provide very specific stat bonuses; a sword can replace a ruler in battles against enemies, but the ruler could have interesting advantages. In a certain way, an attempt is made to lead to experimenting with different styles and approaches, but only partially succeeding due to a rather lenient challenge rate. The quality of the drop and of the tools that can be found varies according to the difficulty level of the main adventure: the higher this is, the better the loot. Super Cane Magic Zero can be played solo or in cooperative mode, with up to four friends at the same time. The perspective from above, the constant presence of a minimap in the corner of the screen and the two-dimensional and clean level design are all aspects that make the exploration of the levels extremely intuitive, which in spite of a discreet vastness are almost always organized by compartments ponds - small square or rectangular areas from which one easily moves to the next. Each area is then good, in the minds of the developers, to remember how in Super Cane Magic ZERO RPG and action go hand in hand: as soon as you get out of the prison of the first level, for some reason crazy feet (yes, crazy feet) attack, forcing the player to quickly remember the information learned from the quick tutorial. The sense of general difficulty has never been a real problem during our raids at WOTF, however some only partially finished aspects of the production make the experience less pleasant than it could have been. All right, it is possible to even eat stones to recover energy, and the precious citation of Sio's work is evident, but the commands for picking up and throwing objects leave a lot to be desired; just as the management of fights against large groups of enemies is not entirely convincing, where it is not always clear how and why the collisions are (or are not) successful. It is better not to talk about loading times at all, since it is incomprehensible how all in all contained levels and a reasonable number of elements on the screen require almost eternal transition phases, even simply to return from a dungeon to a throne room. The funny cartoons that scroll between the uploads themselves don't help much, because after a couple of hours they begin to become repetitive, or worse still, they are directly re-proposed. From this point of view, in five years of work, Sio could have easily designed a few more.", "date": "2019-05-29", "grade": "7.0"}
