{"name": "James Cameron's Dark Angel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/james-camerons-dark-angel.html", "text": "Max Solid Payne... ! It goes without saying that Dark Angel combines various elements that have been part of the heritage of classic action games for some years now. Stealth action, combined with fights where kung fu and firearms are the masters, all seasoned with the now famous Matrix-style slow-motion, an effect with which a certain action sequence can be spectacularly slowed down. The game takes place in Detroit, a metropolis which is subject to a severe curfew and therefore closed in areas monitored by the police; the latter has the purpose of maintaining order but also of finding Max and his fugitive ~brothers~. With the help of Logan, a very expert hacker, we will be guided in the various areas of the game, but it will be thanks to Max's super-soldier skills that we will have to complete the missions; in some cases we will have the possibility to choose whether to hit the enemies by surprise, perhaps from behind, rather than descending from above and then breaking their neck with our legs, but it will also be possible to strike from a distance with electric shocks or look for alternative ways to avoid be found. To access the following areas we will then have to recover some cards, which in any case we will only obtain after having shot down the soldier who owns them and in general we can say that the possibility of choosing how to proceed is very limited. Basically, in fact, the game is reduced to a scrolling fighting game, in which it will be necessary to eliminate all the enemies present in the playing area in order to continue. At dawn? ...just a few hours! It won't take long to complete Dark Angel, also because despite the more than 20 missions, once you enter the game perspective, you will find that the faster you are in eliminating enemies, the faster you will advance. There aren't many variations in terms of gameplay and are mostly limited to the possibility of making some new movements as you progress through the game missions; new movements which, moreover, will not be particularly useful for the continuation of the adventure, which will continue to go on between jumps, punches, kicks and some explosions, useful for opening gates within the play areas. Furthermore, in combat, it will be possible to see one's strength increase further, thanks to a bar located in the lower part of the screen which, as we are hit by enemies, will signal the accumulated rage coefficient; once the bar is at its maximum, our shots will become even more lethal. Basically we can say that playing Dark Angel consists only in clearing an area with blows and proceeding to the next one. This is because, even when you look for a more stealth approach, you will remain unarmed by the pre-Columbian AI of your enemies and then it will become inevitable to seek physical confrontation, in order not to make the gaming experience excessively soporific. For a few more polygons. To what has been said must be added a technical sector which, if at a very first approach seems to hold also thanks to the discreet polygonal model of Max, turns out instead to be sufficiently made and devoid of those characterizations that should give the scenography, always too much the same, that fascinatingly dark tone typical of the TV series. The lighting effects are quite taken care of, but everything returns to mediocrity when you start running and fighting; the animations are in fact approximate and not very harmonized with each other, and the enemies, as already mentioned, are decidedly stupid. Only in some very rare cases does the game become more interesting, thanks to the fact that you can perform some stunts using the walls to push yourself and pounce on enemies with spectacular flying kicks, but everything returns to normal after a few seconds. Finally, the music, apart from some more inspired themes than others, is normal thanks also to the fact that it is taken entirely from the TV series. More generally we can say that the sound, unlike the game, is adequate for a video game of this century, with a note of merit to the speech which, thanks to the use of the original voice actors, is very well made. Definitely Taking a cue from an already not exciting television series, and turning it into an at least decent video game, would have been a more unique than rare undertaking, and with Dark Angel we are certainly not faced with the exception that proves the rule. The Sierra title is only good in voice acting, and that's thanks to the voice actors. For the rest, the programmers of Radical Entertainment have tried to create a modern action game, introducing elements typical of the most current productions, but have ended up creating an approximate product, which is not particularly convincing due to the lack of thickness and which in factto boils down to a boring scrolling beat 'em up, devoid of bite and ultimately too easy. PROS Great voice acting Easy to perform combos For the fans contains an interview with Jessica Alba CONS Technically below average Gameplay flat as a mummy's brain Dark Angel is a television series coming by chance from the USA, where, however, it was suspended due to the low audience, which arrived in Italy a few weeks ago. The creator is the well-known director James Cameron (Aliens, The Abbys, Terminator, Titanic, just to name a few) and the interpreter the beautiful Jessica Alba. The story takes shape around the year 2020, in a semi-destroyed Detroit due to an electromagnetic catastrophe, which crashes computers and electronic equipment of all kinds. The Great Pulse, as this catastrophe was called, caused the military to look for new biological weapons, and this is where genetics comes into the picture. a group of scientists from the multinational Manticore decided that the time had come to create super soldiers, mixing human and feline DNA. Max, this is the name of the protagonist, is one of these genetic soldiers. Escaped, still a child, from the prison-institution in which she was subjected to very harsh training, she now tries to find the other ten boys who, like her, managed to escape. However, the one who in fact is in charge of the whole experiment sets out on their trail, his goal is to find all eleven fugitives and bring them back to the Manticore, if this is not possible we can proceed with the elimination.", "date": "2003-04-02", "grade": null}
