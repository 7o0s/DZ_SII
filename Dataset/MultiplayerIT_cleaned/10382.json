{"name": "Kaemmer colpisce ancora!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72208-iracing-kaemmer-colpisce-ancora.html", "text": "Every self-respecting virtual driver who has a good experience in the field of online racing with real driving simulators on PC should have heard at least once in his life from ~sim driver~ of the genius David Kaemmer or at least have tried one of the titles branded Papyrus. Know that this gentleman enjoys the same prestige as Geoff Crammond, author of the Gran Prix series on PC for the top Formula 1, and that the Papyrus development team has been the point of reference for years as regards the implemented physics and the driving achieved in the driving simulators ever. If these two names don't tell you anything, you can always make up for lost time, but it is also probable that you are not interested in doing so, since your tastes could be far from the extreme realistic imprint pursued, but know that you will never be able to say that you have lived deep into the world of virtual racing, if you have never tried and appreciated at least one of the titles of the caliber of Indianapolis 500 (debut simulator back in 1989), Indycar Racing I and II, the entire Nascar Racing series, and the legendary Grand Prix Legends (released well over 10 years ago). Without taking anything away from the excellent SimBin creatures with the GTR and Race Pro series, the great and evergreen rFactor, the Italian pearl netKar Pro by Kunos and the very good Live for Speed, it must be said that they are all simulators that came later and that they have done nothing else than taking Keammer's masterpieces as a model, trying to improve some aspects with respectable results. What is iRacing? Closing the Papyrus chapter and founding the iRacing Motorsports developer and publisher team, David and other talented programmers got to work on a project that made headlines for over two years, which had the original aim of becoming the new frontier of virtual driving simulation, objective, let's say immediately, achieved even if with some small ~but~. iRacing is a fully multiplayer-oriented car racing simulator, which requires registration and subscription to be able to use it and compete online in all the categories offered. So there are no championships against artificial intelligence, much less dry solo races, but only online game sessions, in which you race against human opponents with the utmost respect and fair play, avoiding aggressive attitudes, counter attacks and keeping in mind the full-bodied code of conduct on the track present in the briefing phase of the game before climbing into the cockpit of our car. It must be pointed out that it is essential to pay attention, because each of our infractions will always be under the watchful eye of the virtual online commissioner ready to sanction any of our violations or misconduct while driving on the track. In practice, the system tries to reward clean driving, keeping track of track exits, wall contacts and accidents with other cars, finally affecting one's ranking or ability coefficient which we will have to increase in score to move up the rank and have the doors are wide open for new vehicle categories and new possible races. Curiosity To simulate with iRacing you must register on the site and pay the subscription. In this way you have access to online competitions and a whole series of services that serve to make the gaming experience unique. There are various subscription possibilities: we will be able to register with the Try Us formula with which we will practically be able to try the simulation for a month for the cost of $14 (about 10), otherwise there is the Season Pass formula which for $36 will give us the possibility to subscribe for three months ($12 per month, about 8 per month), finally there is a one-year subscription for $99 (about 67) called Most Popular or the two-year subscription called Best Value which is $179 (about 120) and therefore about 5 a month, but requires us to pay a really high initial cost, suitable only for true enthusiasts. For about 12$ (8) you can also buy additional cars and tracks, recommended only once you have risen in rank. The game does not start, but the browser! Once the client has been downloaded and installed, if we click on the game icon, the web page dedicated to registered users will open. Through the site we will have access to a multitude of data about each registered pilot, after the first ten minutes during which we find ourselves a bit lost, we become familiar with everything. Through the site we will also be able to customize the livery of our car in a very simple way and with really excellent results (though not with the same freedom as Forza Motorsport), we will be able to choose the color of our racing suit and the colors and graphics of the helmet. On the site are always well andonce the events in progress on the servers are highlighted with the session start times, as the list is very extensive, we will be able to filter taking into account our category, the modalities: Race, Qualification, Time Trial, and the type of Oval or Road track. As soon as we register, our rank will be low and so we will have online access to only a few events. At the beginning we will have to sweat a lot in long Time Trial sessions to increase the score and have the possibility to play the first online races against other human competitors. If we wish, we can also undertake tests, thus freely choosing the car to use among the three present and the track (there are 7 tracks with a total of 14 variants in the season ticket) but in this way we will not be able to improve our rank, thus becoming real practice sessions during which we won't have the pressure of the inflexible eye of the virtual commissioner ready to sanction us for every mistake. not for all... iRacing is a title that requires a lot of time and dedication, it's a parallel life like World of Warcraft style MMOs. During the game period which to tell the truth was never enough, before the delivery of the review, we were only able to try two online races against other virtual drivers at the end only after having had to support several Time Trial sessions both on ovals and on tracks for achieve an adequate ranking. During the online races although the ping was high at about 160ms, a condition due to the fact that the servers are located only in America, there were no problems with the connection, on the contrary we were impressed by the truly optimized netcode so as to make it seem like we were running a race in LAN. Absolutely to mention the sensations in the race: you feel the pressure of having to do well and not make mistakes, you are amazed by the skill of the other users and by their attention to avoid sudden maneuvers and contacts in the race, practically the utmost respect applies. The price and the difficulty of the game make it clear that the users are all professionals with a lot of experience behind them, real driving gentlemen who do nothing but excite you in the race and always keep your adrenaline at very high levels. At the end of the race you feel tired but with a feeling of satisfaction for having managed to stay in the group without having committed any infringements or having lost control of the car. Really nice albeit damn difficult. The physics are decidedly realistic and convincing, each type of car has its own driving model which makes it distinct. The last words on the well-crafted sound and ultimately the graphics that take up the Nascar Racing 2003 graphics engine, improving it slightly, but still remaining behind the latest current productions. The tracks (purely American) are in any case perfect being reproduced using laser scan technology with meticulous care especially of the road surface with all the bumps and depressions present in the real tracks.", "date": "2009-11-16", "grade": "8.5"}
