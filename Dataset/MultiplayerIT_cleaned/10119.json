This software house, author of absolute masterpieces of the genre such as Rhapsody, La Pucelle: Tactics, Phantom Brave and the Disgaea series, seems to have discovered the holy grail of the genre, and each of its works is characterized by a certain general quality as well as from a depth of play and a massive dose of irony that are now a real ~trademark~ of the team. Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days is the PlayStation Portable port of Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories of PlayStation 2 and although it is chronologically the second installment of the series, it is not a sequel proper. Also in this case, as happened in the past for another transposition of a title of the saga on the Sony laptop, i.e. Disgaea: Afternoon Darkness, a whole series of features have been introduced by Nippon Ichi (new bosses, new maps, a new story mode and comfortable equipment) aimed at improving and expanding the original product, which is already quite valid in itself. Among these, without spoiling too much so as not to take away the taste of the surprise and the pleasure of discovering them for yourself by playing, we only point out the presence of several unpublished characters (Asagi, Marjoly, Prism Red, Zetta, Demon Lord Priere, Mid-Boss, Gordon) and some elements taken from Disgaea 3, such as for example a small group of heroes presented here in the form of Bosses who, defeated in special event battles, can then be enlisted or the Magic Change System, i.e. the ability for two characters placed side by side in battle (a human and a monster) to combine their respective skills to perform a devastating special attack. We will talk more about this feature later. Adell and Rosalin While as far as the plot is concerned there is nothing particularly different except for the exclusive presence of the Axel Mode (the equivalent of the Etna Mode of Disgaea: Afternoon Darkness), a mode in which the player can better understand the story of Axel's past, also enjoying the presence of new scenarios and classes. In the world of Veldime the evil Lord Zenon launches a strange curse that affects the inhabitants who are slowly transformed into hideous monsters, while losing memory of their past life. The only one to save himself from this authentic apocalypse is a boy named Adell. With the help of the ~trick-eyed~ summoning mother, the young man decides to face the fearsome Lord Zenon to stop his devastating madness and save friends and family before their transformation is complete (for example, his father has a demon embedded in his chest, and he will soon take over him in terms of personality) by summoning him directly to his home through an arcane rite. But instead of the Overlord, the young man finds himself in front of his own eyes the spoiled daughter of the latter, Rozalin, who had never set foot outside his luxurious home before. Desperate by the girl's arrogant attitudes and to exploit her as a ~Trojan horse~, Adell decides to bring her back to her terrible father. Thus begins a long adventure in which humor, fights and (a few) twists and turns will follow one another in a whirlwind of feelings that will often contrast the two protagonists and the various characters who will join the party, among which the amusing figure of Tink, Rozalin's French-accented childhood friend, transformed by an unknown enemy into a flying frog with dual personalities, one meek and cowardly, the other crabby and lascivious. explosive panels Features such as the one just mentioned not only have a purely ironic value in terms of plot or aesthetics (Tink changes color from blue to red or according to its character of the moment), but also affect the gameplay, demonstrating the care that usually Nippon Ichi pours on his productions. In fact, based on the personality shown during a fight, the aforementioned frog will be able to count on certain skills rather than others. The battle develops as usual in turns and on land divided into a grid, first a party starts and then it's up to the enemy. Both groups of contenders can move or launch attacks in this phase, all in relation to many parameters related to the physical and technical characteristics of the PC and terrain that will greatly influence these actions: a flying creature will cover a wider space of movement than a The other earthling, as well as an attack launched from the top of a certain position or from the flank, will cause more damage to the opponentio compared to the equivalents launched from the front or from the same line in which it is positioned. Without forgetting the possibility of throwing opponents and allies against enemies (the exploding Prinnies are beautiful as always) and the famous Geo Panels. These are none other than colored panels placed on the pavement of a given area and which indicate the presence in the area of Geo Crystals, special pyramidal magic crystals which give bonuses (negative or positive) to all the boxes of the color they are on. However, the latter are not always of the same color as the crystals they host, so if this object is destroyed in this case all the Geo Panels will acquire its color causing damage at the same time to anyone who is on a square about to change colour. From Disgaea 3 to Disgaea 2 It is also possible to take advantage of the Magic Change System, the special ability that we learned about in Disgaea 3 for PlayStation 3 and which consists, as we anticipated at the beginning of the article, in the ability to unify the skills of two party members to perform an attack particular. To do this you must use a monster ally and a human PC. The first, after selecting the appropriate command in the party control menu, changes its shape and becomes a weapon in the hands of the second and in this way it is possible to combine the power of both. For the rest Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days is structured like any product by Nippon Ichi: the gameplay involves the usual advancement through a series of chapters divided in turn on average into four or five checkerboard-structured dungeons in which to fight, defeat all enemies present in the area until the final confrontation with the area Boss to complete an episode which, depending on the case, may also have a certain relevance for the storyline plus dozens and dozens of things to do, discover, overcome, create, confronting Dark Assembly and Item Assembly, parallel and dark worlds and universes enclosed within single objects. And collecting as many bonuses as possible before proceeding to the next level. These bonuses can vary in number and quality in relation to the level reached by a special indicator bar: the latter increases according to the damage inflicted on enemies, and therefore with the use of combos it is easier to raise it. Obviously, by advancing in level, it will be possible to acquire new special attack skills or weapons suitable mainly for the damage of entire areas (and therefore collective) rather than individual ones. Technical realization In this sense, the crimes committed by a character and the judgment that a special court will give on them also play an important role. In fact, the game provides that party members can be judged for their actions, real or presumed to be. The first to enter a courtroom, even if ~innocent~, will bear the blame for some wrongdoing. The more crimes a character accumulates, the greater the benefits that derive from them in terms of experience points, HL, etc. In addition to determining some of the various endings available. It should be noted that by exploiting the possibility offered by the Magic Change System and by placing several heroes on each other's shoulders, it is possible to have a group of PCs enter the classroom at the same time as if it were a single entity and therefore earn criminal points for more elements. In short, there would be so many things to tell about this title to fill a booklet. For all the specific details, to avoid repeating ourselves, however, we refer you to the exhaustive review of the PlayStation 2 version which can be reached by clicking here. Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days uses a 3D graphics engine with an isometric view and two-dimensional characters. The camera is placed slightly closer to the action than in past productions and can pan, zoom away or shoot from a higher point, changing the view of the ground but not of the PCs. In our opinion, the engine performs its task best and it is necessary to underline the excellent work of the developers in this sense. The sprites of the characters are very detailed, ditto the respective static avatars and the environments, well-kept and colorful. The same goes for weapons, special attacks and animations that are very detailed. Suffice it to say that the former are all visible on the screen in the hands of the heroes while the latter can boast their respective animations complete with spectacular skits. Different speech related to audio. If the samples relating to monsters, humans and various side dishes fall into the category of the genre, the soundtrack lacks repetitiveness and the sensation of ~already heard~ given that in this production a large part of thesongs featured in the first Disgaea. On the positive side, however, there is the fact that in this PSP edition there is a Music Shop where you can buy and select the pieces you love most.", "date": "2010-03-24", "grade": "8.8"}
