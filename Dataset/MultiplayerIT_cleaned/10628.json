Sometimes the results are more than commendable, as in the case of Zeno Clash; unfortunately sometimes this is not the case. Behind this project is a Californian team, which on its homepage defines itself as made up of ~videogame industry veterans and talented designers~ (textual). A presentation that is probably too self-congratulatory given that they barely boast the semi-unknown mod for Half-Life 2 Paleolithic Revolution. Drug Wars/Merchants Of Brooklyn (depending on whether you play in multiplayer or single player mode) has caught the attention of insiders for using the CryEngine 2, the graphics engine used for Crysis. It is a FPS in which the player plays the role of Matteo, a subspecies of genetically modified homo erectus, who moves in a New York of the future following an undefined purpose, other than to pulverize hordes of enemies with unfriendly intentions . From the first minutes you can recognize clear references to Kingpin: Life of Crime, a shooter from the late nineties, especially in the character design and in the level of violence. If we hadn't been aware that the game is powered by the same graphics engine capable of making jaws drop with Crysis, we would have gone so far as to say that this Merchants of Brooklyn also shared the same technology as the Xatrix game, namely that of Quake II. Instead, we were really stunned to see the paucity of the technical apparatus. Explosions, shadows and other particle effects can be counted on the fingers of a crippled hand and recall those of decades-old titles; the characters, made in cel shading, make us regret those of Oni for the quality and variety of animations and polygons. Unfortunately there are also serious bugs that undermine the actual gaming experience: huds that sometimes disappear, invisible characters, frequent crashes that lead to abrupt returns to the desktop, unstable frame rates regardless of the level of detail. Water everywhere As for the actual game structure, MoB follows the trend of the various Painkillers and Serious Sams: you have to shoot everything that moves while avoiding getting killed. Health regenerates automatically (and all the faster the lower the difficulty level) and weapons boast almost infinite ammo. They also have two fire modes: the first is activated by simply pressing the left mouse button while for the second you need to press the right one for a few more seconds. The enemies are the most brutally elementary imaginable, real cannon fodder that makes the monsters of Doom 2 candidates for the Nobel prize. In most cases they move nonchalantly between the various levels, made with little care, shooting as best they can; in others, on the other hand, they remain completely still waiting for the journey towards a more peaceful life. Wanting to break the classic lance in favor of the Paleo boys, one could speak well of variety and balance of weapons, but these are a few drops that are lost in the carelessness in which the title navigates. Audio compartment and presentation betray the amateur nature of the project and certainly don't make you want to buy; of the first we limit ourselves to noting the poor quality of the dubbing and the sound effects, which are not always synchronized. It was impossible for us to see the presentation until the end, made in a comic style, as if it weren't another bug but a desperate attempt by the game to save decorum. Finally, the multiplayer apparatus is inexcusable, with the only server available, the official one, always and desolately empty at each start of the game.", "date": "2009-07-15", "grade": "3.0"}
