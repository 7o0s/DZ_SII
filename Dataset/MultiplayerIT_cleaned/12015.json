{"name": "Obscure II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/obscure-ii-recensione.html", "text": "Pair up The gameplay is very similar to the first chapter which, in turn, was a survival horror with a very classic setting. Fans of the original will be happy to know that the cooperative mode has been retained, with the possibility of two players playing on the same computer managing one character each at the same time. In case you don't have a brother, a sister, a trusted friend, a prodigy dog or a parent who is passionate about video games, don't worry, because the AI is perfectly capable of guiding the second character without making human intelligence regret too much. Indeed, the CPU-driven character often proved very useful in combat and never got stuck somewhere forcing us to go back and get him. There will be six characters to guide, each characterized by different skills that will prove essential to continue the adventure. In fact, usually, each area will have puzzles designed for a specific boy but, fortunately, you will not have to constantly retrace your steps to select the right character from one of the collection points (they are places where heroes gather and can be selected to enter game); the latter are very intelligently positioned in the various scenarios and do not weigh on the gameplay, making the advance towards the grand finale extremely fluid. The weapons available to the characters are discrete in quantity and variety. They range from the classic baseball bats to more or less powerful firearms (pistols, rifles and others). In short, the arsenal for fighting organic monsters and darkness is quite classic and offers no surprises, as well as the enemies, too similar to those of the first episode to impress. Jokes Perhaps the real problem with Obscure II is that it fails to impress in any area. The gameplay, as already mentioned, is very classic, but the atmosphere and the monsters are never really scary. It often seems that they are placed in a phone call so as not to create too much tension. On a couple of occasions there is some jolt, but these are rare moments that don't leave their mark. The puzzles are of discreet workmanship, but sometimes it is not possible to understand what to do due to faults not attributable to the player. For example, what to do when the camera decides to sit still and not follow the character, failing to show a door or some object? It happened on various occasions to have to go in circles trying to force the camera to frame some fundamental detail. These are moments, true, but they are moments in which we regret the prequel which, however, did not have these defects. Let's also say that the story isn't exactly the best (it struggles to take off throughout the game), and that the characters are rather stereotypical in their ape of the college types that thousands of TV shows and movies have imposed on us over the years. We confess that we have often rooted for the monsters, especially after yet another inappropriate joke, made by one of the boys, capable of destroying any possibility of identification or immersion. Compare versions Another problem of no small importance is the graphics sector. The PS2 version is well done, with well-made models and spot-on textures, although certainly not miraculous in detail (Resident Evil 4 is always on another planet) and with very beautiful light effects, especially those coming from the windows. The worst version is definitely the PC one, less stable (more than a few times we ended up looking at the desktop without too many warnings) and, above all, less acceptable from a visual point of view. In short: it's a mere porting of the PS2 version with stretched textures and a few more details. It probably would have been uneconomical to produce an exclusive version, but as it stands Obscure II on PC feels like a game from a few years ago. A separate note deserves the soundtrack, truly spectacular: played by the Boston Symphonic Orchestra and the children's choir of the Paris Opera. If it weren't there, the already small atmosphere would be destroyed. Also the PC version suffers from a flaw in the control system that the PS2 version does not. In short, the keys to use are many and the keyboard is uncomfortable. Definitely better to use a joypad, but with the Xbox 360 one we had some mapping difficulties. Probably the ideal solution is to have a PS2 joypad with the PC adapter. But how many will have both? We also wonder why the actions have been distributed over several keys, when they could comfortably fit on just one, opening up a multiple choice in the rare cases of multiple possible interactions on a single object. Mysteries of game design. System Requirements (PC version) Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 3 1.0 GHz or AMD equivalentlens RAM: 256 MB Video Card: DirectX compatible and equipped with 32 mb video memory DirectX 9.0c DVD Player Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Obscure II is a decent survival horror that fails to excel in anything. It has some good moments, but it never crosses the thin line that divides the common experience from the exceptional one. The PC version must be deducted by another 4 points, due to the mediocre technical realization and the various problems illustrated in the final part of the article. In short, recommended to fans of the genre in withdrawal crisis. The others can even pretend it hasn't come out. Pros Good character handling Fun multiplayer mode Great soundtrack Cons Graphically outdated (on PC) Cameras are unresponsive Story trivial We had left the kids at Leafmore High, at the end of the first Obscure, survivors after saving the school from the dark menace of a green-thumbed psychopath. Unfortunately for them, the game has sold enough to allow the developers to make a sequel, and therefore the black flowers have returned to threaten their useless existence, together with that of another college (couldn't it be that these are like Fletcher? Where do they go does anyone die?). The game begins in the room of a student (one of the protagonists) who gets up from the bed where he was sleeping with his girlfriend (let's not be indiscreet). Soon we find ourselves wandering the corridors of the dormitories, with students swearing, others running to the bathroom to throw up and others on their cell phones. In addition to listening to the grunts of the local fauna, it is possible to examine various elements of the scenario in order to obtain more or less bizarre descriptions that mimic US teen movies, those like American Pie, so to speak. In short, it is difficult to get through the first few minutes of the game without encountering some winks at sex and, more generally, at the dissolute life that takes place in what should be a university. Nothing wrong, for heaven's sake, but everything tastes a little too forced. Luckily there are monsters. After some healthy wandering, you end up in another student's room and, after ingesting some strange stuff, in the first nightmare of the game. The atmosphere is quite horror, even if, to tell the truth, there is little tension. You advance, you strike a few blows with the club, you go down into a dungeon, you find yourself with the rifle in your hand and you get to face a couple of invincible monsters that take us out of the nightmare. What happens? It won't take long to understand this and, indeed, in the next sequence, which takes place during a party, one of the old characters will recognize the darkness produced by flowers. Don't worry, there are some twists, but don't expect great things in terms of plot: it's the usual battle between darkness and a group of teenagers torn between heroism and hormones.", "date": "2007-09-11", "grade": null}
