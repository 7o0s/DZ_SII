{"name": "One Piece: Grand Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/one-piece-grand-adventure.html", "text": "The devil fruit Those who follow the publication of One Piece or its animated transposition (renamed in Italy ~All'arrembaggio~ ...) know Luffy's passion for adventure and his desire to become the greatest existing pirate, a desire that leads him to leave and build a crew made up of particular and valiant characters: Roronoa Zoro the swordsman, Nami the navigator, Sanji the cook, Chopper the doctor and so on. This well-matched group will have to face incredibly dangerous situations due to a series of formidable opponents, almost all endowed with special powers thanks to the ~devil fruit~, a forbidden fruit that gives whoever eats it extraordinary abilities depending on the case but which renders it unable to float at sea. Luffy, for example, after eating the Gom Gom fruit, discovered that he could stretch his body as if it were made of rubber, and trained accordingly to become a powerful fighter. And he's not the only one. Grand Adventure does nothing but revisit all the episodes of the series (still far from finished), so in the main game mode you will have the possibility to leave and meet new characters from location to location: some will become your allies and join the adventure or they will simply give you their external support; others will be your worst enemies, and you will face them on various occasions. The structure of the game is expressed in the decision of the route and in landing at a stage, which can translate into a generic challenge (for example a ~rumble battle~, or a clash against a series of enemies; or a test of a particular genre, such as a race or a demolition contest) or a specific challenge, a fight with a particular character. Gameplay How are fights handled in One Piece: Grand Adventure? Well, basically we are faced with something similar to Power Stone, therefore with the characters free to move in a three-dimensional scenario as if it were any action game. The X button punches, Circle kicks, Triangle jumps, and Square grabs objects. To parry, one of the right backbones must be pressed, while the left backbones activate the combinations necessary for the supermoves. As we progress in the game, some characters will guarantee us their support during the clashes: by holding down the L2 key and pressing the Square twice, we will be able to recall the ally selected at the beginning of the fight to help us, by consuming one of the bars of spiritual energy otherwise assigned to the use of supermoves. As mentioned above, Grand Adventure contains some of the typical elements of RPGs: our group grows as we go along, but the individual characters also grow through the acquisition of the classic experience points. Leveling up a character means making him more powerful and ~spending~ upgrades to improve one or more of his characteristics: attack power, defense effectiveness, health level, super moves effectiveness, item effectiveness, allies. In some cases the choice to always use the same character will be rewarded, in others you will regret not having upgraded the whole crew in a balanced way. Note the fact that once the adventure is completed it will be possible to repeat it using other unlocked characters, perhaps even some disreputable types Secondary modalities and technical realization In addition to the Grand Adventure mode, the game allows you to engage in the Grand Battle. In this case you will be able to choose between different competitions to participate in: versus mode (a clash of your choice with the CPU or with a human opponent), arena (a series of fights that will see you climb a specific ranking), tournament (a tournament, in fact , even for a large number of players), training and special battle (which allows you to customize a fight down to the smallest detail). The graphics of the game are really well done, with the characters reproduced in a caricatured way (with the head larger than normal, therefore), with great detail and with a series of good animations, especially those concerning the special moves. Even the locations do not disappoint, they clearly refer to what was seen in the manga (or in the anime) and do their duty without shining in terms of interactivity and above all of extension. The use of colors is commendable, witnessing a very cartoonish and really spot on style. The whole is seasoned with a sound sector that is up to the situation, in which for once the speech in English does not annoy and the music stands out for its quality. Small side notee: the transliteration of the names is completely different from the one adopted by those who take care of the Italian edition of the manga (let's not talk about the anime, which is better), so you will be faced with stuff like ~Monkey D. Luffy~ and Roronoa Zolo etc. etc. Maybe an Italian translation of the game could have solved this problem: too bad. [C] The locations related to the Chopper saga are really well done. At any time it is You can check the progress of the crew. Luffy is the character most powerful, his moves are devastating. [/C] Comment It seems to be a really great time for Namco Bandai, which is churning out titles of unquestionable quality taken from the most successful manga and/or anime one after the other. One Piece: Grand Adventure, in particular, is a game that grabs you right away and conquers you for the large number of moves, for the character growth system and for the fidelity with which it follows the original story of One Piece. In the general picture, the unlockable characters (the total reaches twenty-four) and those who will merely support you (about fifty) are an added value, much more incisive than the usual extras represented by animations, cards and so on (although present) . A good tie-in, therefore, which will not fail to conquer all fans of the series. Pros: Great graphics Great RPG elements Numerous extra modes Cons: Not just for fans, but almost Very similar to the last Grand Battle No Italian localization One Piece: Grand Adventure is available for PlayStation 2 and GameCube. The version used for this review is the PlayStation 2 version. One Piece is one of the manga of the ~new generation~ that is enjoying the greatest success both in and outside Japan, and this success was celebrated as usual through the creation of an animated series first and then some video games. One Piece: Grand Adventure is the latest of these products and incorporates most of the characteristics of the previous titles (of the Grand Battle series), mixing combat and RPG elements in a party that will not fail to thrill fans of Monkey D. Luffy and the his friends.", "date": "2006-12-07", "grade": null}
