This is the price on the App Store of Threes!, the latest effort by the tiny independent Sirvo LLC team made up of Asher Vollmer (former member of thatgamecompany), Greg Wohlwend (Ridiculous Fishing, Hundreds) and Jimmy Hinson (Borderlands 2, Mass Effect 2). A handful of pennies, on a platform, however, where free is - unfortunately - now the norm and where paying out 89 cents for some is already a considerable effort. If you fall into this category, and if you think that two euros are ~too much~ for a smartphone game, you should probably ignore Threes! You simply don't deserve it. But while you observe with satisfaction that bimetallic coin that you have kept in your finances, know that elsewhere there are those who are enjoying what is by far one of the best puzzle games of recent years. Matter of choices... Threes! is an extraordinary puzzle game that will keep you glued to the screen Three at a time Threes! embodies the perfect formula of the successful puzzle game: extraordinary immediacy in understanding the mechanics but exceptional depth of the same, in such a way as to guarantee a constant stimulus to the player and push him to put one game after another. Everything takes place within a 4x4 square grid, which is initially populated by 9 tiles. The basic rule is very simple: those with numbers 1 and 2 (blue and red) can be joined to generate one with the number 3, while all the others must be strictly coupled to the same ones, so as to create one with their sum above. Two 3s give a 6, two 6s give a 12, two 12s give a 24 and... well, we understood each other. To move the tiles and join them together, just swipe your finger across the screen in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right): however, this action does not move a single tile, but all those present on the grid together. The aim of the game is to resist as long as possible by going on pairings, thus generating tiles with the highest possible figures until the inevitable and dramatic moment of game over. This is bound to happen because, with each move, a new tile appears on the grid potentially capable of messing up your plans based on sums, perhaps positioning itself right ~there~ where it is most annoying. Even in the management of this factor, however, gray matter can be brought into play, and this thanks to the fact that the arriving card is in some way anticipated by a special indicator: blue or red for 1s and 2s, white for 3s, and white with a + symbol for those greater than 3. Furthermore, it is also possible to ~decide~ on which side the new tile will have to enter the field, which will be the one opposite to the movement of the group. Once the game is over, your efforts will be transformed into a final score, as high as the tiles you have managed to create will be high. Support for the Game Center obviously allows you to compare scores with those of friends or other players around the world. Is everything clear then? Probably not, but if you have any faith in us you should really try the Sirvo LLC game: the accessibility of the basic rules is such that you can understand how Threes works! in a matter of minutes, but the strategic component, the necessary planning of the moves and the satisfaction in the face of a well-done game are those of only top-level puzzle games. Love between tiles The game mechanic is clearly the key element, the stroke of genius that makes Threes! so extraordinary. Yet Sirvo LLC's work denotes a quality and cohesion of all the other elements that suggests the marvelous creative vein that has propelled the entire project. Aesthetically, Threes! it's beautiful: clean, minimalistic but nevertheless anything but simply ~functional~. There's character, there's art, there's inspiration. A handful of colors are enough to show everything you need very clearly, without unnecessary frills. To add a bit of personality to the otherwise excessive rigor and coldness of a number-based puzzle game, Greg Wohlwend has chosen to give each tile eyes and a mouth, through which they interact with each other or with the player, perhaps to invite him to hurry in the face of waiting too long for a move. A characterization that increases and expands with the tiles with the highest numbers, which become real characters even to be ~presented~ at the first meeting with the user. The audio is also pleasant, however more for the effects (mainly composed of the verses of the tiles) than for the music, a bit superfluous and which lacks the variety necessary to rather not push for its deactivation.", "date": "2014-03-03", "grade": "9.2"}
