We can imagine how it went: Mario and his companions, with Nintendo's pragmatic wisdom, must have tried in every way to make Sonic think, explaining that the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the Sega icon he must not have wanted to know, eager to unleash all his explosive speed on the slopes, perhaps also carrying forward the theory that it is better to reopen everything immediately and rely on herd immunity. The fact is that Mario and the others have decided to stay in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Sonic and all his characters have staged a sort of Olympics in their own way in this new chapter that takes up the official license of this year's Games. although at this point it seems to refer to some kind of alternate reality. Seriously, it is a production in continuity with that of Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games, which on mobile platforms was already focused only on Sonic, evidently because the partnership with Nintendo that made the series of games famous on console. There is the usual chaos created by Robotnik and various henchmen, but in this case the plot makes even less sense than in the standard Sonic games, however the particular expedient of the time jumps that in Mario triggered the interesting experience of the games has been eliminated with classic 2D graphics. In this case we are instead faced with the typical collection of sports-inspired mini-games, largely taken from those present in the console version and adapted to work on touch screens, usually through a considerable simplification of the commands to be used with a single finger and short taps on the screen. First of all, one aspect needs to be clarified: Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games can be downloaded for free but it is not a real free-to-play, but rather a ~free-to-start~, in any case a sort of demo that still requires the purchase to make all the contents available. After a handful of levels, which give you the opportunity to try three or four disciplines with their variations, the game opens up further with the start of the story, the introduction of new areas and various other mini-games but you need to pay to access them . The solution is not negative at all, given that we know what the classic implications of free-to-play are, but an introduction of this type can take mobile users accustomed to not spending by surprise. Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, rightly so, has its own price instead and the problem is that it's not even particularly low: a total of about 10 euros are needed to unlock all the contents, although you already have a complete experience by unlocking the different areas for 5.49 euros on Android and 8.99 euros on iOS. The problem is that the current prices are on promotion, so spending will probably become even higher in the next period. Multidisciplinary arcade sportsman Considering the contents hidden behind the paywall, which effectively make the purchase of the game necessary as it is essentially the majority of the game, there is indeed a great abundance of mini-games within Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which make it only partially a small reduction of the console version. The elimination of the entire ~story~ component, with the nice reinterpretation in 8-bit style, is perhaps the greatest lack because for the rest we find a quantity of disciplines that is certainly comparable to that seen on consoles, with lots of new unpublished introductions and respective variations on the theme with arcade inclinations. Moving around the map of Tokyo they can take part in the various disciplines taken from the catalog of Olympic sports: there are various types of running, sport climbing, target shooting, martial arts, diving, cycling, the The total list of mini-games is very large and the evaluation of each of these is not easy, as they are all short fragments of gameplay that last even less than a minute and usually require very simple and intuitive actions. However, the assortment is remarkable and every single discipline seems perfectly designed to fit in the mobile context, making Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in a certain sense a particularly successful title in this area, in some respects more than in its console version. The latter tends to be above all a party game focused on face-to-face multiplayer, while the game is in the mobile versionfinds its ideal form in terms of gameplay, for the simplicity of the controls and the speed of execution of the games. Furthermore, it manages to exploit the intrinsically ~social~ and connected character of smartphones by proposing a continuous challenge with the world, through constantly updated global rankings as well as direct comparisons with friends. Difficult to find moments in which the game really shines in terms of gameplay, because every single micro-experience is really very light, but the speed of access to these, the amount of disciplines as well as the care with which they have been created makes the fact very pleasant to constantly switch from one to the other. Constant progression also allows you to continuously conquer various rewards, which stimulate the personalization of your user profile with medals, titles, badges and even the unlocking of special skills. The more arcadey digressions applied to sports, which emerge in the ~EX~ versions of the various disciplines, contain some rather imaginative additional elements (enemies to be defeated or bonuses to be seized on the fly) and allow the use of special abilities that integrate with the gameplay forming slightly different experiences but which further expand the audience of mini-games available. Also from a technical point of view, in terms of graphics and audio accompaniment, Sega has carried out a sort of porting that is very similar to Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020. Obviously everything is on a reduced and simplified scale and as we said the more ~artistic~ component provided by the 8-bit style reinterpretations is missing, but the 3D representation of sports, with their spectacular settings and well-characterized characters, makes really a great effect on smartphone screens.", "date": "2020-05-12", "grade": "7.0"}
