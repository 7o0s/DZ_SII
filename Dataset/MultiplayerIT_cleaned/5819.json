After garnering great acclaim at its debut on iOS, Android and Windows Phone with over 30 million downloads - exceptional numbers for a premium game sold for almost 4 and produced by an unknown team - with the Game of The Year Edition it subsequently reached all the Sony home platforms together with Xbox One, Wii U and PC, making themselves appreciated even by those who really can't stand mobile gaming. The development of a sequel was therefore rather predictable, yet the Finns of Frogmind managed to keep it secret practically until the market launch, which took place in mid-December with an exclusive timeline for Apple devices. Badland 2 is a substantial improvement on the first chapter, and therefore a splendid mobile title One hero is not enough Badland 2 does not try to revolutionize the original experience, a very silly hypothesis given the precious balance game and the intelligent management of the ingredients that allowed the first episode to impose itself on the enormous offer of the mobile market. However, it would be ungenerous and fundamentally incorrect to accuse the developers of having chosen the comfortable and safe path of ~more of the same~, because on the contrary Badland 2 is undoubtedly a richer and thicker title, which convincingly develops the foundations in the past. The main reason is to be found in the ability of the protagonist, once again the bizarre and clumsy winged creature Clony together with his expendable clones, to flutter not only in one direction, but also in the opposite one and in a straight line upwards: everything this by simply touching the right side of the screen, the left side or both at the same time respectively. New skills that are intertwined with a more complex level design, now capable not only of developing from one side to the other but on the contrary also in all other directions. A chance certainly not overlooked by the Finnish team, on the contrary: right from the start in Badland 2 we notice the effort to create articulated situations between climbs, descents and unexpected developments, within more organic areas that offer a greater sense of progression and a great variety overall. At the same time, the developers have tried to expand the variety of environmental puzzles by offering a significantly higher number of different situations: although also in this case the level of difficulty is calibrated downwards mainly thanks to the generosity of the checkpoints, one finds oneself wanting to continue in the adventure simply driven by curiosity to find out what you will find in the next area. In general however, despite an enriched gameplay formula, Badland 2 is played exactly like the previous one: the aim is therefore to reach the exit avoiding traps and dangers, acting on switches and mechanisms and bringing with you as many of Clones possible, all this trying to avoid being reached by the forced scrolling of the levels. Once again, the modifiers are a fundamental element, i.e. objects to be collected and which can increase or decrease the size of the protagonist, accelerate or reduce his speed, slow down time and so on. Beautiful and dance One could possibly criticize the overall longevity of the main adventure, destined to engage for no more than a handful of hours, but it would mean having no memory of what Frogmind did with the first episode, which he enjoyed during his life of almost thirty free updates that brought with them new levels and features, such as the editor. The intention on the part of the developers is to repeat the same path, thus guaranteeing maximum value for the purchase price. In any case, while waiting for additional content, one can console oneself with the online mode which guarantees a series of ~expiring~ challenges (usually a handful of hours each) which are continuously renewed, and within which one must try to get the best score to compete within a global leaderboard. Badland was able to be appreciated also for the technical component, starting with a stylistic key evidently inspired by the silhouettes and the predominance of black of Limbo but enriched by the use of color for the evocative and splendid hand-drawn backdrops. As in the first chapter, also in this sequel each of the four sets of levels is characterized by a different chromatic key, which helps to offer a certain variety and to accentuate the dark and evocative atmosphere of the mondo designed by Finnish artists. There aren't huge differences or improvements compared to the first chapter, but despite this Badland 2 remains one of the most elegant and well-characterized games on mobile platforms. The greater dynamism of the camera, which does not disdain zoom in and zoom out during progression, then manages to give the player a better knowledge of these desolate lands dotted with deadly traps at every corner. However, stopping at the graphics would be a shame, because the sound aspect of the Frogmind title is equally worthy of attention, with a thickness and a quantity of elements and sensational nuances not only for the sphere of smartphones and tablets. Not using headphones would be a great sin.", "date": "2015-12-18", "grade": "9.2"}
