We enrich the compound with fluid and captivating graphics, the typical presence of bullet time and give the product a good sprinkling with a soundtrack that would come in handy to stir up even the most incurable of living room sloths. Just the time to put the download on Steam in the oven and voil: The Hong Kong Massacre is served. Unveiled for the first time at Paris Games Week 2017, this new highly over the top top down shooter is made by VRESKI, a young independent Swedish studio formed by just two people. The result was an interesting title, which tries to amalgamate a typically 80s/90s imagery with a frenetic and challenging interaction, where the only thing that matters is being able to eliminate any opponent with bullets, somersaults and executions performed with style. After playing it in full we are ready to tell you what we think in our review. Hardboiled setting: when bullet time saves your life The Hong Kong Massacre has the merit of being a game that gets straight to the point. You can already guess from the title that many pleasantries won't be needed to make your way in the manner of good old Cho Yun-Fat in the role of Sergeant Tequila. The reference is obviously to the film Hard Boiled (1992) by John Woo, but someone will certainly also remember Stranglehold, the 2007 action game directly inspired by the Chinese director's film. In short, it is no coincidence that the slaughter represented in The Hong Kong Massacre takes place in 1992 in one of the best known and most iconic cities in the Eastern world. Starting from these bases, the user is put in the role of a former police officer intent on taking revenge for the brutal murder of his partner. It doesn't matter if it will literally be necessary to turn the city upside down and mangle an entire army of henchmen until those who pull the strings of the local organized crime are tracked down. As it was easy to imagine, the narrative premises are nothing more than a mere pretext useful for framing the gameplay, therefore the fact that the texts are available exclusively in English is relevant up to a certain point. In The Hong Kong Massacre you don't need to talk, you need to act: possibly with the help of a nice cartridge belt. Observing it in action, it seems to be in front of a sort of Hotline Miami on steroids, and actually the first impression you get, once you hold the pad in your hands, is more or less this. There's a top-down view, there's also a multitude of levels that need to be cleared from top to bottom, but it's enough to be hit by a single bullet to see the game over screen appear. To all this are added the already vaunted time slowdown mechanics, combined with the stunts that can be ringed to suddenly exit the covers and torpedo the unfortunate person on duty. Considering the reference landscape, stealth mechanics have not been introduced in The Hong Kong Massacre. Killing without being discovered is not exactly expected and moreover, contrary to what happened in Hotline Miami, the enemies turn out to be decidedly more wait-and-see. Instead of rushing in search of the player in an attempt to flush him out, thanks to their numerical superiority, the minions tend to remain barricaded for the most part, so it is up to the player to find the most strategically effective path to knock them out one at a time. Only in the final part of the campaign do more aggressive enemies begin to appear, which among other things you will have to shoot twice before seeing them collapse to the ground lifeless. The latter are essentially the only ones to have a slightly more unpredictable behavior and to move from room to room with a little more ease to try to identify their target. By becoming familiar with the stunts and bullet time management everything becomes more accessible, even if on more than one occasion you will have your work cut out to bring home the skin. Overall, the level of challenge offered by the game is well balanced, discreet but not overly frustrating. On the other hand, the real challenge proposed by The Hong Kong Massacre lies in completing the secondary objectives linked to each level. The more extreme players can then try to complete the stages by unlocking three extra challenges which consist of clearing the area within a time limit, never resorting to bullet time and never sending a blank shot. Doing so gets you upto a maximum of three stars as a bonus rating for each of the thirty-five scenarios into which the campaign is divided. Levels, weapon upgrades and bosses As far as level design is concerned, the tactical component remains the central factor of the gaming experience. In each stage it is in fact possible to move without having to respect a pre-established order and also being able to choose different paths to achieve the goal painlessly. For example, deciding to break some windows to make their way into another area of the scenario, take a position behind a door and suddenly break in or start riddle it until it literally crumbles, together with unfortunate people who were wandering around . Some stages are more similar than others, but overall each new challenge flows away as it should, alternating areas developed entirely inside buildings with others positioned on roofs, terraces and internal courtyards. More could certainly have been done on the variety of firearms: the player has access to four categories, consisting of pistol, uzi, shotgun and assault rifle, but it is allowed to unlock models with slightly different characteristics in terms of rate of fire, reload speed and so on. Nonetheless, the selectable tools can be upgraded by investing the points forfeited at the end of each assignment. Contrary to what happened in Hotline Miami, in this case the introduction of edged weapons or other melee tools with which to knock out the enemy from close range was not envisaged. By accessing the online leaderboards, you have the opportunity to consult the best times achieved by the rest of the community and try to gradually improve your performance. In this sense The Hong Kong Massacre offers a fair longevity, logically also taking into account the rather limited expense that must be faced to grab it. Once you have acquired the necessary familiarity with each level, especially in relation to the positioning of the enemies, getting into action again means taking the matter to completely new ground. However, it must be said that VRESKI should have carried out a more substantial work on the boss battles, which instead turn out to be all identical and too limited in terms of structure and relative simplicity compared to traditional stages.", "date": "2019-01-28", "grade": "7.8"}
