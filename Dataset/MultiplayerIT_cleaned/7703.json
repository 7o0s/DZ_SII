Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We tried Overkill 2 several weeks ago, but on the first try (interesting pun) the shooter developed by Craneballs didn't impress us. Some problems of youth (see the various crashes) and an insufficiently articulated structure had made us prefer other titles to be treated in this weekly column. But then the updates arrived and, having reached version 1.2, the game has gained quite a bit of charm in our eyes. The reason is obvious: it is a real festival of firearms, automatic or not, which we can not only buy using virtual currency (and, of course, the real one, like a good freemium), but also admire through a 3D visual that makes us understand how much care and effort went into the creation of every single pistol, machine gun and rifle present. The count of weapons available in Overkill 2 reaches thirty units and it is clear that we will not have the opportunity to experience everything if we do not intend to put our hands on the wallet, but there are many elements of interest to enrich the gameplay and it would have been a shame not to talk about them in this seat. So let's start from the basic concept: we are dealing with a shooter with a lightgun, but the lightgun obviously isn't there. The scenario is static and opponents appear from various angles who take their places and unload their bullets at us until we manage to take them out, perhaps hitting a headshot despite a routine that simulates the imprecision of the viewfinder and which makes the setup much less trivial sign of a precision hit. It also makes things frustrating sometimes, but that's another story. The control system revolves exclusively around the touch screen: with the left thumb we can move the weapon on the screen (literally, and in reality the visual effect is not very beautiful), with the right one we can press the fire button, on the refill and on any medkit, to be used when our vital energy is running out. Overkill 2 is a gun and bullet feast, a repetitive core experience but with a nice twist Take these coins The action proposed by Overkill 2 is quite repetitive, being a static shooter. Depending on the type of mission, we can have to defend ourselves from a wave of enemies or try to survive as long as possible, or even aim to beat the score of a human opponent. As our experience level rises, we will be able to move into new scenarios and witness the introduction of new and more cunning opponents, equipped with armor or skilled in throwing grenades. In short, things will gradually become more difficult and we will have to use the money earned in the best possible way, changing weapons and possibly buying special items (stun grenades, disruptive grenades, air attacks, etc.) or taking care of our character's skills thanks to the acquiring armor that increases its resistance and/or accuracy. This part of the experience was rendered very well by the developers, who took particular care of the outline and provided respectable numbers in support of a gameplay that in the end is limited to a matter of power and speed, rather than accuracy (due to the aim corrector we mentioned earlier). The technical sector is also very accurate, especially the graphics, thanks to an excellent level of detail, convincing explosions, an accurate reproduction of the various weapons and a great variety of opponents. We still don't like the way our machine gun moves around the screen, but it's a gameplay-related choice, so there probably wasn't a viable alternative. The sound, on the other hand, is a bit anonymous, despite some well-made sequences spoken in English.", "date": "2013-07-27", "grade": "7.6"}
