{"name": "Impossible Mission - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/impossible-mission-recensione.html", "text": "Impossible Mission - Review Impossible Mission was one of the first killer applications in the history of video games, and especially of the Commodore 64. In other words, at the time of its appearance it was considered the same as a Metal Gear or a current Resident Evil. Thanks to a gameplay that skilfully mixed action (therefore a certain skill with the Joystick on the part of the player), strategy and puzzle game elements, the Epyx Games title immediately proved to be a challenging and long-lasting game like never before that moment in a home entertainment system. After 20 years or more, the revived System 3, which the older ones among you will remember for being the authors of that masterpiece that was Myth, presents Impossible Mission again in this remake for PSP and DS. In the game, the gamer plays the role of a secret agent infiltrated in a gigantic bunker, that of the mad scientist Elvin Atombender, who threatens a nuclear attack against the main cities of the planet. The player's task is to stop the main computer that scans the countdown of the launch of the missiles before it's too late, recovering the access code to it, and intervening. The password is found broken into a ~puzzle~ of pieces hidden in some of the rooms of the building. And that is easier said than done. The bunker is, as mentioned above, quite large to explore, and is guarded by dozens of violent and bloodthirsty robots. Not to mention that some areas are accessible only after a millimeter jump or acrobatic actions that are not always immediately executable. Remake? Let's say immediately, in order to clear the field of possible doubts, that this IM should not be defined as a real remake, in the sense that it is the most faithful transposition of the homonymous title for C64, with all the merits and defects of the case. In fact, the only differences between the two versions are inherent in the visual aspect, as we will see later. Every element, from the single room to the ~patterns~ according to which the sentinels move, have remained as they were in the original. Consequently, the gameplay is also the classic one, in some ways similar to the first Prince of Persia. Each screen usually represents a block containing some of the dozens of rooms into which the mad scientist's building is divided, with several platforms arranged in several levels and connected to each other by small elevators or separated by overhangs. Therefore, to move from one room to the next, it is also advisable to use precise jumps from one level to another, being careful not to be seen by the supervisors. Sorry for a bad ending. In fact, our agent is not equipped with any weapon and therefore it is easy, if discovered, that he can fall helpless into the jaws of the robots. Studying their behavior, checking their position or evaluating the appropriate moment in which to make a jump or get on an elevator after solving some puzzles, are the key elements of the Impossible Mission gameplay. The only extra action possible through our 007 is to manipulate the terminals of the central computer to deactivate the surveillance functions for a few moments or to modify the position of certain elevators. Too faithful transposition But where then is Impossible Mission different from the original? Apart from the three (alleged) game modes (classic, new and mixed) which are practically identical, all the developers' work has focused on the visual restyling of the game: and that is the only substantial difference between the two versions. There are three selectable characters, a man, a woman with a ~Matrixian~ look and a robot, and they effectively take the place of the little man in overalls from the past. Apart from the physical aspect, moreover made for each one in a not excellent way, as well as the animations, there is no difference between them in terms of characteristics, parameters in general and the selection of one rather than the other has no influence on the gameplay of the missions. Furthermore, their history is unknown, there is no screenshot, video or anything else that explains who these three agents are. In fact, then the contour elements of the adventure are reduced to two measly films and new menus and artwork. The settings are colorful, nice, but nothing special here either, they seem to be taken from a SuperNes title. The sound, just to stay on the ~old style~ theme, is limited to a tune that constantly accompanies the player throughout the adventure, with some background noise that takes up those of the elevator or other gadgets, or even the voice of the doctor Atombender. Oh well, we wanted to keep the spirit of the game unchanged, but here it has remained practically unchangedbody all Conclusions Impossible Mission is nothing else, as mentioned in the article, than the old Epyx game for Commodore 64, revised (graphically) and corrected (not so much) for Sony and Nintendo portable consoles. The result is obviously a decidedly atypical product, on which it becomes in some ways difficult to judge: on the one hand, despite its simplicity, the very ~similarity~ with the original, still a very entertaining game, makes the title System 3 is a nice, playable product, suitable for a portable console and for those who want to play a few quick games between a bus or train trip, for example. On the other hand, at the same time, it severely limits its appeal, both for that feeling of ~already seen~ that pervades the ~older~ player, and for a practically reduced longevity and dated gameplay. Especially if you consider that for the same price it is possible to buy entire retrogaming collections for all tastes. Pros: Overall fun. Interesting for those who don't have much time to play. Cons: Dated gameplay. Very low longevity. Level design not always inspired. For nostalgic.", "date": "2007-06-21", "grade": null}
