With the ingredients for sure they have a lot of fun. Whether it was born after a fun night or thanks to a simple stroke of genius, the concept behind Squids Odyssey is a fruit salad of flavors that we would never, ever have dreamed of tasting together: billiards, rpg and action bottled in sea water. The amazing thing is not so much the idea, but the fact that it works well. Very good. A bit of history before delving into the examination of the game itself: Squids Odyssey has arrived exclusively on Nintendo consoles, but it wasn't born there. Before having the honor of landing on specifically gaming platforms, Squids, as it was called at the time, enjoyed enormous success on smartphones. Soon the inevitable sequel would arrive, and now on Wii U (soon also Nintendo 3DS) it is enclosed together with the progenitor in a single edition, at a price almost tripled compared to the sum of the two originals. Given that we are talking about thirteen euros and not fifty, there have been various controversies regarding the amount to be paid: perhaps it would have been more correct to stop at ten euros, but the surcharge is by no means unjustified. Because seeing Squids Odyssey on a big screen is quite another thing, because it can also be played only on the gamepad, because there are more levels, new objects and characters, and above all because the control system has been streamlined and expanded, contemplating the use of both the stylus and the analog stick. Contrary to mobile then, as expected, there are no extra contents to be purchased separately. Also, fresh and unexpected news, by buying it on Nintendo 3DS you can get the Wii U copy for free, as long as you have the unified Nintendo Network ID; it is not yet clear whether the opposite path is also foreseen, i.e. free download for Nintendo 3DS by purchasing it on Wii U, but it would seem not - mysteries of online shops. Well, now let's deal with squid. It is impossible that you are looking for Squids, because there is no other game like it. Try it! Hole! At the risk of seeming incapable, to quickly understand the mechanics of Squids Odyssey we advise you to watch the video that you find nearby. Because, really, it's much easier. For those who still want to rely on our words, we try to illustrate the concept in the best possible way: the action takes place with a shot from above, on areas ranging from a single platform to various areas connected to each other, however never huge size. Within these stages there are (depending on the type of mission) from a minimum of one to a maximum of four squids: your platoon, basically. The objective also varies, mostly it is a question of reaching a certain area of the level, alternatively it includes the killing of a particular enemy or the survival of at least one member of the team for a certain number of rounds. Each chapter then has various secondary goals, such as collecting a secret star or reaching the end without losing a single companion, all to the advantage of replayability (and you will be encouraged to improve, rest assured). But how does all this have to do with billiards? Well, in short, you don't have direct control of the squid: they have to be thrown. Perhaps a better example would be that of the slingshot, the fact remains that you will have to grab your alter ego (via control stick or stylus, the latter is perhaps more intuitive, but both work well), and pull it with more or less force in one direction or the other one. Simple and fun. And this procedure applies both to move and to attack: the stronger you impact against an enemy, the more damage you inflict. And gradually more and more tricks are learned, such as the possibility of leaning against a wall, possibly even by crushing against an evil crab, so as to inflict double damage on it. We mentioned the turns before, and in fact the action evolves in this way, segmented: in the exploration phase you go from squid to squid, each with a different number of launches based on your potential. The sequence is predictably interspersed during the fights by the moves of the enemies. Mixed fry But turn-based scanning isn't the only link between Squids Odyssey and the world of RPGs. First of all, remaining within the real action, both your squid and the enemies have an energy bar that is scaled with each contact with the opponent. Furthermore, the characters must be constantly updated, buying objects through the collected pearlsin stages, or even by trading them for level advancement, an eventuality which, as usual, involves a global improvement in statistics. In this field, the designers have fallen into a slight naivety, and that is the bundle of improvements of the various objects: even if you have equipped only one single example, once you have obtained the advantages of a (for example) hat, these do not disappear when you replace it with a new one, but they add up. Which makes the selection process a bit artificial. The squids, at the end of the adventure about thirty, are divided into four categories: the explorers, who can count on a further acceleration after the initial launch, the gunslingers, able to shoot at a short distance from the enemies, the fighters, resistant as well as capable of hitting multiple opponents at the same time, and finally the healers, useful for healing companions in the event of contact (the same mechanic that allows you to damage enemies, reversed here). But above all, and in this aspect the spirit of Squids Odyssey is inextricably linked with the essence of RPGs, the squids are characterized brilliantly. In the gags and dialogues that introduce each mission, but also in the design and personality. This surprisingly rich universe allows you to connect contrasting elements in a homogeneous way: rather than thinking about the strange mix of billiards, sea depths and Final Fantasy, while playing you are concentrated on not letting dear old Sammo die, obsessed with food and always ready to take a beating for others. And it's just one example, because even the graphic work is commendable, including the settings and animations: a grotesque but refined trait. Of course, there are flaws: the learning curve is too steep, the enemies are not varied enough and the equipment of the objects, as mentioned before, is a bit naive. While fun in the basic gears, the action in the long run - and there are lots of missions - gets a bit repetitive. But certainly none of these rusts compromise the quality of the work in its entirety.", "date": "2014-07-02", "grade": "8.0"}
