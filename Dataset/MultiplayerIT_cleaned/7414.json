In LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars, for example, pitched battles had been removed, and in LEGO The Lord of the Rings the free roaming component had disappeared. Now that next-generation consoles have also taken to the battlefield, we have frankly wondered what would happen with a port that must be operated both downwards and upwards. And so, after thoroughly playing the PlayStation 3 version of LEGO Marvel Heroes, we grabbed the DualShock 4 and went back to wandering around New York as Iron Man, Wolverine and co... We replayed LEGO Marvel Super Heroes on next gen consoles: it's the reference version Playstation 4 trophies To win the thirty-eight bronze, four silver and three gold trophies offered by LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, players will have to - among other things - complete the various levels, find all the characters and all the hidden objects and collect bricks galore. Only then will the platinum trophy unlock. In previous episodes... We talked a lot about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes in our review of the PlayStation 3 version, which we suggest you read if you want to know the life, death and miracles of this umpteenth parody by TT Games. In fact, calling it a parody isn't exactly accurate, because despite the prevailing humor TT Games this time has offered a completely new story, written specifically for the game. In short, Doctor Doom and his evil allies want to get their hands on the mythical Cosmic Bricks, and only an alliance of super heroes can stop their sinister plans. Obviously comedy is always around the corner thanks to funny cinematics entirely dubbed in English and subtitled in Italian that tell us the unfolding of the story, highlighting the absurd interactions between the many super heroes and super villains of the Marvel universe, from 'Spider-Man to Mister Fantastic through the X-Men, the Avengers and so on. In fact, it is possible to unlock up to over one hundred characters, each with special powers that allow you to solve the many puzzles scattered throughout the fifteen levels of play. Initially we will only be able to control specific characters, but gradually we will begin to unlock more and more so that we can replay the missions already completed and access previously unreachable areas and collectibles. Between one mission and another, the free roaming component takes over with which TT Games is really starting to get the hang of it, and which in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is represented by a miniature version of New York. Between streets and buildings we will come across optional puzzles and missions which, once solved, will unlock bonuses and even more characters, expanding our possibilities and our collection of ~minifigs~. In short, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the summation of the best features proposed in the latest editions of the franchise, and as such it carries with it a baggage of historical strengths and weaknesses: it is chock full of things to do, long-lived, fun to play alone and in company, as well as a real ocean of more or less refined quotes that will delight fans. On the other hand, it is still a LEGO game, and therefore it is rather simple and at times a bit repetitive, plagued by an approximate combat system, some unfortunate bugs and puzzles that are not always particularly intuitive. In short, if you are a fan of the series, you already know what to expect. Yes, but the next gen version? During our test of the PlayStation 3 version we were pleasantly impressed by the care taken in the creation of the various levels and above all by a New York that mimics the freely explorable cities of the various Grand Theft Autos, of considerable size and full of details , passable even in flight to the control of the characters able to hover in the air. However, we had also encountered some quite annoying technical problems, especially as regards a frame rate that was anything but stable and which on more than one occasion had made us turn up our noses, especially when we wandered around the Big Apple or faced some particularly bad bosses. chaotic. The PlayStation 4 version, fortunately, does not suffer from these problems and the granite frame rate offers a much more fluid and satisfying experience, furthermore assisted bya widening of the visual distance that makes exploring New York even more enjoyable. The same goes for the 1080p resolution which guarantees better quality images, embellished with some additional particle effects and cleaner textures. A very slight aliasing persists, but nothing that makes a cry of scandal. It should also be remembered that LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is, well, an ~old generation~ game based on combinations of bricks, so you will hardly impress your friends from a graphic point of view if you insert it in the console instead of Killzone: Shadow Fall, and from this point of view the increased price can be a bit indigestible. However, compared to the Xbox One version, the PlayStation 4 version can play the trump card of remote play via PlayStation Vita. We said that the ~secondary~ portings have so far been mistreated even in the case of PlayStation Vita, perfectly capable of reproducing the PlayStation 3 gameplay but condemned to the lazy transposition of the incomplete editions for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii. The PlayStation 4 remote play system puts an end to this tragedy by allowing us to play LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, in its entirety, on the Sony laptop: of course, you won't be able to do it in the car or on the subway, but continuing to collect bricks even in the bathroom has no price, especially if the handheld controls lend themselves to the experience perfectly and flawlessly.", "date": "2013-12-10", "grade": "8.9"}
