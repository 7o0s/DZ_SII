{"name": "Il verme definitivo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123838-worms-clan-wars-il-verme-definitivo.html", "text": "The appointment with the worms of Team 17 is now practically annual: think that they have been raging on all the screens since 1995 and their fans are never satisfied. They went from 2D to 3D to 2D again, went online, went portable, and took over Facebook. Worms everywhere, in all sauces (and sorry if you've just eaten) and for all tastes. Worms Revolution, the last edition dating back to last year, had disappointed us a bit, because it had nothing of Revolution at all, and even if the gameplay is fine as it is, it doesn't make much sense to talk about revolution when it's new it's very little, apart from a little more physics and some rounding. So here is that Team 17 has taken a step back, choosing a less high-sounding title but certainly more honest and forthright. Clan wars, then... but which clans? Worms all! This new version of Worms offers a slightly more interesting single player experience than usual, divided between the story mode and Worms Ops. Contrary to what happened in the past, this time it is the Worms Ops that resembles a real tutorial, and not the story mode: they are themed missions that become increasingly intricate and force the player to adopt very particular tactics to reach the various goals. The Worms Ops essentially offer a basic smattering on the use of the many weapons available, old and new, and on the most appropriate and imaginative way to combine them to get around the limits imposed by the scenario or reach unthinkable positions or targets. All experience, in short, which could prove useful in different circumstances and which will certainly serve the more experienced players as an excellent refresher and for new users as a real training ground. The story mode, on the other hand, offers twenty-five missions linked by a common thread that defining abstruse may seem like an understatement: we are talking about Stone Carrots and mind control, Cement Donkeys and worms intent on conquering the world. In this case, the ~bad guy~ of the moment is called Crowley-Mesmer, and if Mark Sheppard had been dubbing we would have jumped for joy, just to stay on the subject of Crowley, and instead we have to ~settle~ for Katherine Parkinson, the very good Jen Barber of IT Crowd (TV series that, apparently, the boys of Team 17 adore, given that also in Worms Revolution it was another actor of the serial, Matt Berry, who acted as narrator). Parkinson gives the voice to Tara Tinkle, a bizarre archaeologist who mimics Lara Croft and updates us on the continuation of the plot, commenting on everything that happens with great humor and a sparkling English accent that does not regret the absence of dubbing in Italian. What then, in short, the plot is very stupid and what matters are the missions of increasing difficulty, perhaps even too increasing: the impression is that of a not exactly very well calibrated difficulty curve, based on an artificial intelligence of the opponents a bit ' up-and-down and likely to test the nerves of even the most capable veterans. Compared to what human opponents could come up with, however, it's child's play. The new appointment with Worms is probably the best in recent years from every point of view Of old and new worms On the raw gameplay front, the improvements made are few, but absolutely significant. In addition to the new weapons, which we leave you with the pleasure of discovering for yourself, the guys from Team 17 have taken the trouble to review the concept of ~classes~ introduced by Worms Revolution: Brutes, Scientists, Explorers and Soldiers are therefore back, each category characterized by different parameters and movement capabilities, as well as peculiar abilities such as the ~area healing~ of the scientists, suitably revised and corrected for the occasion. Worm tier also affects weapons and wargear, with heavy Brutes making jetpacks use more fuel than usual and parachutes harder to control when plummeting with a flimsy Ranger, etc., and also affects physics, which for the occasion it was slightly rebalanced especially as regards the behavior of liquids (another novelty introduced by the previous Revolution) which in particular seemed much more convincing to us. Everything is framed by the usual, delightful two-dimensional graphics, embellished by an unprecedented care for the backdrops: the latter not only offer various levels of parallax and therefore a nice depth effect, but also lots of animations and a pleasant day/night cycle which makes long battles downright spectacular. The real novelty of Worms Clan Wars, comuTherefore, it is undoubtedly the renewed multiplayer mode: behind a series of menus that are a bit too confused and fragmented, there is not only the usual option to challenge friends online, but also the unprecedented possibility of founding a real clan that act as a meeting point and competitive base. Players will therefore be able to challenge other clans, customize their own and organize real feuds thanks to which they can climb the world leaderboards. It is still too early to tell if Team 17's experiment in this sense will be successful, and only time will tell if the community has welcomed this new feature, which in any case represents a significant added value. Steam Workshop closes the circle: thanks to the tool made available by the developers, the platform will allow players to share their creations with other users, proposing maps, weapons and personalized games and, consequently, increasing the longevity of the experience.", "date": "2013-10-04", "grade": "8.5"}
