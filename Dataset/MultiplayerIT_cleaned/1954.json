{"name": "I Tre Regni: La Battaglia di Red Cliffs", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-tre-regni-la-battaglia-di-red-cliffs.html", "text": "The three kingdoms The game tells the story of one of the most epic battles in Chinese history and exactly the one known as the Red Cliffs, which took place in the third century after Christ and which sanctioned the division of the Chinese Empire into three kingdoms. The complete manual attached to the game (in Italian), tells us all the events that led to this famous battle and is a reading that I consider preparatory to better enjoy the game. On the other hand, the great historical accuracy lavished on the creation of this game is also one of its strengths. We only have to choose which side to be on and then impersonate one of the main characters between Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quam and then follow them on their path that leads them to the final battle. Like the previous Fate of The Dragon, The Battle of Red Cliffs is a clone of the successful Microsoft title, which, in fact, has created a real standard in games with a strong historical connotation like this one. It must be said that The Battle of Red Cliffs promises to be deeper and includes many innovations that make the game more complex, as usual what interests us to know and if these innovations are really such or if in the end they can be won games with the classic ~pile up a thousand armies and destroy~, in my opinion, the real big problem of strategic games which, apart from a few rare exceptions, all face and resolve each other in exactly the same way. Anyway no more talk, let's install the game and immediately enter the game to try the Single Player mode. A classic pattern, but well done The game features the now classic 2D graphics in isometric perspective, which reaches truly remarkable levels, of course it must be said that lately we had become accustomed to three-dimensional graphics, but if this is the result then we are happy that solutions are still being adopted like these. The game interface is simple and broadly follows those of other games, the thing that makes an impression are the two maps at the two lower corners of the screen, one represents the map of the city we are in, the other all the territory with the various cities. Considerable care has been taken in resource management, given that it is possible to collect seven different types of goods and their production is very specialized. For example, within a farm it is possible to produce grain, but also raw meat (to do this, the worker specialization must be set manually). The number of buildings is enormous and I avoid listing them all, but they are really many, just as the research upgrade system that the game allows us to deal with is complex, just know that all part of the manual is intended to list all the improvements that you can get with science. Natural disasters are also of particular importance, such as floods, droughts, earthquakes and other pleasant events, in this case we can also make sacrifices to request the protection of some God (which never hurts). We go out into the field The same treatment has been placed in the creation of the troops, which amaze for quantity and quality, perhaps they are even too many; moreover, the interaction with the surrounding environment is magnificent, for example our soldiers barricade themselves inside the towers or can get on and off their horses. Surprising are also the equipment, wagons, ships and kites (yes, yes, you read correctly!) which, in addition to being well made, allow us to prepare different strategies. But let's go back to the original question. Is the game tactical or not? Well it must be said that we can face the missions that are entrusted to us in various ways, and using different units, and therefore different tactics, but if we then want to face it all by attacking head on, we can do it (unfortunately). What disappointed me a bit is the brevity of the campaign mode which runs out in a short time, despite the fact that there are three stories to go through. Excellent, as expected, the multiplayer support that allows us to play good games via the Internet thanks to GameSpy. Lights and shadows In short, The Battle of Red Cliffs stands out for its uncommon historical accuracy, reference graphics and interface and for complete Multiplayer support, but it doesn't hit the mark due to a certain conceptual age. In any case, we must underline the excellent translation into Italian (excluding the spoken word which is in Mandarin) and the beautiful packaging with the beautiful book by Sun-tzu. The art of war He who scores a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the most skilful of all. Who doesn't even give battle, and subdues the opponent's troops, is the most skilled of all. This philosophical phrase makes a fine show ofif on the cover of the famous strategy book ~The Art of War~ by Sun-tzu, which we find as a gift inside the package of this umpteenth strategy titled The Three Kingdoms: The Battle of Red Cliffs and which introduces us to the epic era of Greater China of the third century AD In reality this game is not an absolute novelty, because it is nothing more than the new chapter of the successful Fate of The Dragon whose review can be consulted at this link.", "date": "2002-11-05", "grade": null}
