Since its debut back in 2008, LittleBigPlanet has made no secret of its motto ~play, create, share~ and the subsequent chapters, both portable and home, have cemented this philosophy by magnifying the possibilities of users and, at the same time, the structure of a game that started out as a simple platformer and has grown into something more over the years, as LittleBigPlanet 2 demonstrated three years ago. It is clear, then, that seeing this phenomenon in the hands of a company that may not have understood it has been concerning, especially in light of the major additions that could have made it better or ruined for good. We want to anticipate that Sumo Digital has not made us regret the MediaMolecule at all, but to understand why the best episode of the series has not bordered on the excellence of the previous one, you will have to read the whole review. LittleBigPlanet 3 is the best exponent of the series, but no longer as amazing as it once was A history of puppets Already in LittleBigPlanet 2 it was evident that MediaMolecule wanted to do something special with its platformer, transforming the ~campaign~ into something more than a simple showcase of the potential of the Create mode. And so, over time, LittleBigPlanet began to have a story that linked the levels designed for the player and his possible co-op friends: Sumo Digital has particularly pressed his hand on this element, devising an even more elaborate Adventure mode than the one played in the previous episodes. This time the world of Bunkum is in danger, a planet where imagination is slowly disappearing: the bizarre Newton will ask us for help and will involve us in the search for three legendary heroes who could help us save goat and cabbage, since in past they had already once defeated the titans that threatened Bunkum's creativity. The handful of stages that serve as the prologue to the game have a double function: on the one hand, it teaches us how to play as the Sackboy, if anything were needed, and on the other hand, it lays the foundations for the story when we discover that we have been deceived. We weren't helping Newton wake up the three legendary heroes to save Bunkum, we were freeing the titans to destroy him! This twist will be the incipit of a journey that will take us around the planet: each region makes a world of its own, in practice, and is represented doubly by a schematic map in the main hub and by a kind of mini- real explorable level, full of objects to collect and secrets to discover in pure ~metroidvania~ style. In addition to proposing the entrances to the various main levels, in fact, it often happens to come across characters who will entrust us with secondary missions, unlocking particularly complicated additional stages that we will have to overcome using the skills and any gadgets already obtained. Although they are actually a bit dispersive - which is why Sumo Digital has implemented a second schematic map and a list of waypoint missions - the hubs still represent a fun idea and an alternative way to prolong the experience, inviting us to revisit micro and macro levels after unlocking a new power-up or character. Because, as even the stones will know by now, this time we won't just control the Sackboy. Almost. The Three Heroes Since its announcement, LittleBigPlanet 3 has made a multimedia display of its new and most important feature, or the presence of three supporting characters to control instead of the Sackboy. It was a novelty presented with great pomp and on which Sumo Digital has pushed its hand a lot but, in the end, its weight on the gameplay is really small. In fact, the Sackboy will have to travel around Bunkum in search of the three legendary heroes: each world is stylistically different from the others, inspired by abstract concepts such as technology or nature, but in terms of gameplay, the various levels are almost all structured to the Sackboy. Strangely, in fact, the heroes only check towards the end of each world in specially dedicated levels that explain what their peculiarities and powers are, but then they disappear and the focus inevitably returns to the Sackboy and his gadgets. And it's a shame, because ilevels in which the skills of the three supporting actors are used are fresh and fun and represent the effective, albeit brief, evolution of the franchise. Oddsock, for example, is a stuffed dog that allows us to bounce and walk on walls in frenetic platforming sequences, while Toggle, which can change size depending on the circumstances, imposes a slightly more reasoned progression. Swoop, the last hero, seemed a little subdued to us, a bird whose power is precisely that of fluttering and carrying objects, and therefore not exactly very original. Which does not mean that the levels starring the Sackboy are of poor quality, on the contrary: not only did they appear much more sophisticated and ingenious than those played in previous iterations, thanks also to the slightly more precise control system and revised and corrected physics , but they very often imply the use of gadgets that are unlocked as you progress in the adventure, and some of these seemed really brilliant and well implemented in the general structure of the levels; this is the case of the gun that allows the Sackboy to teleport through some particular portals, for example, or of the vacuum cleaner which, while simply allowing you to blow or suck in the air, is used to solve some ingenious puzzles based on moving obstacles and platforms . That's not to say, however, that you don't feel a certain sense of inconclusiveness after unlocking a new hero and returning to play levels designed exclusively for the Sackboy, limiting the control and usefulness of Oddsock, Swoop and Toggle to zones extras previously unattainable in some stages or in the main hubs, unlike what has been proclaimed to the sound of trailers and slogans in recent months. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock the seventeen bronze trophies, eight silver, six gold and the legendary platinum you will have to complete the most varied objectives, and in this sense in LittleBigPlanet 3 you certainly won't get bored. In addition to having to complete the Adventure mode, of course, players will have to overcome the challenges of the Popit Academy, play multiplayer, create a level in Create mode, wear certain costumes and so on. Next generation problems The first impact with LittleBigPlanet 3 is not the most exciting, let's be honest: despite the higher resolution than in the past - and the PlayStation 3 version, which runs at 720p - LittleBigPlanet 3 looks like a very nice, adorable and very stylish LittleBigPlanet like many others. The Sackboy is the same as ever, with the same animations, the same textures, and the supporting characters (both the three playable heroes and the other characters) look like they have come out of any iteration of LittleBigPlanet. The differences, however, are tiny but they are there. They are mostly details, sensations and small changes that only the most sensitive or attentive players will notice, while others, especially the new generation, will take them for granted. We have already mentioned the improved control system that allows the Sackboy to make more precise jumps and movements and, consequently, Sumo Digital to offer more elaborate levels, and we have also talked about the physics, enhanced by those small adjustments that make the interaction with the obstacles in the stages more fulfilling than in the past. But there is something more in the stages of LittleBigPlanet 3, which are perhaps the plays of light and the care with which the colors reproduced have been chosen, or perhaps the songs of the 50s (Mr. Sandman and Pink Shoelaces in the same stage! ) or the complete absence of music, replaced by razor-sharp ambient sound effects. Then we meet the eccentric actor Marlon Random and we hear him speak and we don't immediately realize the novelty, but in LittleBigPlanet 3 every secondary character has been completely voiced both in the cinematic sequences and during the actual levels, a very welcome novelty which certainly makes the experience more engaging, even if the speech often clashes with the progression of the player, automatically interrupting itself with not exactly pleasant results if the point to which the playback of the track is associated is exceeded. LittleBigPlanet 3, as enchanting and imaginative as ever, is full of small bugs and glitches that counterbalance the effort put into creating scenarios and levels full of details and special effects, especially now that they are spread over more than three floors of parallax. Not infrequently we have seen polygons, textures and models disappear or reappear during some kinematics, and if this is frankly negligible, the same cannot be said of the sudden crashes that have closed the application, of the flights into the infinite abyss marked through pfloors that should be solid, checkpoints that didn't open and that forced us to repeat the same level over and over again because dying towards the end meant not being able to regenerate and staring at the screen dazed. At the time we are writing these lines, a patch has not yet been released that fixes these annoying bugs, and we would not be surprised to find out that on the day of its release, players will be forced to download gigs of data in order to play: in recent times it has It has almost become a trend that we feel strongly criticizing, whatever the reasons that drive companies to place products on the market that it seems impossible to us have passed quality control. Piece infinity Beyond the Adventure mode, LittleBigPlanet 3 obviously offers the much loved Create mode which practically defined the entire series and which in previous episodes was even more important than the campaign to be played in single or co-op. In this case it is not only the Adventure that practically acts as a tutorial, but also the brand new Popit Academy which, in fact, mainly serves two purposes: first, it teaches the rudiments of creation in the LittleBigPlanet universe, immediately teaching how to control the environment and 3D models freely, perhaps using the touch pad if you play in the PlayStation 4 version (which is not exactly very practical, at least initially, but optionally limited to the rotation and resizing of objects) and, secondly, the Academy represents a intelligent collection of puzzles in turn that starts quite slowly and gradually becomes more and more complicated, skillfully mixing the platform phases with the solution of the puzzles that block the way. In short, having completed the levels of the Popit Academy, you already have a good at least conceptual smattering as regards the Create mode: it is the same as LittleBigPlanet 2, to be clear, both in the interface and in the contents, to which various features are added , including the much-heralded sixteen planes of parallax and the ability to create gadgets at will. Only these two innovations should let the fans of LittleBigPlanet and its editor understand the immense potential of this chapter, especially to fans of LittleBigPlanet. Create mode is an ugly beast not to be underestimated, be warned, in which it is easy to get lost; to learn how to exploit it decently several hours of practice and a lot, a lot of patience are needed. The results, of course, can be proposed to the huge community which, to all intents and purposes, makes this third iteration practically infinite for those approaching the franchise for the first time: old players will discover that the title automatically imports data from previous LittleBigPlanet games , if owned, between DLC and various costumes, while the new ones will find themselves faced with the millions of custom levels that the community has proposed over the past six years, accessible from a complete, if a little unsettling, interface that categorizes them based on user ratings and other metrics.", "date": "2014-11-27", "grade": "8.0"}
