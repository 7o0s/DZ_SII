{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-2.html", "text": "Game Boy OPSAT By connecting GameCube and GBA, without any games, Sam will benefit from an extension of the functions of his OPSAT, the indispensable ~wrist palmtop~ where he collects all the data: first of all, he will have a radar available that will indicate the position of enemies, cameras and important objects, secondly he will be able to interact remotely with electronic instruments and turrets, perhaps programming them to kill enemies. Finally, he will be able to disarm and use wall mines against opponents. Fun, but it affects the gameplay by making some phases simpler than designed: playing you will realize, for example, that the turrets are obstacles that should not be underestimated and overcoming them alone gives a lot of satisfaction. Darkness is your best friend The first Splinter Cell was released in not far November 2002 on Xbox and PC, and then landed on PS2, GBA, GameCube and even on mobile phones: Pandora Tomorrow follows exactly the same path. It was perhaps the first title ever that followed the lesson of Metal Gear Solid not to insert Stealth elements in a game that remained action, but to create a pure Stealth, even more than MGS itself: the characteristic of SC was in fact the presence of illuminated areas and other darker ones until complete darkness, and they were the ones that Fisher had to exploit to remain completely invisible to the enemy, and to act undisturbed. In theory, except where expressly provided for by a mission objective, Sam could pass most of the levels without being involved in shootings and even without killing or neutralizing anyone, but simply remaining invisible to the eyes of enemies, taking advantage of shadow areas, the particular conformations of the levels and the numerous, delicious gadgets with which it was equipped. a pure Stealth, even more than MGS itself Darkness is your best friend Pandora Tomorrow, also considering the short period of time that separates him from his father, does not change the settings one iota and limits himself to bringing, as well as, obviously, a completely new story and setting, a different technical system (an important point which we will deal with later) and all in all limited, but welcome, changes to the gameplay, such as a slightly more reasoned level design, a more functional control system, the correction of some bugs and various defects and little more... Basically we're facing the same game, which shouldn't be a problem for the many who loved the first SC; it is impossible for us, however, not to point out the obvious negative sides, together with the positive ones, of this choice. In general the rules are simple, avoid the light like the plague and do the dirty work with an opponent out of sight and ears of the others Darkness is your best friend So let's go and examine this blessed game in detail... As mentioned, within the various settings Sam will have at his disposal, or will be able to create, areas of absolute darkness in which he will remain totally invisible to the enemy, literally embodying the concept of stealth; from here he will be able to study, and in most cases calmly, the right strategy to adopt to overcome the particular obstacle he is facing undisturbed. In general, the rules are simple, avoid the light like the plague and do the dirty work with an opponent sheltered from the eyes and ears of others: in fact, if you attack an enemy where others can see and/or hear, first of all an alarm will go off, and in some missions you won't have to trigger any, and then a good shooting will start, which a good secret agent should avoid... In these moments, of studying and implementing tactics, the game can be downright exhilarating: moving in the dark at a palm of the nose from the enemy who cannot see you, waiting for an opponent to arrive at the point where you think it is safe to attack him, aiming, firing a precise shot on the head, all underlined by absolutely atmospheric music and immersive effects such as Sam's breath when he fires a shot after holding his breath, all this offers priceless emotions for fans of the genre. Another big point in favor of the game system is that there is never only one way to deal with various situations, and very often there is not even the best way: the careful study of the level design set up by the UbiSoft programmers, with various alternative ways difficult to see but effective to remain unseen, the athletic versatility of the agent Fisher which allows you to take advantage of the aforementioned alternative ways and above all the many technological or otherwise gadgets at his disposal, will all be means and variables useful for each player to establishand the tactic that he finds most secure and suited to his way of playing, in some cases even giving a feeling of absolute freedom even though the levels are completely guided. ... all this offers priceless emotions for fans of the genre. Darkness is your best friend It is a pity, however, that this ~suspension of disbelief~ falls badly, not always but it does happen, when it comes to terms with the artificial intelligence of the enemies, or rather with its lack: in fact, all the terrorists' behaviors seem scripted, and paradoxically a script is much less predictable, the first time you play, than a well done AI routine; such is the disappointment when we realize that some opponents, just for example, will promptly succeed, it does not count either your position or your speed, to raise the alarm before receiving the second nudge necessary to knock them down, when we logically we had judged safe the tactic of luring them into a dark place and physically attacking them to be quick and silent... Maybe this will lead us to have to replay that particular point, now knowing how to behave, but this to the detriment of the study phases and the feeling of freedom above. Another defect, of minor importance, is the inexact calculation of the vital points of an enemy: if, in simple terms, you hit an opponent in the chin or neck instead of precisely in the head, he will not die, and wounded he will give the alarm. But now that you know that, it shouldn't be a problem... Better a Pandoro tomorrow... One of the reasons for the great success of the first Splinter Cell was its graphics of great stature, and the sequel, in its original Xbox and PC versions, is no different. The GameCube version, however, is a conversion not from the original Xbox, but from the PlayStation 2 version, necessarily crippled compared to the Microsoft console. For Splinter Cell UbiSoft had decided to cut clearly in the PS2 and GCN versions the light and shadow effects, which on Xbox and PC were a real show and the strong point of the graphics, in favor of maintaining the number of polygons and the quality of the textures , and the result was a game with clean graphics, less atmospheric but certainly not to throw away; with Pandora Tomorrow the diametrically opposite decision was made: the lights and shadows remain practically intact, while the number of polygons and the textures undergo even heavy resizing in some cases. The result is richer, heavily atmospheric graphics, where the splendid dynamic lights and shadows manage to obscure the awkward and low-detailed polygonal models and poor quality textures; however, it is also decidedly dirtier and heavier graphics: the frame rate of the first SC on Cubo was certainly not stable, but here the slowdowns are even more present and translate into real jerks that fortunately make the title unplayable in situations very rare along the course of the levels, and all related to the movement of the camera; once you find the right position, you will have no problems. Furthermore, the poor polygonal detail and the low quality of the textures will be noticeable in all their heaviness when you equip the night vision, which eliminates any atmospheric light effects. beautiful dynamic lights and shadows manage to obscure awkward, low-detail polygon models and poor quality textures Better a Pandoro tomorrow... These are all problems, not considering defects that the game carries with it from the very first version such as some interpenetration of polygons here and there and collisions, especially with the badly calculated scales, which derive from the choice to base the GameCube version on the PS2 version and not on the Xbox one: the Nintendo console has in fact already amply demonstrated that it can manage high quality dynamic effects of lights and shadows together, a good number of polygons and excellent textures, not to mention physics and artificial intelligence routines, maintaining a sufficiently constant frame rate. However, we do not feel like condemning UbiSoft for the decision, given the situation of third-party titles on the GameCube. Just as we do not feel like expressing negative judgments on the decision to exclude any online functionality of the game: in the other versions, in fact, the big news is an online multiplayer mode that changes the whole spirit of the game a bit, and which, while not being epochal, has attracted the sympathy of a good number of players, remaining in fact the biggest step forward in the series and perhaps a fundamental incentive to purchase, which is missing on GameCube. But expecting Ubi to invest where Nintendo is also extremely reluctant would have made little sense; the decision not to include multiplayer is a little less understandabler offline with split screen of the other versions, but that's it... expecting Ubi to invest where even Nintendo is extremely reluctant would have made little sense Better a Pandoro tomorrow... What leaves quite disconcerted is the fact that, frame rate aside, the Cube version is technically even lower than the PS2 version! Some textures, movies, dialogues and even loading are better on the Sony console, demonstrating the poor optimization work, the scarce resources involved in the Nintendo conversion; and the extra level on PS2/Cube is worth little, which happens to be the worst mission of the game both technically and as a concept (and which in any case is available to all Xbox Live users), and the connection with the GBA which does nothing else which make the game easier than originally thought; we will not launch here into invectives with an ideological flavor using big words like ~intolerable~, which would not be entirely unjustified, because we are well aware that video games are a billionaire business and the various players must base their actions on profit parameters and of profit. We will therefore limit ourselves to the bitter observation of being faced with the classic snake that bites its tail: the software houses think, based on precise data, that their games will sell less on GameCube, so they allocate fewer resources for development on the console; the game does less well than elsewhere and comes out later, and actually sells less as a result. It is a situation now too rooted in Cubo to think of changing it, but the coming Revolution will have to deal with this too... With the Voices of To finish on happier notes: the music is extremely well done and atmospheric, emphasizing every moment with the right incisiveness; the sound effects also contribute to the atmosphere, in particular the aforementioned breathing of Sam when he exhibits his sniper skills, priceless! All the dialogues, as in the first, are spoken and dubbed in Italian, and as in the first to give the voice to Fisher is the incomparable Luca Ward, who perhaps does not adapt perfectly to the physical appearance of the very American and grizzled Sam but he excellently embodies the ironic and bold spirit; Morgan then, who voices Sadono, is a pleasant surprise that contradicts the negative expectations of those who were a little perplexed by the announcement of his collaboration with UbiSoft: sometimes a little over the top, and it's not his the tone that we instinctively imagine for a character like Sadono, but the acting is excellent. What leaves quite disconcerted is the fact that, frame rate aside, the Cube version is technically even lower than the PS2 version! The other characters are good, decidedly among the best of the Italian videogame dubbing panorama, although it is on the rise, which is important for a game that relies on numerous dialogues, both in the cut scenes and in the game, to unravel the plot and establish the atmosphere right. In this regard, we conclude by noting that the events take place making use of all the clichs of the genre, even without major twists, and that the fans will love it; finally, the cut scenes seem slightly lower than those of the first episode, which appeared more cinematic while these adopt a cut more suitable for a TV serial. Nothing to beat your chest about, though... Comment The judgment on Pandora Tomorrow, the game, is soon given: an excellently conceived Stealth that finds its only rival in Thief 3 for the palm of best representative of the genre, which will exalt those who have already loved the first episode and all fans of the genre , and which has a major flaw in the opponent's AI. Even the judgment on Pandora Tomorrow, the GameCube version, is easy: it lacks a whole part of the original experience, the multiplayer mode, and technically it is the worst version. If you only have a GameCube to satisfy your gaming needs, make it yours without reservations; otherwise we do not see a single sensible reason to prefer it to the other versions. Pros: Beautifully designed Great atmosphere Dynamic lights and shadows never seen on Cubo Formula tested with the first SC Cons: Formula tested with the first SC IA? You are here? The Cubic version is the worst From Indonesia with Terror In many intellectual works with a more liberal inspiration than the one that pervades the works of Tom Clancy, we users of the stars and stripes collective imagination have learned to know and fear the National Security Agency, NSA for friend and foe, as a very powerful and obscure organization totally outside the consolidated American democratic tradition: in", "date": "2004-08-16", "grade": null}
