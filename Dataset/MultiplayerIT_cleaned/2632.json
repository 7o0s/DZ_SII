{"name": "Mario Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-tennis_a.html", "text": "Simulation and training The game is truly amazing. It is most likely second only to the classic Super Mario Deluxe; longevity and enjoyment are expressed at the highest levels. These and few words could be enough to justify a review, and the immediate purchase; any other discourse is purely informative. The graphics are also very nice, it is understood when compared to similar titles. The price that is currently paid in terms of resolution compared to any other console is immense, but if you love the unmistakable style that accompanies every title for the GBcolor, then you will have bread for your teeth. 1 The game is divided into two distinct sections: on the one hand there is the exhibition: you can choose all the characters dear to the Nintendo tradition and challenge each other in a single, double or two-player game via the link cable. We must immediately premise that this phase is far from any simulation ambitions; based in the best arcade style, it allows you to learn the basic strokes in an absolutely ridiculous amount of time. For the more demanding, the smash and all the various effects that exist in tennis are available via a special combination of keys. 2 Almost joined to this is the mini games section, i.e. a collection of challenges that give the possibility to access two (or perhaps more...) hidden characters. Each player has one type of mini game, for example Donkey Kong has to hit some bananas. 3 Le Tours! But if you want more, you can take on the Mario Tour mode. Here is the greatness of the game. You will have to play the role of an aspiring tennis player, who enters a college where this sport is taught. The old teacher will first explain the rules of the campus: as soon as you arrive you will have to try your hand as an amateur: attend the gym, improve your strokes with the masters and beat the first four of your class: you will become a semi-professional! Here you will start over to try to become a Varsity, i.e. one of the best three players. As soon as you finish the single mode you will find the double waiting for you. 4 Clearly your skill levels will be very low at the beginning, you can increase them with all the methods described up to now. Be careful though if you place too much weight on speed and power, accuracy and direction will suffer. The secret is to build a balanced player. The last feature of the game is the Dictionary which contains all the explanations of the terms used in the game of tennis. 5 Why not spend a few more words on the interaction you can have with other students, or on the possibility of improving yourself by obtaining rackets and outfits from college? Because as I said at the beginning it's all rhetoric. The game must be tried to understand how much excellent feeling it gives to the user. Mario Tennis essentially has a defect: namely the high price of the batteries given that you will need at least two ~changes~ to complete it, without forgetting, indeed forgetting that in addition to the Nintendo laptop you also have a social life. But after all, isn't this what you're looking for from a game? A MUST! pros: Good graphics Good sound Good gameplay Great fun Incredible longevity cons: Incredible longevity will be worth the entire social life of vs RED! To possess What is the greatest pleasure that an object can give to its owner? Undoubtedly precisely the fact of feeling it absolutely his, of being able to touch, use, manipulate. What joy do you feel in opening the package of the console you just bought and touching it, exploring it in every inch? What console in the world can give you this feeling in a perpetual way otherwise a laptop. Which console allows you to freely choose between Japanese, American and European titles? Who gives you the priceless sensation of pixel-based graphics, but the GameBoy? Perhaps these are the reasons behind the success of the small portable Nintendo. Today we are here to talk about yet another success for this console: Mario Tennis", "date": "2001-02-16", "grade": null}
