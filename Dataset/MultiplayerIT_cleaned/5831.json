In the meantime many things have changed and its very representation has considerably transformed, going from being a simple dark and indefinite background, a frame useful above all to let the imagination travel, to a complex system of planets and stars simulated with impossible fidelity to think up until a few years ago. Technological evolution has made it possible to return to space with a completely different attitude and if the sci-fi charm of spaceships and exploration of the unknown has remained practically unchanged, immersion in the virtual universe today takes on other contours. The explorable universe has therefore expanded and deepened and has become the scene of stellar journeys that represent the realization of the dreams of those who played Asteroids in the 70s and 80s. If space is ~enormous, incredibly, frighteningly vast~, as Douglas Adams says, a video game that represents it nowadays must be equally large and complex and Starpoint Gemini 2 manages to be, with all the difficulty of immersion that this, consistently, requires. There is a huge galactic map available to the player and a universe of different possibilities to carry on his own adventure among the stars in an approach that can easily disorient the user used to being led by the hand within the game mechanics , also due to the total absence of an in-game tutorial. For these reasons, the Little Green Men title requires dedication and commitment, but it is also capable of delivering great satisfaction to those who have the right predisposition, imagination and perseverance to learn the hard job of the space explorer. Exploring space takes time but can also give great satisfaction in Starpoint Gemini 2 Storytelling and free play The initial choice immediately places us in front of an important crossroads, with the possibility of choosing between the Campaign or free flight. It seems clear, going into the game, that his soul resides mainly in the second option, with the spirit of discovery and freedom of action that marry more coherently with a structure without narrative impositions, especially if these do not even appear high level. The Campaign continues directly from the conclusion of the first chapter and tells a story of revenge and revolt, which leads us to explore the various areas of the Gemini sector facing the overwhelming strength of the Empire with a small fleet, but is carried forward by rather cheesy dialogues and with a flat dubbing, failing to excite and resulting at most a good introduction to the game systems and the various types of missions. Several elements of the plot also take for granted the knowledge of the history of the first chapter, so those who have not played it find themselves lost in the face of a quick summary of the events and a background that is taken for granted when it would need more insights. In general, faced with a certain absence of pathos and particular situations in the Campaign, the free mode seems to reflect the spirit of the game in a more congruent way, therefore the advice is to dedicate yourself to the latter as soon as possible to fully breathe the atmosphere from space adventure without borders, the real strong point of Starpoint Gemini 2. There is really a difficult start to keep in mind, however: the beginning of the game is hard, inhospitable, almost hermetic in its lack of explanations and in the face of the amount of options and possibilities. It's a mechanic to be tamed and maybe the use of the controller and the classic console station don't even represent the best solutions with which to enjoy this game, but if your imagination helps you and you don't lack patience, it's also a difficult experience to be found elsewhere on Xbox One, although the only other example currently available, Elite: Dangerous, is substantially superior in many respects. Space at the controller's reach The adaptation from PC to Xbox One shows fluctuating results, even if in principle the game is all there and is also enjoyable. The biggest obstacle was obviously represented by the reduction of the control system to the Xbox One pad and the operation was performed in an excellent way: the left analog stick controls the ship together with some maneuvers (the pitching in particular) relegated to the directional cross , while the right stick is dedicated exclusively to movementof the camera. With speed and fire assigned to the triggers, the front buttons remain free and on these the team has worked in particular to adapt the large amount of commands available, with the possibility of calling up a contextual menu that opens a series of radial options, offering in in this way the various solutions related to the situation in which we find ourselves, in particular with regard to combat tactics, various maneuvers and the possibility of communication and interaction. It is clearly not an intuitive system, but given the complexity of the game it is probably the maximum obtainable by having to reduce a quantity of commands of this kind on the keys of a controller and on the other hand it is a question of commanding a spaceship (or even a fleet) in a game that has simulative ambitions; it stands to reason that the control system should reflect a certain depth. The combat system is also dynamic and pleasant, with a practical representation of the shields in the HUD placed around the ship which allows you to always have an eye on the situation of the ship and the defenses, thus being able to divert the energy reserves in real time to the points most at risk and quickly manage the power of the shields, making us feel in full Star Trek climate. Primary and secondary fire modifiable at choice (obviously paying to mount and upgrade new weapons) complete the picture of a well-implemented combat sector, despite being only one of the many aspects of the game, even if dogfight often falls into the usual syndrome of the chase without purpose that unites this kind of titles. All-rounder explorer The soul of the game is that of RPG, despite the integration of various features from other genres such as simulation, management and shooter, so that is the basis on which the action is structured. Each activity carried out in the Starpoint Gemini 2 space leads to the acquisition of experience points, as well as usually to the earning of money, all with a view to continuous progression for your character who in this way level up and can unlock new perks , which translate into special abilities to be used in combat, navigation or trade. Among the numerous missions that can be undertaken in the Gemini system, it is easy to see the quests of a sort of large space role-playing game that leads us to explore the universe in search of enemies to fight, materials to collect in the activity of collecting minerals , transport of various goods and trade. At the beginning of the game it is possible to choose between three different specializations for the protagonist, namely Commander, the more balanced and inclined to navigation in space aboard single ships or fleets, Engineer, obviously more inclined to technical and repair skills and Gunner, the firefight specialist. Each specialization brings with it a series of statistics and special abilities to unlock that modify the possible actions by introducing new items within the contextual menus, referring to the various game situations. The growth in experience and skill on the part of the protagonist is accompanied by an increase in funds which allow us to purchase new ships that are increasingly performing and make us able to further expand exploration in space, thanks also to the use of the T-Gates which allow you to cover huge distances in a few moments but with considerable costs. It should be noted that the simulation components only go up to a certain point, without deepening the flight techniques at the levels seen for example in Elite: Dangerous and greatly simplifying various situations such as docking on planets, which takes place in fact by simply pressing a button . Xbox One goals Starpoint Gemini 2 contains 26 objectives for the usual total of 1000 points, but the organization of these is decidedly bizarre. About half of the unlockable achievements do not release points, with all the gamerpoints therefore concentrated in a handful of 100 objectives, apparently distributed without a precise logic, also because some of the cumulative ones that are harder to reach reward us with zero points. Quite frustrating. Space charm The production is not that of the great videogame blockbuster and this is evident in various aspects as regards the technical realization, however the taste with which the space is built manages to make an exploration pleasant which otherwise would easily risk being monotonous. Nebulae of various colors, binary stars, light and shadow effects enrich the various perspectives of interstellar travel and gameplay experience. However, there is a rather fluctuating frame rate, perhaps the result of poor optimizationand in the conversion from PC, with obvious blocks that occur in correspondence with sector changes due to the streaming loading of the various explorable areas. In general, the visual impact is rather far from that of the much more impressive Elite: Dangerous, but Starpoint Gemini 2 still manages to establish itself with a certain style, also presenting very varied situations between wrecks, asteroids and other elements that arrive randomly at vary the spatial experience. Another rather spartan aspect of the game is given by the representation of the menus: the interface appears somewhat simplified and poorly adapted to use on consoles, with extremely small written texts to be seen optimally on a television, something that in a game that relying heavily on navigation between the various options can affect long-term use. On the other hand, the planets themselves are essentially menus, so greater care in organizing and displaying them would have been desirable. On the other hand, the work carried out on the design of the ships is good and the audio accompaniment is excellent, which follows the deeds of the player with a constant electronic soundtrack with ambient tones, which adapt well to the classic science fiction setting of this Little Green Men title.", "date": "2015-12-14", "grade": "7.5"}
