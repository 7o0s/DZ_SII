{"name": "Davis Cup", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/davis-cup.html", "text": "Forehand loop, backhand loop... The nucleus of this game consists of the Davis Cup mode in which, in fact, you will have to challenge the strongest national teams in the world to win the silver salad bowl! At the beginning you will be asked to choose a national team and then to select the four players who will be part of your team and will take the field during the various matches! The players all have individual skills. There are four parameters: speed, response, accuracy and service. The overall score of the team will be determined by the average of the scores attributed to the skills of the respective characters that make up your team. Once you have selected your team, you can choose the level of difficulty that best suits you: easy, medium and difficult. If you are a beginner, the easy level is recommended even if over time the other two levels will immediately become within your reach. Finally, you can also choose the surface of the field on which you will have to play. There are four types of surfaces: grass, characterized by being fast and with a low bounce; clay, characterized by being slow and with an average bounce; the sentitica 1, characterized by being slow and with a high rebound; the synthetic 2, characterized by being slow and low rebound. In Davis Cup mode you will not be able to choose the surface of the field as you like, but it will be determined randomly by the computer. There's a break point! The gameplay of Davis Cup is quite simple also because it uses only the directional buttons and A and B leaving R and L practically unused. The game does not offer particular cues or virtuosity as the only shots allowed are the forehand, the backhand and the short ball . For the rest, all you have to do is throw the ball across the field hoping that your opponent doesn't get there. Eventually you will find yourself in a vicious circle from which you will struggle to get out of it having to keep dribbling from the baseline with your opponent by incessantly pressing the A and B buttons in the hope that sooner or later someone will make a mistake. Unfortunately for someone like me who grew up on bread and Virtua Tennis, Davis Cup is not the best you can expect for a game based on tennis. Unfortunately Davis Cup doesn't make the idea of how this sport can be something more than a simple exchange of baseline strokes! Tennis is movement, entertainment and this is demonstrated by the fact that despite the most fierce matches even reaching 3 plus hours of play, the whole audience is glued to following the match without the slightest hint of boredom. Isn't that Bjorn Borg? If the gameplay isn't excellent, we can't even console ourselves with the graphics! I still remember when I enjoyed playing Namco's Smash Court Tennis! Although the game wasn't exactly the best, however the superdeformed characters, the fields obtained in the most disparate locations and the addition of special rackets with hallucinating effects made it an enjoyable game from all points of view. Unfortunately, in a serious representation of tennis like the one offered by the Davis Cup, a listed competition and a few logos scattered here and there are not enough to make a title great that instead struggles to fit into the games to buy at any cost! The graphics of Davis Cup closely resembles the one seen in All Star Tennis released some time ago for PlayStation, with the difference that at least in the second one the players enjoyed listening to the referee scolding the audience before making a joke, making cell phones ring! In Davis Cup sound and graphics that should mix perfectly in a tennis game, do nothing but make everything more boring. There's nothing sleazier than having a game-winning shot landed without a cheer from the crowd. Pro Tennis or Against Tennis? That is the question... Although the Davis Cup is a very popular competition for tennis enthusiasts, however if you haven't approached tennis yet, this is certainly not the best way to start. However, considering that the GBA doesn't offer many titles in the genre, Davis Cup can be considered a good pastime for those who want an easy and immediate game! Furthermore, the possibility of playing up to four players could be considered very fun in terms of competition between friends. Pros: Many national teams to select Ability to play the entire Davis Cup Easy and immediate gameplay Ability to play up to four players Cons: Gameplay poor in winning shots It doesn't offer particular ideas of originality Focused too much on the exchange and little on the shotsrpresa Bad graphics and not very incisive sound Tennis according to Jokerit! The summer period is not only beautiful because you go on vacation or you can admire the wonderful girls in bikinis, but also because tennis and cycling enthusiasts can finally start following the major competitions regarding their favorite sports on TV. In tennis, for example, three of the four most important tournaments on the Grand Slam circuit take place from June to August, namely Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the U.S. open. The Australian Open, on the other hand, takes place every year at the end of January and is the opening tournament of each new season. You may be wondering what all this has to do with the Davis Cup: it's easy to say! The Davis Cup is a team competition that has nothing to do with all the other tournaments held during the season. This competition involves teams made up of players of the same nationality who compete for the conquest of the silver ~salad bowl~, the Silver Trophy. Ubi Soft has decided to bring the Davis Cup to GBA with a title of the same name which, in addition to publicizing the event, will bring users closer to this very entertaining sport more from a visual point of view than from the one played.", "date": "2002-07-16", "grade": null}
