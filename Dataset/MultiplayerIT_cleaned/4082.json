{"name": "Rome: Total War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rome-total-war-recensione-iphone.html", "text": "Rome: Total War had the merit of thrilling the many strategy enthusiasts when it made its debut on PC, back in 2004, giving them a new, fascinating historical scenario to deal with. Third episode of the series developed by Creative Assembly, which still reigns supreme within the genre to which it belongs, the game allowed you to choose one of the most powerful families of the Roman Empire and pursue obtaining absolute power through the growth of cities under their control, the conquest of new territories and the creation of important alliances. Concepts that are well known to the fans of this franchise, and which are also being re-proposed today on the iPhone, a couple of years after the game's release on the iPad. How did the developers of Feral Interactive manage to ~tighten~ the interface and optimize the controls so that Rome: Total War can fully express its potential even in a portable context? Some adjustments have been made, but in general the feeling is that the team has limited itself to translating the title faithfully even on the Apple smartphone. This does not represent a problem during the management phases of the gameplay, that is when it is necessary to accept any missions, make or receive diplomatic proposals, but also to move the troops within the map. However, the moment you switch to the action view, during real-time battles, things become more complicated: scrolling the camera is often too fast and managing it is difficult, which also makes selecting and moving of the troops less simple than it should be. Gameplay and structure Adding to the issue of not perfectly optimized controls is the age of Rome: Total War, which unfortunately makes itself felt especially with regard to graphics. Many soldiers are displayed simultaneously on the screen, in a very clear way, and this does not cause frame rate drops on the iPhone X, it is true, but in terms of textures and animations we are faced with an evidently dated product, which shows off different glitches and inattentions within the presentation. Beyond these aspects, however, the game is all there and boasts a strategic depth that on mobile, for a whole series of reasons, knows no rivals. The mechanics that regulate the gameplay are quite multifaceted and profound, and allow you to devote yourself with all the calm in the world to the development of your own settlements with dozens and dozens of possible upgrades, possibly implement policies that can give a minimum of relief to citizens and increase our popularity, or disregard these aspects in order to obtain as many resources as possible to be used in war expeditions. There is an option that allows you to automate many elements, where you don't intend to take care of every aspect down to the smallest detail, and even during fights the importance of planning is essential, determining victory or defeat through dynamics that they are necessarily linked to the numerical superiority or inferiority of the troops. Also equipped in this edition with Italian dubbing and a complete translation of the texts, the title originally developed by Creative Assembly can entertain fans of the genre for dozens of hours thanks to the various campaigns available and the side modes, which allow you to try your hand at quick battles or with pre-set historical scenarios, to be ~solved~ in the best way.", "date": "2018-09-05", "grade": "7.7"}
