This is the latest effort by the specialists of Eugen Systems, a team with a great experience in strategy behind them (we mention in particular Act of War and Wargame), who under the wing of the publisher Paradox Interactive have been able to produce an uncompromising game, aiming to a user of enthusiasts. In short, don't be fooled by the genre, because Steel Division: Normandy 44 has very little to do with titles such as Halo Wars 2 or Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III. The Company of Heroes itself is very distant from it, despite sharing the same scenario. As soon as you start, you must first launch the long tutorial, which alone lasts a few hours. This is an aspect that should not be underestimated, because starting from the single player campaign or even from the online modes, without knowing the rudiments means being swept away without understanding why. The first factor to take into consideration is the choice of troops, which takes place according to a very simple system: each unit corresponds to a kind of card that must be selected by inserting it into our army. At the beginning of a game you will therefore have to deploy the first units, chosen on the basis of the category (each battle is divided into three phases and in each phase new units to be deployed are unlocked) and the points you have available (if you have an initial pool, but more are accumulated by playing). The battlefield is usually divided into three areas: one blue, one red and one neutral. The first is under our control, the second is under the opponent's control, and the third speaks for itself. It must be said that neutral zones usually remain neutral for a few seconds, especially in online skirmishes, where the goal is to expand your front as much as possible to accumulate more points than your opponents. The three stages In the previous paragraph we briefly mentioned the three-phase system, which deserves a few more words because it is central to the gameplay. To understand this, you must first understand how Steel Division troops work: not only does each unit have different values, but also specific mechanics. Unlike other real-time strategy games, here the troops do not compete on uniform numbers, but have precise roles, which make them better or worse depending on the situation. For example, attacking a tank with even ten infantry units involves a certain massacre, as does deploying bombers when it is certain that the enemy has an anti-aircraft unit. Even the actual clashes are more complicated than those of other real-time strategy games, by virtue of a system that does not provide for the immediate elimination of troops. In this way you have the possibility of making them retreat to a safe area and then making them fight again; provided that it is granted to us by the opponent, who can instead continue to target them by finishing them (either by killing everyone or by making them surrender). Here come the three phases into which each battle is divided: in phase A the lightest troops are usually deployed, such as reconnaissance troops (land and air), which are used to identify the position and quantity of enemy troops, infantry, artillery , some emplacements (mainly heavy machine guns), support troops for ammunition supply, weaker tanks and so on. This is the phase in which the front is usually established and the battles take on their physiognomy. Phase B sees the deployment of the middleweights, while phase C, the last one, that of the bigwigs (heavy tanks, air strikes and so on). The intertwining of all these mechanics, to which must be added the possibility of using buildings and vegetation as cover, the intelligent use of roads and other small but determining factors, is what makes Steel Division: Normandy 1944 an exceptional strategic both in terms of management of the entire battle, both at the level of individual actions. After having completely mastered the interface and understanding how to move troops without having them killed, the games become spectacular, with fronts that are reversed thanks to a shrewd use of the troops unlocked in one of the two advanced phases; with the creation of impenetrable but at the same time counterproductive defensive lines because they slow down the conquest of the front; and with the generation of many other situations that only a strategist with this complexity can guarantee. Campaigns and technique Difficult to reduce the complexity of Steel Division: Normandy 1944 to a handful of words. Let's say what the game doesgood is to transform the player's strategic vision, based on the troops available from time to time, into action. At the beginning it is difficult to apply the tactics that are explained in the tutorial, even when it is clear which ones are the most effective for winning battles, but with practice you find yourself giving orders like modern Pattons. Do not underestimate this aspect, because that of Eugen Systems is not a title that is easy to consume and to be able to say something online requires a certain dedication and an in-depth study of the game system. Fortunately, the latter guarantees a constant growth of the player who goes from being initially disoriented by the many variables to take into consideration, to knowing how to accurately evaluate the weight of the forces in the field and the probable outcome of a battle. This is what keeps us in the game and allows us to go beyond the initial impact, which is quite rude. The only weak point of the entire production are the three single player campaigns, made up of four missions each. For heaven's sake, they are very long and complex and we advise you to play them before going online, because they are an excellent school, but the truth is that they really make it clear how much Steel Division: Normandy 1944 was not designed as a single player game and that where the narrative imposes limits (of troops, actions, movement and so on), the whole construct begins to fall apart. From this point of view, the period films, the good artificial intelligence and the other tricks designed to make the whole experience more pleasant help little: the feeling is always that of being faced with a castrated mode compared to the online ones. The technical aspects of the game also deserve a few words. Overall Steel Division: Normandy 1944 is not jaw-dropping. Selecting the maximum level of detail is not bad and the more than four hundred units reproduced are well modeled, but it is clear that the obsession with graphics does not concern him. It does what it has to do: offer battlefields with recognizable elements and with always very high legibility, even when there are many troops on the field. From this point of view the guys at Eugen Systems have done a great job and that's enough. Also because when you participate in ten-on-ten matches and you have to keep an eye on and manage multiple battle fronts at the same time, what you need is fluidity, not graphic detail. If we want the same can be said of the soundtrack, full of effects and music in line with the scenario, which do their thing without overlapping the action.", "date": "2017-06-05", "grade": "8.5"}
