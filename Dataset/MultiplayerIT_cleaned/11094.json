{"name": "World Championship Pool 2009 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-championship-pool-2009-3d_a.html", "text": "The birth of billiards does not have a certain date, given that it is a game that has had various stages of development over the centuries and only in recent decades has it taken on the forms we all know. The best known billiard games, which also boast an official sports representation, are undoubtedly the ~eight-ball~ and the ~nine-ball~. In both cases, to win you have to pocket all the balls, but the rules and modalities change: in the ~eight-ball~ game, the two players share the balls (on one side those with full color, on the other those marked) and they have to post them all and then move on to eight; in the ~nine-ball~, otherwise, you have to pocket following the numbers of the balls (in ascending order) and whoever manages to pocket the nine wins. Billiards boasts a good representation on mobile, with several titles only recently starting to make use of polygonal graphics. World Chanpionship Pool 2009 3D is part of the new guard and can count, among other things, on an aesthetic impact of the first magnitude. Once the game has started, we will be able to try our hand at a career (made up of various tournaments), play a quick game, challenge a friend or face the many skill challenges. The number of modes is above average and offers a good longevity, but it is clear that the first thing that catches the eye is the solidity of the gameplay: the I-play product focuses on concrete things and closes the door to technicalities, perhaps wrong. It is possible to direct the shot and adjust its strength, but without conferring particular effects on the ball, which therefore always proceeds according to a straight trajectory. The approach is very ~user friendly~, with the graphical interface that takes us by the hand at any moment and makes our life easier from all points of view: before shooting we can check the possible movement of the hit ball and scroll with one button all the balls we can hit. We can also use the beauty of three different views: the default one, a close-up on the ball we're about to shoot and another from above. The control over the shots is therefore complete, perhaps even too much: the level of difficulty is affected by these aids, which at least are not present during the skill challenges (otherwise what ~skill challenges~ would they be?). The action is always rather reasoned and slow, with matches that last even several minutes and cannot be saved during the course: the only thing we can do to speed everything up is speed up the opponent's shots. As previously mentioned, World Championship Pool 2009 3D has an excellent aesthetic impact: the polygonal graphics make the action spectacular and realistic, the models used for the characters are of good workmanship and the movement of the balls is always quite fluid. The presence of three different views is a very valuable extra, too. If we really want to find fault with the game's graphics, it must be said that it's clearly not for all mobile phones: your device must have a certain computing capacity, or you'll find yourself playing in slow motion. The sound consists of well-made sampled music and effects, while the control system is immediately simple and immediate, with an excellent response to inputs.
