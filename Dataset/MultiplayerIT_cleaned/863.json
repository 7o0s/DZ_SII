This title offers a very realistic vision of what the negative evolution of the event could have been. The result of the atomic collision razes to the ground a large part of the most industrialized metropolises of the planet, cutting off the legs of the production of the most developed countries. The war scenarios are bleak to say the least. Entire regions are unusable due to flames, rubble and the very serious amount of waste and radiation produced by the explosions. The primary need after the cataclysm seems to be only one: to obtain raw materials, food, water and fertile and uncontaminated lands in order to rebuild the lost civilization. Here, then, is the post-atomic casus belli that inexorably lays the foundations for the Third World War. Gathered the remaining forces and entered into new alliances, the surviving countries must now fight for survival and the conquest of the Promised Land, a place where they can guarantee peace and prosperity for future generations away from deadly radiation and lands now rendered barren. RTS & TBS In this post-apocalyptic scenario, the player finds himself taking his first steps towards the last world war. Reformed armies make use of whatever the enemy has left on the ground, thus setting up motorized sections with new and old vehicles. This implies the need for a great knowledge in the war field, since each unit necessarily has its own peculiar characteristics that must be carefully studied in order to be exploited to the fullest. From this need arises the first important aspect of the game, namely the massive availability of means of all kinds that can be used on the field; in fact there are models of the past and hypothetical ~new models~ arising from the research carried out by scientists after the atomic war. The game has two distinct phases. The first is the one that covers a broader function and presents a geographical map of the territory in which the battle takes place, highlighting the possessions of the sides in the field, the position of the armies and the location of inhabited centres, industries and raw materials. In this phase, the game proceeds in turns, during which each faction is called upon to place its troops on the field and manage its possessions, for example by developing new structures to support the advancement of the front. The game proceeds in this mode until the opportunity for a direct confrontation with the enemy arises. In fact, when two armies find themselves occupying the same territory, it inevitably leads to direct confrontation. At this point the game drags us into combat mode. The player is asked to choose the mode of resolution of the conflict, automatic or with direct command from the player. The second choice allows access to tactical mode, a purely RTS experience that allows you to command troops and vehicles directly on the battlefield. A few more details... The tactical level of the game features a whole host of great insights. Although the game maps in this mode are not very large, the strategic impact is significant. The major difficulties encountered during field maneuvers are due to the large number of vehicles and units of the most disparate types that can be commanded at the same time. Many missions require careful planning to be completed as it is necessary to take full advantage of every peculiarity of the troops available to defeat the enemy resistance. The artificial intelligence of the game, despite being robust, suffers from some weaknesses; experienced and shrewd players will find the resolution to many clashes without any particular problems. This aspect clearly affects the longevity of the game, which not being able to have an online multiplayer mode (only the LAN game is available) should at all costs focus on the length of the missions and on an ever-increasing degree of challenge. The evaluation of the combat scenarios is essential for the outcome of the battle and the study of the mission, in fact the countless contaminated areas make it difficult for the troops to advance, as they act on them with negative effects on their state of health. A vast encyclopaedia on available armaments (from equipment to vehicle and aircraft models) closes the circle of tools made available to the player to achieve excellence in his attacks and better plan his battles.or clash with the enemy. Technically surmountable and already outdated, The Day After seeks its qualities in a simple style with a nod to the greatest videogame productions. The hybridization of turn-based strategy and real-time strategy, which reached its peak with the series of historical strategy Total War, appeals to many and has very interesting features. The attempt of this Black Bean production is to launch an economic title on the market that can still offer a rather vast experience. Where the game fails, for example in the decidedly antiquated graphic and sound sector, it recovers with the vastness of the units, a fair level of difficulty and commitment required, a rather captivating plot and, an aspect not always to be overshadowed, a package upper band, unusually refined for a game intended for the ~budget~. Pros: Huge assortment of units Ability to handle large number of units Higher quality packaging Cons: Outdated graphics Forgetful soundtrack Sometimes confusing tactical mode What if...? What if? What would have happened if the Cuba crisis of 1962 had not gone as we all know? What would have happened to planet Earth if the tug of war between Kennedy and Khrushchev had precipitated into the fastest and most destructive war that mankind could imagine? From these terrifying questions the Black Bean project was born, developed by the Russian software house G5 Software. The Day After: Fight For Promised Land takes its cue from this alternative political fantasy scenario to develop the basis of a strategy that aims to combine the two well-known philosophies of turn-based gaming and real-time gaming. The proposed plot evokes the specter of thermonuclear war narrowly escaped just over forty years ago, when the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to want to drag the entire globe into an absurd atomic tussle. In the second half of 1962, US spy planes discovered secret Soviet missile installations armed with thermonuclear warheads on the Cuban island. The reaction of the USA took off harshly which, fearing for national security, threatened a harsh and irreproachable reaction. It was soon understood that the critical situation could lead to a war that would not in any case leave losers and winners but only death and destruction. Kennedy's words were peremptory which cast the shadow of the atomic nightmare over the whole world on November 2: ~We will not prematurely run the risk of a world war in which the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouths, however we will not back down from faced with this serious risk at any moment it will be necessary to face it. Then began a tremendous tug of war between the two superpowers which ended peacefully by exploiting the channels of diplomacy in those fateful thirteen days that made the whole world tremble.", "date": "2005-08-02", "grade": null}
