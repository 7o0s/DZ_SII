Space borders are in turmoil, real galactic highways are being built before our eyes, but despite the promises of an evolution in intergalactic relationships, the potential profit linked to new technologies is more than enough to unleash a large-scale conflict. In essence, we find ourselves experiencing the events that will lead us towards X: Rebirth, a completely new chapter whose assumptions are created by the events narrated in Albion Prelude. The grand finale For the grand finale, however, EgoSoft did not limit itself to adding a couple of missions seasoned with some footage. In fact, even if X3: Albion Prelude is proposed as a bridge to X: Rebirth, nothing is left to chance and there are substantial innovations also from a technological point of view. The gameplay remains practically unchanged even if the interface is even more intuitive allowing quick access to all menus and all functions through the use of the mouse. Of course, in combat it is better to use some keyboard shortcuts, but the fact that the title can be played in total tranquility is important. It is in fact a title that requires a fair amount of patience and which, precisely through its relative slowness, forces the player to immerse himself in a unique spatial atmosphere characterized by credible maneuvers, complex statistics and long journeys. Obviously there is no lack of hyperspace jumps and the possibility of increasing the game speed, up to 10 times more than normal, to make everything bearable. But the hardcore nature of the series is solid and remains untouched. Everything from communications to equipment to trade is structured in a complex and articulated way. Among other things, the buying and selling of objects, essential for collecting money, is no longer linked only to the intrinsic values of the goods produced in a specific system but also depends on a dynamic quotation system. This obviously must be kept in mind when deciding which assets to buy or drill in order to maximize profit. Profit which, through management-type mechanics, can also be invested in stations and spaceships in order to create a small personal empire. A complex universe X3: Albion Prelude offers a number of different experiences which, depending on the chosen character, radically change the gameplay. They range from the basic difficulty, with the choice of the terrestrial pilot who is in the most hated faction but also in the richest, and you get to the extreme one with only one life to spend on suicide missions. Wasted that you can't recall a save but have to start over. If we add to this the complex and warlike faction system, the intrinsic difficulty of some missions and the vulnerability of X3's vessels, we can get an idea of the potential, in terms of degrees of challenge, of this expansion. There are also some innovations from a technological point of view. By now the suggestive sampled voices, obviously in English, recite all the essential information in an impeccable and engaging way. In addition, with Prelude there are also 30 new models, including ships and space stations, which greatly amplify the feeling of variety. Everything is then made with greater care which makes space stations and planets much more credible. To support everything there is obviously no lack of suggestive soundtracks of excellent quality which in a title of this kind are a fundamental element given that a large part of the aesthetic sector is based on an illusion. Although X3: Albion Prelude is an add-on to X3: Terran Conflict, and uses various assets of the latter, the technical differences included in this expansion make old saves incompatible. The choice is obviously the basis of the aesthetic leap made by this new expansion but it is not without contraindications since it forces you to start over from the bottom up. In fact, several missions are immediately extremely complex and require a well-equipped spaceship, so it becomes necessary to go through the whole process to install various upgrades and accumulate money. Not a real obstacle for those who spend hours and hours on this series, but a potential problem for those who love flying around in space and don't have too much free time. In short, a lot of time is needed before finally being able to get to the heart of the galactic change which, representing the grand finale of the series, would have benefited, also from the point of view of identification, from the possibility of using a character who grew up through events by Terran Conflict. In any case, if faced with the right attitude and with patience, this transitional chapter is still capable of givingand unique satisfactions and to create the right conditions to make entry into the next series something unique in the videogame panorama.", "date": "2012-01-05", "grade": "8.0"}
