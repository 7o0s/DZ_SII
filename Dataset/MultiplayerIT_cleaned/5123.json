{"name": "The Entropy Centre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-entropy-centre-recensione.html", "text": "If the mountain doesn't go from Portal 3, a team of indie developers creates their own version of Portal 3. That wasn't exactly the saying, but in practice that's what happened with The Entropy Centre, a new puzzle game coming on November 3, 2022 on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC. Stubby Games, a new team in its first test, has made as close as possible to the beloved Valve saga, proposing a first-person puzzle game that immediately recalls Portal without going to the point of having to defend itself from lawsuits. However, being inspired by a couple of much loved games is not enough to create a work of quality: since the announcement Stubby Games had attracted our attention, but on the occasion of the release we had the opportunity to try firsthand how much good has been accomplished. To find out if the final result satisfied us, you just have to continue reading our review of The Entropy Centre. Space and time In The Entropy Center we will have a Portal Gun um, an Entropy Gun The Entropy Center does not try to hide its source of inspiration in any way. A science center abandoned for years? We have it. A gun that is not used to shoot, but to manipulate space? Present. An artificial intelligence with an easy joke? It is not missing. The first difference is linked to the fact that our protagonist is not silent, but rather has a fundamental role in the narration. Aria, this is her name, wakes up with no memory in the Entropy Center, a space station created by humans with a ~simple~ purpose: to reverse Earth's time during cataclysmic events. The structure is essentially a rescue system that analyzes our planet and in case of problems it sends back time, then sending data on what is about to happen and how to prevent this from happening. In The Entropy Center we must prevent the earth from reaching 8,000C Only, in our time, the center is abandoned and only Aria, along with her AI-attached entropic gun called Astra, is present. What happened? Where is everybody? Questions arise when we discover that the Earth is about to explode and we are the only ones who can save it by activating the Entropic Beam. The plot is administered both through the nice dialogues between Aria and Astra (characterized by an excellent dubbing, among other things) and through about seventy narrative collectibles to be found in the game, also delving into life in the center and slowly suggesting what it actually is happened. The ending, we admit, is easy to guess, but that didn't make the journey any less interesting. The plot is well paced, offers some disturbing implications and in some situations we were prompted to think about ethical issues related to what was happening. In short, The Entropy Center manages to offer a valid narrative component, which is not always easy with a puzzle game. Puzzles but also action The classic push buttons are also a must in The Entropy Centre However, the heart of The Entropy Center is its playful component, i.e. the puzzles. The structure is exactly what you'd expect from a similar Portal: a series of rooms with an exit door to reach and unlock, with some more action-packed sections that break the pace. The latter help to make the experience a little more varied and are a good way to create tension and put pressure on the player who must, for example, escape while some structures collapse around him or must destroy robots that have become aggressive. In some cases these action phases are a bit annoying since it is possible to die and you have to repeat some steps. These are a few areas scattered throughout the game, but they are undeniably the weakest point of the experience: they are necessary, but in a couple of cases some polishing would have helped to make them more enjoyable. Some robots are not happy to see us in The Entropy Centre However, most of the ten hours of play (a similar length to the second Portal) are spent solving puzzles. The game is divided into sections, and each time you move on to a new one, a new design element is introduced. We will have the classic cubes to place to press buttons on the ground, but also a platform to jump, cubes that generate bridges of light, laser beams (not deadly) to activate sensors and more. Many of the elements used by The Entropy Center immediately recall Portal 2. On the one hand, the game is therefore not very original, but on the other it really makes us think we are inside a new Valve game: from our point of view, this 'last feeling is more than positive. The Entropy gun from The EntropyCenter allows you to move objects back in time But let's get to the point: how does the entropy gun work? In practice, every time an object is moved, the movement is recorded and our weapon allows it to go back. The whole game is therefore based on understanding how to move objects so as to create a path and make them move from a distance to position themselves exactly where we need them as we too move around the room and reach the exit. The Entropy Center brings many ideas into play, continuously expanded and reused in an interesting way in the following rooms, gradually mixing the various design elements that have just been unlocked. The quality is on average high: it is one of the puzzle games that have most satisfied us in recent years, proposing challenging, but always clear and legible puzzles. Difficulty The Entropy Center isn't like relaxing on the beach, but it's never too hard, I promise The difficulty level is never too high, above all because the game accompanies us towards each new rule with simple puzzles that make us familiar with new types of solutions before facing more elaborate sections. How easy it is obviously depends on the individual player and his level of experience but, to try to give you a point of comparison, from our point of view it is a little easier than a The Talos Principle and Portal 2. Personally we would have appreciated some ~brain-busting~ enigma ready to block us for even a good half hour, but on average we are satisfied with the level of commitment required: nothing is ever taken for granted and if you think you have immediately found the solution you realize that there is one more detail that had escaped you, but at the same time you never stay still for too long on a single section. Small technical limitations The Entropy Center is stylistically pleasing Where The Entropy Center cannot compete with a Valve product is on the technical side. Let's be clear, the game doesn't have huge flaws, but it's still an indie. In some situations, the lighting system leaves something to be desired and the level of detail is not top-of-the-class, but at least it manages to vary the minimum stylistically enough by proposing slightly different environments. There are also some small bugs, which risk locking the character in place, but these are a couple of occasions throughout the game right in front of the autosave: we also believe that the first updates will correct this.", "date": "2022-11-02", "grade": "8.5"}
