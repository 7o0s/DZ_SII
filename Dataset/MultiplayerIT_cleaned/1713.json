{"name": "Risiko! Digital", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/risiko-digital.html", "text": "The dice technique Comment on the purely technical aspect of this RisiKo! Digital would be rather merciless. Criticize the bare and poor graphics, even if functional, or the essential and monotonous sound, even if at times refined (definitely nice, at least at the beginning, the fact that, for example, fighting in the territories of Jacuzia you will hear the hiss of the icy Siberian wind ), would be too simple and short-sighted. In fact, from the point of view of a videogame transposition as faithful as possible to the original boxed game, it is only necessary to note how much the feeling and style of the original ~RisiKo!~ have been maintained. This, if for many it can only turn up their noses, for others it can only recall even more the atmosphere of the smoky evenings in the tavern spent in the name of the freest and wildest curse. Instead, the design of the game interface deserves a separate discussion. Especially during the first few games you will need to get used to it a little, once you get used to it, however, it will be impossible not to notice how nothing has been left to chance and how, except on rare occasions, it is possible to have a immediate status of the situation with a few mouse clicks if not with a single glance at our monitor. During every moment of the game, then, it will be possible to consult the game statistics to verify which player was the most tenacious, the luckiest or the most spendthrift. From the initially rather abstruse logic and from the at least accessory utility those numbers will not fail, however, to make all the most avid players and all lovers of numbers in general rejoice. Either risk or death The initial menu of RisiKo! Digital is immediately clear: we can play against the computer in two different ways or we can throw ourselves headlong into the mare nostrum of the big network. Another possibility, actually quite useless in our opinion, is the fact of being able to watch a game played entirely from the computer with the only possibility of being a spectator. This mode defined as ~Arena~ will be used mostly by those wishing to test the virtual characters created using the special editor supplied with the game or by those wishing to have their creatures collide with those of their friends: a sort of ~Robot Wars~ strategic in short. By setting the advanced difficulty level, in fact, we will be able to choose the style of play of our computerized opponents ourselves and, in case the predefined personalities do not suit us, we will be able, as already mentioned, to always create new ones thanks to the useful personality editor included directly with the game. If at a basic level beating the computer could prove, especially for veterans, too easy by virtue of Banzai tactics or in any case quite ~stubborn~ (such as: I attack you until you give me my favorite territory) we will instead notice how challenging opponents with more advanced AI it is really difficult to win. We can confidently state that the most intelligent computer players implemented by RisiKo! Digital far outnumber the average human gamer in the flesh. The game board is that of the classic ~Risiko!~ (no FutuRisiko or similar amenities therefore) and we will be able to play, according to our needs, both with the classic rules and with the tournament ones of the so-called ~RisiKo! Prestige~. Let's rosy together Multiplayer is certainly the real soul of the game. This is because, however well thought out the artificial intelligence may prove to be, you will soon tire of being relegated to simple duels against virtual opponents and, instead, you will be itching to clash with hundreds (thousands?) of other enthusiasts in a Ladder (also called ranking) all Italian, calculated in full tennis style, which cannot fail to arouse the desire to compete together with the best players of ~RisiKo!~. The network code seems to have been optimized even for slow connections, so that even with a mere 33 Kb modem you can enjoy the pleasures of the multiplayer game. Furthermore, the structure of the matches has been designed so that, even in the event of problems for one of the participants involved in the current match, the match does not have to be cancelled, as the computer itself will take charge of preparing and using, for as far as possible, the player's troops suddenly disconnected. Another decidedly welcome feature is represented by the fact that, in the event of loss of the connection, it will still be possible to re-enter the game and resume the reins of one's army in mininature. It is a pity that, from time to time, online matches suffer sudden and truly inexplicable blocks. Therefore, it may happen that you have to abandon a game due to the loss of synchrony of one of the participants right during the ~rolling of the dice~ making it effectively impossible to abandon the current session and forcing all players to reset the game. It is also a pity that it is not possible to organize Hot-Seat games (several players take turns on the same PC) or on the local network: in short, no evenings with friends in front of the PC. With a view to offering a service that is as simple and complete as possible, in fact, the developers have chosen the path of managing everything through their game server and website which, albeit very small, may remind someone of the famous BattleNet by Blizzard. Also really appreciated is the comfortable and very simple in-game chat with which it will be impossible not to start pleasant discussions with other players. On balance the Multiplayer part can be considered promoted without hesitation. The last words Whoever wrote this review is a big fan of RisiKo! and board games in general. This, even if at first glance it might seem like an obvious how trivial and gross error, however, is only an indication of the fact that this title was designed, above all, for those who are already accustomed to the original game. To strengthen this thesis, it is sufficient to point out how, reading the game manual, one notices the almost absolute lack of description of the game rules of ~Risiko!~. There are more or less in-depth indications on the use of the Software but there is almost never mention, for example, of the Tournament rules. RisiKo! Digital therefore offers the best (if not the only) opportunity to play the timeless classic of the same name on our monitors. If you love RisiKo! original you can't help but stay up late challenging other enthusiasts on the Internet and you can't help but play a quick quick match against the computer, perhaps during the lunch break. If you don't like RisiKo! or are you simply looking for more gameplay depth then you might want to go back to playing Civilization or Europa Universalis. But then, let's face it: how many, having the opportunity to try it, have had the courage not to fall in love with this playful jewel? Have you ever tried RisiKo? So I suggest you get invited by some of your friends and try it with the excuse of spending a nice evening with friends. Everything else will come by itself guaranteed. The last words Pros It's risky! Neither more nor less Fun and well done (despite some uncertainty) the multiplayer section You will never lose count of your armies! Cons It is not possible to play multiplayer games neither on the same computer nor in LAN Audiographically dull For many it may seem too simplistic Tank question In the beginning there was the plastic tank. Of different colors but always of the same shape, the carroarmatino can join together with others of the same race (and color) to become, once a certain degree of metaphysical aggregation has been reached, a flag. Carroarmatini and flags are the means by which the will to achieve one's goals is revealed: the domination of the world as we know it today. Almost. RisiKo! it is this and much more. One of the best known and most played board games, second perhaps only to the equally legendary Monopoly, RisiKo! has managed to attract the attention of millions of fans: from the casual player to the most attentive and savvy one. Because if it's true that dice are dice and luck doesn't look anyone in the face, ~RisiKo!~ it always manages to give us the impression that, despite that ~damned bad luck~, we could have changed the course of the game by implementing a more cautious tactic or a more refined strategic approach. After dozens of more or less successful imitations of RisiKo! sees, again at the hands of the legendary Editrice Giochi, its own digital incarnation which could only be called RisiKo! digital~.", "date": "2003-03-24", "grade": null}
