{"name": "Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-boy-and-the-cursed-kingdom-recensione.html", "text": "The release of Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap, a remake of the almost homonymous title that dates back to 1989, brought the Westone series back on everyone's lips after the Japanese company went bankrupt in 2014, twenty years and something after the release of the last ~official~ Wonder Boy, the fourth. In fact, the franchise has been characterized for years by a complicated story of licences, adaptations and conversions that we have summarized in an old monograph to be read. However, while DotEmu and LizardCube were rebuilding Wonder Boy III, French developer Game Atelier, which had started a standalone Kickstarter project, caught the attention of Westone founder and series creator, Ryuichi Nishizawa. The Game Atelier game has thus become Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom, a title that recalls the original series, projecting it into a space where nostalgia and innovation mix to form one of the best video games released in 2018. The shape of the gameplay The limited scope of this project could be misleading and suggest that it is a kind of indie sold at too high a price, when instead it is important to understand that Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is a finished game that does not show off polygons and three-dimensional virtuosity, preferring a very colourful, cartoonish two-dimensional solution and, above all, enormously respectful of its origins. Each screen is a little jewel made of accurate details, excellent animations, detailed sprites and references that exude the immoderate passion of the developers and that the older ones, those who were there at the time of the other Wonder Boys, will enjoy recognizing and appreciating. Each dialogue and each supporting actor participates in making this funny world in which uncle Nabu, apparently mad, or perhaps just drunk, has hurled curses left and right, transforming the inhabitants into anthropomorphic animals. One of them is Jin, the nephew, the ~wonder boy~ who, having become a pig with underpants and an eye patch (don't ask) will have to find a remedy for this mess before his uncle loses his life, seen that the king and his subjects are rightfully pretty pissed off. Jin, in the form of a piglet, cannot wield a sword and shield, but only step on switches with his big butt, sniff out hidden tracks and use a whole series of gadgets and magic that include boomerangs, bombs, lightning, fireballs and small tornadoes . These skills are learned as you face the early stages of the game and immediately put themselves at the service of a structure reminiscent of the ~metroidvania~, a genre that in a certain sense helped to outline that Wonder Boy III at the end of the years 80's: Spells solve environmental puzzles that gradually become more intricate and sometimes force the player to backtrack. The real game, however, only begins when Jin gets his hands on the first of the five spheres that could help him break the curse and which gives him the ability to take the form of a snake: it is at that moment that Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom finally begins to express its full potential. Each new area in the gigantic game map tests all the skills learned up to that moment and forces the player to change shape on the fly and almost continuously to solve the puzzles of the turn and continue exploring. Jin the snake can adhere to the sticky walls, spit poison and slip into the narrowest tunnels, while the toad shape finally allows you to take up your weapons again, but also to grab levers and protrusions with its elastic tongue. The leonine form guarantees a prodigious strength that allows you to break through walls with shoulder thrusts, while the draconic form allows you to reach previously inaccessible platforms thanks to a nice pair of wings that are convenient, in the last stages of the game, also to sift through every corner of the map . That of Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is in fact a world full of secrets from the very first lines, whether they are chests and hidden doors or alternative paths that refer to future powers and suggest returning at a later time, perhaps thanks to the comfortable portals. The multiplication of forms that Jin can take leads to the progressive stratification of an intelligent and imaginative level design which in the last few bars perhaps gets wrapped up a bit on itself for the desire to amaze and put the player to the test at all costs. Despite the fairy-tale appearance and the sung introduction - in English and Japanese - reminiscent of Sunday morning cartoons, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is a title that can sometimes be brutextremely difficult in the arrangement of enemies and in the most intricate platforming sequences. The bosses, often gigantic and divided into multiple stages complete with puzzles in between, could be the least of your problems. In this sense, the checkpoint system works well: there is no Game Over and these autosave points are intelligently diluted within the maps so as not to force the player to laboriously repeat the more complicated segments. The shops scattered here and there allow you to recharge hearts and restock on gadgets and spells, but everything has a cost and this, in the last stages of the adventure, could require a certain dedication to farming gold coins. In fact, Game Atelier has also developed a subtle RPG component, filling the game with weapons, armor and objects with the most disparate powers which, in some cases, even serve to solve some puzzles. The ice sword freezes the water into platforms to walk on, the lead boots prevent the wind or current from carrying us away, the shields reflect different types of projectiles, there are armors immune to different elements, boots that float, boots which allow a double jump and so on. Virtually every piece of equipment changes the appearance of the sprite who wears it and what's more it can be enhanced by the blacksmith, consuming the appropriate gems to unlock bonuses and secondary powers that perhaps grant access to new areas where other treasures are hidden. Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is a subtle interlocking game, a huge mosaic in which the various pieces come together with an enchanting perfection, going to draw an adventure that lasts about ten hours, something more if you are committed to scour the map for every possible collectible, whether it's spell boosts, additional hearts or Ollie the Musician's sheet music. In short, the Game Atelier title is not very long, but it involves from start to finish, it never leaves the player with folded hands and indeed accompanies him continuously to face new challenges on the notes of an extraordinarily rich soundtrack that have composed talents of the the likes of Motoi Sakuraba, Michiru Yamane and Yuzo Koshiro, lovingly rearranging the series' iconic tunes.", "date": "2018-12-06", "grade": "9.0"}
