{"name": "Duri a morire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155101-operation-dracula-duri-a-morire.html", "text": "The two-dimensional shoot 'em up genre represented an important piece in videogame history when the first arcades full of arcades to be filled with coins appeared. Over the years, the tastes of the players have evolved and have embraced new styles, above all thanks to the advancement of technology and new development environments that have led to what is present on the market today; despite this, shoot 'em ups still experience moments of glory especially in the mobile sector, thanks to high quality productions such as the Operation Dracula present here. Operation Dracula is a little gem that shines in the vast sea of games on the App Store Old school The story that frames the action tells of a war that happened many years ago in which four nations allied themselves to get rid of nothing but the famous Count Dracula, who following the defeat resurrects and tries to reconquer the world for the umpteenth time. If the narrative system seems to you only an almost pathetic excuse to catapult the player straight into the heart of the action, you are absolutely right, in fact, apart from this small summary that is proposed at the beginning of the game, there are no other hints of facts or things happened. In any case, what is important in this type of video game is not the plot, but the gameplay that distinguishes the experience itself and represents the one and only yardstick on which to base the final vote. From this point of view, one can only be satisfied by the work done by the Crescent Moon Games developers: although there are no innovative mechanics that can represent a turning point in this genre of games, the solidity of the gameplay is such as to certainly satisfy enthusiasts. The controls are very similar to those of similar titles on the touch screen: with a swipe on the screen you control the ship while the basic projectiles are automatically fired. Following the filling of the dedicated bar with a double tap, the special attack can be started, while in the lower right corner there is an indicator of the available bombs. The strategy and the way in which the player approaches the game represent the cornerstones on which to base the experience, in fact at the beginning of the adventure you have the possibility to choose the ship that you will go to command: there are three and each one of they have different strengths and weaknesses that must be tested to understand which one is most suited to the player's tastes, while completing the adventure with each one unlocks an additional fourth. Although the action is very frenetic and requires a good dose of reflexes, the special attack allows you to neutralize the blows of the enemies to catch that half second of breath and plan the next move, while the bomb is the weapon of destruction excellence that unleashes an explosion across the entire screen causing massive damage; occasionally, however, bonuses appear that allow you to enhance the basic attack and it goes without saying that they are absolutely essential in order to survive the gigantic end-of-level bosses. In essence, everything is as expected: Operation Dracula is certainly not a game destined to reinvent the wheel, but rather an excellent exponent of the genre. Technically the game looks very good, with detailed 2D graphics that are very pleasant to look at, while the music of clear ~Japanese-arcade~ inspiration represents the final touch for a product that does not disappoint from any point of view. Apart from the decidedly very high difficulty which risks discouraging those who are new to shoot 'em up; even at easy level successfully completing each level presents a challenge that will make even those who chew bread and R-Type sweat. The number of bullets on the screen, the enemies, power-ups and in general the density of elements that fill the display make the experience on the iPhone much more difficult than on the 10-inch iPad and in fact the latter is certainly the device best to try and beat Dracula's army on. Memorizing the patterns of the bullets and the position of the tanks is of vital importance to be able to get to the end and despite the presence of an energy bar, the gameplay is still decidedly hardcore; through high scores it is possible to obtain extra lives which become absolutely necessary in the most agitated phases of the experience, and therefore there is the incentive to eliminate as many enemies as possible to collect fundamental points. In essence, it is an excellent game that has the target to which it is addressed well in mind and does not present substantial defects that undermine the final experience; the only drawback, in addition to the high difficulty, lies in the price of 7,99, which perhaps seems excessive for this type of product.", "date": "2015-08-26", "grade": "9.0"}
