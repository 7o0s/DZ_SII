{"name": "Kameo: Elements of Power Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kameo-elements-of-power-recensione.html", "text": "Classic mechanics The Rare title is full of references and quotations, more or less explicit, of other video games and cinematographic works. The first to get noticed during the starting levels, are those for Metroid given a particular transformation of Kameo, and the influence of the Lord of the Rings in some audio tracks or game sequences, especially those of the spectacular open field battles between Elves and Troll. This kind of quotes increases as you proceed, and you can see what great effort has been made by Rare in an attempt to amalgamate all these situations so different from each other in an optimal way within the single player campaign. In fact, after saving them from the forces of the shadows, the princess can be transformed into as many as ten elemental warriors and each one inserts totally different gameplay elements and commands, which it will be crucial to be able to master. The control scheme, fortunately, always remains the same, each of the two analog triggers is assigned a move, plus a special shot that is performed by pressing them simultaneously. The choice of power ups, the fruits that are collected around the world and which can also be purchased in shops, and which provide new abilities to the creatures, is also decisive. The princess, in fact, can be transformed, after having saved them from the forces of the shadow, into ten elemental warriors and each one inserts gameplay elements Classic mechanics The controls are uniform for all the transformations of Kameo, and after an hour of play they are able to assimilate perfectly. Also the management of the camera, controlled via the right analog stick, after some initial uncertainties, can be managed without difficulty, with the only exception of the underwater movement, possible through a precise transformation, which is less intuitive than the others and which creates some difficulties. Kameo is a successful cross between an old-fashioned platform and a third-person action-adventure, the player must start from scratch to progressively improve their possibilities, through new transformations, increase the skills and abilities of the characters they use most, and use these powers to access previously closed areas, clashing with the bosses of the moment that can only be defeated through the combined use of transformations. Even with ingenuity, given that there is almost never only one way to deal with a given game situation, if you are able to carefully observe the setting and the enemy in front of you. A particularly well done and noteworthy feature is that of the use of a sort of bullet time which is activated when several monsters are killed in succession, creating various combos. As in the best of Matrixian realities, time will only slow down for your enemies, and in this way real carnage can be carried out. The difficulty level, unfortunately, cannot be changed, and it is a pity not to be able to make the clashes with the various enemies, excluding bosses, slightly more dangerous. In fact, unless you stop to collect all the coins or make impossible combos to collect points, the various areas can be crossed without too many thoughts. Similar speech for what concerns the aids available through our magical book which, if constantly requested, offer an all too direct solution to the puzzles to be solved during the game. Fortunately, this type of hint can be changed from the options menu, making the gaming experience more adventurous. The not excellent duration, together with a non-modifiable level of difficulty, prove to be the only substantial defects of the game in the test of facts. The campaign mode is rather linear, and in certain sections it is too guided, Kameo in fact can be completed in about ten hours, especially often using the various aids and clues available and following only the mandatory quests. In this way you lose most of the fun, you skip all the available sub-quests, you don't visit a good part of the virtual world and, above all, you cannot maximize the various abilities of the characters, who are the real protagonists of the game. game. The not excellent duration, together with a non-modifiable level of difficulty, prove to be the only substantial defects of the game in the test of facts. Cooperative campaign Loading times are short and the game offers a sort of autosave before and after major events within an area. Too bad you can't save in different slots to be able to resume the game at different points, directly from the main menu, so you can review the most epic and spectacular scenes.lari that are certainly not lacking. The evolution of Kameo has also been supported by the technical capabilities of the Xbox 360, adding some previously impossible scenes to achieve, one above all the reproduction, already mentioned, of the battles between Elves and Trolls with over 2000 animated models and with their own AI reproduced in a single screen. In the middle of the land that serves as a link between the different areas of the game. The view is spectacular, especially when, riding her faithful steed, the princess launches herself among the thousands of animated enemies, the explosions and the tanks that set the world on fire.

Cooperative campaign Not only singleplayer but in Kameo there is also a cooperative mode, where you can make the most of the combined capabilities of two different transformations. The co-op missions are unlocked as the game progresses in the single player campaign, so you can't start from scratch in this mode which, in fact, simply allows two to play the same sections of the single player campaign. On the other hand, the experience accumulated with the various characters available allows you to make the best use of the various powers with the help of a companion. The cooperative mode is certainly not Kameo's strong point, given the setting of the levels, certainly not natively designed for cooperative action, but it becomes an addition that can increase the longevity of the game and that allows you to enjoy it together to a friend of the Rare title settings. The princess of parallax mapping The technical side of Kameo, both graphically and sonically, is safe from any possible criticism. Impossible to mention all the effects used by Rare in Kameo, each area has something unique and a particular detail that distinguishes it from the others. From the first level, you will find scenes with exaggerated amounts of polygons, distributed between environments and animated models, such as the dozens of dragons that flutter near the castle walls, combined with first-rate implementations in lighting effects, or the use of parallax mapping and shaders elaborated to amplify the rendering of all the other elements visible on the screen. Played on an HDTV system, Kameo proves to be one of the most representative titles, if not the most representative, of the Next Generation graphics concept. Starting from the animations of the characters, up to the implementation of physics such as in the reactions of the water, we find examples of how Rare has exploited the potential of the Xbox 360. The frame rate always remains stable during the action, even in the presence of particularly complex scenes, just as there are no aliasing defects. (The only notes can be moved to the character design of some of the characters in the game, who must have suffered in these long years of gestation, not all being of the same level in terms of care and, above all, aesthetic taste nd A.J.) Impossible to mention all the effects used by Rare in Kameo, each area has something unique and a particular detail that distinguishes it from the others The princess of parallax mapping Among the available options, the possibility of choosing predefined settings for the brightness of the images is very useful. In addition to manually changing the value, you can recall the default settings dedicated to the various types of device used, such as an LCD panel, a plasma, digital projectors and so on. I invite you to change this parameter as soon as you start the game, in this way you will be able to fully appreciate the graphic performance in relation to the video support used. Not only polygons and textures, but also the whole sound department is at the top of the category. Excellent use of Dolby Digital 5.1 for the creation of environmental effects, but in particular the honorable mention goes to the soundtrack, which turns out to be one of the most successful and successful in recent years. Despite the possibility of using your own audio tracks, the Rare title is one of those titles that makes you desist from using this feature. Kameo is totally localized in Italian, including speech, and even in this case one cannot really complain about the result obtained. Comment Bright colors, personal character design, narrative interludes to underline the danger looming over the world, the fairy-tale atmosphere amplified by the omnipresent talking book, animations and facial expressions of the various characters worthy of a comic strip. In short, all the elements included in Kameo: Elements Of Power make itthe closest there can be to a Pixar production, with all the technical and graphic differences of the case, of course. If Rare wanted to bring the two worlds of digital animation closer together, bringing a bit of the old school style of video games to the Microsoft console, it has not failed with this title. Kameo, due to longevity problems and some of the defects reported during the review, while remaining one of the best titles at launch and one of the best exponents of Next Gen graphics, does not become the absolute Killer Application that many hoped for Xbox 360. It is a good title, which can be played with pleasure, which amazes in several points and which, more importantly, bodes well for Rare's future productions. Pros: True Next Gen graphics and technical sector Excellent sound Rare Style Cons: Only one level of difficulty A little too guided Character design inconstant Born as a project on Nintendo 64, Kameo: Elements of Power was first moved to GameCube and then Xbox, immediately after the acquisition of Rare in September 2002 by the Redmond giant. During the last few years the title has gradually evolved, with the change first with the graphic cosmetics, with a much more mature cut, then with the inclusion of new components in the game mechanics. Finally, in 2004 Rare and Microsoft decided to further expand the gameplay, inserting online cooperative modes, special sections in the single player, and rewriting the graphics engine according to the potential of Xbox 360 to make it one of the launch titles, together with Project Gotham Racing 3 and Perfect Dark Zero. Kameo: Elements of Power can be compared to a real fairy tale in videogame format, since the introduction, narrated by the classic voice-over, you can guess the type of product developed by Rare. Leaving aside the basic story, widely explained by a video that is impossible to skip, you immediately find yourself in the thick of battle in what is a real guided tutorial. Immediately after this second introduction, our journey begins from scratch to recover the elemental powers that we will need to save our family and the whole kingdom, from the Trolls' offensive in an epic battle between them and the elves for a game that has adventure, action and platform game in equal measure.", "date": "2005-11-29", "grade": null}
