Sam is about to congratulate his white partner when he realizes with horror that Max has become a floppy puppet with an empty head: someone has stolen his brain! Needless to say, the second chapter closes with a nice twist and, at least at the beginning, the new episode seems to keep pace. During the first part of the game, a pall of smoke and strong smells falls when Sam, with a long beard and a distorted face, takes off his white gloves to conduct a round of interrogations that are not at all pleasant - especially for his interlocutors. There are no items to use at this stage, just questions to time and choose as Sam grills a suspect. Although thanks to the ingenious ~noir~ voice, available among the answers, the whole scene benefits from a sharp sarcasm that counterbalances Sam's abrupt manner. However it is an ephemeral pleasure, because a few attempts are enough to return to known reality and begin the central phase of the adventure. It will also be for the comparison with the excellence of the second episode, but the fact remains that shortly thereafter, the third chapter is short of breath. There is no Sam without Max Be that as it may, things are still going well in the Museum of Mostly Natural History section, where the attempt to reanimate Max's body is the excuse for some clever and fun puzzles. We don't want to reveal the details so as not to spoil the surprise, but there are all the necessary ingredients to keep you hostage to the screen, at least until the start of the second part. Then the tension collapses, and the overabundance of voices vying for the stage doesn't do any of them justice. Furthermore, the story recycles characters and occasions already spent previously, hurrying from one scene to another. The puzzles do not require a serious and methodical rummaging as in The Tomb of Sammun-Mak, but are still less accessible than those present in the first chapter. Sam and Max sometimes switch roles and often act separate from each other, albeit with a common purpose in view. In this sense, there are some ideas worthy of the unconventional approach that has distinguished Telltale to date, but the energy that was felt last month is absent, to the point that interest sometimes fades to boredom, especially in the finale, which limps without ever taking flight. Even the final twist seems to force the hand in order to displace the player. Some might argue that we are very critical, but after seeing what can come out of Telltale's pen, what lines of dialogue and what ideas, we expect only the best, nothing less. Let's just hope it's an interlude to stock up on oxygen for the final sprint. Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse is the third series of five episodes on the adventures of Sam and Max.
