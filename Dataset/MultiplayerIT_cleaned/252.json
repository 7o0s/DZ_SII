{"name": "Sam and Max Episode 1: Culture Shock - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-and-max-episode-1-culture-shock-recensione.html", "text": "Sam the Riddler The gameplay is classic point-and-click adventures. The settings will be explored and analyzed, trying to collect the objects useful for solving the many puzzles proposed. The latter are extremely imaginative and bizarre: it will happen, just to name one, to have to pierce a slice of cheese with a gun, so as to make it look like Emmental and satisfy the whims of an overbearing little mouse headed by a fearsome organization of mafia rats. Unfortunately, many of the proposed puzzles will have to be unraveled through anything but logical reasoning, forcing the victim to a very large number of attempts and causing a lot of frustration. Inventory management is also not very well taken care of, the objects in which it contains will never have to be combined with each other to create others. The dialogues are very well thought out, pungent and always full of irony. The warning to seafarers of the day is instead linked to the necessary knowledge of English, the only language available for both speech and subtitles and used in its most jargon-like incarnation, almost in slang. It was decided to include a couple of arcade driving sessions, during which we'll have to chase some vehicles and stop them using our pistol and, at most, a megaphone. Unfortunately the vehicle, which accelerates automatically, must be moved by mouse click, making the experience complex. We would have expected, to tell the truth, some more innovation and the use of Sam and Max as a couple, while the latter will only be a comic shoulder. Longevity is an extremely delicate point to address: the guaranteed four, maximum five hours of play are decidedly few by the standards we are used to. In reality, the serial nature of Season 1 and the price at which each chapter can be downloaded directly from the Telltale Games website must not be forgotten: 8.95 dollars, approximately 7 euros. Steve Purcell and Telltale Games Behind the return of Sam & Max are some historical figures in the development of graphic adventures. Steve Purcell is the inventor of this bizarre duo, which he also revived in some illustrated books and in an animated series, and in the 90s represented the best the artistic studies of LucasArts had to offer, so much so that he had a voice also in the creation of the first two Monkey Islands. Telltale Games, on the other hand, is a small independent software house, whose members were part of the team that created the splendid Grim Fandango. The new faces of Sam & Max Technically Sam & Max: Culture Shock comes with a rather clean and cartoonish three-dimensional look. The structures and objects are stylized and characterized by textures with details that seem hand-drawn, really very pleasant to see, while the character models leave something to be desired due to an excessive lack of polygons and a certain repetitiveness. Thumbs up for the sound, which boasts spot-on jazz music and full dubbing of all dialogue. Note how the game is compressed in an installer of only 72Mb, on the disk it will occupy about 200, and has very low minimum requirements: a processor clocked at 1GHz, 256 MB of Ram and a video card with 64MB of Vram will suffice. Conclusions Sam & Max are back after a very long wait and almost meet our expectations. The irony and tone of every single dialogue, always suspended between the serious and the humorous, will elicit many smiles and will be able to enthrall you as it has rarely happened while playing a video game. Unfortunately, the puzzles, in the face of a certain originality, do not mix well with the different situations, forcing several unsuccessful attempts, ~just to try them all~. A must buy for lovers of graphic adventures and nostalgic for LucasArts productions, whose spirit has remained unchanged despite the conquest of the third dimension. All we have to do is wait confidently for the next chapters, to be released from January to May 2007. Pro Sam & Max, the name is enough Amusing like few others Costs little... Cons ...and unfortunately it doesn't last long The puzzles are sometimes not very sensible None heavy innovation Sometimes just one success is enough and you become immortal: this is the case of Sam & Max, who in 1993 managed to capture the hearts of many players in the graphic adventure Hit the Road, of which they were the amusing protagonists. Sometimes, however, a detective dog and his trusty mentally disturbed rabbit are not enough to convince some strutting producer to try to give new luster to a brand with a glorious past; so it happens that we have to wait over 13 years and the courage of Telltale Games. The Season 1 of Sam & Max was born from these premises. Six chapters, each distributed over two months di distanced and completely independent from others. The first, the subject of this review and entitled Culture Shock, will engage the two protagonists in the hunt for the evil Brady Culture, the guru of some self-improvement videos, actually a wicked evil genius with a penchant for hypnosis. As it is easy to guess, the plot is somewhat bizarre and imaginative, full of apparent contradictions and paradoxes. In reality, the tone and rhythm of the narration are the most successful aspects of the entire work: every situation is irreverent and manages with the lightness of a joke to lay bare the fears and neuroses of modern society. The enemy sees everything through the eye of a video camera, as if it were yet another Big Brother, while ordinary people fill up with weapons to defend themselves from those of others, fear the arrival of aliens and read the daily newspaper, which headlines satisfied how people's level of fear has dropped to the level of common anxiety.", "date": "2006-11-28", "grade": null}
