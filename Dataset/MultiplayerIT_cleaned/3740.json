{"name": "Outward", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outward-recensione.html", "text": "Outward is a strange object and a difficult subject for a review. It's the classic game that does everything to be hated, but at the same time manages to give you something that many other titles, even the most refined ones, cannot offer. Made by a handful of development team, Outward is the purest expression of the love of classic RPGs and at the same time is a spit in the face of electronic RPG in its most modern sense. In a strictly conceptual sense, the title of the Canadian Nine Dots Studio follows in the wake of the most radical trend of the genre, so much so that it immediately brings to mind series such as the Gothic one, or more recent titles such as Kingdom Come Deliverance and Elex. Impossibly angular, so much so that it literally rejects the occasional player, it expresses the best of itself precisely in its radicality, which on certain occasions reaches almost sublime peaks. The user takes on the role of a shipwreck survivor who, having returned to his village, must repay a blood debt incurred by his ancestors. The game is set in the world of Aurai, a harsh and dangerous land divided into ten regions (four of which are implemented in the game). Not even the time to recover from the tragedy that occurred at sea before we are forced to travel to recover a certain amount. The guided part of Outward ends here, in the sense that, net of the missions that are assigned to us, the game system leaves us free to do our research and proceed as we wish. Sure, some characters give us advice, while others give us directions on missions, but there's no other help whatsoever. In short, outside the village it's us against the wide world. Gameplay Open the map we discover that there are no indicators whatsoever to tell us where to go. We have to do everything ourselves, starting with orienting ourselves. We'll soon find out that this is a fundamental aspect of the gameplay, especially at night. In general, the game systems are well explained by the long tutorial, which introduces the use of the inventory, the development of the character, the combat with weapons and magic, the management of hunger, thirst and states (poisoning, tiredness, diseases and so on), but once they get on the field it's a whole other story. A few steps outside the city we meet a couple of bandits on patrol, who eliminate us without too much concern. Thus we discover that Outward is incredibly difficult and punishing. The only concession that is made to us is the absence of a real game over: when you are defeated, various events can happen, such as being transported to a camp, or to a sacred site, or even in the depths of a cave, deprived of equipment. If you think that in these cases Outward takes pity on the player, you are very wrong, because often you wake up in more dangerous places than those in which you lost consciousness and, obviously, it is easy to end up knocked out again. Sometimes you are transported to unknown places, without having the faintest idea of how to get out of the way. For example, we happened to have managed to escape from the clutches of a band of marauders, only to find ourselves wandering at night in an area never visited before, without being able to see any reference points to compare them with the little information shown on the map. In desperation we started walking around in the dark with a torch in hand and we were spotted by a pack of wolves, escaping from which we ended up in the jaws of a much bigger and more dangerous enemy, which we didn't even manage to manage at first. identify. Fast travel obviously isn't a solution, because it doesn't exist in Outward. Taking out a sleeping bag and sleeping until morning would have been smarter, except that we were in winter and it was bitterly cold: we needed to light a fire, but the camp kit was in the rucksack, which we had left marauders. The backpack deserves a few separate words, because it is one of the key elements of the gameplay: with limited capacity, it forces you to think a lot about managing what you find while exploring. Filling a backpack, even the biggest ones, isn't difficult, so you need to know exactly what you want to take, sacrificing everything else. Getting too heavy gives big malus in movement and in combat. It must be said that the backpack can be placed on the ground at any time, in order to gain agility, especially in dodging, but this makes it an asset that is easy to lose, therefore all the more precious. Over time, more capacious backpacks are acquired, but the tasks of micromanagement remain, especially in large dungeons. Consider that, coI already said, there is no fast travel, so you have to make your way every time on foot to go and sell what you find. Be that as it may, we confess to you that when we realized that after more than ten hours of play we had achieved little or nothing, but had died countless times, we let ourselves be taken by a strong discouragement. Nevertheless... Character life and death In Outward, the growth of the character takes place by talking to the classic masters, the only ones able to make us progress in skills. One of the most important elements to take into consideration is the limited life span of the protagonist who will inevitably end up dying. However, his skills will be passed on to his heirs, so as not to lose the progress made. Hardcore RPG Yet Outward has managed to call us back to itself, regardless of having to review it. Playing it turns out that it is a difficult title, not unfair and that, looking back all the way, we had discovered and learned something anyway. Meanwhile, we realized that the enemies did not level up with us, but were distributed more intelligently across the territories: the most remote dungeons generally house the strongest enemies. The player is guaranteed the freedom to go where he wants, at the price of being careless. We had also managed to go further and further, even if we hadn't realized it. The game scenario is so open that one of the first main missions requires you to go to the four corners of the game world to choose which of the four available factions to join: each faction will open up its own series of missions, making the games very different between They. The fundamental point, however, is not to carry out the quests, but the approach to the game world. In this sense Outward is more similar to Kenshi than to other role-playing games, given that having internalized the system we find ourselves wanting to wander off into an adventure without necessarily knowing where we are going, but just for the sake of finding out if the steep path that we're following leads to some mysterious place, perhaps filled with rare materials for crafting, or home to an ancient legendary weapon. The combat system itself seems to have come out of an action game, with attacks that change depending on the weapon being wielded and with special abilities, which can be called up at any time, linked to the weapon itself (to be developed separately). The enemies, especially the initial ones, lack a bit of feedback to our shots, but as the adventure continues, you get used to it and, when you have mastered the system well and start facing stronger enemies, there is no shortage of satisfaction, because one realizes how much one's experience counts in being able to win. You will have understood by now that Outward is a very pure role-playing game, which makes it all the more if played in cooperative with someone, its trump card: it is possible to do it online or via split screen, with the difficulty significantly increasing in each case, but with the addition of the ability to resurrect the fallen companion. Playing it with a friend who is passionate about RPGs can prove to be a truly rewarding experience, because the challenge requires very close collaboration, much more than in other titles. From a technical point of view, Outward certainly pays for its production level: as already mentioned, the development team is made up of a handful of people. Obviously it was not possible to increase the level of detail of such a large map with such a small number of graphics. Some areas therefore appear empty and lifeless, with few characterizing elements, while the creatures, human and otherwise, have few, often inaccurate animations. Of course, Outward isn't bought to put the graphics card through its paces: it doesn't claim to, and it simply can't. A few beautiful landscapes are occasionally encountered, but they are isolated moments in a sea of ugliness. Of course, the development team could compensate by making more radical stylistic choices to give a stronger personality to the game world, which as it stands is not only empty, but also insignificant. Better the dungeons, which evidently went the most care, but given the time you spend outside a little more attention would not have hurt.", "date": "2019-04-03", "grade": "6.5"}
