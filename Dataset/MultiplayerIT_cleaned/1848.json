Jokes aside, the latest generation 3D games are spectacular but unfortunately the definition that can be had with a still image is still to come (with Xbox anyway, times will be short!). The game goes on with still images and you move by clicking in the desired direction. Everything happens in a very static way, and it makes you turn up your nose, but for some it might not be a negative aspect; in fact everything is designed in a superlative way, but the whole thing has the air of a museum of paintings, so much so that the game seems like a kind of ~trip to the Louvre~ simulator. The main novelty implemented by the programmers compared to its predecessors is the possibility of looking around 360; this is to benefit the player during explorations, in order to locate the place to go or the object to examine and collect quickly enough. Shadows, reflections, transparencies, lights, drawings, objects, everything is designed to perfection so as to make it seem real. Each element, however, has its importance and can be an important clue or even decisive for solving a puzzle and moving forward in the adventure. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The little hand hangs...... A game for everyone, but not too much. In an age in which the video game is action, adrenaline, and ~tweaking~ on the pad, Myst cannot fail to bore anyone apart from fans of the genre. To play, just move the pad and the only key (the A key) that is used to go towards a road or examine or collect objects, and the analog stick will serve the purpose for 360  movement to give a wide view of the whole. The simplicity of the interface is undeniable, but terribly limited. Little interactivity, little action, few things to do, many to see anywaybut this is not Photoshop!

The soundtrack is perfectly in tune with what happens in the course of the story, resulting suggestive and evocative. However, this is the response of the team that had been criticized (the only criticism made at the time) regarding the sound sector of the first two episodes of the saga, accused of being musically unrelated to the setting. Unfortunately it is the only positive note that I feel like giving to the title. However, even if the interface and the game system are simple, Myst is not exactly easy to complete (did you have any doubts about it ?). To solve the adventure you will have to use all the gray matter in your possession. Frustrating element in this episode though: while in the previous episodes everything was very difficult to solve, at least with logic it was possible to arrive at the solution; in this third episode, however, some puzzles are solved at random, and many times by pure luck. At times, clues have been implemented that pass between the absurd and the visionary, logic in truth is not exactly what will be needed to keep you going. The indispensable tools are the various books and diaries that can be found wandering here and there. However, solving a puzzle brings half satisfaction, so much so that you won't know if you're a genius or just born with a shirt. The game is completely in Italian, including audio and instructions. The translation is well done and also the interpretation of the voice actors is not affected by particular defects. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Final comment. A game must amuse, excite, and the beauty of a video gamer is having the feeling of ~living~ a video game, to the end. Myst III Exile unfortunately fails in its intent as its first two episodes succeeded, either because it is a purely PC user title, or because times have changed, or because of its difficulty..... it will certainly involve lovers of the series, but in this case they will be more intrigued by how the story will end, rather than immerse themselves in the actual game. Instead, those approaching this type of game for the first time may have hysterical crises and find it frustrating not being able to solve the puzzles proposed to them. At this point you just have to read the solution or continue to insist, but in eachcase, I bring to the reflection on the purchase especially the newbies, the lovers of the genre and of the saga maybe, they will appreciate it much more. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The incredible thing about Myst and which decreed its past success, was that you didn't need an ultra-powerful computer to play it: it was nothing more than a set of static images, sound and ~point and click~ with the mouse (now this is the term to define the genre of this type of game). Yet it managed to sell a lot despite the presence of products with a high graphic and interactive level. This is because Myst had a thick storyline capable of making a game an incredibly captivating and fulfilling experience. Then followed Riven, who had much approval, if not more, than his predecessor ...... but things (fortunately, or unfortunately, it depends on the point of view) are changing. A bit of history Atrus is the main character of the entire Myst series, descended from an ancient dynasty of powerful wizards, the D'ni, who possess the ability to create worlds called Epochs. The D'ni write on a book the characteristics of the world they want to create and the book itself, loaded with their power, functions as a gateway to reach the created universe. The adventures narrated in Myst III Exile follow what is narrated in Riven by ten years. Atrus decides to look for traces of the D'ni who are trying to re-found their society. But as always there is someone who has to break the eggs in the basket and so a guy who is not exactly a friend, who has seen his goals and purposes damaged by Atrus' son, seeks his revenge. It's up to you to ensure that the situation does not fall into total chaos by traveling in five extremely different eras but united by the same charm.", "date": "2002-12-28", "grade": null}
