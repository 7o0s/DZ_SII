{"name": "Sonic Adventure 2 Battle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-adventure-2-battle-2.html", "text": "Cubed porcupine Skipping the versions that appeared for other consoles (Master System, Game Gear and Neo Geo Pocket Color), we arrive at the year 1998, the year of the 3D debut of the saga (Sonic Adventure) on the unfortunate and very valid 128-bit console of Sega, that mistreated Dreamcast that last year, for the tenth anniversary of the saga, gave birth to the controversial but damn trippy Sonic Adventure 2 which has now landed on Nintendo's Gamecube (with the suffix ~Battle~). Finally after a decade of struggle between Nintendari and Segaioli (no joke, thanks nd Latin), the 2 mascots are united in a single hardware, the 128 bit Nintendo. How did the Sonic Team fare in its first game (and conversion) for our beloved cubozzo? Well.but not too much. Heroes and baddies The Sonic saga debuted with only Sonic and Robotnik, the first protagonist and the second bad guy, who were gradually joined by other characters, now famous, such as Tails (Sonic's inseparable friend), Knuckles (our rival beloved porcupine) and Amy (girlfriend of our hero or at least she considers herself so). In the first three-dimensional episode of the saga, Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast, all these characters became controllable, each with its own specific skills and attitudes. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle continues the path taken by the Sonic Team, but with significant changes: at the beginning of the game you can choose to play with the heroes (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles) or with the villains (Robotnik, Rogue and Shadow, the rival Sonic's turn); once the choice has been made, the storyline will put you in the shoes of these characters to give life to the events of this new chapter in the Sonic saga, inhibiting the possibility of choosing individual characters, given that, for example, if you choose to play with the coupons, it will start with a fully fit Sonic, continuing with Knuckles, then Tails and so on. One of the most discussed novelties of this episode, appreciated by most, criticized by the minority, is the partial distortion of the gameplay; if with Sonic and Shadow you have to go through the various levels at high speed, collecting as many rings as possible, jumping on enemies, performing loops of death at supersonic speed, with Ivo Robotnik and Tails you find yourself driving automatons, destroying all enemies in your path, between one jump and another; with Rogue and Knuckles instead you will take part in a real treasure hunt, looking for diamonds, keys and more using radar. When we are close to the objective, the radar will warn us by flashing, it is up to us to fly, dig underground or carry out any other action that allows us to carry out the discovery in question. If all this were not enough for you, it is possible to replay all the levels individually as you pass to try to solve them as quickly as possible and with the greatest number of rings that the gamer will be able to bring with him. Heroes and baddies A very interesting peculiarity is the one that allows Gamecube to be linked to the Game Boy Advance portable console, subject to possession of the link cable and the Sonic Advance cartridge (excellent but with a somewhat reduced longevity), available for the 32 bit Nintendo. Basically, in the Chao Garden, you can deposit the little creature you are raising, caring for and entertaining (with go-kart races or karate matches) on the Game Boy Advance on the 128-bit Nintendo, continuing to take care of it, educate it, make it eat and more wherever you are. If all this is still not enough for you, the Gamecube mode also has other new features, in the form of a game mode for 2 players, via split screen. You will be able to challenge another opponent in the flesh in competitions of speed, treasure hunting and challenges based on hardened blasting, which are the main modes of the single game. Sonic Team deserves applause for the Gamecube-Game Boy Advance connectivity, the inclusion of multiplayer modes but unfortunately some fans of the series did not like the upheavals in the gameplay; if it is true that the levels with Sonic and Shadow do not deviate from the canons of the saga, in the stages of Tails and Robotnik we are faced with a disarming simplicity (turn towards an enemy, frame him and launch a homing missile), as opposed to the annoyance that many have tried in the search levels of certain items by Knuckles and Rogue, capable of hovering in flight and clinging to the walls. An absolutely heterogeneous gameplay therefore, which could make people turn up their noses or, on the contrary, exalt Sonic fans more; whoever writes these lines has found the levels of the echidna and thebat, boring and devoid of bite those blasters and.. frenetic, as always, those with Sonic and Shadow, perhaps our hero's most apt enemy ever. Graphics Sonic Adventure 2 Battle will certainly not be the game with the most beautiful graphics seen on the Gamecube but it certainly does not go totally unnoticed, although the conversion from Dreamcast is slavish: sixty frames per second (after pressing the ~B~ key in the boot-up initial) remain nailed without any hesitation (not even with the split screen in multiplayer mode), despite the presence of super fast porcupines, ramps, crates to be destroyed, big robots armed to the teeth, seagulls fluttering happily in the sky, little butterflies that settle on flowers, Chao who can't wait to be bred and fighter fighters who will do nothing but fill you with missiles, all at a speed that is nothing short of stratospheric (except in the levels with Robotnik and Tails, deputies for purely blazing action). Graphics From Dreamcast, unfortunately, also the presence of pop-ups is inherited which certainly does not make a good impression on the Nintendo cube, like explosions, in late 2002, a bit antiquated, in terms of construction and a polygon count which it could, however, be slightly more massive without undue effort. Progressive Scan, a few unpublished side elements, some brand new special effects and others slightly revised complete the series of cosmetic innovations for the 128 bit Nintendo. What unfortunately remains in this very faithful (even too much) conversion, however, is the camera system, decidedly drunk, given that many times you will lose sight of your alter ego, with consequent loss of precious lives and time (especially in the levels with Knuckles and rogue). Sound One of the flagships of the Sonic saga is obviously the musical side, right from the progenitor on Sega Megadrive (the Sonic Cd soundtrack is unforgettable, on the add on Mega Cd) and, once again, Sonic Team has hit the target; almost all of the music is worthy of ending up in the box to listen to on the car radio, given that we are talking about simply beautiful rock, hip hop and new age songs, accompanied by truly tripping choirs and lyrics (the initial level of Sonic, the Pumpkin zone of Knuckles , etc). In the game there are both the dubbing in Japanese (the same voice actors already heard in the prequel on the Dreamcast) and in a more understandable Yankee, both of an excellent level, although the majority of purists, like myself, will opt for the Sol language Levant and subtitles in the Albion language. Sound This overview closes on the extreme enjoyment for our ears, the vast range of sound effects that every Sonic fan knows perfectly (especially when we pass on the rings to collect) and that could never be separated from them. Conclusions Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is ultimately an excellent video game but far from perfect: graphically it is at just sufficient levels, taking into account the potential of the ATI video chip, the music, indeed, the sound sector, in its entirety, is Grammy award-winning, the unpublished multiplayer modes add a pinch of fun to a game which however risks dividing the fans of the fastest hedgehog in the world, given that the nature of the saga has been partially suffocated by virtue of some styles of play that would have deserved better treatment ( ridiculous the shooter levels, a little bit boring, after a few times, the exploration and research ones). Thumbs up for the replayability of the title, to ad hoc complete the individual outdated levels and for the interaction with the Game Boy Advance for Chao breeding. Ultimately, an excellent game, however far from perfect and which could be harmful to the most ardent fans of the series, even if fortunately the majority of the public appreciated the upheavals made by Yuji Naka's Sonic Team. Pros: Fast-paced and fun various gameplay styles in one unedited multiplayer mode Exceptionally well-crafted audio Cons: Outdated Gamecube graphics May not appeal to all Sonic fans Cubed porcupine In the summer of 1991, Sega released on the then best-selling Sega Megadrive, the first 16-bit console in history, Sonic The Hedgehog, a famous platformer that, together with Nintendo's Mario, would have made the platform game school. Unlike the mustachioed plumber invented by Shigeru Miyamoto, capable of flying, swimming, collecting shells, riding dinosaurs, theporcupine created by Yuji Naka, Sonic Team guru, emphasized the speed element beyond belief: the most splashy videogame brand ever was born, an action game based mainly on the speed with which Sonic could cross the various game levels in charge, between loops, bouncing worthy of the best pinball machine and dozens of enemies to jump on to send them back to the sender, or rather Dr Eggman (in the West Ivo Robotnik), true nemesis of our hero, in the same way as that Bowser who so many headaches continues to create, still, to Mario (and Luigi). Unlike the competing franchise, capable of surprising with each episode released, the Sonic saga has often been the subject of more or less legitimate criticism, such as the scarce innovations perpetrated in the sequel (the only fox Miles ~Tails~ Prower), the low longevity of the third episode and the fourth (Sonic & Knuckles), although these last two episodes should be understood as a historical unicum for the videogame world: the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge allowed you to enjoy some game differences if ~linked~ to the Sonic cartridge 2, 3 and the spin-off Sonic Spinball, without forgetting the introduction of one of the most successful characters in the series, Knuckles, the echidna.", "date": "2002-05-28", "grade": null}
