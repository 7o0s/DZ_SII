{"name": "MotoGP 15", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152421-motogp-15-gomiti-a-terra.html", "text": "If there is a problem intimately connected to the nature of annual titles, for developers it is undoubtedly the need to make their creature fresh and innovative with each new iteration, a goal which, however, all too often gets out of hand, especially way when a sensitive evolutionary step is followed by years of relative laxity. Just think of what happened with the sagas of Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Lego and Fifa, just to name a few of the most famous and commercially successful. Sports and racing are genres particularly exposed to the aforementioned dynamics, and the ~reskin~ risk, or that of proposing a very expensive expansion with only updated squads and liveries, is always around the corner. Starting from these assumptions, we approached Milestone's MotoGP 15 with curiosity and a pinch of apprehension, especially in light of the promotional material released by the Milanese software house to date, which did not suggest substantial steps forward compared to the previous iteration. We put it to the whip on our PlayStation 4 and this is what we think of it. Some news and a lot of conservation in the new racing dedicated to the Moto GP My team Among the main innovations introduced in MotoGP 15 we find a partially evolved career mode, where private teams peep out for the first time, the so-called GP Credits and more in-depth customization. The general framework is practically the same as last year, both from the point of view of rider growth, who starting from the Wild Card in Moto 3 aims for the top of the standings in the premier class, and from that of the organization in the motorhome, with the The inevitable touch screen for consulting e-mails and news, the calendar for managing individual Grands Prix, the video monitor and the driver's dressing room. The substantial difference lies in the fact that we will also be able to have direct contact with the sponsors, necessary to finance our private team which can be customized from various points of view. Beyond the logo and the name, in fact, you can put your hands on the livery of the bike directly, with about forty pre-set designs to vary thanks to a handy tone editor. The GP Credits won in the race can be spent both to buy new licensed racing cars (over twenty models including Moto 3, Moto 2 and Moto GP) and liveries, while by leveling up with experience new gloves, helmets and boots become accessible . The selection is obviously not comparable to that of RIDE, but allows a good degree of customization especially for those who are committed to unlocking everything. As far as the profile of the driver is concerned, it is possible to choose an identification photograph, the initials, the nickname, the race number and the driving style, which ranges from Balanced to the so-called Old School, passing through Elbows on the ground, Shoulders out and Body out . However, the innovations introduced in the career do not change the substance of what was already experienced last year, and the sense of dj vu is also magnified by the substantial recycling of assets and by the practically unchanged interface windows. Overall, however, it is a good, long-lasting and rewarding career that will certainly excite and amuse fans of the world championship. Among the accessory modes for single player we find Instant Race, Grand Prix and Custom Championship, Time Trial and above all Special Events, which this year has a couple of interesting introductions. In addition to the Real Events relating to 2014, in which we will be able to relive (and if necessary overturn) the key moments of last season, such as for example the spectacular exploit of Andrea Iannone at Mugello in the start of the race, in Beat the Time it is necessary to beat a time with specific bikes and conditions, while in 2-stroke events we will be engaged in eighteen challenges impersonating riders like Mick Doohan, Max Biaggi, Loris Capirossi and Carlos Checa aboard the racing cars that have made the history of this specific engine. The game also features riders from the 2014 season of Moto 3, Moto 2 and Moto GP. As far as multiplayer modes are concerned, we find the shared screen for two players, always welcome, and an online compartment that supports up to twelve players at the same time. The options can be superimposed on those seen in the past season, given that it is possible to access quick matches, create personalized sessions and participate in the so-called ~Sprint Season~, with promotions and relegations like those introduced in the Fifa leagues. During our tests we didn't suffer any lag problems and the netocode was solid; the only real flaws residedor in a rather dated conception of lobbies, with the need to go out and recreate the room if you want to make certain changes, and in having associated an annoying white window with the click of the left analog stick, which all too often is pressed involuntarily during the guide. Playstation 4 trophies MotoGP 15 offers 47 trophies, of which 35 are bronze, 8 silver, 3 gold and one platinum, which is unlocked by winning all the other trophies. Most of the basic objectives are related to winning a race with a specific team or class, but there are also rewards dedicated to online sessions, reaching certain speeds and signing contracts. Among the silver trophies, those relating to the Event modes and Pro physics stand out, while to win the three gold ones it is necessary to unlock all the riders in the game, become world champion in MotoGP and accumulate a certain number of kilometers on the track. In hull If you have played MotoGP 14 thoroughly, do not expect a substantial evolution in gameplay, since the dynamic simulation model has been refined and updated with new algorithms, but the yield does not differ significantly from the results (however good) already obtained last year. However, the influence of RIDE is felt in some of the new animations, furthermore the PRO physics are even more difficult and satisfying to master, with a more nervous and faithful response of the bike, between unseating and very violent slamming if the brakes and accelerator are not managed carefully especially out of corners. The effects obviously appear clearer by disabling the TCS (traction control) and on board the very powerful Moto GP bikes, for which it is necessary to practice a lot and carefully learn the trajectories of the various tracks. The Standard and Semi Pro physics, in association with the possibility of having joint brakes and automatic management of the rider's position in the hull, as well as the ideal trajectory, brake and assisted steering, make the driving model quite scalable and suitable to a wide range of players, without ever resulting in the superficial. The artificial intelligence is always competitive and offers a good level of challenge even at the intermediate difficulty, although it should be emphasized that the behavior is sometimes not very attentive and reactive towards the motorcycle controlled by the player, with often harmful consequences. The collision physics does not differ from what has already been seen in RIDE and in the previous iteration of Moto GP, although it is embellished with some more pleasant and less woody animations. Unfortunately for the console versions of the game, the 30 frames per second was once again opted for, a value which, as is widely known, in a simulation-style racing impact on the sensitivity and precision in the response to the commands. On the technical front we are practically faced with a ~more of the same~ of the previous chapter, characterized by some highs and several lows both in the rendering of the effects and of the circuits. While on the one hand we find several flat and low resolution textures, as well as circuits not quite up to current standards, such as Losail at night, Catalunya and the Termas de Rio Hondo track in Argentina, on the other there are good models of the bikes, some interesting shaders and more detailed and visually pleasing tracks, such as Sachsenring, Austin and Sepang. The rain effect is discreet even with the internal views, although the accumulations of water on the road surface are rendered with decidedly little netxgen results. As far as the audio sector is concerned, we point out the return of the appreciated Guido Meda to the technical commentary before and after the race, while the roar of the motorbikes presents samples with ups and downs based on the model and class.", "date": "2015-06-29", "grade": "7.2"}
