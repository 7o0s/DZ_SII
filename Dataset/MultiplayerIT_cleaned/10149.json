The great title or at least an exponent of the genre capable of fully satisfying the expectations of its millions of users has always been missing. Fortunately, things are changing and after a long period of stalemate in the production of role-playing video games for this console, the situation finally seems to be moving in recent times. Proof of this is that many RPGs, especially of a Japanese nature, have arrived in recent months and will arrive in Asia, the USA and Europe, above all the highly anticipated Final Fantasy XIII by Square Enix. Among the products most awaited by the public, in this case Western, there is also White Knight Chronicles, exclusive PlayStation 3 that has made players from all over the world suffer so much in recent months mainly due to the fluctuating judgments and comments received from insiders Asians who reviewed it. If in fact the premises had been highly encouraging since the first appearances in videos and photos of the game, especially considering that the team behind this production, Level 5, boast interesting titles on their curriculum such as Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King and Rogue Galaxy for Playtation 2, the criticism by Famitsu who gave him a dry 29/40 had in fact scared the fans. However, at the end of last year, the sales data report thought about it to lift the spirits of the latter a little: as of December 31, 2009 White Knight Chronicles had recorded the decent figure of 360,000 units sold in Japan. Which is no small thing for a title that, according to what was said above, had received bad marks in the reviews. But then, how is this latest effort of Level 5? Let's find out together. Princesses in danger The game actually doesn't seem to be very original in the first stages, with a plot that seems to heavily abuse the usual clichs of the genre. In the kingdom of Balandor, Princess Cisna, who hasn't spoken for years due to the trauma of having witnessed her mother's murder, is about to be kidnapped during a ceremony that will serve to introduce her into society for her eighteenth birthday as well as establish peace between his people and that of the kingdom of Faria of the obnoxious archduke Dalam, from the usual organization that wants to destabilize everything called Magi. However, a young vintner's boy named Leonard manages to grab the girl's hand and drag her away towards the castle cellars and the treasure room. Here at one point the boy comes across a strange artifact capable of transforming anyone who wears it into a white knight, an ancient, enormous, spotless and fearless warrior with devastating strength. The armor of this hero is very reminiscent of those of medieval knights but with a futuristic touch to the Gundam. However, the gamer does not directly impersonate the protagonist, Leonard, but a sort of his apprentice assistant hired by Mr. Rapacci, the young hero's boss, who will then accompany him for the rest of the adventure. In short, an avatar built from scratch using an excellent editor. With it you can create your own virtual alter ego by working on numerous details such as eyelashes and eyebrows, chin spacing, eye shape, weight and even facial expressions or cheering sentences. All while maintaining that typically Japanese style of character design that fans of the genre like so much. However, it should be noted that at any moment of the adventure, both during the exploratory phases and in the fights, it is possible to easily switch from one PC to another without problems. MMORPGs White Knight Chronicles is the classic role-playing game with a third-person view and with a free camera that can be controlled using the right analog, in which, following the indications given by the plot, you have to explore cities, dungeons and outdoor areas, talk to NPCs , gain experience points, level-up, and get stronger as you acquire new weapons and abilities. Instead, the thing that differentiates this production from the others is the battle-system, which implements a system based halfway between a classic J-RPG and an MMORPG, and the online one, which we will analyze later. Without forgetting the increase in content compared to the original Japanese for the western edition, such as new quests for online play and the implementation of some controls such as automatic running or voice chat. But let's proceed in order and for now let's focus on the first element mentioned. The combat system takes place in real time and in some ways is very reminiscent of that of Finto Fantasy XII while retaining some element of those in turns. The enemies are clearly visible on the screen and come in various types, from those who have a ~neutral~ attitude to others who attack on sight. Once you come into contact with them, the fight begins without transitions in the battlefield. The control in this case is focused only on one character at a time (but it is possible to change it at any time, as mentioned before) while the CPU takes care of the others. However, before each fight directly from the options menu, or during, by pressing the L3 key, they can be given the type of attitude that they will have to maintain for the entire duration of the fight: in this way the partner is ordered to give priority to one action rather than another (heal the party, defend, etc). Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty-four Trophies available in White Knight Chronicles. They are divided into 8 Bronze, 7 Silver, 8 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain the prizes it will be necessary to complete the various challenges proposed by the game, such as that of collecting fifty pieces of equipment, or that of killing from 3,000 to 10,000 monsters (the Trophy in the first case will be Silver, in the second Gold) or even maxing out the skills for eight sets of weapons. Battles Interesting is the option that allows the gamer to create custom combos with different types of attack to save and recall quickly during the clashes a bit like the Macros of Final Fantasy XI. Even if they are expensive to use in terms of turns, action points and MPs, and not always necessary. The actions of the hero maneuvered by the user are determined by a circular time bar which indicates the moment in which it is possible for him to act: once filled, it allows him to perform an attack in relation to the equipped weapon and the level of experience achieved. These elements, together with spells, special abilities, objects, etc. can be recalled in battle via the bar divided into slots at the bottom of the screen, where the relative commands are housed. After that you have to wait for the gauge to fill up again. In these situations, however, it is possible to move on the playing field within certain limits, perhaps changing objectives with L1 or working with the directional cross to choose the next moves. At the right moment some of the main characters can transform into a Knight, a being about seven meters tall, armored and very powerful. This change in knight requires several action points, so, given the slowness with which they recover in game, it becomes advisable to economize their use and learn to manage them well. After defeating enemies, players get classic rewards. Some of these are found in both story and online modes, others only in the second and are used to upgrade weapons, items and equipment. And experience points. The progression of the characters is marked by the classic levels, upon reaching which skill points are unlocked which can be spent to unlock new features through a sort of table with spheres within which it is possible to learn new skills, more than fifty, for each type of class. are new skills, more than fifty, for each type of class. Multiplayer, GeoNet and Georama White Knight Chronicles includes an online multiplayer mode which in our opinion is the real strong point of the title: from each save point, after a few hours of play, you have access to GeoNet, the Network created by Level 5 specifically for the game from where it is possible to do practically everything. It works almost like a real social networking service. In fact, players can create their own personal profile, keep blogs and comment on those of others, take part in a forum, send and receive e-mails, manage lists of friends, organize online matches and enlist fellow venturers to complete sub- quest. Perhaps by meeting as a clan in their own virtual village. Georama, the second option for network play, in fact, allows users to create their own city with the function of a lobby by customizing every aspect, from houses to shops, from natural terrain obstacles to non-player characters to populate the area. Each of the latter can be recruited from one of the cities present in the offline adventure and considering that these NPCs will also maintain the same types of work and specific skills that characterize them in the web village, they will affect the type of materials and items that will be available in the georama. Also in this mode up to a maximum of twelve users can visit the area and three of them can join withthe host user to form a party with which to go on missions. In these sub-quests (third option for online) players can maintain the same stats of their character achieved in Story Mode, including level and equipment. In addition, they can take advantage of one of the absolute novelties present in the western versions of the game, that is, support for vocal communication on microphone and headset, or USB keyboards for textual communication. Technical realization But there are many things you can do on the web, even exchanging what you produce with other users, using the proceeds to unlock new buildings and increase the production of your city's shops. This game mode is also extended to American users as well as European ones and it must be said that, apart from some occasional small lag, in most cases the servers behaved well when we played it. From a technical point of view, it is unfortunately noted that White Knight Chronicles is a stylistically outdated game compared to the competition. While falling into that category of titles that enjoy great care and size, with rather long and detailed interlude sequences and a vast game map, the product has textures that appear too dated, flat, with the polygonal models of the characters reminiscent of those of Shadow Hearts 2 for PlayStation 2, scenarios that are often not very detailed and rather repetitive, to the point of in some cases suggesting that in some areas the environments are recycled, as well as an annoying aliasing whose presence is quite marked. Despite all this, however, believe us if we tell you that the overall aesthetic result is not bad. Often in some titles it is the general visual impact that compensates for certain gaps, and this is what happens in this case, with colorful and atmospheric settings. The design of the knights is also splendid. As far as the audio is concerned, however, there is a certain asynchrony between the speech in English and the lips of the characters, a good soundtrack with songs typically from Japanese role-playing games and a sampling of voices, sounds, ad hoc effects that are good they match the type of game.", "date": "2010-03-12", "grade": "7.0"}
