We won't tire your eyelids with tons of historical notions, but you must know that the title was born as a flash game. Yes, the die seemed cast when Ronimo Games, with a leap of personality, decided to try his luck on WiiWare; a service similar to a baby in swaddling clothes if compared to the competition but capable of wittily attracting small pearls of the independent world. Destiny saw it by force of the market become multi-platform, but this is not the paradox we want to tell you about: what amazed us is finding ourselves today to note the Wii U exclusivity of this sequel. Storm? Maybe yes, but at least allow us to smile in the face of the jokes of a fate that would too easily assign the exclusive dress to many other videogame installers but instead not. Luck is being tried on the Kyoto flagship which, although it is not making inroads into the players' homes as much as it deserves, is still enriching its retail and digital library in an impeccable way. And today a little more valid thanks to the support of Ronimo Games. Swords & Soldiers II is an excellent strategy game with great additions, too bad the tutorial is too long! From North to south Time has passed since the first Swords & Soldiers, now Ronimo Games has its own headquarters and the kids have grown up, and a lot, but not only them: Sword & Soldiers II is the result of the maturation of an experience that always remains bite-y - run away, but it is more complete, classy. The greatest production values are seen from the first moment in which the splendid hand-drawn dynamic and static elements are revealed in high definition and this time - finally - in a native way, without being replaced by ports and re-editions. Vikings? Exactly, precisely those cuckolds who don't care about false history and run around in a fantasy epic between Persians and demons of hell. The biggest change is related to the factions of the main quest: there will be only one army to support in history. If the first chapter had accustomed us to a narrative with watertight compartments in which to forcibly propose a path between peoples, this is not the case in the sequel and Redbeard, the Viking commander who will accompany you along the 25 levels, is proof of this. The search for an artifact is an evergreen and Ronimo Games does not forget its roots by serving lines of dialogue which, although in not exactly immediate English, are tasty and cheerful. A bit like the artistic style adopted, pleasant and light but not poor in details. Gamepads Mandatory in campaign, secondary screen in offline multiplayer. The choice is yours whether to take advantage of a key-based control system or whether to hold the stylus and indulge yourself with the touch. A good use that goes well with an even more flexible overall interface. Many pads, two sizes Sword & Soldiers II remains faithful to its predecessor: a 2D strategy game in which the emphasis is on the accumulation of gold and magic resources with which to study, build and fire spells. Ronimo Games spice it up by drawing inspiration from the sacred monsters of the genre, inserting a sort of champions in the list, unique personalities with their own peculiar ability. The rest is known: each unit, once created, will begin the advance without the possibility of stopping but at least we will be able to decide whether to make it go above or below a passage, by activating the exchange lever. A small gimmick that adds interest in studying the best path, perhaps the fastest, to reach the goal which is almost always the destruction of the enemy stronghold. The GamePad is a mandatory accessory but it performs well, mostly we don't understand why allowing you to choose between normal and touch controls and then, in the end, not enabling the Pro Controller for the single player campaign. The interface is very different from Swords & Soldiers: no more icons to click on the GamePad, this time it is the backbones that activate the army and spell grid in which to navigate using the sticks. Comfortable, we must say, capable of absolutely not making us regret the nib. Also because by doing so we can look at the panel in the living room and enjoy all the excellent technical sector, which is impossible to do with the port from a year ago. On the other hand, the multiplayer implementation is excellent: excluding the Skirmish mode in which to train with the armies in various arenas, the title allows two players to challenge each other - always and rigorously - offline. One uses the GamePad, the other the TV: a nice find that restores full dignity to the Wii U symbol controller without weighing on performance, guaranteeing qhence a well packaged experience. I'll explain It's up to you to judge whether or not it's a problem, but in our view, the team has structured the campaign too forcefully in a sort of tutorial in the making, adding for the first half a succession of slightly guided battles. We have to be honest, the hand-holding sensation is not strong but an expert user of the mechanics might not appreciate the excessive design emphasis that leads the game to supply the troops one piece at a time - and related strategies to win - and not vice versa . Annoyance never exceeds the tolerance bar and the conquest of the two extra medals in each mission still leads the player to review everything in the true hardcore reading key required; however, it is as if the standard advancement were a sort of easy mode and the real feedback is structured to arrive only from satisfying the additional objectives, often real thorns in the side in terms of difficulty. Could it be Ronimo's way of embracing a wider and less tolerant audience? We are not here to dictate the design law, but getting to the Persian section, a good 40% of the campaign, and still finding tutorials on new moves and new units, seemed to us to impoverish the advancement and make it more of a skillfully guided vein than anything else , not allowing to acclimatize except in the advanced stages. The additional objectives are another matter: the strategies to be adopted make them real quality trials and errors in which to study the map, facets and units available with the utmost care. Let's be honest: that of the extra medals is certainly the most galvanizing and rewarding part of the entire single-player game, capable of giving even the most skilled veteran a hard time.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "8.3"}
