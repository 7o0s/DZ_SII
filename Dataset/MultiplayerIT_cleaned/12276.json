{"name": "Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puzzle-quest-challenge-of-the-warlords-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time in Etheria The assumptions from which Puzzle Quest takes hold are of a purely classic RPG matrix, the main mode of the game is the one that follows the trend of the narrated events: the kingdom of Bartonia, the birthplace of the protagonist, is grappling with an unusual and inexplicable invasion of undead, the hero will leave his kingdom to travel the lands of Etheria in search of the strain of this plague, surrounding himself with friends and fighting grueling battles. The first step to join the adventure is to choose your name, appearance and - above all - the class you want to play with. The player has the opportunity to pursue a career as a druid, knight, warrior and wizard, bearing in mind that each class - as in all RPGs from the beginning of the world - has particular characteristics that manifest themselves both in terms of equip that combat capabilities. The world of Etheria is represented with a view from above, slightly squashed towards the bottom to favor greater visibility of the map and above all a semi-three-dimensionality of the miniaturized cities. Movements between one stage and another within this world are indicated by a continuous line which indicates to the player in which direction it is possible to move and connects - as one progresses in the game - all the locations visited through a dense network of paths where it is possible to take part in random fights, always signaled by the presence of enemies along the way. Cities ~play~ an absolutely central role during the game: in fact, these are the only points where you can interact with a series of useful options for looking for new quests to tackle, buying items to use as equipment, visiting taverns in search of particular runner entries and improve their skills. The adventure unfolds along a main quest (indicated with a different color than the others), and a multitude of sub-quests useful for increasing your character's characteristics, acquiring particular items or looking for new allies. As you progress in the game, the possibilities offered by Puzzle Quest grow exponentially: the player can simply limit himself to following the main quest and thus get to the end of the game, but the true potential of the title shows itself when you start to use all the extra features that enrich it. By interacting with Bartonia, the city to which the protagonist belongs, it is possible to expand and improve the city's resources by spending your own money for the creation of stables, forges, temples, towers and much more. Each of these elements effectively expands the gaming experience: the possibility of capturing a mount (and subsequently leveling it up) is unlocked through the stables, with the towers the possibility of fighting and besieging another city ( by defeating it, you add it to your kingdom, ~forcing~ its citizens to pay taxes), and through the temple you learn new spells and skills. However, one of the elements that is probably the most distorted with respect to the canons of role-playing games is that linked to one's own party: in fact, during the adventure it is possible to ~recruit~ new travel companions but these can never be used directly, limiting themselves to providing background special skills and characteristic boosts able to facilitate clashes. An entire paragraph has passed and still no word has been said about the element that recalls Bejeweled, this is because Infinite Interactive have succeeded in merging and keeping the RPG and puzzle game elements separate at the same time. As the previous paragraph has sketched, the setting and the ancillary mechanics of the game are fully based on what is a classic RPG structure, with the four classes of heroes, a kingdom to save and all the rest. What makes Puzzle Quest out of the ordinary is the fact that the battles are not fought with swords and magic: the fight is a clash of brains and strategy in which the small colored spheres are the masters which, if paired correctly disappear to make room for others. The rules that underlie games like Bejeweled (or Zoo Keeper, in case the first doesn't say anything) are practically universally known: the aim is to eliminate the elements in play by uniting them (in minimum groups of 3) by color, where in the case of eliminations of 4 elements the player is given an extra turn and for eliminations of 5 he is also rewarded with a particular ~universal~ object that can be coupled to any element in play. Of course, the winner is whoever empties completely firstmind the opponent's energy bar. Going back to Puzzle Quest, the opponent is challenged on a special board (common to both sides) filled with colored spheres (red, blue, yellow and green) which, if destroyed, fill up the player's mana bar, which this point can use a series of offensive and defensive spells, or simply status alterations useful to embarrass the enemy; the real fulcrum of the challenge, however, is represented by the skulls inserted between the spheres, in fact these elements are the only ones that can give the player the possibility of directly hitting the opponent, going to ~empty~ his energy bar. The counting of the objects on the board is also completed by a particular purple star which, if paired and destroyed, increases the experience of the protagonist (like any rpg, the level is increased by reaching a certain amount of experience won on the field) and finally the coins, which in the same way as experience are used to increase the cash loot. The rpg world that merges with that of puzzle games is reflected in a whole series of parameters of vital importance during the battle The rpg world that merges with that of puzzle games is reflected in a whole series of parameters of vital importance during the battle: the protagonist's class ensures him particular moves to be used in exchange for collecting a certain number of mana spheres, the equip directly modify the player's abilities during the battle (for example, by wearing some particular objects it is possible to increase the chances of obtaining extra turns even after simple eliminations), the capture of certain monsters -only possible after having built a prison in Bartonia- they give the player new moves to cripple his opponent. Just as the fights are based on matching gems and skulls, all the other game situations that imply a certain level of ~skill~ are also based on these rules suitably modified according to the assigned task. In short, when you decide to capture a mount, to do so you just need to take part in a special combat stage in which the only task is to make all the elements inserted in it disappear from the screen (the difficulty lies in fact that there is one and only way to clear the screen, a kind of puzzle). To forge new objects, in addition to the presence of suitable materials in his inventory, the player will play within a particular stage with the aim of destroying a certain number of spheres useful for the creation of the required item. If the experience of the main quest weren't enough, for players there is the possibility of taking part in the ~Instant Action Battles~, battles outside the main story that have no other pretext than that of a quick elimination challenge of spheres. The multiplayer works in the same way, which allows two players in possession of the title to challenge each other on the game board, using their own character created for the story mode, complete with equipment and all. Graphically without infamy and without praise, Puzzle Quest bases its strength on the incredible vastness of the proposed world, on the large number of quests capable of making the gaming experience decidedly long-lasting and above all on a bizarre, innovative and certainly long-lasting gameplay additive. The sound sector is probably the most subdued element of the title by far, not so much for the quality of the proposed songs - decidedly catchy, very ~epic~ and suitable for the format - as for their actual quantity and repetitiveness. In closing, the only real negative note of the game is represented by the absence of any language other than English: a barrier that -especially because of the deep structure of the rpg- often proves to be insurmountable for many users not too accustomed to using a foreign language. Puzzle Quest bases its strength on the incredible vastness of the proposed world, on the large number of quests capable of making the gaming experience decidedly long-lasting and above all on a bizarre, innovative and certainly additive gameplay DS Vs. PSP Nintendo DS and Sony PSP are the platforms that host Puzzle Quest, and although they are different in terms of hardware and game settings, they don't differ much from each other. PSP guarantees a better graphic rendering and -surprisingly- a better setting of the control windows both in the exploration phases of the world of Etheria and in those of combat. The DS despite having the practicality of the double screen on its side cannot find its quadrature of the control windows forwhere finding information is often decidedly longer and more cumbersome; the DS nib stands out as a much more accessible element than the PSP analogue but inexplicably less precise. For everything else, the games are to be considered absolutely identical: same options, same quests, same multiplayer mode (in both cases two people with two copies of the game are needed). The choice of platform remains a matter of hardware availability, in case you own both the PSP version has half an extra gear. There is little to say: Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords is a wonderful surprise. Infinite Interactive has succeeded in the enterprise of merging two genres commonly considered as on parallel tracks and does it in the best possible way: with intelligence, with a product with attention to all aspects, faithful to the stylistic features of both types and above all long-lived and fun . If Puzzle Quest ever has a sequel, some weak points will have to be filed (see the sound sector and the not excellent graphic characterization) but what is most important for a video game - the gameplay - is there. Absolutely. Pros: Original gameplay. Long-lived and additive. Incredibly deep. Cons: Graphically and musically not excellent. Absent a shared multiplayer mode. The game is in English only. If the small game developer's kit existed, like the one that deals with chemistry, two elements would even be indicated in the instruction booklet as per ~don't-mix-even-under-torture~: puzzle games based on gems et similar and role-playing games. Thinking about it even for a moment it would probably be like refilming the movie ~Gone with the Wind~ using Bruce Willis, putting two thermonuclear explosions, an army of elves and at least ten minutes of footage on a game of dodgeball. And it is here that the human mind falls into error, because a developer -Infinite Interactive- had the courage to cross the threshold considered ~impossible~ by creating a game that mixes with an almost perfect fusion of the basics of the most common RPGs with what is one of the most popular games in the world of the web (and they are not), Bejeweled. The secret of their recipe? Once the adventure begins, it's really hard to stop...", "date": "2007-05-16", "grade": null}
