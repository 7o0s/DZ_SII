{"name": "Teamfight Tactics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/teamfight-tactics-recensione-versione-mobile.html", "text": "To write the review of the mobile version of Teamfight Tactics we tested the game both on an Android tablet and on a smartphone, always Android. It is important to specify this because there are substantial differences between playing it with one or the other, dictated not so much by the game itself, which remains identical for all versions, but by the legibility of what happens on the screen. Unfortunately Teamfight Tactics on smartphones suffers from the same problem as many other titles of the genre, namely poor readability, which can only be compensated for with experience. Probably those who have already played the PC version for several hours will not even notice the problem because it will go from memory and will only have to adapt to the menus that have been moved and adapted to touch screens, but those who start playing know that using a telephone they will have to overcome this small obstacle in more. It should also be noted that on mobile Teamfight Tactics is a completely autonomous game, where on PC it can only be downloaded together with League of Legends, with which it shares the client. For the rest we are essentially talking about an identical game on all the platforms that host it, that is an autobattler cloned without too many mysteries from Auto Chess, which however tries to have its own identity more than other competitors. Game mechanics For those unfamiliar with the genre, autobattlers are free-to-play strategy games that are very simple to play, in which you have to face human opponents by buying samples in a virtual shop and arranging them on a chessboard with hexagonal tiles, in the planning phase . In Teamfight Tactics matches are played in eights. Each player starts with one hundred energy points: the last one alive wins. After each round you get money which can be spent on buying new troops or leveling up. For every three first-tier champions of the same type purchased, you get one second-tier champion; adding three second-level champions results in a third-level one. This is where the element of chance comes into play: the shop offers five troops at a time, chosen from the nearly fifty available. If you want, you can spend money to refresh the showcase, but getting the units you need is always a matter of luck. To win, we must therefore learn to indulge in chance, so to speak, that is, try to make the most of what we are given, strengthening the units deployed round after round. Fortune When choosing the units to purchase, there is a determining factor to take into consideration: synergies. Champions synergize when they have a similar class or origin. These produce different effects that can be more or less devastating depending on the level of the champions and the number of those that make up the synergy. Not taking this factor into consideration means certain defeat, especially in the advanced rounds. Unlike other autobattlers, Teamfight Tactics offers small variations. For example, there are the rounds of the carousel, in which using your avatar you can go and get a champion among those who go round in the center of the arena. They are very useful for completing combinations or stealing resources from opponents. There are also PvE rounds where you can get coins, items or champions by collecting orbs dropped from enemy corpses. Compared to other autobattlers, in Teamfight Tactics learning how items work is crucial to winning; above all, it is necessary to understand how to combine them to obtain more powerful items to give to the champions. Graphics and problems The advantage of Teamfight Tactics over analogues of the genre is to make the player feel less like a victim of the case. Naturally luck remains very important, especially in matches between players of the same level, but the micromanagement of the economy makes the later stages a little less arbitrary. Still, it's undeniable that there are some imbalances between units and that some champion builds are more effective than others, regardless of placement, just as it is true that some items are more useful than others. In a certain sense, the drama of the autobattlers is only mitigated and even Riot Games, despite all the efforts made, has not managed to take away from them that slot machine aura so opposed by some players. Finally, from a technical point of view, we are faced with the best autobattler on the market: the units are varied and well made, both in the models and in the animations. The arenas are also very nice to look at and well characterized, even if honestly, little attention is paid to them while playing. In general you will only enjoy the game graphics with a big enough screen. It's not bad on smartphones.but some details are lost and it lacks some clarity, which further increases the learning curve of the game compared to other exponents of the genre. The microtransactions deserve a final note: of course there are but they only allow you to buy cosmetic items, such as avatars or arenas, so they don't affect the mechanics in any way, which remain the same for everyone regardless of how much you spend.", "date": "2020-03-23", "grade": "8.0"}
