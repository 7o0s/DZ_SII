{"name": "KnightShift", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knightshift.html", "text": "An unserious story Despite the ~dark~ look of the package cover and the epic accents of the sound comments, the first thing that catches the eye, and which helps to build the deepest identity of KnightShift, is its powerful humor. The characters are aesthetically ridiculous, including the protagonists and especially including the initial ~bad guy~, which is not hidden in the mystery but clearly present in the introduction movie, where it seems anything but a scary demon. It's not just a matter of aesthetics: the dialogues and the plot of the game also trigger more than a laugh. Let's take some examples. The prince, one of the protagonists of the game, puts so much emphasis on his being the hero who saves the world that it makes one wonder whether he is the first to not believe it. The wizard Gallus appears every time we are defeated, first despairing over the imminent destruction of the world and then adding: oh well, it's a video game, reload! Sometimes the irony is more subtle. In a dialogue, a knight begins to quibble very extemporaneously about the mind and the unconscious; the prince interrupts him saying Good, Freud *ahem*, friend. The game is full of such jokes. This can have positive or negative aspects: that the typical fantasy game clichs are mercilessly pilloried is certainly fun, but in the long run it could get tiring and the continuous ~relieving~ due to humor nullify the dramatic tension and this could, in some players, diminish interest in the story itself. Merge and divide Perhaps the element that most distinguishes KnightShift from its predecessors that we mentioned above is the attempt present within it to ~isolate~ the two strategic and role-playing components, building a game that offers both experiences separately rather than really ~merging~ them into one . Indeed, from the main menu we can choose two different main game modes: the campaigns or the role-playing game. The campaigns are a succession of linked scenarios carried out according to the traditional system of real-time strategy with only small hints of role-playing, dealt with directly in the appropriate section, made up of a series of ~chapters~ where the only character below our control will be the one created at the beginning of the game, with the exception of some supporting actor who will accompany him for a while on certain occasions. The two sections do not use the exact same interface; there are elements available only in campaign/rts mode (for example the menus of structures to build or units to train) and others available only in rpg mode (merchants, character inventory). From a narrative point of view, the events begin in the campaigns, whose first scenarios also constitute the tutorial, and continue in the rpg mode. The strategic mode is marked by synthesis: there are not so many ~civilizations~ to choose from and dozens of units to train, but a single faction, that of the prince, and a few highly specialized units. Carpenters build, repair and if they want they can also fight; the buildings range from the classic training structures (barracks, temple) to the equally classic defense structures (walls, towers, portals); a particular building is the stable, practically the only economic structure in the game. In KnightShift, in fact, the strategic resource is milk: soldiers, buildings and even technologies ~cost~ milk, and the milk is produced by the cows that can be trained at, in fact, the stable. Military units include warriors, archers, spearmen, and horsemen. Magical units are witches, priests, priestesses and wizards. Then there are other units with different tasks, including the fearsome ~mothers-in-law~, complete with rolling pin in hand: they are used to make carpenters work faster and to ~conquer~ enemy buildings. There are also the classic ~technologies~, which allow you to improve the strength of the soldiers or in any case the efficiency of the units; it is interesting to note that each technology has a precise consequence, including graphics. The mechanics of the battle are traditional: it is possible to form groups, set up formations and waypoints and so on; fights and explorations take place not only in the open air but also in underground or indoors, connected to the map by special passage points (this applies to both game modes). An important element to underline is that all units (including cows!) as they perform their activities gain experience and level up; between a newly trained warrior and a ~veteran~ the difference is enormous, and this greatly affects the development of strategies, leading the player to tenter to keep your units for a long time, also because there is the possibility of transporting them from one scenario to another in the campaign. The attention to detail of the single unit is also increased by other factors: for example, by the fact that each of them has its own name, as well as by the fact that each of them can collect objects if they are related to its occupation (for example, a warrior can pick up a sword, an archer a bow); the objects collected increase the power of the unit and also have a precise graphic feedback, so that after some time each of our warriors will be different from the other, since each will have a particular equipment. In strategic mode, however, there is no real inventory, which is present in rpg mode: there, objects can be accumulated in the backpack and also sold or bought from merchants. If in the strategic mode the protagonist is necessarily the prince, in the ~role-playing~ mode the player creates the protagonist by choosing him among different classes and personalizing his various abilities, both initially and in the course of gaining levels. Clearly, the rpgistic section places greater emphasis on missions and dialogues, even if there are never multiple response possibilities: when we start a dialogue, we can only listen to it and take note of it. This would seem to reduce the possibilities of true interpretation to a minimum, but the fact that (at least in the appropriate section) the attention is really entirely concentrated on a single character and not to be alternated between the protagonist and the army, as normally happens in ~hybrids~, should constitute a certain guarantee for the fan of role-playing games. On the other hand, the narrative development foresees the need to deal with both game modes: it can therefore be said with reasonable certainty that KnightShift cannot in any case be recommended to the ~purist~ of one of the two genres. What about random maps? KnightShift does not only offer strategic campaigns and ~role~ missions. Other main menu options include the ~skirmish~ mode, which allows for quick strategic battles against the computer or other human players via multiplayer, and there are also various maps unrelated to the main storyline to play solo with your hero in role-playing mode. Unfortunately, there is no random map generator, which has always been a classic option in strategy games. This is partially solved by the presence of a very versatile and powerful mission editor, whose interface is close to that of the game itself and which will therefore certainly be ~appetizing~ for inventive players. Whether the community will rise to the challenge, only time will tell. The first game in the world? Technically, KnightShift is a pretty dazzling game. The graphics are fully three-dimensional and practically everything except the terrain is animated: the trees, the buildings, the wild animals, the smoke from the torches The detail is remarkable, and even at the maximum zoom level it doesn't suffer too much from the typical angularity polygonal games; then there are some touches of remarkable virtuosity, for example the reflection of the clouds on the ground, or the treatment of the water surfaces, which reflect everything that happens on the banks in real time: this occurs mainly thanks to a very capable, even if not so much as to allow the claim of very risky firsts (according to the box, KnightShift is the first game in the world to exploit the pixel shader; evidently the programmers have never heard of Morrowind, released in 2002). The most important thing to underline, however, is that all the good things just described are incredibly ~light~ in terms of resources required; just to be clear, KnightShift always runs perfectly in a system that struggles to run SpellForce; however, this may also depend on the fact that Zuxxez's game tends to focus on small skirmishes, while SpellForce prefers mass clashes, clearly demanding in terms of resources. Even the sound commentary deserves applause, even if at first glance it might seem irrelevant with the light-hearted tone of the title. In reality, the strings and majestic choirs that form the musical leitmotif of the soundtrack contribute not a little to the outline of a dreamy atmosphere, where the caricatural forms of the events and characters seem to find their perfect location. The dubbing and the vocal characterization of the protagonists are excellent, even if only the texts have been translated in the Italian version, and this can create some problems for non-English speakers since the dialogues do not containemplano the use of subtitles (it is still possible to go and read them later through the ~missions~ screen). Final comment KnightShift is a well-crafted game, which decisively brings out the professionalism and experience of the developers. While proposing schemes that may already seem hackneyed, the authors have shown themselves capable of dealing with them in a clear and crystalline way, isolating their characteristic elements and avoiding confusing them between mixes and contradictory game alternatives. The strategic section adds nothing to the genre but is pleasant, not very frustrating, in a certain sense benevolently ~light~ in proposing a single nucleus of buildings, units and technologies, avoiding the hypertrophy and quantitative maximalism of many other titles belonging to the category . The ~roleplaying~ section cannot and does not want to have any comparative ambitions with ~real~ role-playing games, but it is nevertheless pleasant and its being knowingly ~isolated~ from the rest of the game makes it accessible on several levels, as a narrative continuation of the story strategic or as a moment of simple videogame relaxation for the RPG enthusiast. The decision to propose a mix that is twice as ~light~ is, in a certain sense, KnightShift's greatest strength and weakness at the same time. By not really delving into any of its features, the game condemns itself to a destiny of mere pastime, a shining example of a ~profession~ ultimately destined not to leave deep traces in the player's memory and which perhaps lacks the element of inspiration which distinguishes the highly professional product from the fruit of authentic passion for a genre. Strengths Very well programmed Rich in irony Playable on multiple levels Very good graphics and sound Defects Very simple game mechanics There is nothing new It has no real ~soul~ A very fashionable mix There is no doubt that in the last period the preferred marketing technique for launching and selling a video game is to present it as a ~fusion~ of many genres. However, not all mixtures seem to meet with the same consensus from the public: if some daring experiments remain unanswered, others even go so far as to inaugurate a new genre. This is the case of the lucky mix between rts (strategic in real time) and rpg (role-playing game). We could trace the first distant signs of this union to the beginnings of real-time strategy, when programmers, to make the stories to be told more exciting, began to make them revolve around some character who remained fixed in the succession of the various scenarios. It is clear that from making this protagonist a simple unit with a few more hit points to an absolutely unique unit also in terms of skills, the step is short: the evolution towards the rts / rpg was therefore almost inherent within the greater limit of the strategic in real time, i.e. the impersonality of the numerous units that populate it. The first title of great appeal to ~consciously~ use the fusion of the two genres was the famous Warcraft III by Blizzard, which, moreover, was much more daring and experimental during the first steps of its development than in the version on sale and still today much played online. In Warcraft III, the normal units were joined by ~heroes~, i.e. characters who leveled up and had a series of skills to improve over time as well as a basic inventory of objects. The other important title to enter this vein was, more recently, SpellForce; there the role-playing dimension seemed decidedly more consistent, but this consistency turned out to be predominantly ~quantitative~ and did not substantially change the approach to the game, based in any case on the RTS mechanisms of the accumulation of troops and the development of technologies. The title we are now going to talk about is a new stage in this journey. It's called KnightShift and is a game developed by the company Zuxxez (sounds like a silly name, but it is pronounced like the English ~success~), in particular by its internal team Reality Pump. The game revolves around the story of a prince of a typical fantasy kingdom and his friend-mentor, the wise wizard Gallus; the stories of the two characters develop in missions characterized now by the control of a single unit or a limited ~party~, now by the need to build structures and train larger armies. That there are no revolutionary innovations is therefore a first little obviousness. To go further, let's try to address all the various aspects of the game.", "date": "2004-05-18", "grade": null}
