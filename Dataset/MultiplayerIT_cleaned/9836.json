However, a (very) partial consolation for lovers of the infamous jet skis, cross and delight (but above all cross) of swimmers, the App Store comes to the rescue with the second chapter of a title, Aqua Moto Racing 2, which despite the blue pencil error reported in the name, it actually proves to be potentially very interesting. Physics of fluids The first Aqua Moto Racing, released several months ago, already contained the germ of fun, however prevented in its development by a rather approximate technical realization. With Aqua Moto Racing 2, on the other hand, things seem to have definitely changed, and luckily for the better. Immediately striking in the Resolution Interactive title is already the beautiful and colorful animated initial menu, capable of conveying a sense of joy and dynamism from the first glance; not bad if the options present turn out to be always the usual ones (i.e. the settings, the quick race, the tournament and the garage for choosing the vehicles), in fact in the end, as in everything, the first impact is very important and in this case it is certainly promising. The arcade racing genre is always prolific, thanks to the fun and immediate adrenaline that crazy races are able to convey to the player: Aqua Moto Racing 2 does not deny this axiom and season the arcade racing dish with some simulation elements, more distinctly related to water physics, finally present and well implemented in this second release of the game. Contrary to the predecessor, in fact, the realization of the movements and ripples of the water are reproduced here in a decidedly more credible way, such as to greatly influence the behavior of the vehicles. If, for example, you are in the vicinity of a wave, it is not recommended to fully open the throttle, on pain of lifting the boat and consequently losing control. While receiving a fairly credible feedback from contact with the external environment, the arcade component undoubtedly remains predominant in the game: the turbo button, which can be activated after a series of perfectly circumvented buoys or the aerial acrobatics that can be performed after the numerous ramps present are proof of this evident, not to mention the possibility of excluding the use of the brake from the set of predefined commands. Speaking of controls, the iPhone's accelerometer once again proves to be the perfect control tool for this type of game, thanks also to the wide possibility of calibrating sensitivity. In Championship mode it will be possible to face 14 mini-tournaments in succession, 7 during the day and 7 at sunset on the same circuits but in reverse, located in three different settings ranging from the Tropics to Greece to Egypt. As per tradition, to move from one competition to another at a higher level, it will be necessary to finish in the top three in the previous tournament. The victory of the races and the success of the stunts will earn money, which can only be spent on the purchase of new and more performing jet skis from the Garage; the choice of the most powerful medium proves to be necessary above all in the second part of the championship, when the AI becomes more aggressive and attention and steady nerves will be needed to keep the fast opponents led by the CPU at bay. After having mentioned positively the realization of the physics of wave motion, some remarks remain to be made regarding the general technical aspect of the game: if in fact the glance is not bad at all, on a more accurate analysis the small graphic defects are frequently noticed , first of all the polygonal interpenetration with different objects and between the same water and the scooters, which sometimes seems to cross them. It is understood that realizing the movement of a fluid is certainly not an easy operation already on a ~classic~ console, let alone on a device like the iPhone, albeit with its potential; however, even if no one expected the sea seen in Bioshock, the presence of these flaws is undeniable. Another serious lack is given by the absence of any type of multiplayer, neither local nor online; present instead the Open Feint achievements, the unlocking of which, however, is particularly annoying during the course of a race, due to the drop in framerate (which also occurs on the test iPhone 4) and the invasion of the screen that causes thenotification notice.
