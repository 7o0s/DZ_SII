{"name": "Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182246-planescape-torment-enhanced-edition-ricordi-dal-mortuario.html", "text": "There are various ways to remaster and, more generally, relaunch an old video game. One of the most wrong is to try to add content that no one has asked for: neither those who played the original, nor new players, who certainly won't be convinced to buy by the presence of some more missions or some lines of dialogue changed. Every updating operation should be based on respect for the work, including its limits. Beamdog has had a hard time understanding this with the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, however well done, but often criticized precisely for the revised and added contents. The same Siege of Dragonspear, an autonomous expansion of Baldur's Gate, which attempted to fill the gap between the first two chapters, net of some political controversies, received strong criticism for not being able to reach the quality of the originals. In short, remastering a classic can certainly be fruitful, but at the same time it is a minefield from which you risk not getting out alive. Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition was announced a few weeks ago. It was suspected that Beamdog had already been working on it for a few months, first of all because it had been silent for some time and also because it was the last of the great titles created with BioWare's Infinity Engine not to have been remastered yet (actually Icewind Dale is still missing II, which however is not as famous as this one). However, the certainty came when the development was practically completed. Given the precedents, many immediately put their hand to arms, declaring themselves ready to go to war in the event that what is considered one of the best electronic role-playing games ever had been affected by some nefarious commercial decision. Even uncontrolled rumors have begun to circulate about alleged changes, additions and so on, due to the presence of Chris Avellone as a consultant, one of the authors of the game. Luckily that didn't happen... We reviewed Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition: is it still one of the best RPGs ever? The Power of Planescape: Torment Unlike the aforementioned Baldur's Gate or the Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment (1999), always a videogame translation of an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons scenario, is a very measured and composed title, capable of telling the story of its main character with great effectiveness, but without ever giving in to deleterious excesses. The room for maneuver to modify or expand such a narrative fabric is practically nil, also because there would be a serious risk of breaking its balance, causing the entire gameplay to collapse with them. In short, in a Baldur's Gate one more or less fight, perhaps on a new scenario, does not make a big difference, while in Torment it would be difficult, if not impossible, to justify. For this reason, Beamdog made the only sensible choice: the Enhanced Edition in terms of content has remained identical to the original, including dialogues. For those unfamiliar with it, Planescape: Torment, not to be confused with Torment: Tides of Numenera, which is only a spiritual sequel, but which is not directly related to it, tells the story of a character with no name and no memory, called Nameless One, who awakens in the mortuary of the city of Sigil, the so-called ~City of Doors~, the melting pot of the plans of the multiverse. Together with him we immediately get to know another character, the floating skull Death, who introduces us to the rudiments of the game, immediately joins the party and helps the Nameless One escape. From here on, the goal becomes to reconstruct the protagonist's identity, to find out how and why he has forgotten his story and who or what made him immortal. To do this, you must first explore the city of Sigil, then start traveling the planes in search of the truth, coming into contact with characters as mysterious as they are powerful and experiencing highly dramatic situations, which answer many of our questions, while simultaneously opening others. To complete the whole there is a rich and varied cast of supporting actors who can be hired for the party, all interesting and with their own story to tell. At the time Black Isle, the original development studio, did everything to dodge stereotypes and clichs of the fantasy genre, demonstrating that one can be original and profound even by handling material strongly sedimented in the culture of the target audience. Even today, the writing of Planescape: Torment can be admired for the ability demonstrated by the screenwriters to alternate the linguistic registers of the various characters, which end up composing an organic and multifaceted universe, even if only from a linguistic point of view. Obviously the strong philosophical approachica of the whole adventure is still there, as well as the possibility of choosing the approach to take, i.e. whether to be more combative or more communicative. Nothing has changed. And the Italian? Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition is not officially translated into Italian. However, we did a quick search and discovered that the Allegri Buffoni group is collaborating with Beamdog to adapt the amateur translation of the original version to the Enhanced Edition. Let's hope it's a matter of days rather than months, but let's give these guys time to complete the update in peace and thank them very much for what they are doing. Enhanced Edition? Paradoxically, the greatest strength of Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition is the distance held by Beamdog compared to the work of Black Isle. As already mentioned, there are no gameplay changes, apart from a greater zoom, which makes exploration less problematic, and some improvements to the interface, now closer to the modern standards of the genre and perfect for the most diverse resolutions (the original was designed for a resolution of 640x480, upscaled to 800x600). If we wish we can tell you the triviality that, being a 1999 title, the graphics are visibly aged, but you can also realize this by looking at a screenshot. Of course, if a few wrinkles prevent you from experiencing one of the best RPGs ever, that's your problem. The only negative points of the whole operation are the 'accounting' ones. In fact, until the launch of the Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment was sold for 9.99, while now it is no longer possible to buy it separately but you get it together with the new edition which costs 19.99. Let's also add that before the downloadable soundtrack was included in the game, while now it must be purchased separately as if it were a DLC and it doesn't even cost very much (if you already had it, however, you'll find it right where it was). In short, we understand the need to get back on the investment and make money, but sometimes you also need to try to appear less rapacious than you are, especially when you go to exploit a recognized masterpiece.", "date": "2017-04-18", "grade": "9.3"}
