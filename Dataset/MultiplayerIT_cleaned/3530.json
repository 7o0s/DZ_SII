Predictably MXGP 19 is placed in clear continuity with respect to the consolidated characteristics of the series, offering enthusiasts some small novelties which, however, do not distort the substance of the product. With the exception of some modest variations on the theme, which we will discuss in the course of our review, the local team has not in fact distorted much what is the general feeling transmitted by the game and what it can offer to all supporters of the discipline . MXGP 2019 debuts today on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, offering official content updated to the current season. Game mode The approach chosen by Milestone for the development of MXGP 2019 is therefore absolutely in the name of tradition. A problem often debated by enthusiasts, especially by those most critical of the recent work of the Milanese team, in hindsight the result of a very busy development calendar and with rather short processing times. The scenario could change now that the company has been taken over by THQ Nordic, but only time will tell what the new direction taken by the team will actually be in the future. In the meantime, we cannot help but notice the extremely conservative nature of MXGP 19, which does not offer particular creative flashes while trying to put some new features on the plate. Starting from the introduction of the editor: in fact a new feature for the franchise, but essentially a feature taken from Monster Energy Supercross and adapted for the occasion. At the beginning of the game it is possible to create your own virtual alter ego by choosing its appearance and characteristics, and then decide on the team and customizations of an aesthetic nature. Alternatively, the classic quick modes are available as always, divided between the normal race, the single season or the time attack competition. The personalized driver is associated with a growth system which provides for the collection of Prestige points based on the results obtained. However, it is not the only option guaranteed by the game, which once again offers the official licenses of the MX2 and MXGP championships, including teams, locations and stars belonging to the two categories. There is talk of a total of 17 official tracks and 35 riders, including the unfailing Italian pride: nine-time world champion Tony Cairoli. Alternatively, you can opt for the Playground mode, the usual freely explorable sandbox area in which players can take part in various activities. In addition to the races, spread over three customized tracks and divided between the traditional competitions against other pilots managed by the AI or the time attacks, you can in fact try your hand at a series of challenges of increasing difficulty, whose starting position is identified on the map. In this context, there are also Waypoints, i.e. short routes dotted with small checkpoints, which must be crossed being careful to be very precise. The latter can, if necessary, be customized by the users themselves and then shared with the rest of the community. The inevitable multiplayer mode closes the picture, which does not introduce anything new compared to the formula tested in the past. By accessing this section you can create a private lobby or vice versa to access a quick game. Unlike offline races, where you have to contend with 22 other drivers on the track, online competitions have up to a maximum of 12 opponents, with the AI in charge of filling any shortage of participants. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 51 MXGP 2019 Trophies, divided into 38 bronze, 10 silver, 2 gold and platinum. One part involves winning first place at least once on each track, others are related to completing Playground challenges and objectives related to Season mode. Gameplay in the wake of tradition Also in terms of gameplay MXGP 2019 substantially renews the formula already proposed in the past. Control of the vehicle becomes essential especially in the vicinity of bumps and large jumps. Without the correct trajectory it is in fact quite easy to end up outside the stakes that delimit the track or to lie down in the mud following a collision with the barriers and sacks that delimit the route. To give your rider more balance it is always necessary to rely on the scrub maneuver, which involves managing and improving the trajectories of your bike during corner entry and travel, servingendosi of the right stick of the pad. By doing so, it is possible to improve one's exit speed - as well as the stability of the motorcycle - by managing weight shift in key moments and the use of the legs to improve the grip of the vehicle. Unlike MotoGP 19, where a new artificial intelligence called A.N.N.A. was introduced for the first time, in this case the AI remained the typical one that also characterized the previous Milestone-branded products. So don't expect big steps forward on this front. As mentioned, one of the (few) new features available is the presence of the track editor, which allows you to select the type of environment in which to shape your own path, choosing between the Forest, Desert and Riviera options. The vehicle tuning options also follow the tradition, through a plethora of detailed parameters such as suspensions, ratios, wheelbase and so on. The tracks created by the community can be consulted by opting for various criteria, for example taking into account the most recent ones, or the works that have received the most appreciation. Alternatively, it is possible to select some to add to one's personal favorites folder, so as to be able to retrieve them at any time with maximum convenience. On a technical level, MXGP 2019 is again based on Unreal Engine 4, offering a fluidity of 30 frames per second on consoles. Graphically we are faced with the same defects already listed in the past, including the excessive static nature of the public present at the edge of the track and the poor reactivity of the ground to the passage of the bike - even in variable weather conditions - as well as the presence of a collision system poorly structured. The game menu has been updated and made more pleasant to look at, while at the sound level the sampling work of the engines is in line with the past, giving the player a homogeneous and faithful feeling to the original counterparts. Definitely to improve, however, the duration of the loading times.", "date": "2019-08-27", "grade": "7.0"}
