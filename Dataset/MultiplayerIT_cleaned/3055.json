{"name": "The Outer Worlds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "A few months have passed since the first review of The Outer Worlds, Obsidian's latest independent effort, which after more than ten years has returned to the first-person three-dimensional RPG. The studio founded by the creators of Fallout has invested so much in this project that it convinced Microsoft to acquire it, thus starting a new era for the team. After about nine months and a long delay, the Nintendo Switch version finally arrives which, unfortunately , fails to solve the many problems already encountered by other ports of the unreal engine on the Nintendo hybrid. Whether you are in portable or home mode, The Outer Worlds fails to hold a candle to its original counterpart, losing in practically every respect, net of some interesting features such as aiming managed via gyroscope. Not too big an epic The story of The Outer Worlds is congenial to the type of experience it wants to give. Obsidian never deviates too much from the stylistic features of its RPGs and, in this case, the points of contact with an adventure along the lines of Fallout can be read both in the continuation of the journey and in the game mechanics. In our case we find ourselves catapulted into the body of a man or a woman after a sleep that lasted many years longer than expected. The space journey to the Alcyone colony has ended and the space pirate Phineas decides to awaken us to use us as a means for his own purposes. After a not too deep editor, it is possible to choose where to spend your base points, so as to give a bland address to our character. Don't worry, because you can redistribute the points at any time, as this genre is getting used to us by now. The peculiarity is that different aspects correspond to a single category, thus combining different characteristics which, up to level fifty, grow simultaneously. Only once this value has been reached in the specific category, will you have to choose a sort of specialization. The skill classes are among the most diverse: ranging from one-handed melee weapons to long-ranged weapons, passing through hacking and dexterity. Once we have made our choices we will find ourselves catapulted into an adventure limited to macro zones on different planets, spaceships and satellites, forgetting the vastness of an open world, but making a fair variety of settings available to the player. The main campaign, with its primary and secondary missions, the deepening of the relationship with your supporting characters and moral choices will take you about thirty hours, clearly demonstrating the reduced nature of the experience. On the other hand, we are still talking about an independent RPG, born from Obsidian's strong will to have his say again in the lions' den of first-person role-playing games. From a purely narrative point of view, it certainly cannot be said that the adventure is mind blowing. Some of the events are perplexing, the psychological insight of the supporting actors is not always extraordinary and, above all, some of the choices end up being of little influence and even inconsistent with the consequences. This last element probably derives from the narrative necessity of having to bring everything back to just two endings. Despite this we are faced with one of the best modern experiences of the genre, seasoned by the strong humor of the team, which remains anchored to some styles of the past but which still today it highlights Obsidian's great ability to constantly reinvent the same formula. Definitely a great business card for future Microsoft-branded projects. A known gameplay If all that we have said concerns the construction behind the idea of the role-playing game, the actual gameplay certainly does not reach the same heights. The title is not only backward from a technical point of view, but above all in the mechanics and in the combat system. The shooting system is as close as Obdisian could achieve with Fallout: New Vegas in mind, bringing with it all the problems of the genre, the difficulty in working well on the hitbox and fluidity of movement and, above all, in the recycling of mechanics that even leads abuse a sort of bullet time reminiscent of a distant relative of the SPAV. of the Bethesda series. Much better as regards customization, with a very wide choice of weapons and pieces of equipment that can also be modified, so as to increase the characteristics that can be more useful to us. The choices, as mentioned, have not always been successful in terms of consequences, but we must acknowledge Obdisian for having reminded us with great pleasure what it means to feel free to act, with the possibility of killing charactersimportant for the balance of some places and communities, so as to totally transform the continuation of some quests. This remains the most successful element of The Outer Worlds experience and the best advice we can give you is to make a second pass on the game, so as to move in the diametrically opposite direction. This won't drastically change the events of your journey, but it will allow you to face them in a very different way from the previous time. The Nintendo Switch port Let's start immediately with the painful truth: The Outer Worlds on Nintendo Switch is bad to see. The technical level of the game didn't make a miracle cry already at its original release, making clear the production possibilities of an Obsidian without big budgets. Despite this, the diversity of environments and some stylistic and chromatic choices allowed The Outer Worlds to be digestible and, in some moments, even beautiful. The Nintendo Switch version from this point of view is a disaster. The level of detail is set to something even less performing than the worst ~very low~ that we've ever set on a really too dated PC. After the first moments, with interesting cutscenes that bode well, when the game really starts, it made us feel sensations similar to the disastrous porting of RiME. In a world where even a title like The Witcher 3 manages to run on Nintendo Switch, it's really sad to see a game reduced to these minimum technical terms, also considering the rather concrete risk of running into some frame rate problems in the most agitated moments (but not too much). Surely from this point of view we would have expected something better, above all because it would have been an excellent opportunity to experience such a particular experience with the convenience of the Switch's portable mode. Unfortunately, the problems are not solved even by holding the console in your hands, with the only difference being to go down to 720p, but not even the small screen of the Nintendo console manages to perform its usual miracle and reduce a general ugliness that is difficult to digest. Crazy pop-in, a general embarrassing level of detail and a strange lack of sharpness on the depth of field are three of the negative elements that stand out the most within this conversion. What struck us very positively instead is the possibility of using the gyroscope for aiming. Before thinking that it is very inconvenient (a mistake we too stumbled upon) know that the great idea is that of being able to use both the aim via analog and that linked to the motion sensors at the same time. Among the options you can choose to activate it constantly, only once you are aiming, or deactivate it completely. We were very happy with the second option, allowing you to integrate the low precision of the analogs with the adjustment of the shot via gyroscope. It could almost be a patented method to be reused more constantly. Seeing is believing.", "date": "2020-06-04", "grade": "7.5"}
