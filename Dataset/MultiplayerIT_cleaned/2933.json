{"name": "Robotics!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robotics-la-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of Robotics! let's talk about the latest work of the Russian team ZeptoLab, author of successes such as Cut the Rope and CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars. The game can be defined as an ideal sequel to the latter, given that it takes up the basic concepts, however, changing some cards on the table: if in the 2017 title it was a matter of building small tanks to be sent into battle without having direct control on them, in Robotics! the player must assemble combat automatons making them also learn movements to then be replicated in the clashes. So let's find out if it is a heated soup or a product that expands and improves a winning formula. Small robotics ZeptoLab didn't try too hard to distinguish Robotics! from CATS, considering how structure, interface and progression model are substantially identical. Instead, the protagonists and graphic style change, and not necessarily for the better: if the previous work of the Russian developer could count on a decidedly original and pleasant imprint (with the extra gear given by the kittens), Robotics! it offers a rather bland and anonymous look, which the typical coldness of automatons only emphasizes. However, the choice of robots is not just an unfortunate aesthetic habit, since it directly involves the gameplay. The user's task is always to build a machine to send into battle against the creations of other players, choosing between torso, arms, legs and sidearms or firearms. You can set up to three different loadouts and choose one at the start of the match based on your opponent's characteristics, but the most important component in Robotics! derives from the movements that our automaton can learn just before the collision: you have a handful of seconds available to tap its appendages and drag your finger to indicate to the robot how to use them, which it will repeat until one of the two contenders it will not be reduced to a pile of metal. An exhilarating practice only on paper, but which actually denotes all its inadequacy after just a handful of games, when it turns out that victories and defeats in Robotics! they are dictated practically only by the level of the player's equipment and by a good dose of luck. The deliberately exaggerated physics of the ZeptoLab title causes the automatons to end up caracollaring to the ground after a few steps, reducing the fights to a tangle of bionic limbs in which the winner is the one who manages to hit the opponent randomly more times or with a greater dose of damage . Fun to see the first few times but quite depressing in the long run, especially considering the heavy pay to win mechanics that the title is dominated by. The clashes are divided into arenas that require different entry costs in terms of tickets (the higher the price, the better the rewards in case of victory) and the resources obtainable by playing do not allow you to upgrade your robot beyond a certain extent: If you aim to climb the rankings, the only viable option is to purchase packages of virtual currency, otherwise you will soon find yourself annihilated by opponents equipped with out-of-scale equipment compared to your own. ZeptoLab has really pushed the hand on the microtransactions button, which are suggested a lot in a title that in any case does not even miss its fair share of advertisements. A modern free to play, in short, in the most unpleasant sense of the term.", "date": "2020-08-29", "grade": "6.5"}
