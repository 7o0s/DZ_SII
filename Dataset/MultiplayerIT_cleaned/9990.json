Runner is in fact the most complete and independent title of the series so far, at least from a conceptual point of view. It is not a question here of offering tributes to particular great classics of the past as could have happened in Bit.Trip Beat for the old Pong or in Core for the ~ancient~ shooter genre, in this case we are faced with a structure that is not necessarily derived from the arcade of the past and that even without relying excessively on the stylish ~retro-chic~ finds more sense within today's play offer. The concept behind the game is simple as well as substantially already seen in other areas (Canabalt and the crazy Robot Unicorn Attack got there first and amply demonstrated its goodness): it is an inexorable race towards the conclusion of the levels, with few and elementary controls left to the player who basically limits himself to making sure that the main character is able to overtake the countless obstacles that stand in the way unscathed. Three or four simple commands that are gradually integrated into the playful fabric may seem few, but the resulting gameplay is far from poor. The frequency with which the obstacles appear and the speed of the protagonist do not allow a moment of rest, while the frenetic pace is underlined by the typical connection between the input of the commands and the resulting sounds, perfectly integrated within the psychedelic soundtrack in full ~8-bit~ digital style, a feature common to the entire aesthetic sector of the whole series. A crazy ride Bit.Trip Runner is divided into different worlds represented with different particular graphic characteristics, all obviously abstract and minimalistic as required by the stylistic code of the series. Each world is in turn divided into various sub-levels. The player is simply required to get the pixelated Commander Video to the finish line, making sure that the obstacles do not prematurely end his mad run, alternating jumps, slides, kicks and parries based on the different type of threat that confronts us . Each obstacle requires a specific movement, therefore there is no room for personal interpretations or margins of error, making it necessary to have the exact command with perfect timing, under penalty of immediate return to the beginning of the level. So here is a feature with a double meaning: there is no energy bar or a count of ~lives~ for the protagonist, simply every mistake is punished with the return to the beginning of the level, from where Commander Video will restart immediately with his mad rush. On the one hand, this contributes to tightening the pace of the game to very high levels, as it erases dead times by creating a continuous game flow despite the (sometimes frantic) succession of attempts, on the other hand, it can generate frustration and tiredness in the player, since each The slightest mistake causes the progress made to be reset (within the current sub-level, of course) and the game to be restarted immediately. It must be said that, given the high rate of addiction that the gameplay generates, such a solution is positive in terms of longevity and attachment to the game. Without the ~excuse~ of a cut-scene to break the pace and with a continuous re-launch of the action, it becomes very difficult to leave the Wii Remote and end the session. In the more advanced levels, the succession of several obstacles of different types in rapid succession generates the need for fast and sequential inputs, resulting in real key combinations to be pressed almost in fighting game style, while the correct continuation of the race and the collection of bonuses is enhanced by the appearance of an increasingly defined rainbow that follows the protagonist. Digital worlds The retro style is obviously a key element of the game, even if as the playful depth increases, the aesthetic aspect no longer represents that fundamental stylistic pretext that gives meaning to the entire production, but rather a splendid characterizing setting. The typical elements of the series return here too: 2D characters and elements with a ~pixelated~ look that recall the video games of the 70s and 80s, however mixed with other three-dimensional elements that reproduce the same graphic style through the use of polygons, with a decidedly pleasant general graphic effect. To this aesthetic system is added the soundtrack that follows the canons imposed by the Bit.Trip series proposing delland electronic bases with which the user interacts simply by playing: in fact, each action corresponds to a particular sound that integrates perfectly with the background music, and since there are obstacles arranged at more or less regular intervals along the way, the result is a rhythmic scan that blends the game action with the music in an organic whole that increases the psychedelic and addictive effect. It is probably also this homogeneity between graphics, sound and action that pushes us to continue playing after the hundredth mistake that sends us back to the beginning of the level and that makes us yearn for the perfect performance despite the extreme simplicity of the gameplay and simple rewards such as the wake rainbow that forms behind the protagonist with the collection of bonuses. A real homage to the past, clearly distinguishable in the midst of the vague suggestions is obviously that of Pitfall, which can be found both in the aforementioned colored trail, present in the iconography of the Activision game (in particular in the historical cover) and in the bonus levels, where we are to run and collect gold bars in a setting that closely resembles the old David Crane classic.", "date": "2010-05-27", "grade": "8.5"}
