{"name": "Obscure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/obscure_a.html", "text": "Two is better Not too strangely, a further element emerges: each of the characters has a specific talent, it will be up to the player to exploit it to his advantage and, if for the simple cover fire each of the boys is adequate, it is in the execution of a certain command that differences are found significant. With the use of a special key, each member of the party will do his utmost in a particular action, with variable results depending on the various situations. Just to give an example, Josh is able to communicate to the player if there are objects in a room, Shannon has a great analytical spirit and always offers advice for solving puzzles, Ashley is very good in fights, and so on . Later in the game, the group will consist of five elements, further increasing the decision-making power of the player. Since it is only possible to proceed in two, the rest will always wait in the school courtyard, regardless of the progress of the adventure and some key events, and it will be possible to gather everyone in the aforementioned square with a special command. each of the characters has a specific talent, it will be up to the player to exploit it to his advantage Two is better It is obvious that this formula tends to favor a strategic approach to a strongly linear progress system, in perfect line with the genre, which requires the sequential exploration of the various areas following the discovery of specific objects and key quests. However, where Obscure flaws clamorously is in the characterization of the characters themselves, crude and approximate, which makes them much more unpleasant than the monsters who want to make an attempt on their lives. If Resident Evil proposed soldiers accustomed to combat, and Silent Hill normal subjects at the mercy of lucid hallucinations, the handful of boys armed to the teeth of Obscure is hardly credible. And it's a shame because the unprecedented social placement of the characters certainly deserved more attention in the screenplay phase. The feeling of dealing with soulless puppets weighs on the atmosphere, as does the visual rendering of the monsters, not too inspired and often too similar to what has already been seen in other productions. Shapeless abominations have already reached the state of grace in Silent Hill 2, monstrous humanoids look like carbon copies of the Capcomian Tyrant, while zombies don't really scare anyone anymore, even with their unpredictable entrances, no matter what (including annoying sounds) it has already been extensively experienced in order to still be effective. Furthermore, the impossibility of enemies to leave their area leaves a further bitter taste in the mouth, especially after what was seen in Siren, since it is possible to escape their threat simply by changing rooms. On the other hand, the idea of surrounding the monsters with a dark halo, which signals their presence, distresses the player and also finds a credible justification in the script, is certainly one of the best gimmicks of the game. Equally good is the idea of chasing enemies away with a torch (an essential object by now) or by breaking windows to favor lighting, a solution that is not exclusively scenographic, as light plays a crucial role in the game. The high school of horrors Where Oscure could really take flight was in the possibility of being played in multiplayer, but this mode is just sketchy: although it is possible to exchange objects, issue orders or heal each other, the combined action is reduced to a minimum, while it is all absent that in different locations (when everything had already been well implemented in Resident Evil Zero), being impossible to control the characters individually once separated. Fault, we must admit, also of a lackluster level design and chronically anchored to the canons of the genre. The puzzles are few and never complicated, but their limitation finds a logical sense in the usual contexts of a high school. The controls are managed in real time with two side windows with scrolling icons, one for objects and the other for weapons, similar to what was seen in Metal Gear Solid. Their management is slightly confusing in the most demanding fights, the high vulnerability of the characters to enemy blows requires a sometimes frustrating timeliness. A much more evident problem is in the limited duration of the adventure, estimated at six hours, very few if we think that a certain backtracking of the locations is necessary for the search for certain clues and objects. As already found in other similar products, the various additional bonuses relatively stimulate replayability, for this reason we strongly advise not to choose the lowest difficulty level (there are three in all). we will never be alone, always being able to count on the moral and physical support of our colleague, who can be used both by the CPU and by a second player The high school of horrors Graphics and sound certainly play in favor of Obscure, which proves to be an aesthetically well-finished product. The graphics engine developed by Hydravision is of excellent caliber, fluid and unassailable, and offers detailed three-dimensional locations full of animated objects, indeed more scenographic than effective in the playful economy, even if the possibility of breaking windows to open doors or take objects facilitates a lot of interaction. The artistic direction is managed by expert hands, and the lively use of colors and the roundness of the shapes, from a typical French comic, is well balanced by the abundant presence of gore and suitably tense situations. The polygonal counting of the characters is not up to the latest productions, but still proves to be decent, with good quality textures. The most effective effect is the aforementioned dynamic halo of monsters, which taints floors and walls, making an effective sense of oppression. The shots are not manageable by the player and are decided each time by the CPU, often and willingly with the help of an extreme and hallucinated Silent Hill-style direction. This setting generates the well-known visual problems during combat, where it is not possible to understand exactly the position of the enemies outside the framed play area. The work done on the texts is excellent, the game is totally localized (without gross errors) in Italian, voices included, and can count on a quality dubbing. The possibility of enjoying a similar adventure completely in Italian will delight many users, a pity that the script emphasizes the background of high school more than the characters. The musical accompaniment is essential, represented by sparse well-made orchestral parts, and distressing lullabies that would make Dario Argento jealous, whose use in the game is however really excessive. Obscure is an imperfect product, but worthy of interest, which inaugurates the teen survival horror by offering an unprecedented initial cue, but which resolves itself too soon in a slavish imitation of the cornerstones of the genre. Too many situations already seen in its predecessors, too many gimmicks that have now addicted the user, losing their effectiveness. The salient feature of the product, represented by the cooperative method between characters, only partially balances the situation, having been tested more effectively in the Capcom saga. To the advantage of the Hydravision effort, the possibility of facing the adventure in two, making use of a diversified party, is appreciable, but this implementation is barely mentioned, leaving all the possible evolutions to a possible sequel. On balance, the player will end up exploring the high school with the characters most suited to his style of play, or those necessary for the key points, limiting himself to exploiting the simple cover fire for the rest. Also disappointing is the lack of combined actions between several elements, evidence of a not too elaborate game design, and the overall duration, which is really very small. On the other hand, there are good ideas worthy of future developments, such as light management. The technical realization is impeccable, of an excellent level. Ultimately a title that we would like to recommend to lovers of the genre, but which dares too little to leave a deeper mark. Pros: Good technical realization Totally localized in Italian Five characters Cons: Too many situations already seen Cooperation between characters that can be improved Rather short I want to go back to being a student One of the focal points of a survival horror is represented by the script and the scenario, Capcom, Konami and Sony are well aware that with their products they have presented different but equally terrifying situations and characters. For Obscure, the last pretender to the podium of the genre, Hydravision have opted for a setting abused to the limit in film productions, but strangely not in videogame ones: the events take place in fact inside a US high school, the Leafmore High School. This cue brings the game closer to the teen-horror films with a school setting, very famous in the eighties, and successfully revived with the Scream series (and related parodies), but also with the television series inspired by the vampire hunter Buffy. The introduction opens cheerfully on the notes of Sum 41, presenting the five protagonists with the typical video clip style. After a series of conversations we immediately take control of Kenny, the handsome all-muscle sportsman, who will pay off his curiosity. A few meters are enoughIt is necessary to discover that we are faced with a simple and linear prologue, along the lines of what was already seen in the first Silent Hill, but for those who live it as a first playful experience it is a gimmick that always has its effect. The adventure begins the next day, when Shannon, Kenny's sister, agrees with two friends to stay in the school after hours and look for her brother who mysteriously disappeared. Hidden in a classroom, and completely unaware of the aberrant hidden presences in the high school, the trio begins their search, and so does the actual game. From this point we discover one of the salient features of Obscure, its cooperative nature that pushes the player to embark on the adventure assisted by a companion. This means that we will never be alone, always being able to count on the moral and physical support of our colleague, who can be used both by the CPU and by a second player. Despite being presented as revolutionary, this addition owes necessary recognition to what has already been seen in Resident Evil Zero and, more recently, the online chapter Outbreak.", "date": "2004-09-14", "grade": null}
