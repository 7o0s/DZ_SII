{"name": "Petz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/petz.html", "text": "It's easy to compare a title like Petz to classic role-playing games, and the reason is obvious: a large part of the fun lies in making your characters ~grow~ (in this case, puppies), and seeing their statistics increase in view of trials practices. What is certain is that we will hardly have to gently caress our warrior, feed the magician or clean the thief's puppu. All things that in the new Gameloft product we will instead be required to do within a typical day, especially when our virtual home will be literally invaded by animals of all breeds and sizes. But let's go in order... At Petz we play the role of an animal breeder, basically. Our first puppy is a dog, and the first stages of the game show us how to feed and drink him, how to make him play, how to cuddle him and how to put him to sleep. A convenient notepad reminds us of the objectives to be achieved throughout the day, objectives that change and multiply as the number of animals to manage increases. In fact, not even a day will go by that the dog will be joined by a rabbit. Then a hamster. Then a kitten. Then a turtle, and so on until the bottom of the screen is filled with icons relating to every single puppy of our particular ~breeding~. Naturally, the more animals to manage, the more complicated things will become, after all, this is Petz's way of interpreting the increase in the level of difficulty. In any case, the progress of the game is never obscure: we are always guided by numerous suggestions that tell us what to do, where to go and what to buy even in the more advanced stages. The main objective is to never let the animals lack for anything, which are equipped with a mood bar similar to those of the various The Sims (although, fortunately, the needs in this case are limited to eating and drinking). Our house is divided into zones that can be accessed as you progress, and certainly one of the most important places is the garden, because that's where our little friends have the most fun and because it's possible to feed them of plants, responsible for improving the characteristics. Outside the home we can go to the shop (to buy food, toys, accessories and even other animals - at exorbitant prices, moreover) or to the stadium (to test the ability of our puppies). As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Petz is very well done. The sprites of the various animals boast a good number of animations and a well-chosen design, in short, they do their job perfectly. The house is also well designed and quite rich in details, in particular the use of colors is excellent and gives the graphics that sense of ~cartoony~ which never hurts. The sound sector is functional to the action, but nothing more. Finally, the control system is simple and immediate: using the joystick we can move a hand-shaped cursor around the house, while with the FIRE button (or 5) we access a series of different actions (calling the puppies, interacting with them and with the setting). The notepad with the daily objectives can be consulted by pressing the left function key, while by pressing the hash key we can scroll through our animals to check their mood bar and intervene promptly in case of dissatisfaction. PRO Simple and fun Nice and colorful graphics Lots of puppies and objects to manage AGAINST Animals all behave the same way The further you go, the more complicated it becomes The game takes us a little too much by the hand", "date": "2007-10-25", "grade": "S.V."}
