{"name": "Halo 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/halo-2-recensione.html", "text": "DirectX 10? No thank you But let's go in order: once the installation is complete, by launching the executable you will be crossed by a subtle shiver along the spine, when the game will ask you to create a Live profile!, confirming your choices with the red B key on your pad. Not bad, it will have escaped the developers that these keys do not exist on PCs, but fortunately the integration of the mouse and keyboard is one of the most successful aspects of this questionable conversion. Yet the details are set to High... Once the profile has been created, the first thought that will cross your gray matter will be that of configuring the game: we wrongly thought that, since Halo 2 is only compatible with Vista, we would have had to prepare ourselves for graphics entirely in DX10, ready to squeeze every single hertz of the latest 8800 GTX: unfortunately, in addition to choosing the resolution, you can only act on the level of antialiasing (up to 4 samples) and on a superficial level of detail, which can be set to High, Medium or Low. The situation begins to make you turn up your nose, but what you have discovered is nothing more than the tip of the immense iceberg against which you will collide; trying not to pay too much attention to these elements, while calling yourself an overly pretentious player, start your first game. During the introductory movie, which serves to link the two episodes of the saga, you can't help but notice that some textures just can't fit into the picture, presenting some pretty visual glitches: your first concern will fall on the brand new video card, perhaps fearing an overheating or some defect in the correct rotation of the fan: having verified its functioning, it will therefore be natural to attribute everything to the immaturity of the drivers, so as to put your soul at peace and enjoy, at least, the narrative plot. Shaders, where are you? Is the bump at home? While the introductory movie is running, we said, your attention will be drawn to the desperate poverty of the graphics: forget the presence of any shader, surfaces covered by any type of mapping and the like; you will only notice the models, made with a rather low number of polygons, textures completely in low resolution and the lighting which presents nice peek-a-boo effects: in an instant you will see projected shadows, rigorously pre-calculated and without any semblance of Radiosity (like happened in Half-Life 2), and an instant later they will mysteriously disappear. the situation begins to make you turn up your nose, but what you have discovered is nothing more than the tip of the immense iceberg against which you will collide Shaders, where are you? Is the bump at home? So the hope of seeing the first title completely in DirectX 10 collapses, considering that Halo 2 is already struggling to manage the libraries in the ninth version and it seems at first glance not too superficial, to have the same, identical graphics of three years ago . However, your judgment will be the definitive one: we therefore refer you to our gallery only to give you an idea of what can be found on the shelves in mid-2007, and of the work done by the Bungie guys for this conversion, which under the aspect purely aesthetic leaves much to be desired. Die damned alien, Die! At this point we also have to play the last card of ~the graphics don't count~, a statement that we usually rattle off when we find ourselves in front of a graphically painful title: fortunately, Halo 2 manages, at least, to save itself thanks to a one of its strengths has always been: the gameplay. Die damned alien, Die! If this is one of your first visits to the Halo universe, don't expect to find tactical combat, refined teamwork and Call of Duty degrees of empathy: once you step inside the Master Chief's green suit, your only concern will be the indiscriminate (and fun!) extermination of anything that stands in front of you, only having the foresight to take shelter when the level of your shields will be too low. Your opponents, on the other hand, will certainly not wait motionless for their premature end: thanks to the skill of the programmers, both in creating some scripts for the AI and in creating the enemies, the level of challenge offered is quite varied, and will force you to adopt new fighting techniques for each different enemy you will face. For example, it will be absolutely useless (or unwise) to throw tons of bullets at an alien equipped with an energy shield, given its obvious resistance, while a good grenade or a weapon with bouncing bullets will be able to resolve the conflict in few moments. If you want to find, within the gameplay, a negative point, undoubtedly it can be found, despite what has been said just above, right in the Artificial Intelligence: although the developers have created some particularly successful scripts ad hoc, your enemies will never show themselves up to the soldiers of F.E.A.R. and they won't be able to coordinate in team attacks, making your life extraordinarily simple: however we don't feel like penalizing this aspect excessively, given that in the frenzy of Halo 2 combat, you will hardly notice the IQ of yet another alien. Interesting, even if already seen at the gates of 2007, the idea of integrating the gameplay with vehicles, ranging from the famous Warthog (the green armored jeep), to the indestructible Scorpion tank, passing through a whole series of alien vehicles: yes unfortunately, it is a ploy that breaks the frenzy of foot combat, but which unfortunately fails to integrate completely into the gameplay, either for a continuous feeling of deja vu, or for the constricting level design, which will force you to go through always predefined binaries. One question, however, arises spontaneously: considering that the gaming universe is evolving at an impressive rate, why investing 50 for a graphically dated title with game mechanics now expanded and improved by other titles? Late. Too late, unfortunately. If the graphics disappoint a lot, the gameplay manages to balance the situation: it is still about Halo and its magnificent universe. The main point in favor of this Bungie recycling lies precisely in the charismatic presence of Master Chief (the alter ego that you will be called to impersonate), a figure who is particularly exalted during in-game movies and during missions: if for some reason should the Covenant cause problems, you will always impersonate the solution. The narrative plot is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most satisfying aspect of this title: trying not to reveal too much about the plot, we can tell you that there are some interesting twists and turns, such as some game sessions in which you will be called no more to impersonate the Green Taricone, but also his direct antagonist. The interesting aspect is that, as already happened in the Xbox title, the dynamics of the gameplay is slightly altered from the usual ~slaughter everything that moves~, in a more tactical ~slaughter everything that moves, but sometimes hide~ , making use of the optical camouflage device supplied to the Covenant forces. Excuse me, where are you going? A special applause also to the right cinematographic choices, created ad hoc to enhance the figure of the protagonist: on more than one occasion you will find yourself smiling in front of the contemptuous jokes of your protagonist, also exalted by particular camera positions in the films: if it weren't for dated graphics, surely Halo 2 could establish itself as a real interactive film, worthy of the best Hollywood masterpieces. Comment All in all, Halo 2 is a controversial title. On the one hand we have a rather obscure commercial maneuver by Microsoft (why limit Halo 2 to Windows Vista only?), which wants to sell a product essentially identical to its console counterpart, with outdated graphics and fun game mechanics, but already seen and devoid of any innovation. On the other side, that of the positive aspects, we have Halo and everything that this brand means: frenetic action without too many headaches, a high quality sci-fi universe and an absolutely charismatic protagonist, who is given particular prominence in this second chapter. How to answer the fateful question: to buy it or not to buy it? In our opinion yes, without a doubt, if you are a fan of the universe and of Master Chief, while carefully pondering your decision if you only love the genre: you can find better in shops and this is undeniable. Pros A lot of adrenaline-pumping action Fun multiplayer There is Master Chief Cons Better not to mention the graphics Game mechanics without innovations Only for Windows Vista Too expensive System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz or AMD 2200+ RAM: 1 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 6100 or ATI Radeon X1700 or higher Disk Space: 7.0 GB Windows Vista. Test configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 at 2.7 Ghz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Ultimate The game, having graphics dating back to 2004, generates a disproportionate number of frames (between 150 and 230 ), although it was set to 1650x1050 resolution, with FSAA at 4x and details set to High. Halo 2 could easily run on PC even di low-end, given the actual hardware requirements, but binding this game to the presence of Windows Vista will oblige you to have, however, a good medium/high-end desktop, with at least 1.5 GB of RAM. Chasing Xbox Live The multiplayer, the real spearhead of the console title, always proves to be very frenetic and fun, but even in this aspect, the past three years make themselves felt. However, the PC version of the game offers a new map (called District, particularly suitable for snipers and ambushes), which supports a good number of other places where you can massacre, with full knowledge of the facts, any opponent you will come across: consider that the gameplay is not distorted, so you will find yourself catapulted into maps with frenetic and continuous action, light years away from the teamwork required in competing titles, such as Armed Assault or America's Army. However, let's go back to the discussion just above: if Halo 2, in 2004, had upset the genre, it is undeniable that its game mechanics, however entertaining, can easily be found, improved and expanded, in more recent titles. On the other hand, it must be recognized that Halo 2 in the PC version is making itself heard also because it is the first title to support the PC counterpart of Xbox Live, the appreciated partially paid service. Also in this case we have the subdivision between silver and gold users, a subdivision which however tends to flatten out given that the key reason for the subscription collapses on PC: the possibility of playing online which, with the exception of MMOGs, is always completely free on PC and independent from Microsoft (which is not true on Xbox and Xbox 360 where to be able to play multiplayer you need to be a Live Gold user). However, the possibility of using an Xbox Live account remains interesting in the event that one already has one. An eventuality that marries perfectly with the Objectives which, directly transported by Xbox 360, are also present for the first time on a PC game with Halo 2. Let's also dispel a false myth that had been spreading in the community for some time: the users PC will not be able to compete with console users, given that this new platform, currently in the works, has not yet been fully developed and is not present in this Microsoft title. Three years behind the PC market, Microsoft and Bungie have finally agreed to release one of their best console titles of 2004. With its arrival, some questions also arise about Microsoft's decision to allow Halo 2 only on systems equipped with Windows Vista, considering that DirectX 10, as we will see, are not used in the least by the graphics engine: perhaps a curious commercial ploy to increase sales of the latest operating system from the Redmond house? Or maybe this is an experiment to test the capabilities of the Live system? So many questions, many unanswered: but in the end, if you're having fun, why ruin your days instead of spending them slaughtering the Covenant again?", "date": "2007-06-07", "grade": null}
