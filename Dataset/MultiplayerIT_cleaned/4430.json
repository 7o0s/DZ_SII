There was a lot of curiosity around the first expansion pack for Call of Duty: WWII, especially since the Second World War would not allow Sledgehammer to vary the themes and imagery as Treyarch and Infinity Ward did in the last two chapters. No playgrounds, nuclear stations or takeaways to storm but new war-worn cities, extremely difficult to differentiate and make unique, a truly complex job given the great expectations of the fans. On zombies, on the other hand, we didn't have major perplexities since it was easier to propose something new by being able to play with science and crossing that thin line that separates fantasy from historical realism. Will The Resistance have succeeded in surprising us? A long journey between France and Germany Before listing the actual contents of this additional package, at the dawn of 2018, we want to make a general consideration on the distribution method and on the enormous amount of modalities that each COD now contains within it. As you well know, this year Call of Duty brought us the Nazi Zombies, a rather satisfying singleplayer campaign, dozens of diverse and solid multiplayer game modes, and War mode as well. At this point, each individual DLC tries in its own way, or at least it is the case of this first package, to add something to each of the elements mentioned. So we have three competitive maps that have entered the multiplayer rotation, a new map for War and a new campaign for Zombies, plus a whole host of free content added to flesh out the offer for casual soldiers. However, there is a basic problem within these packages: most players will hardly enjoy and appreciate all the material equally. So the three maps for multiplayer are fine, but often those who play in multi and do it competitively ignore or leave out the zombie mode, as well as War. In this way, we find ourselves paying the canonical 15 euros to find ourselves using only half of the contents created, a waste that perhaps should be revised in the future. In short, we would like the Season Pass to obviously include all the new modes and maps, but that the latter were then perhaps split into smaller packages in order to leave the end user complete flexibility for purchase. Hoping that this will happen on the next few occasions, for now we just have to continue evaluating the DLCs as a whole, emphasizing at the same time how this year Sledgehammer has done its utmost to also bring new content for those who do not intend to face further expenses on COD. First of all the new resistance class, an infantryman equipped with passive perks that can confuse the enemies' mini-maps, reveal their orientation and is equipped with a tactical knife that he can hold at the same time as a pistol: extremely useful in close quarters and in veteran mode. But be careful because the enemies will always be alerted to your presence precisely because of the disturbance of the mini map, a double-edged sword that will force you to play intelligently during matches. Three maps, a thousand houses The Resistance marks the overbearing return of snipers to Call of Duty: WWII with maps that leave room for very long corridors where shooters can have good times and bad times. Among the three maps proposed here, as always, there is also the classic remake, a good choice for both nostalgic and new players, who can thus taste some of the best maps of the old CODs. Occupation is a map that simply works, it manages to offer a medium-sized environment of extreme quality, it's fun to play and well balanced also in terms of respawns. Both simple kill and objective-based modes perform well for a really great overall map. Anthropoid is the largest playing area presented in this package but not only, even the largest in the whole title. Here the firing lines are almost all clean and it is possible to be killed by players stationed very easily, with all the camping that follows. However, it also introduces the possibility of swimming for short distances, a mechanic that does not add particular tactical depth but which finally avoids the instantaneous deaths of soldiers who ended up in pools just over a meter deep. The last map however, called Valkyrie is really fun to play. It is a location with high rhythmsvati but the respawn points are good and allow for a variety of approaches. You can choose to use light machine guns and engage in close quarters or go back to sniper rifles and cover the sides of the playing area. Two fixed positions also appear to keep an entire corridor under control: decisive in veteran but also dangerous in all team deathmatch modes, an unusual choice that will certainly cause players to discuss in the weeks to come. Unreal Tournament in WWII We have always liked War Mode a lot even if in the Call of Duty: WWII community it has always remained on the sidelines. Operation Intercept will once again put you in the most complete tussle by testing your resistance in a very difficult map for stormtroopers. The first impact and the first idea we got is that the areas to be defended are extremely simple to keep under control, with extra coordination necessary for the attack teams to be able to complete their tasks. During the initial phase you will have to open the doors of two cells and extract the six prisoners. The rooms are really narrow and the continuous rain of grenades and the very few entrances available (only two per room if the defenders build the barriers) will make the heart of the battle become a real slaughterhouse. Both breaking down the doors and freeing the hostages is an operation that requires you to remain motionless for a few seconds, a practice that is not very simple given the enemy respawn points so close to the area. The same problem, this time also for defense, is relived in the second point with the almost total impossibility of building barriers as in the other War maps. Furthermore, in this case the multiple radios to be destroyed, despite the green borders, are not very easy to discover and you will be required at least a couple of games to memorize their position, thus avoiding wasting unnecessary time looking for the last radio to be destroyed. A map that will improve over time and whose precarious balance could balance as players learn to exploit its weaknesses and strengths but which for now does not seem to have been created with due care and attention. The last part of the operation instead involves escorting a tank, a trick already used in two other maps and therefore rather redundant. The idea of being able to open the doors of the convoys to change the lines of fire is good, but it is little to revive a scenario that has not managed to fully convince us. And even today Zombie for breakfast The last part of the huge The Resistance package could only be dedicated to Nazi Zombies and their dedicated mode. However, we do not want to dwell too much on this particular aspect of the game since the basics are the same that we have now learned to appreciate, but rather try to understand what strange direction the team dedicated to the design of the Isle of Darkness has taken. In fact, unlike the old zombie maps, this time we have an extremely linear mission on our hands, very easy and without too many secrets to figure out. Of course, there are always doors and gates to open, traps to activate and tools to research to continue the narrative, but the impression we got is that this time the content is aimed at a more listless type of player, devoid of that desire to find out what to do to continue. The most interesting idea of the map is the presence of a very thick fog which, at regular intervals, will disturb the players, making it practically impossible to see more than a few meters away. A nice find, made with discreet care and useful for increasing difficulty and tension, two indispensable ingredients of the zombie mode but which, in our opinion, fails to guarantee enough variety. The new enemy and the new weapon have the same effect: introductions that will soon be forgotten.", "date": "2018-02-03", "grade": "7.0"}
