{"name": "Prince of Persia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia_a.html", "text": "As probably the more observant will have noticed from the images, this episode for mobile terminals doesn't travel in parallel with the imminent 360 and Ps3 version; if in the latter case in fact Ubisoft wanted to heavily mix the cards of the series, detaching itself from the previous chapters thanks to a decidedly different game structure and graphic style, on the contrary Gameloft preferred to play it safe by treading the most obvious and simple path. And so Prince of Persia only hints at one of the most important themes of the main product, or rather the active presence of his partner Elika within the gameplay, which on the contrary in this case becomes little more than an extra, part of a very in-depth plot for don't say confused. The game structure is obviously that of a platform / adventure, on the classic mold now recycled by the French house for some years and with dozens of titles. The goal is to go through the levels using the prince's abilities, defeating enemies and avoiding traps. Yes, because as per tradition, the protagonist is a skilled athlete, capable of jumping from platform to platform, climbing and running on walls, pirouettes and things like that. obviously he does not lack sword skills, which he will often be forced to draw to eliminate the monsters scattered here and there; unfortunately in such cases the flatness of the combat system, which relies only on the frantic pressure of the 5 key to attack or 0 to defend oneself, becomes even more evident due to the modest variety of opponents present, who on the contrary repeat themselves with those 3 or 4 sprites continuously. We were talking about Elika's contribution, marginal and not very incisive; for most of the time the prince will in fact be forced to go through the levels alone, except for the occasions in which the powers of the young companion will be needed. Represented as a kind of sorceress capable of flying and shooting fireballs, Elika will in fact appear out of nowhere in the aforementioned situations; the player's task will be to abandon the protagonist's control for a few moments in favor of the girl, in most cases to reach switches or levers in order to be able to unlock a blocked passage or something similar. And fully remaining in the tradition, even in Prince of Persia Gameloft has interspersed the classic levels with short alternative sections, in this case represented by the flight on the saddle of a sort of flying dragon capable of shooting fireballs; very dull both from a technical point of view and from a playful one. Instead the graphics of the main adventure is, as often happens in this kind of product, what lifts the game from the general flatness, even though in this case too the engine is always the same and the scrolling is decidedly imperfect. The characters with good animations are quite beautiful, while the environments, colorful and rich in detail, are of an excellent level. On the other hand, the sound is insufficient, not very incisive with a handful of effects and little more. PRO Technically good Still quite fun AGAINST The usual Gameloft adventure Repetitive Poor longevity", "date": "2008-10-31", "grade": "S.V."}
