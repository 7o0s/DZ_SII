{"name": "Cake Mania 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cake-mania-2_a.html", "text": "The eternal dilemma that anyone who plans a video-auditory sequel involves, i.e. changing at the risk of not equaling the first episode or staying on the exact same tracks, has seen RealArcade move decisively towards the second option for this Cake Mania 2: in fact, the product appears in many ways indistinguishable from the previous one, to the point that it would be more correct to speak of data-disk. The play structure is therefore the same: in the role of Jill, the user must take hold of a vast series of pastry shops and bring them to success by churning out sweets like hell. Those who have played titles such as Diner Dash will immediately feel at ease, as here too there is a pattern that must be repeated in the most profitable way possible: therefore, you must first take the customers' orders at the counter, then bake the cake, decorate it properly and deliver it to the rightful owner by withdrawing the payment money. A process that must be repeated in each stage with very slight variations, in order to obtain the necessary amount of money within the time limit. It goes without saying that such a structure lends itself to repetitiveness, accentuated by the fact that - as mentioned at the beginning - little or nothing has changed compared to the prequel. Graphically, the game has remained substantially the same, if we exclude the new look of the customers and the implementation of some rather picturesque scenarios (in fact, it happens to sell cakes underwater or even on the Moon) which however do not affect the global picture that much . One of the few innovations concerns a greater complexity of the Story Mode, with a slightly more articulated plot - but unfortunately peppered with dialogues that should entertain but only bore you - and a series of crossroads which, however, do not lead to significant changes. It would therefore be legitimate to criticize RealArcade for having continued so slavishly in the footsteps of the first Cake Mania: however, credit must be given to this second chapter for still proving to be extremely accessible and quite fun, two key factors in mobile gaming but which are often lost sight of. What is certain is that attaching the number ~2~ to a product so similar to the previous one is almost a joke...
