{"name": "Q.U.B.E.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/97196-qube-erno-rubik-chi-era-costui.html", "text": "Invented in 1974 by the Hungarian architect of the same name, the Rubik's Cube is considered one of the most famous toys ever, with more than three hundred and fifty million pieces sold worldwide. Equipped with six faces and as many colors, this curious puzzle has quite a few things in common with Q.U.B.E., the first-person action puzzle developed by Toxic Games and available on a series of digital stores from December 16th (it will also arrive on Steam on January 6). Firstly, the gameplay of the game is entirely based on solving puzzles, the complexity of which increases progressively, through a really well thought out crescendo. Second, colors play a huge role in its mechanics; and although one is not asked to put the faces of a cube together making their shades coincide, in practice all the elements of interaction with the scenery are based on red, yellow, blue, green, purple and, above all, white. This last color almost entirely covers the mysterious place where our character wakes up, dressed in a suit equipped with special sensors on the gloves that allow him to control some of the many panels that surround him. The left hand provides an input, the right hand its opposite, and thanks to this ability we can point the red blocks and make them protrude more or less, make the triads of yellow blocks rise forming a ~staircase~ of nature different depending on which panel we activate first, ~squeeze~ the blue blocks so that their release transforms into a catapult capable of projecting us upwards, use the green cubes as a support to reach otherwise inaccessible areas and interact with the purple panels because let them rotate a portion of the scenery according to our needs. In the more advanced stages we will even be able to ~draw~ the relative powers from these colors and give them to interactable white blocks, in a sort of reversal compared to the first half of the adventure, in which instead the neutral tone only distinguishes what on which we have no control. That is the background, which also changes and deforms as we pass, following symmetries that seem to leave nothing to chance. At least up to a certain point... Logically As mentioned, the structure of Q.U.B.E. it's all about solving increasingly complex puzzles. The progression with which these puzzles are proposed to us is really well studied and in general, in terms of style and approach, the production does not at all seem the result of the work of three former English university classmates: while remaining anchored to clearly evident tracks, the direction in fact, the artistry of the game appears mature, even capable of surprising when suddenly one passes from the sterile environments of the first part to the uprooted walls of the second, or even just to locations characterized by slightly different shades. Q.U.B.E. it's very much a mouse and keyboard game, although it supports controllers perfectly; this is because puzzles sometimes require a quick movement of the ~crosshair~ to activate blocks on the fly, especially those based on ~neutral~ spheres, whose path must be controlled quickly so that they arrive at the correct destination, opening the doors to the next area . In the first of these puzzles, for example, we are asked to operate a switch which tells the system to release a sphere, after which this rolls, due to the slope, downstream of the scenario. Along the way there are colored blocks in transparency, which the sphere must cross to color itself, and therefore reach a final ~hole~ dyed in the right shade. To achieve this we have to rotate portions of the path, thus changing the trajectory of the sphere so that it passes through the transparent blocks and finally arrives at its destination. I see / I don't see The gameplay of Q.U.B.E. it therefore focuses on a single element, puzzle solving, but in this sense an excellent job has been done to make the experience as varied as possible, proposing always different puzzles. For example, having introduced the functionality of colored blocks, the game will project us into a series of completely dark environments, in which the very familiar shades allow us to distinguish the outlines of the scenario. The same colors, however, will ~turn off~ as soon as we have used their functions, asking us to memorize the position of the blocks already used while we act on the others. Once this possibility has also been explored, we will find ourselves having to activate switches by moving cubes to the correct position and making them invest in a ray of light. In short, the developers seem to haver really exploited every possible combination, eventually even giving us the freedom to assign certain colors to neutral blocks, effectively making the resolution of puzzles even more free and subject to multiple variations. Ultimately, a work of extraordinary quality, but always limited to a single element, so much so that in fact there are no ~sidelines~ with respect to the main mode. This does not constitute a huge defect, starting from the assumption that the whole experience is proposed to us as something unique and unrepeatable, which in the end corresponds to the truth, but more had to be done in terms of the plot, to encourage us to see ~what's next~ not only for the sake of challenging the next puzzle, but also to know who the character we control is and what he's doing inside that mysterious structure. Questions to which even the final sequence does not provide precise answers. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the graphics flawlessly render the starting idea of the game, the ~sterile~ and symmetrical environment which however at a certain point begins to ~corrupt~. There isn't much to see apart from the colored blocks and the endless white walls, but the protagonist's hands are very well done and on more than one occasion there are similarities with Mirror's Edge, although the platform component is indeed basic. In short, even in visual terms Q.U.B.E. does very little but does it very well, supported by an electronic soundtrack that accompanies the action without standing out.", "date": "2011-12-27", "grade": "7.5"}
