Even in the multimedia field, the fascinating animal kingdom, with its many facets, has given rise to wonderful films and documentaries as well as (sometimes) amusing video games. Of course, usually the protagonist creatures of similar works have a ~humanized~ appearance and are almost always sweet and nice in the eyes of the viewer / user, but the approach chosen by Anthill: Tactical Trail Defense (henceforth simply Anthill) is however different : behind the appearance of an old-fashioned strategic title it is in fact possible to see a touch of the always green Tower Defense, also seasoned with an unusual splatter-insectivorous vein that is certainly not cheerful or nice. Alternative Chinese food The trivial but always effective plot that forms the background to the events narrated in Anthill features an active anthill located in the center of an unspecified forest, inhabited as known by various categories of industrious insects. In fact, alongside the simple workers, tasked with carrying out the humblest jobs (including the transport of food), other types of ants live in the complex structure, among which those of military rank stand out in importance, ending up with the highest step occupied by the queen. The army generals in particular, responsible for the defense of the anthill (and of the queen), therefore have the difficult task of coordinating the different types of troops that can be recalled; however, the actual distribution of forces on the battlefield is up to the player. The only way to push the insects out of hiding is to create real pheromone tracks on the ground: with a simple slide, it will therefore be enough to draw a line that leads from the entrance of the structure to the place in question, to finally see the ants begin to move attracted by the irresistible call. The trails of smells obviously have different fragrances available, each of which is able to ~recall~ a specific type of insect: in particular the blue ones refer to the workers, the yellow ones to simple soldiers, the purple ones to the armored ground troops and the orange to the air troops, here played by agile moths. The types of enemies to be faced are different and rather dangerous: they range from small and slow worms to voracious ladybugs (which from the point of view of ants certainly do not bring luck), up to large cockroaches and unlikely insects with a very worrying appearance. However, the choice by the programmers to show the death of the opposing insects in a crude way, bordering on splatter, is decidedly non-standard: in fact, once killed, each victim of the army of ants literally explodes, leaving body fluids on the battlefield and the carcass of its exoskeleton; only at this point, like macrophages, do the workers intervene to collect the remains which, in a realistic but also rather ugly way to see, thus become food (and therefore a resource) for the production of other units. In addition to the corpses, scattered throughout the various levels, it is also possible to recover bonuses in the form of gems, the excessive weight of which will require the support of numerous ants for transport. Anthill's ultimate goal is therefore resistance to the various waves of attack on the anthill, expertly managing the pheromone binaries and the creation of troops based on the resources present. Then there are some superworms in the boss version, without however changing the approach to battle much; in general, however, the three game chapters present are finished in a short time, a sign that once you understand the mechanism, the level of challenge is certainly not very high. The upgrade system for the troops, based on the experience points collected at the end of a stage, also contributes to making the approach to battle less demanding; despite the possibility of ~cheating~ by purchasing points through microtransactions, enhancing the different abilities of the soldiers actually proves to be an operation within everyone's reach. Technically speaking, the developers' choice to make the game more ~adult~ is really spot on: the worms and ants, as well as all the other insects are reproduced in a very realistic and credible way, therefore far from the cartoonish standards of Disney or similar; if it weren't for the presence of deliberately brighter colors than normal, we would have been in the presence of a title not recommended for entomophobic people (or, more simply, for all those who are afraid of insects).
