The very latest novelty for Kinect is in fact the videogame transposition of a famous Japanese TV Show called ~Nkabe~, nicknamed by the videos that appeared on youtube as the ~human Tetris~ and then also replicated on American TV and in some Italian broadcasts. Basically it is a question of having to physically ~enter~ through a specially created shape in a wall. However, we are not the ones who have to actively go through it, but just stand still assuming the required position because the wall moves in our direction and, in case of wrong position, it will drag us into the (virtual) pool behind us. It's probably easier to understand by trying to watch a video directly, than by explaining it, but it's a really simple concept that adapts wonderfully naturally to the Xbox 360 Kinect. Hole in the Wall is a game that marries perfectly with the concept born at the base with Kinect: making video games fun even for those who are not gamers. ~Also~ obviously implies that even hardcore gamers can find a source of satisfaction in these games, especially if played in the company of friends, boyfriends or children. With (only) ten levels available we can choose whether to tackle them individually or choose the ~Show~ option, with which we proceed step by step: each level consists of 3 steps and a final, slightly more difficult test. Finally, each step is composed of a series of ~themed~ poses: the seasons, for example. In the winter level we have to assume positions typically used by skiers; egg-shaped, poised on skis, on the ski lift, and so on. Hole in the Wall is definitely fun but it lacks a real purpose of the game as in addition to the score obtained you win absolutely nothing, and the game does not ~unlock~ anything apart from the classic Xbox 360 achievements. Furthermore, the spirit of the TV show was to amuse the spectators thanks to the disastrous falls into the swimming pool placed behind the participants. In the Xbox game, for obvious reasons, there is none of this and therefore even defeat makes little sense as it is ~non-punitive~. For those who could afford it, we strongly recommend placing an inflatable pool behind the players and imposing the bathroom in a forced way in case of error (it could be a good peripheral). Xbox 360 goals Like any game downloadable from Xbox Live Arcade, this Hole in the Wall is giving away 200 points to unlock, through 12 objectives. It's very simple to get them precisely because of the extreme brevity of the game: each of the ten levels can be completed in about ten minutes at the most, and once the game is completed all 200 points will be automatically obtained. How to lose dignity with a video game Undoubtedly, taking absurd and comical positions in front of friends is fun, especially considering that the Kinect camera constantly shoots us and photographs the best moments, also allowing us to save them in HD. A great way to lose that shred of dignity you might have - before - starting to play. Camera tracking is great, provided you have a suitable and sufficient space for two people to writhe and writhe. A lot is played with horizontal lines: the figures drawn on the walls are not always central but rather, they range from right to left forcing us to move continuously in search of the best pose. Obviously it is impossible to be able to perfectly center the ~cutout~ on the wall, and here comes the scoring system studied by the developers. Once the wall has started in our direction, you get a higher score the faster you are in finding the right position. Also, ~covering~ most of the space with your body (which is displayed on-screen with a green shadow) results in an extra bonus. In the worst case scenario, i.e. not getting the pose right at all, the step is repeated. The real Game Over takes place only if we make mistakes three times in the same pattern, otherwise the game goes on. There is an online leaderboard to compare our scores with those of friends on Xbox Live, but the longevity of the game is still very, very short. Finally, there is very little to say on the technical front. Graphically the game is really bare and does not display anything but the wall with the shapes, our avatar and the virtual pool in which we fall in case of error. Even the sound sector certainly does not shine and stands out (by waysay) for quite repetitive and uncharacteristic jingles. The programmers have done very, very little work in this area. The concept of the game is really interesting and we are sure that a developer with more resources could make a title of this genre with a more layered, satisfying and long-lasting gameplay. For now, Hole in the Wall represents nothing but a little more than a ~concept game~ made in a short time and it is mostly a curious pastime that could elicit more than a smile if played in the company of friends and relatives. but nothing else. Being a download from Xbox Live, it has the price on its side and therefore it's worth a try.", "date": "2011-08-30", "grade": null}
