{"name": "La flotta di cartone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106169-toon-shooters-la-flotta-di-cartone.html", "text": "Fourteen scenarios, each characterized by different dynamics, thirteen challenging boss fights, almost sixty unique enemies, eight characters to choose from, an arena for survival mode and even cooperative multiplayer for two players on the same device, taking advantage of the multitouch capabilities of the iPhone and iPads. These are the numbers of Toon Shooters, and these are truly significant figures if we think that the title developed by Mooff Games is distributed at the modest price of 1.59 euros on the App Store. The game bases its appeal primarily on cartoonish, hand-drawn graphics, which use strokes and colors very well to represent irresistible subjects, with a funny but no less lethal appearance. In fact, it is enough to start a game to realize, a few moments later, that the gameplay is anything but a joke, it is definitely not something for children and indeed it goes to fish some of the most characteristic elements of the shooter genre to put them on the plate and enrich the game. offer: various types of smart bombs, directional fire, upgrades to be purchased based on the points collected, support pods and ~disposable~ bonuses, which perhaps can be used to succeed in eliminating a particularly difficult boss. There are two characters that Toon Shooters makes available to us right away, Otis and Ben: the first is a funny purple bird on board a ship with traditional functions, i.e. equipped with a main weapon that shoots towards the right of the screen and simultaneously of powerful bombs that are released on the ground; the second is a smiling boy equipped with a jetpack and a rifle, whose movements require particular attention since the fire is directed as opposed to moving. To unlock the other six (Gary, Angelica, Daisy, Engleburt, Calbee and Paul) you have to shell out from 18,000 to 500,000 ~dollars~, nest egg to be scraped together with a little patience or by putting your wallet in the purchase of packets of money through an in-app purchase system. Whichever you choose, the game will reward you with respectable content, lots of fun and excellent replay value. Shooter cartoons The action of Toon Shooters, as mentioned above, varies according to the theme of each scenario: in some cases the scrolling is purely horizontal, there are ~swarms~ of opponents who come towards us and we have to eliminate as many as possible as we go forward; in others, scrolling speeds up, there are obstacles to avoid and times to calculate on the fly so as not to suffer too much damage. The presence of an energy bar (and bonus for recharging it) avoids episodes of frustration deriving from the much feared ~sudden deaths~, which in this context would have made the experience really too difficult, while the possibility of enhancing one's character spending the ~money~ earned in the stages proves to be a very well implemented element in the structure, so much so that in some cases we will necessarily have to repeat the levels to get the cue needed to defeat a particular boss. And it will be a pleasure to cope with this task, the gameplay is so solid and the touch controls are immediate and precise; to the point that the developers even thought of including a cooperative mode for two players on the same device, taking advantage of the multitouch functions of the iPhone and iPad. It goes without saying that on the screen of the Apple tablet it works quite well, while it will be difficult to combine something in this situation on the relatively small display of the iPhone.", "date": "2012-07-26", "grade": "8.5"}
