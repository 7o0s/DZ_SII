{"name": "Ghost Giant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-giant-recensione.html", "text": "Announced at E3 last year, Ghost Giant represents the debut of Zoink Games on PlayStation VR: the authors of Fe and Flipping Death have shown in the course of their works that they have no fear in varying registers and styles of play, and this latest release is a confirmation of an absolutely virtuous trend. Ghost Giant is in fact an experience that could be defined as an ideal point of contact between a classic point-and-click adventure and a modern virtual reality product, topped off with a peculiar graphic style, top-level sound accompaniment and a plot that cannot leave you indifferent. If the picture described has intrigued you even the slightest bit, continue reading this review, because Ghost Giant could really deserve your attention. The Great Gentle Giant (and ghost) The player takes on the role of the phantom giant who gives the title to the game, who suddenly appears to little Luis, an anthropomorphic kitten grappling with problems much bigger than him. Without wanting to reveal too much about a plot that is undoubtedly one of Ghost Giant's greatest strengths, let's just say that Zoink once again undoubtedly proves capable of dealing with the right balance between lightness and seriousness even very thorny subjects (depression, in this case), giving his work a fairy-tale tone that always leaves room for irony and yet does not spare a few punches in the stomach. The narrative arc unfolds through 14 scenes which in fact constitute the game levels, in which the user must try to help Luis in different ways: translated into practical terms, this means that you have to use the Move controllers to simulate the giant's hands , acting on the scenario and on the characters that populate it as needed. The feeling is that of a point and click adventure in a simplified form, with progress that is marked by puzzles that most often require you to locate certain objects, manipulate them or place them in the right position. Nothing incredibly bizarre or transcendental, of course, but all activities that are pleasant and rewarding also thanks to the excellent work done by the developers on the control system: by holding down the main Move button, the giant's hand index finger is extended to press buttons and interact in various ways with Luis and the other characters, while with the trigger you grab things that can then be pulled, pushed, thrown, shook and so on. Playstation 4 trophies Ghost Giant offers 32 trophies, including 12 bronze, 15 silver, 4 gold and one platinum, the latter unlockable after obtaining all the others. While bronze trophies are awarded for completing the chapters that make up the story, for the others it is necessary to perform specific actions within the various scenes and collect hidden objects. Nothing prohibitive, however, for a title that certainly does not aim for hardcore users in this area. A very inspired design allows Ghost Giant to flow without ever being limited or repetitive even though the basic mechanics are really elementary: the levels always offer something new to do and gradually introduce new possibilities for interaction between Luis and the giant, and this is an undoubted merit of the Zoink developers, who are also to be congratulated for their commitment in the artistic and technical sector of the product. The diorama style of the settings and the Animal Crossing look of the characters is spot on, to say the least, and the immersive effect is more than convincing, even if there is no actual movement in space: you really get the feeling of be a giant grappling with a living and pulsating microcosm, and the game often stimulates the user to physically lean and lean to better observe what surrounds him. In this regard, the scenarios are full of small details and secrets to discover, while the musical accompaniment and the English dubbing (with Italian subtitles) punctuate an adventure that has the only great demerit of ending too soon . Three hours are more than enough to see the end credits, and the only mild replayability factor is represented by the hidden objects in the various scenes that must be found to reach 100% completion and also obtain the consequent trophies.", "date": "2019-04-26", "grade": "8.2"}
