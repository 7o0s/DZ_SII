The latter has modified many game systems, some with truly excellent results, despite a slowdown in the games that many players did not like (however they are fixing with new patches). This is not an unnecessary clarification, because patch and expansion were launched at the same time and getting confused is very easy. After all, one of Apocalypse's problems is precisely the comparison with the 2.0 patch, which is decidedly richer in terms of content and news (it would require a separate article to be illustrated). Of course, one could say that if the game were not maintained by the sale of expansions and various DLCs, the development of updates would certainly be stopped, but the fact remains that the comparison is inevitable, especially on the part of those who have been playing it for a very long time. As is inevitable with the previous expansion, Utopia, which is also much richer. In short, as you may have already understood Apocalypse has not completely convinced us. All that remains is to explain why. What does Apocalypse introduce? The major contents introduced by Apocalypse are essentially three: the Marauder race, the Titan class ships and super weapons called Colossus. Let's go in order. The Marauders are a race of space nomads who work as mercenaries. They are found in different systems and, in the face of better organization and greater power, function much like the good old space pirates. Basically, factions can hire them to attack other targets, be they enemies, friends or even other groups of Marauders. The key difference with the other mercenaries is that about halfway through the game, the Marauders can unify under a leader, called the Great Khan, and start expanding on their own as if they were a full-fledged civilization. Semi barbarians yes, but also Earth history buffs, it seems. Another difference is that they are much more insistent than normal mercenaries and in the long run, if underestimated, they are decidedly more dangerous. In truth, when you understand how they operate, they're not particularly difficult to keep at bay, so they quickly wear out their criminal appeal. On balance they work more like a variant of an already existing mechanic than like a real new content. They may have some tactical utility, but don't expect them to revolutionize your games. The Titan-class ships, on the other hand, are the most relevant novelty of Apocalypse, as well as the best made. These are gigantic warships capable of taking down any opponent with a single shot, apart from other ships of the same class. However, their power is not limited to offensive power alone, because they also have a support function. In fact, the ships that gravitate in their area of influence get big bonuses or penalties, depending on whether they are friendly or enemy. Obviously you can't produce entire fleets of them, but having one is enough to make a difference in battle. Unfortunately they are not very customizable and, it must be said, they are not even too original, because before Apocalypse there were already mods that did something similar. Probably by introducing them, the Paradox developers wanted to institutionalize an idea that gamers liked a lot. In short, they wanted to play it safe. Finally there are the four Colossus superweapons, the ones that earned the expansion its high-sounding title. Unlockable with an Ascension perk, they are gigantic and so powerful that they can destroy entire planets, or exclude them from the rest of the universe. Spiritualists can even develop one capable of converting all the inhabitants of a celestial body with a single blow. They are certainly spectacular to use, the problem is that after trying all four of them, they quickly wear out of their usefulness and charm. The reason? Producing them costs a lot, they have stringent requirements and very long times of use. In short, apart from some desperate cases, creating a Colossus weapon means wasting a lot of time on it to obtain benefits that are often not even as useful as they might seem at first glance. Soft apocalypse For the rest, unfortunately, Apocalypse introduces very few new features. Paradoxically though, some of the new Civics and new Ascension Perks produce more interesting game effects than Colossus and Marauder weapons, even though they are standard additions. In short, destroying a planet the first time is also fun, as well as using the Titan ships is definitely somethingthat Stellaris fans will love. The fact remains that Apocalypse fails to give that little bit more that one might have expected, especially after the excellent Utopia expansion. Even from a technical point of view, there are few innovations. Titan spaceships are cool, as are Colossus. As already mentioned though, they are not customizable, so they don't have much to offer in terms of variety. What else to say? Let's hope that the next expansion, which we don't actually know if there will be or not, will be more effective than this one, recommended only for ultra enthusiasts.", "date": "2018-03-04", "grade": "6.0"}
