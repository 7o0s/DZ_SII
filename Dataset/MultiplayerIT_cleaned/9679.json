The latest incarnation of the series, finally in our hands, is a real hell of variables that come from dozens of leagues and thousands of teams. But Football Manager 2011 isn't just a huge collection of statistics used to decide the outcome of matches. The role of the coach is in fact increasingly central and not only in terms of strategy and market signings. Football Manager makes the surrounding elements relevant, gives us the possibility to influence the market and players and tries to simulate the entire football circus to give users a complete experience. Emotions and entertainment Fortunately, at least for those who are more interested in the purely football component, almost all the surrounding elements can be managed quickly or automatically thanks to the interface that tries to compensate for the immense amount of variables and information that reach the player. But it is good to know that these are not marginal components. In fact, interviews are fundamental and it is important to dialogue with the players to maintain their attachment to the team and manage all the unexpected events that characterize the life of a footballer. And the life of the players, their aspirations and our answers to questions from the press, which in brackets have risen from 500 to 650, affect both team morale and newspaper news and therefore the transfer market and the behavior of ready opposing teams to exploit any weakness or to fall into our traps. And let it be clear, not always avoiding answering questions is a wrong path, especially if the risk is to unleash disputes with journalists and coaches. Having overcome the press and public opinion, we find an equally rich and varied management sector, but also in this case there is no lack of various automatisms dedicated to those who do not have too many hours to spend behind the thousands of variables put in place by Football Manager 2011. Total management And the facilitations are fundamental given the enormous number of variables, news and market moves that continually assail us. Luckily every single window has a tutorial that explains what to do and every decision, including the stipulation of contracts, can be managed by consulting your staff. An entire team of collaborators is in fact at our disposal and each assistant has specific skills that allow us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the opponents, the characteristics of young players, plausible offers for a foreign champion and so on. And it all flows into the prematch meeting, or rather a pre-match meeting that summarizes most of the variables involved in relation to the upcoming match. But small details are also essential, such as the colored marker next to each shirt that indicates whether or not the player is comfortable in that position, which allow us to touch up imperfections without wasting too much time. In addition, scouts and other teams inform us directly about free players, promising young players and new entries in the youth team. For those who have the time and desire to fully step into the shoes of the coach there is the possibility of directly cultivating the team's youth, down to the smallest detail, and there are indispensable tools such as the Tactics Creator which includes the Set Piece Creator. This increasingly complex tool allows us to create real artificial intelligences, obviously customized by us, which increase our possibilities and our responsibilities as coaches and make each team unique. Unfortunately the Set Piece Creator is limited to some types of play and is not as technically advanced as Championship Manager's real-time play test, but given the overall richness of this title it's a small challenge that Football Manager can afford to miss . So the game philosophy is no longer only suggested using the advice for the players but with the additions of the last chapters it is now possible to structure it step by step by attributing merits, tasks and differentiated strategies to the players which allow the team to face every possible situation. Even more complex However, the commitment required to keep one's team competitive remains high and the workload, and possibilities, has grown considerably compared to the already very complex Football Manager 2010. Every player must be involved, the second team must be considered, the release clauses must protect us financially from the egos of footballers and the most tired players must be left alone.pluck and cheer yourself up on time during difficult times. The contracts are now more complex, have a separate system, and include detailed clauses, but convincing a foreign champion to play in a less famous league can be very difficult even by drawing heavily from the wallet. Fortunately, it is now possible to raise the level of general fame of the league in which we find ourselves by imposing one's team in international challenges and thus increasing the appeal of one's club towards the most demanding players. Furthermore, the possibilities for managing the players have increased, especially as regards training and dialogues which are still limited but are an addition capable of opening up very interesting future prospects. We are therefore faced with a huge number of possible interactions on each individual player and each affects morale and performance. The number of the shirt, the rest times, the degree of indispensability for the team, the degree of availability on the market of a player, the type and heaviness of the training sessions, the presence among the reserves and the discussion between coach and player are relevant . And the latter is a particularly important tool, also useful for convincing a player to stay in the team if courted by more renowned clubs, but it is also one of those elements that would need more variety. In fact, a few more choices and differences in tone depending on the character of the player would have given a lot to the atmosphere, eliminating the feeling of talking to a computer. The eye wants its part The graphics engine in this Football Manager 2011 hasn't made any particular leaps forward but it remains pleasant to see, obviously when compared with that of other management systems and certainly not with the FIFA engine. Unfortunately, despite the hundred new animations that add fluidity to the action, all those small shortcomings and defects that were already present in the previous incarnation of the title remain and which become more and more evident over time. Indeed the animations of the stops and the goalkeeper lack variety, the players often skate rather than run and the physics of the ball is not always credible. Also, there is still no ability to create and test specific attack patterns outside of matches. Obviously there are all the commands that allow you to customize the vision of the match and the statistics in real time, all the cameras imaginable and the possibility of increasing the passage of time during a match. Obviously, by increasing the speed of time, the commentary is lost which, as always, is valid and absolutely necessary to be involved in what is happening in the field. As far as the interface is concerned, as usual we are faced with a complex title but full of shortcuts and customizable windows. Furthermore, at the bottom right, we always find a link that allows you to consult the market movements and the most relevant events in the football universe. It is undoubtedly a useful shortcut to facilitate the reading of information and which allows us to breathe the atmosphere of the football world without having to wander lost among myriads of windows.", "date": "2010-11-04", "grade": "9.0"}
