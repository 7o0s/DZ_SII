{"name": "Might & Magic Heroes: Era of Chaos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/might-magic-heroes-era-of-chaos-la-recensione.html", "text": "Ubisoft has also decided to launch itself into mobile strategy RPGs with gacha elements, but with a high-sounding name like this it is easy to face the review of Might & Magic Heroes: Era of Chaos with a certain curiosity and enthusiasm. Only that the hope is rather poorly answered, because although it has interesting ideas and the charm of the famous fantasy series behind it, this game seems to have come out of the most commercially standardized mold possible for titles of this genre. There is also an aggravating circumstance, to tell the truth: just as the mobile panorama seems to realize that it has gone a little too far beyond the degree of tolerance for this type of game and above all in the indiscriminate use of micro-transactions, new production models also deriving from subscription services and a general lightening of monetization in free-to-play titles, Ubisoft presents itself with a game that instead contains all the most classic distortions of this type of product. It's kind of the same thing we did for Epic Games' Battle Breakers and this suggests that perhaps the big publishers need more time to understand precisely the new trends in the mobile market. Immediately highlighted the more negative elements, we can still say that Might & Magic Heroes: Era of Chaos still has some interesting aspects, starting right from the reference to the fantasy lore of the series that inspires it. Mind you, this could generate off-scale expectations: although the story is connected to Heroes of Might & Magic III and the structure shares some aspects, Era of Chaos is a fundamentally different game. It can be defined as a real-time strategy, even if the classification calls for somewhat different mechanics from those staged. Here it is above all a question of choosing the units to be deployed on the field and then arranging them in the best way to face the enemy armies, with the clashes which then take place automatically based on the statistics of the characters in battle. Battles and menus As often happens in this genre of games, we spend most of the time invested in Might & Magic Heroes: Era of Chaos on its numerous and intricate menus. The interface is not particularly complicated but the mechanism is always rather cumbersome: it is a question of navigating between menus and sub-menus focused above all on the management of the characters, their evolution and that of equipment and the like, in a continuous search for enhancement. There are about six different internal shops each with its own in-game currency, all linked to the loot that is obtained by advancing between the missions but also necessarily structured in such a way as to force at a certain point to resort to micro-transactions, at least for the players who more easily get sucked into the perverse mechanism and don't have the patience to wait that much. The main mode tells the story of Queen Catherine Ironfist and her struggle to rebuild the Kingdom of Erathia, essentially proposing one battle after another interspersed with rather simple narrative sequences. The fights are the core of the action even if the interaction required is limited: after having chosen the units and having arranged them, all we can do is touch the icons to cast the spells, choosing which ones to use and regulating their timing while waiting for the various cooldowns. Occasionally the situation varies a bit, presenting particularly massive and demanding opponents, but in principle it is above all a question of making the fighters evolve in order to be found with a fairly high level for the almost totally automatic clash with the enemy. The management of the characters occupies the other half of the time, in the continuous search for enhancement which is essentially reflected in the increase in statistics which gives a bit of meaning to this whole type of game. The dynamics are the well-known one: after an initial period of battles easily won, victories begin to be achieved with ever lower ratings until you find yourself losing and having to dedicate yourself to grinding to get back on the saddle, with the system tending to push towards micro-transactions . The strategic combat mechanism certainly has peculiar elements but the obsessive repetition of actions and situations makes the interest in the heat of battle pass rather quickly, making it become a routine. A particularly positive feature of Might & Magic Heroes: Era of Chaos is the Guild Adventure, which offers a multiplayer system with cooperative and competitive elements that manage to spice up the action by making the challenges more stimulating and raising the stakes, thereforeit may make sense to patiently face the initial stages of the game to reach this mode, but it is easy to get nervous beforehand, also because in terms of narration and graphic presentation the game does not detach itself from a certain anonymity, considering the quantity of similar titles present on the mobile market .", "date": "2019-12-06", "grade": "5.5"}
