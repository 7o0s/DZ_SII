In the case of Fairway Solitaire, however, the guys from Big Fish Games have gone further and have built a nice story to accompany what essentially looks like the umpteenth edition of the solitaire game: an evil marmot, which has survived any type of ordeal, he finally finds the ideal place to build his own underground lair. Too bad it's a golf course! Annoyed by the players, the clever little creature invents everything to boycott the games and convince them to change the area, but in the end who wins? We'll find out within sixty-six levels, the first six playable for free. Fairway Solitaire can in fact be downloaded for free from the App Store and asks for the payment of 79 cents only if we intend to unlock the full version, once we are convinced of its qualities. Each course can be completed with a different rating, from one to three stars, which depends on the final score of the various holes that make it up. In fact, our goal is to go under par as much as possible, and this golfing rule is applied to solitaire simply by counting the cards that remain on the screen when the deck is depleted and there are no other moves left to make. However, the classic mechanics of the card game are enriched by a large number of extras: from the bag of ~clubs~, which transform the current card into the corresponding number and therefore allow us to make extra moves during emergency situations, to thirty-two achievements that are worth gold coins, finally passing through the virtual store where you can buy various types of upgrades to survive the more advanced stages. There was the marmot packing the chocolate... Getting familiar with the philosophy of Fairway Solitaire is quite simple, also thanks to a tutorial that accompanies us until the completion of the first field, illustrating not only the value of the combos (the elimination of the greatest number of cards in a single move, i.e. without revealing another card from the deck) but also the extra maneuvers we can carry out to straighten a game that is not proceeding in the best way. The mechanics of solitaire are always the same, so you start with an open card and with a series of ~packs~ scattered on the table, but the further you go on in your ~career~ and the more complicated things get, with groups of extra cards that they remain blocked until we have eliminated all the others, which makes planning the moves of utmost importance in order to achieve the most consistent combos possible. The club purse, which we mentioned earlier, provides for the disbursement of a certain amount of gold coins (which are earned based on victories and the quality of the ~shots~) and allows us to use numbered clubs, from 1 to 9, to replace an awkward card that we wouldn't know what to pair with. However, the clubs require a cooldown period, therefore they do not represent a solution to every problem and must be used sensibly, even taking into consideration a damage limitation tactic if what interests us is the differential with par at the end of the field , which as mentioned can be made up of a variable number of holes, the results of which add up. The game structure, multifaceted and full-bodied, is accompanied by a decidedly adequate technical sector, characterized by an always clear and legible interface, with very well-arranged controls and, between one level and another, some skits starring the perfidious groundhog, not mind-blowing in terms of design but really nice.", "date": "2012-03-29", "grade": "8.8"}
