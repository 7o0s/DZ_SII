There are actually a few games that address the theme, like Jeff Minter's little gem Hover Bovver or Nikolai Usachev's more recent Grass Cutter, but by and large, very few in our industry see anything epic or entertaining in what is considered a job, even when done for oneself. An attempt to ennoble the figure of gardeners, at least the professional ones, comes the Skyhook Games simulator, published by Curve Digital, which aims to make us understand how behind the activity of grass cutting there is much more than it appears, at least when it comes to having to work on large lawns of wealthy people. As you will read in the Lawn Mowing Simulator review, the game convinced us, despite its concept aimed at a very specific type of player. Do business Lawn Mowing Simulator, a game image Lawn Mowing Simulator is not particularly complex to master. As the game progresses it becomes deeper (a bit like it happens in many other simulators, such as Farming Simulators), but the fundamental concepts that regulate it are very simple. In career mode, the player plays the role of the owner of a company that is responsible for cutting the grass in the gardens of the rich landowners of a charming town in the English countryside. Starting from relatively modest homes, the goal is to get to work for the owners of castles and estates, who make a lot of money. As soon as the game is started, we are asked to create a character with the integrated editor, then to try and buy one of the first two lawn tractors available (out of a total of twelve). Note that the vehicles belong to real manufacturers, such as Toro, SCAG and STIGA, who have licensed their use to the developers. More on that later. Having bought the first vehicle, all we have to do is start looking for some customers and finally start our business. The gameplay Naturally only the wealthiest will need your services The first thing to do once you accept a job is to find all the objects scattered on the lawn that we have the task of mowing, so as not to risk damage. That is, instead of getting into the vehicle and starting to mow the grass, you have to take a walk around the area collecting the objects left by who knows who (just grab them to eliminate them). Then you can go back to the ride-on mower, start the engine, take it out onto the lawn, lower the blades and set the height (each customer will ask for different cuts), then start walking up and down the green turf until you've reached the percentage of cut required (usually around 99%). The difficulties with which one has to deal are those typical of the activity being carried out. In the meantime, avoid overheating the engine by modulating acceleration according to the slope of the ground. The first lawns to be mowed will be essentially flat, but as your career progresses you will have to contend with very steep terrain, which will put our vehicles to the test. Another aspect to take into consideration is the fuel, which is closely linked to our ability: the more we are able to be precise in the cut, working out an advantageous path right away, the less finishing touches we will have to do in the final phase and, consequently, the less fuel we will consume. A further difficulty is given by the finishing touches: often to reach the required cutting percentage, we will have to work near flower beds. In the event that we accidentally cut some flowers or bushes, we will have a penalty, which translates into less income. Naturally, the maintenance of the vehicle is also important, so you must avoid crashing it against walls, steps or other obstacles, especially when the blade is in operation. Sure, it's still possible to fix it, but doing it costs money and all translates into less money for the company. The company grows One of the vehicles in action In any case, don't be fooled by the ~dangers~, because the action of Lawn Mowing Simulator is decidedly slow: basically you spend a lot of time going back and forth through the meadows, looking for residual tufts. It also takes tens of minutes to finish a single job, especially when you are not familiar with the vehicle and do not have advanced accessories such as strip rollers or shredders. Luckily, there's a feature that highlights uncut grass, so you never have to look. Not a big deal at first, but when you get past a certain percentage of the task done, figure out the individual ciu yourselfThe survivors are by no means immediate. Once a lawn is completed, you get the agreed money, net of the mistakes made, and you can move on to the next job or you can buy a new tractor, if you have enough money. The more jobs you carry out, the more money you accumulate, the more you can increase your fleet of vehicles and hire new employees, to mow more and more lawns and make more and more money. Wealth also brings other benefits as a dowry: for example, it can be spent to improve the headquarters, or money can be invested in marketing campaigns that attract new customers. The important thing is not to spend more than you earn, otherwise the company will go bankrupt. We reiterate, for those who haven't understood it: Lawn Mowing Simulator is a pure simulator, which adopts the rhythms and problems of the activity it imitates and which should be considered as such. If being a professional gardener doesn't appeal to you even a little, you can sail away without regrets and dedicate yourself to something else. If, on the other hand, you have a certain passion for the subject, then you won't find better around, both in terms of reconstruction of the real dynamics and for the care with which the vehicles were created, all reproduced with great skill. Graphics and defects We will also visit a castle In addition to the career mode, the Skyhook title offers a free mode that allows you to dedicate yourself only to cutting the grass, setting all the conditions of the match and a challenge mode, which engages the player with specific objectives in predetermined scenarios (mowing the lawn within a certain time, use a certain vehicle, etc.). In technical terms however, Lawn Mowing Simulator is an excellent exponent of its genre: not only are the vehicles reproduced with great care, but also the settings are very accurate and pleasant to look at. After all, the engine's ability to reproduce such placid and absorbed environments is one of the reasons for the greatest charm of the game. Unfortunately, there are also some flaws. The main one is that they don't offer much in terms of variety. After all, the game is spent most of the time on virtual lawns and, although the management elements are interesting (at least they are not useless like those of many other similar titles), if you are not passionate about grass cutting it is difficult to want to go back to playing once the PC or console is turned off. Another problem is the limited number of vehicles: there are only twelve tractors in the base game. The promise is that more post-publication will come, but they will probably be paid DLCs.
