{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-4-empires.html", "text": "Once upon a time in ancient China.... Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires can be defined as a hybrid between action and strategy seasoned with a pinch of RPG: so you won't just have to throw your hands left and right, but you will first have to plan your attacks and also take care of some management aspects. The plot of the game follows the historical events of China: the nation is divided into small kingdoms headed by various feudal lords, and your task will be to take one of these lords by the reins and venture into the conquest of the entire state. It will be possible to do this by following a narrative thread through the Historial option; if, on the other hand, you simply want to think about dominating the lands by not caring about the events, the Fictional mode will be available. After all this you will move on to the selection of one of the many garments scattered around the nation. Each leader has different weapons and characteristics and has two non-commissioned officers at his mercy (later the number of acolytes may increase, but we will explain how a few lines below). Once you have chosen the faction that suits you best, you will have to decide which character among the 3 initially available to command in battles: in fact, during the levels you will only maneuver one warrior, while the other allies and the rest of the troops will be controlled by the CPU. To further assist the leader there will be particular objects, to be equipped before the battle, which will increase the potential of your alter ego, allowing him to increase his physical strength or to launch magical attacks, and so on. A novelty compared to the previous episodes is given by a special ability possessed by some fighters (each one has its own), which will support the entire friendly battalion: therefore you can raise the morale of your comrades at a given moment, or set up an ambush to an enemy etc. However, if the available characters are not enough for you, you will use an editor that will allow you to create a personalized one. As already mentioned a few lines ago, during the game you can make various alliances with other lords, thus increasing the power of your army. This is possible when you emerge victorious from a battle, consequently submitting the opposing generals to your will. Be careful though, because hiring new soldiers will cost you money, and if you don't have enough gold you will be forced to let them go free. But what must be done to get liquidity into the cash register? Simple: you can increase the taxes to be collected on the conquered territories! In fact, we mentioned at the beginning of the article that in Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires you will also have to deal with the management aspects, which will concern, in addition to the increase in duties, also the reinforcement of the army, the exchange of goods with other characters and, as already explained, the recruitment of new officers. On some occasions, however, the other feudal lords of China will ask for your alliance on their own initiative to face a particularly demanding battle. Obviously you will be free to accept or not. Other times, however, you will be invaded by enemies, and obviously it will be necessary to defend your territory tooth and nail. So far we have dealt with the strategic aspect of the product, and as you may have noticed the depth of this side is not excellent, unlike other well-known titles; but in any case I don't think you could have asked for more from Koei, as its game contains an action component that plays an important part. To include the versus mode, where you can challenge a friend using the split screen. All techniques can be performed very easily thanks to a particularly easy and immediate control system, which allows you to launch blows by pressing even a single button Boarding! Once the tactical issues have been settled, you will move on to the real facts, facing the enemy in battle. First of all, on the right of the screen there will be a map divided into blue and red colored areas: the first color represents the territories occupied by you, while the second those under the control of the opponents. As you defeat the antagonists, the red parts on the map will gradually disappear at the expense of the blue ones, until the entire territory is occupied by you, sanctioning victory. So, unlike the previous chapters, it will not be enough to only take down the opposing generals. During the course of the fights you will only control the previously chosen character, while the rest of the battalion will act automatically. The moves that you will have available will not be very many, but still sufficient to deal with any situation: thrusts, slashing, devasmany combos, jump with consequent attack and a special blow (available once the bar under the vital energy is full) will characterize the technical baggage of your alter ego. All techniques can be performed very easily thanks to a particularly easy and immediate control system, which allows you to launch blows by pressing even a single button. Also during your journey you will find some power-ups that will develop some of your skills in a superhuman way (but only for a short time), such as speed, attack power and so on. The clashes in which you will take part will be very frenetic and lively, above all because swarms of opponents will face you (15-20 elements, and let's not exaggerate!). Despite the large number of enemies, the big work will be up to you, since the AI of fellow soldiers is on rather low levels: in fact, they prove to be decidedly unresponsive and inefficient, and very often instead of giving you a hand, they will stand there and watch you you work hard. Fortunately the same goes for the enemy troops, who are decidedly not very reactive, but the same cannot be said for the opposing generals, who are decidedly tougher and more aggressive. Put simply, therefore, the decisive duels will be those between your leader and the leaders of the other faction, but in any case being defeated by the enemy and seeing the allies standing like stockfish on the field makes you nervous a lot... All in all we are faced with a good gameplay able to satisfy the player. Too bad that the repetitiveness of the missions could lead to boredom after a short time, but above all the lack of substantial innovations will annoy users already familiar with this saga. Technical Analysis Graphically, the Koei title stands at discrete levels. Textures appear sharp and clean, and the level of detail is quite high. The lighting effects are also good, even if there are better ones around, while the medium resolution backdrops aren't very detailed. However, there is a frame-rate to be commended that always remains fluid, even in the most chaotic situations. To note the lack of CG movies, present instead in the past editions: for this reason the interludes will be displayed with the in-game graphics. As far as the sound is concerned, the rock songs are catchy and pleasant to listen to, but they don't match the general atmosphere at all: surely ancient China had to be represented with completely different symphonies! The dubbing is good, even if completely in English. Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires maintains all the qualities that have made the series successful by adding a pinch of novelty. Unfortunately, however, the slight innovations made do not change the overall game structure, which essentially remains the same seen in the past. Sure, the title is just an add-on, but those who already own all the chapters of the saga rightly wouldn't see a reason to buy the Koei product. Ultimately therefore, if you have never played one of the past episodes, then you can add 1 point to the final evaluation and take advantage of the modest price at which it is sold. Otherwise, however, you would do well to think twice before proceeding with the purchase, unless you are really a huge fan of the saga. Pros Smooth controls Fast-paced battles Fair technical realization Against deficient AI In the long run repetitive Important innovations are missing It was the year 2001, a period in which the Sony mother console still had to fully pull out its claws. But just at that moment so important for the life of Playstation 2 came from Koei Dynasty Warriors 2, an action that had much acclaim from audiences and critics. Given the success achieved by the product, the software house decided to publish sequels: therefore, Dynasty Warriors 3, 4 and the Extreme Legends expansion fell on the market. Although the qualitative level of the episodes has always remained at good levels, the lack of substantial innovations has prompted journalists and users to make some criticisms. In the face of this, has Koei listened to the reproaches received? We see.", "date": "2004-10-28", "grade": null}
