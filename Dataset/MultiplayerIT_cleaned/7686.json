It's been two years since the original Japanese release and it may seem like an exaggeration, but Tales of Xillia is truly a game changer for our country and one of the longest running franchises in the history of the jRPG genre. Tales of Xillia isn't even the first Tales for PlayStation 3 to come out in Europe: a year ago it was the turn of Tales of Graces F, but this is the first time that Namco Bandai opts for the Italian localization. And if we consider that until a few years ago the Tales barely came out of Japan, this is already a great achievement, believe us. In a year it will also be the turn of the sequel, Tales of Xillia 2, already officially announced for our market, and this bodes well for the future of a jRPG series that for fifteen years has made converts after converts, offering fans of the genre a safe and punctual nest in which to rediscover all the traditional characteristics of a genre that lately seems to have lost sight of its identity. But besides being a significant event, is Tales of Xillia a good game? The most beautiful couple in the world Welcome to Rieze Maxia, a seemingly normal world where humans have learned to exploit the mana lobe, a portion of the brain that allows them to communicate with elemental spirits to cast spells and perform extraordinary feats. Magic meets science, in short, and no one knows it better than Jude Mathis, a young medical student with a passion for altruism. Every day seems the same, and despite the growing tension between the kingdom of Rashugal and that of Aou Joule, the people are still doing quite well. Until the god Maxwell discovers that humans have built a weapon capable of harming both themselves and spirits, and decides it's time to teach his creatures a good lesson. The god Maxwell would be the blonde and buxom Milla, and her accidental meeting with Jude will start a chaos of events that will force them to join forces to save the world. On their way they will meet the most terrible enemies and the most eccentric allies: Alvin, a mysterious mercenary; Elize, a child prodigy always in the company of a cheeky talking toy named Teepo; the butler Rowen, with his unthinkable past; and Leia, Jude's feisty childhood friend. Tales of Xillia's plot and cast are, hands down, the best in the franchise's long history. Events follow one another at a brisk pace; more than once one gets the impression of having reached the climax of the story, only to discover that a new, unpredictable twist is about to call everything into question. The story, while remaining within the confines of an interactive ~anime~ like all the other Tales, is full of captivating details and reflections; the characters move away from the classic stereotypes to offer convincing and decidedly original facets. Also because Tales of Xillia must be played at least twice, if you want to delve into every detail of the story: at the beginning of the game we can in fact choose the protagonist between Jude and Milla, and even if the choice doesn't actually alter the development of the plot, however, it offers us a different point of view in the frequent cases in which the two heroes split up and live separate experiences. Even the traditional cartoon introductory movie ~unlocks~ only at the end of the prologue and has slight variations depending on the chosen hero; accompanied by the song ~Progress~ by Ayumi Hamasaki, for the first time proposed entirely in Japanese also in the West, it is not the only animated film: the development of the story is punctuated by at least a dozen animated sequences of absolutely stellar quality, made by the renowned Ufotable studio. And Tales of Xillia, while enjoying a sequel, has the great advantage of being a completely self-contained story, in which all the knots come to a head and the themes that will develop in Tales of Xillia 2 are only hinted at. PlayStation 3, two years later An all-round narrative experience of great depth, in short, which rewards us for the two years spent imagining what the heck the various characters were saying to each other in the videos that - we are sure - we have all watched on YouTube, sighing in the belief that this Tales for PlayStation 3, together with Tales of Graces F and Tales of Vesperia, would not have seen the light in a country that the producer Hideo Baba has always snubbed. We have been proved wrong by the first, and if for the second the hopes are now verging on zero, we already know that at the beginning of next year we will be able to play (or replay) the high resolution compilation of Tales of Symphonia. and also thislast will be in Italian, just like Tales of Xillia. An Italian translation, that of Tales of Xillia, which makes up for some slips or not exactly correct adaptations thanks to the verve and fluidity with which the dialogues have been translated above all. This is especially true in the case of the ~skits~, the famous optional dialogues that delve into the characterization of the characters and which are often nothing more than chatter and gags full of irony. However, the dubbing remains in English, with no possibility of switching to the Japanese audio track for the most die-hard fans of Japanese actors. Generally, the voices chosen to give life to the characters have convinced us, even if we have some reservations about Milla's voice for completely different reasons from those of the fandom that has carefully scrutinized every Namco Bandai trailer in recent months. Precisely by virtue of her otherworldly personality, Minae Noji's cold, detached and almost robotic imprint seemed strongly apt, especially as it changes inflection as the story unfolds and Milla's attachment to human beings. If anything, there's a clear tonal gap between Milla's voice and the other characters' voices as if it's being dubbed over the phone. A minor problem, actually, but which makes itself felt - forgive us for the pun - in the context of a first-rate technical sector which, however, disfigures a bit in front of the graphic masterpiece that is Level 5's Ni no Kuni. Tales of Xillia still has a good two years on its back, and it's the first installment of the franchise to offer a fully rotatable 360-degree camera in every location. But even compared to the vivid colors and refined cel shading of the predecessor Tales of Vesperia, on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the cool tones and pastel colors of Tales of Xillia leave a bad taste in the mouth. However, nothing that cannot be forgiven by admiring the inspired panoramas of Rieze Maxia, on the notes of one of the most varied and engaging soundtracks of the saga, always punctual to underline the most lively, epic, dramatic or adventurous moments of the story. Playstation 3 trophies The large collection of Trophies is inevitable: 32 bronze, 10 silver, 3 gold and platinum. Actually getting them is not difficult at all. It takes a little patience, maybe a good guide that shows us how to find and solve each mission, and all the time necessary to complete the game twice and see every object, enemy and power-up. United, we will win! The main feature of the Tales of Xillia combat system is called ~constraint~, and it is the ingenious idea with which Namco Bandai has managed to differentiate it from its predecessors. The basic mechanics always remain the same: after coming into contact with an enemy and quickly charging the battlefield, the player assumes direct control of the party leader, while the three companions are controlled by a highly customizable artificial intelligence . The combat is purely action: a good amount of key combinations allow us to attack normally or use spells and special attacks called Arts. These consume traditional technical points, while normal attacks and evasive maneuvers consume ability points. In short, it is a hybrid combat system that recalls both the more traditional ones of the series and that of Tales of Graces F: unlike the latter, however, it is less technical, but also much more intuitive. The bond system, on the other hand, allows us to connect to another character: at that point, our partner will join us in attacking a target, coordinating his moves according to ours. A side indicator even allows us to unleash super Arts that combine one of ours with that of the partner to whom we are bound. And that's not all, because each enemy has weaknesses that only a specific partner can exploit: changing constraints on the fly becomes fundamental and fortunately absolutely immediate, which is why Namco Bandai even allows us to replace one of the four fighters on the fly with one of those who may have remained on the bench. Spectacular yet clear, deep and hilarious, the combat system in Tales of Xillia is truly rewarding. Satisfaction grows together with the lilium sphere, the screen that basically allows us to develop individual characters. In reality, being able to decide which parameters to explore is a bit of an illusion, because at the end of the game you will still have accumulated enough points to unlock each bonus. The lilium sphere - reminiscent of the Final Fantasy X spherography - is onesort of cobweb where at the points where the threads join we find spheres that increase the main statistics of the characters. In the empty space between the wires, other spheres teach new Arts, passive skills and other offensive and defensive maneuvers: to learn them, you must unlock the surrounding spheres. And once you've unlocked at least three of those closest to the perimeter, the lilium sphere expands and offers other bonuses and abilities. The player can then activate or deactivate the various power-ups as needed, so that the characters are always ready to face each new challenge in the right way. Scotty, teleport! And there will be many challenges that await our heroes, especially in the many areas that we will have to cross on foot to reach a new destination. Perhaps this is precisely the weak point of Tales of Xillia. Namco Bandai has decided to interpose fully explorable environments such as forests, swamps and mountains between the various main locations of the game. These zones replace the traditional three-dimensional map of the world and represent a 1:1 scale version of the endless but empty prairies that we had to navigate to get from one city to another in Tales and countless other jRPGs. The experiment was only half successful, because if on the one hand the immersion in the world of Rieze Maxia greatly increases, on the other the various locations - however separated by loading screens - do not prove to be sufficiently diversified and offer more or less the same structure, although perhaps different in appearance. The dungeons also disappointed us a bit, because there are few really interesting, intricate or punctuated by puzzles that test not only the patience but also the player's ingenuity. What's more, the 1:1 world solution means the absence of the typical means of transport and free exploration: the 3D map is in fact replaced by an arid list of cities, regions and dungeons to which you can teleport to instant after discovering its entrances. A feature that makes you turn up your nose, it is true, but which comes in incredibly useful when traveling the world to complete optional missions: given by NPCs with an exclamation mark on their head, they often ask us to visit certain places, defeat certain enemies, or find and deliver various items. The optional missions reward you with money and accessories, often purely aesthetic, and while not showing who knows what variety, they are pleasant secondary activities that break the linearity of the narrative development. The original shop development system certainly deserves a last mention: they are all the same, and this kills the curiosity of visiting them in a new city a little, but on the other hand, it is possible to visit any of them to consume the materials found during our wanderings and level up the various categories of items and equipment. In this way, it is the player who decides when and how to make new purchases: it is clearly an experimental idea that did not completely convince us, but which we found curiously original and which Namco Bandai would do well to investigate, perhaps in the next Tales. Tales of Xillia is the ideal jRPG for anyone who wants to experience forty hours of adventure, emotion and fantasy", "date": "2013-08-06", "grade": "9.2"}
