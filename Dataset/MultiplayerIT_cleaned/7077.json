The use of cel shading and a ~bloom~ effect are decisive in this sense and manage to transform the Unreal Engine into an excellent engine at the service of creativity, of visual solutions of greater impact, of a technological gap that is filled without any problem from that abundance of style that Suda51 certainly does not lack. It is even curious to see how the introduction of a higher resolution on the PC compared to the console versions does not bring with it the traditional problem of low-definition textures, given that the technique used by Grasshopper Manufacture prefers flat surfaces, drawn with ~brushstrokes~ that they hide any artifacts and make the show even more enjoyable. There are moments in which this expedient shows its limits, mostly when the scenarios open up, revealing a lack of detail and interactivity that are so ~old gen~; however, these are precisely moments, the presence of which does not affect a general picture made up of elegant and refined gimmicks, winking fan services that can turn into monstrous aberrations and particularly evocative sequences, often and willingly at the service of the gameplay. Therefore, the lack of advanced options for graphic adjustments does not annoy, which are limited to the aforementioned resolution, the activation of vsync and three qualitative presets (low, medium, high), but we really cannot understand the reason for a lock at 30 frames per second decidedly emasculating on medium-high-end configurations, a problem which fortunately can be remedied with a workaround but which we hope will be resolved in an official way, given that activating 60 frames per second seems to affect the performance of the quick time events . Killer is Dead - Nightmare Edition brings Suda51's out-of-the-box action and storytelling to PC Frame rate stuck? Here's how to fix it The PC version of Killer is Dead runs by default with a locked frame rate at 30 frames per second, regardless of the v-sync settings. It's unclear why this was the case, but luckily it's possible to manually tweak the settings for a smoother experience and the much sought-after 60 frames per second. All you have to do is enter the C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamappsKidGameConfig folder, open the KidEngine.ini file with notepad and change the value of the string ~MaxSmoothedFrameRate~ from 30 to 60 (or 120, if your monitor supports that rate). Fly me to the Moon The protagonist of Killer is Dead is Mondo Zappa, a skilled swordsman equipped with a bionic arm but completely unaware of his past. The only thing he remembers is that he likes soft-boiled eggs and beautiful women, the latter a passion that can be put into practice in the nice Gigol mode. It is a series of appointments with different girls, to be ~conquered~ through a skilful game of looks and, of course, increasingly expensive gifts. Success in this area can yield us extra bonuses and weapons to be inserted precisely in the mechanical limb, which, if necessary, therefore transforms into a ~blooded~ cannon, a powerful drill, a freezing gun or with a disruptive charge. After a short tutorial, the Grasshopper Manufacture title reveals a mission structure consisting of thirteen chapters and various extra challenges, which in the Nightmare Edition include a DLC and the special difficulty level of the same name. In addition to the aforementioned narration and the undoubted atmosphere, the focus is clearly on the fights, which take place in a traditional third-person context with an unobstructed view. It is possible to play with mouse and keyboard without any particular problems, apart from the lack of an option for changing the commands, but our suggestion is to use a controller for Xbox 360, perfectly supported and with the same layout used on the Microsoft console . Mondo cannot jump and this lack makes one turn up one's nose with respect to its offensive possibilities, not very rich if we compare it with the best exponents of the genre (see Bayonetta and its boundless repertoire of moves) but implemented in an excellent way, thanks to an excellent rendering of impacts and to visual solutions that here too enhance the various situations in the best possible way. In fact, it is enough to score a dodge with perfect timing to open a gap in the defense of the opponent on duty and issue a powerful scaric of blows while the graphics switch to a sort of three-colour process between white, black and - of course - blood red. In short, there is no extraordinary complexity in the combat system, but the satisfactions are not lacking and the use of the bionic arm often lends itself to shuffling the cards on the table, acting as a guard breaker or activating the weapons we talked about previously, useful if not fundamental in some situations. The whole world has it In short, in Killer is Dead - Nightmare Edition, you fight and come across situations that are decidedly out of the ordinary, daughters of Goichi Suda's extraordinary imagination. The government agency that Mondo Zappa works for takes care of eliminating dangerous assassins at the request of private citizens, but each character hides secrets and it is really interesting to discover them during the adventure. Between one mission and another we will find ourselves dealing with a scenario inspired by Escher's paintings but also by Lewis Carroll's books, with the traditional elevator that can be seen in every self-respecting scrolling fighting game, with oriental settings that they hide secrets to discover and opponents to defeat, with variations on the racing-style theme while on a motorcycle we chase a Yakuza boss riding a tiger. In short, you will find that console users may well know why they have been able to try their hand over the years with the entire Suda51 repertoire, but that on PC they arrive as a very pleasant breath of fresh air, as well as an excellent starting point for the future of Grasshopper productions on the Windows platform. Perhaps more could have been done in terms of design with regard to the standard, somewhat anonymous enemies, but it must be recognized that some bosses are truly peculiar and remain in the head; as well as the excellent Japanese dubbing, selectable in the options instead of the English one and, in all cases, well subtitled in Italian.", "date": "2014-06-04", "grade": "8.0"}
