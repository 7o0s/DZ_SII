You got it right: the new Ubisoft title exclusively for PSP is not a two-dimensional platform that bears only the name of Assassin's Creed, but a real sequel to the game that has enthralled millions of people (and has bored just as many, because of the objective problems related to the repetitiveness of the gameplay). There is no Desmond Miles, but the story is still ~remembered~ through the Animus and narrates the events following the discovery of the Apple of Eden by Altair. The assassin returns to Acre with the aim of eliminating the Templar Order once and for all, but runs into a person he believed he would never see again. It is also thanks to his help that he learns of the mysterious Templar Archive, following a trail that leads him to the island of Cyprus, in the cities of Limassol and Kyrenia. All mine the city There are therefore again three locations that Altair can visit during his quest for justice and knowledge, just like in the first Assassin's Creed. We can walk the streets of the city and observe its inhabitants, assume the typical pose of the Erudites (but not blend in with them) so as not to attract the attention of the guards and try our hand at a series of secondary missions ranging from defending citizens in difficulty to transporting money and messages, from stealing documents to killing traitors and criminals. Compared to the original game, the timed missions, ~spy~ and pickpocketing sessions are missing. The latter were also used to stock up on throwing knives, which instead can now be collected from the body of the victims or restored when we go to the assassins' den. Altair starts immediately with all his skills and weapons (hidden dagger, sword, throwing knives and bare hands), which therefore do not have to be regained gradually but which can be upgraded once a chapter of the story is completed or when we continue the game in following a save. In this case, we can spend the points earned to increase the synchrony bar of the Animus (ie vital energy) and the speed of its recovery, equip ourselves with a greater number of throwing knives, improve the power of weapons and the probability of score a critical hit, as well as making our camouflage faster after a fight. The fights take place in the usual way, thus relying on the timing for the counters and on the combos. In the end, the success or failure of a critical attack appears almost random, and generally being killed by ~normal~ opponents proves to be at least unlikely. The situation concerning the bosses is different, because in that case the parry often cannot be used and we have to limit ourselves to dodging and then quickly swing our blows. Acrobatic stunts The control system of Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines takes up that of the first AC and therefore allows us to move discreetly, run and enter the ~high profile~ mode, or jump over any obstacles as well as climb where possible. The map of each city district is updated thanks to ~synchronization~, so also in this case you have to find all the towers and reach the top to be able to observe the surroundings and notice the presence of situations that require our attention. The climbing phases are clearly not as detailed and exciting as on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, but the work done is appreciable and the drawing distance appears discreet. Each sync is followed by a ~leap of faith~ with the usual landing in the hay, which together with the wooden buildings on the roofs constitute an effective hiding place to wait for the situation to calm down after a scuffle with the guards. Since the PSP does not have a right analog stick, the view must be adjusted by holding down the left back button and acting on the main buttons like a d-pad. The operation turns out to be quite painless because the lack of intelligence of the opponents does not force us to pay who knows how much attention when we have to carry out a silent assassination: generally it is also possible to eliminate two or three soldiers in a row if they are stationed and look in the same direction. It must also be said that compared to the first Assassin's Creed the possibility (present in AC2) of grabbing enemies has been addedthat are near a ledge and drop them suddenly. The problems arise during the acrobatic race phases on the roofs, because at that juncture the view does not move as it should and therefore poses a major limit to our freedom of movement, making it rather cumbersome to move at high speed without falling. To make matters worse, some Altair behaviors with respect to walls and ledges, as well as a general lack of sensitivity of the analog stick. Curiosity Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines can synchronize with Assassin's Creed 2 for PlayStation 3, translating the Templar coins that we collect with Altair into guilders and unlocking some new weapons. Technical realization Bringing a technological masterpiece like Assassin's Creed to PSP was certainly a challenge, but the developers of Griptonite Games have only half won it. The game's graphics engine manages to maintain a smooth and constant frame rate, without dips or uncertainties, and this in itself is a respectable result. A result that however arises from a polygonal count that is anything but monstrous. The three cities that we can explore are divided into districts that each need separate loading (rather fast, thanks to the possibility of installing part of the game data on the Memory Stick), but this ~sacrifice~ is not compensated by who knows what level of detail: while very well masking the limitations of PSP in the field of textures, the buildings reveal their simplicity as soon as we climb the first tower to look around. However, the use of colors is excellent and the overall result appears respectable. The problem is that a miracle was really needed here, something similar to what was done to bring Gran Turismo to the Sony portable console, with its polygonal models and 60 frames per second. That the ~miracle~ did not happen can be understood from the characters Altair interacts with, whether they are enemies or supporting actors: their appearance is angular, the animation is just discreet and the use of shaders indicates a clumsy attempt to give greater realism to faces. As for the sound, music and effects reflect the original ones but do not stand out that much. The dialogues are dubbed in Italian by the same cast used for Assassin's Creed, but unfortunately in a less brilliant way.", "date": "2009-12-01", "grade": "7.2"}
