{"name": "MXGP Pro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mxgp-pro-recensione.html", "text": "MXGP Pro stands in many ways as the episode of maturity for the Italian Milestone franchise. In fact, a year has passed since the change of graphics engine, with the transition to Unreal Engine 4, and important innovations have been introduced on the gameplay front, based on the feedback received from the community. Sufficient elements to project the game experience forward, at the level of the most famous productions? Not yet, sadly; but let's proceed in order and find out which aspects the developers pushed the hardest on, starting with the choice to structure the tutorial as a real virtual place, the Compound, where you can get familiar with the bike and its characteristics, with the new aerial manoeuvres, with clutch management also during the race as well as at the start and with a renewed physical system, which in its most extreme and realistic meaning aims to give us even more engaging and demanding races. The new mode includes a total of thirty challenges, and overcoming them will actually allow us to substantially improve our ability to compete for victory. Game mode It is a bit of a speech that tends to repeat itself, that of the lack of ideas in the context of the modalities that find a place in Milestone-branded driving games from year to year, and MXGP Pro from this point of view is no exception. From the starting screen it is in fact possible to tackle a single grand prix, try your hand at the time attack on a specific track, kick off the traditional career or a championship. Among the options there is also competitive multiplayer, which at the time of writing is not yet populated, but which allows you to join an existing match or host a match, choosing to set it as a single event or an entire season, determining in the latter case the number of races that will compose it. Among the adjustments stand out those relating to physics, the length of the race and the presence or absence of qualifying sessions, as well as the activation or deactivation of collisions, the latter factor being very important to avoid excessive chaos during the races. Returning to the single player sector, as mentioned, there are no substantial innovations, but the roster of riders, bikes and tracks has been updated to the last official MXGP season, with the inclusion of the MX2 category for a more reasoned progression . In this regard, the career is now available in two different versions: the normal one and the Extreme one, which deactivates all the aids by default and brings realism to the maximum degree for a considerable challenge, to be experienced only after having done the necessary practice. Mud and gameplay In short, the biggest differences compared to the last episode of MXGP are those that are perceived once you get on the track, daughters of a rethinking of the mechanisms that regulate the time in the air and the landing, as well as the degree of realism of the experience in general. As per the script for Milestone racers, it is possible to change the driving style between three different levels so that it best suits our needs, perhaps as part of a personal growth that leads us to start with an arcade approach to gradually arrive at a most probable and tricky approach. The changes in this sense can be seen and felt: the simpler style seems to forgive any blunder, with the bike not losing grip even if we launch sideways at full speed; the intermediate one begins to set clear limits precisely as regards the drift and the dosage of the accelerator, while ignoring most of the collisions with the other pilots; finally the ~pro~ physics requires an above-average degree of attention, delicate and careful handling of the vehicle and a clear awareness of its surroundings. In all cases, the yield of the terrain seemed consistent and convincing to us, with ruts that pull from one side to the other, but which above all can lead us to end up off the road or against an obstacle, an eventuality that we can remedy by resorting to the traditional rewind or accepting to lose a few moments for an automatic repositioning of the bike. However, it is what happens when we take flight that has the greatest impact on the economy of the race, in direct proportion to the level of difficulty selected. In the first place you have to memorize the characteristics of the tracks to avoid taking leaps in the wrong direction, perhaps frustrating the efforts to get to the head of the group by ~getting stuck~ somewhere; but above all you have to practice with the maneuver of the scrub, which through the movement of both anal sticksogici allows you to put the bike sideways, to one side or the other, to significantly reduce the time spent in the air and quickly return to the ground, avoiding losing speed. Nuances that connect with the inevitable parameters for the vehicle setup, and that will undoubtedly make fans of the genre happy, without however affecting too much the general appeal of the product. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-one MXGP Pro Trophies are obtained by winning all the grand prixes, completing the career mode and the championship, but also by carrying out certain actions for the first time: using the Rewind, signing with the technical sponsors and meeting their objectives, positively completing all the challenges of the Compound, and so on. Graphics and details Speaking of graphics, MXGP Pro does not boast the production level of MotoGP 18, and this is evident right from the start. There is, since it is a niche product, that in terms of interface and technical realization the game turns out to be a little behind, with the usual flaws of the Unreal Engine (the delayed appearance of the assets during trivial sequences, fortunately not in the race) to confirm a general lack of attention to detail, which is however highlighted above all during the collisions, actually very ugly to see in terms of animations, with frequent polygonal interpenetrations. The context does not cooperate, it must be said: the design of the bikes and outfits, however faithful, does not improve the look of the game and many of the seventeen tracks included have the typical appearance of dirt tracks, which negatively affects the variety of what actually appears on the screen from race to race. Furthermore, the behavior of the opponents does not reserve any surprises during the events. The frame rate, once again fixed at thirty frames, is consistent but sometimes lets itself go to mysterious ~blocks~ of a few moments, with a bit of stutter that can be seen in the background during the tightest curves. As for the audio sector, it seems to us that it falls within the average: the narrative voice in Italian performs its task well, the noises of the motorcycles are fairly realistic and an electronic soundtrack accompanies navigation through the menus.", "date": "2018-06-29", "grade": "7.0"}
