Sony's willingness to forcefully open up to a new type of audience was even revealed by the launch of a bundle containing the console, the new controller and a copy of the game, but the response from critics and players was anything but positive. due to a selection of superficial and not very original mini-games, proposed, among other things, in a not very intriguing way. Two years later, Sony tries again with Start the Party: Become a Hero!, a more refined episode both in terms of presentation and in terms of variety of mini-games. Let's save the world! If the first Start the Party! it limited itself to proposing a helter-skelter list of small mini-games, this time the developers made an effort to set up a small narrative canvas capable of giving a nice logical thread to the various challenges. In a crackling of clichs, the Earth is under a combined attack by robots, aliens and dangerous creatures commanded by the psychopathic Doctor Terrible. Up to four players will thus have to collaborate to foil the threat and save the inhabitants of the planet in the most bizarre ways, clearly always making use of PlayStation Move. Too bad that the number of mini-games present is really small, and that only in a few cases the challenges manage to entertain and elicit a sincere laugh from the players. In the twenty or so challenges proposed, we have had to recover divers with a mechanical arm before they were devoured by sharks, play target shooting against waves of UFOs, maneuver a helicopter to rescue survivors or rebuild robots by putting the right parts in the right place. In one of the nicest and most senseless, the player must lead an injured earthling to the emergency room: since keeping him inside the ambulance would have been too simple, it will be necessary to keep the unfortunate little man balanced on a giant hand all the way, trying not to falling while making him jump to collect floating medkits; predictably everything is made more difficult by the numerous bumps and slopes of the road. The Move performs almost flawlessly, but unfortunately the way it has been implemented is superficial and far from original, offering a gaming experience that has already started to go moldy on the Nintendo Wii for several years. Another big wasted opportunity concerns the interaction between the various players, who will not compete at the same time but will play one at a time in an attempt to score the highest score. On the other hand, a second player can use a dualshock to lend a hand, a welcome addition but totally unable to replace that sense of chaos and frenzy that characterizes party games when you support each other at the same time. A nice option taken from the first Start the Party! is the ability to customize your avatar by replacing the character's face with a photo of yourself taken with PlayStation Eye, while a funny voice will repeat your name after you've recorded it out loud. A trifle, after all, but it is among the few nice things that the game is able to offer players. At the end of the fair, Start the Party: Become a Hero! it only partially manages to make up for the numerous problems of the episode that accompanied the launch of PlayStation Move, and indeed the developers ended up stumbling once again into the same errors. An extremely meager number of challenges, very superficial mini-games and the total lack of a competitive experience at the same time are the problems for which Sony's party game, once again, fails to represent a decent answer to Nintendo's Wii Party.", "date": "2012-02-13", "grade": null}
