This Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions wants to be a ~caciarone~ tribute to the history of films by giving a light-hearted and self-referential tone to the various fisticuffs that we have learned to love so much in the cinema. In this review of Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions we will find out how the authors have tried to condense all the essence of the noble art and the spectacularity of the Rocky and Adonis Creed sagas into a single video game. The story we all know, or maybe not All characters from Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions Surely the best side of the whole Rocky saga is the narration, a heartbreaking and poignant story that has been accompanying our protagonists for four decades now. The developers have rightly decided to divide the story of each individual character within the Arcade mode, thus giving way to relive the life of Rocky, Apollo, Ivan, Adonis and many other characters who have made the history of the saga . The meetings are all those that fans remember and in some cases there are also some curious and welcome surprises such as a fight between Rocky and Adonis which obviously would not be possible except in an imaginative thought. Between one match and another, apart from the narration through simple on-screen dialogues of the characters, we will have the opportunity to train in the gyms without a real purpose. We would have much preferred these interludes to give us buffs or debuffs depending on the outcome of the training. In short, between lines of dialogue and historical fights we will find ourselves using 20 characters in all, for a total of about 100-110 encounters. It should be noted that not only the protagonists of the two sagas are present, but also secondary characters who have appeared for a short period of time within the various films. To unlock them all you will have to complete the game with the 10 characters that it will make available to you at the beginning or fight in Versus mode and obtain the license to unlock by fighting against every single opponent. Simple but satisfying gameplay The protagonists of Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions From a purely technical point of view, BRB: CC is very simple to play, but difficult to master. Being a cross between an arcade and a sports one (even if we are far from simulation) it has simple dynamics with more technical nuances. By pressing Y we will use the basic attack which can be launched in 4-hit combos. Depending on the direction pressed before the first or last hit we will have different combos available. With the X instead the special shot of our character will be activated, customized according to the chosen fighter. B, on the other hand, will allow us to dodge or sprint forward or backward, which is essential to escape or chase the opponent. Lastly, the A key which is used to make an unstoppable ~grip~ after which a blow will be launched. All attacks decrease the parry bar, which can be done by pressing the ZR key. Once received too many hits in the parade we will suffer an exhaustion that will leave us helpless to the opponent's attacks for a short period of time. It is known that the attack is the best defense and in Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions, by hitting the enemy without equal, we will go to load the bar of the special move, a blow that can be activated by pressing the ZL key which will allow to inflict a fairly high damage to our ring opponent. Normally it would be an unstoppable blow, but the game also advises us not to use it too often first because it can be counterattacked with another special move launched a fraction of a second after the end of the starting animation. All this is the basis of the meetings, but there is a small detail. We played the whole time on ~newbie~ difficulty because even just in intermediate mode, the game is extremely punishing. Not that it's a bad thing to have to get used to the mechanics of a fighting game, but maybe a little downward balancing wouldn't hurt anyone. Technique and method Rocky's famous characters in Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions Even if it doesn't cry out to a miracle, especially with regard to expressiveness, textures and some drop in frame rate, this Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions is certainly pleasant to watch and above all to listen to. From the first moments anyone who plays it can't help but get carried away by the various ~Eye of the tiger~ or ~Gonna Fly Now~. Unfortunately the dubbing, apart from some sporadic frase, like ~I'll split you in two~ by the evergreen Ivan Drago, is totally absent, with the exception of the reporter who will certainly not be remembered in the annals for his variety of sentences. The boxers' models are of decent workmanship and don't disfigure in movement, furthermore each character is characterized by a personality that comes out above all when he puts the opponent on the ground, taunting and mocking him. The methods are the classic ones to which we are all used to. Let's go from the pure and simple Arcade which will face the story of each individual fighter and which allows you to unlock the whole roster and the various skins. We then move on to the versus mode which is nothing more than a personalized match that can be played against the AI or another real player, giving the possibility here too to accumulate points to unlock the characters. Finally, we have the training and tips for playing, which we recommend reading carefully to understand all the dynamics (exhilarating, a card that indicates how it is possible to dodge a move after the opponent has already dodged; we imagined a curtain in which the two dodge until the end of the round, ed.). We were appalled when we searched for it and couldn't find an online mode. Well no, there is no kind of ranking or lobby to be able to use Rocky or Apollo to punch a random guy across the ocean with his fists. The hope is that the developers do something about it because in our opinion it is a serious enough lack in a title based on the challenge.", "date": "2021-09-07", "grade": "6.8"}
