What results from this policy is a scenario populated mostly by productions that leave the time they find, attempts to ride the wave of this or that title without introducing any novelty and without focusing on aspects such as depth, duration and the degree of challenge. Often these are forced choices, moreover it must be considered that most of the development teams that are dedicated to the iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms are independent in the crudest sense of the term, i.e. they do not have large budgets and are not even able to invest years in carrying out a project. We must therefore recognize the courage and commitment of a team like Hexage, which not only brought Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman to all mobile devices, but also chose to adopt a different model from the usual, which allows you to download for free the game and enjoy it without limitations until the character reaches level 10, after which you can proceed or not with the purchase of a ~premium edition~ starting from 2.99 euros. Translated into a nutshell, this translates into a decidedly more lasting entertainment than the average, which offers us quests, fights and nice narrative interludes in profusion, while also managing the arduous task of never being too repetitive. Ah, did we mention that Reaper is also a great game? Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman doesn't do anything complicated, but it does it damn well Death mask The structure of Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman is that of an action RPG devoted right from the start to a mix of quality and quantity. The protagonist is in fact a mysterious masked knight who offers his services to the highest bidder, endowed with a benevolent or malevolent nature depending on what we choose to do during the adventure: we will help that soldier in difficulty or we will let him die on the field of battle? Will we offer to protect a damsel in distress on a journey? Will we gladly accept the reward of an old merchant or will we demand that he give us more money? The possibilities are varied, but the results are generally always the same, in this case the unlocking of new quests and new objects with which to enhance the character. The latter must be purchased from the shop of a girl who offers us from time to time more powerful swords, armor parts with greater resistance or jewels capable of influencing our abilities. As far as the quests are concerned, they are composed of narrative interludes that lead to furious fights, and it is in this juncture that the synthesis of Hexage's work is appreciated. In fact, the knight finds himself facing various types of different opponents, within situations that sometimes recall the mechanics of shooters (see when you have to dodge myriads of bullets by calculating their trajectory) and are based on a simple but effective touch control system , which only on a few occasions shows the side of some uncertainty. The screen is virtually divided into three parts: the first two, in the left half of the display, allow you to move left or right; the third part, i.e. the right half of the display, is instead used to activate the jump (one tap), double jump (two taps), flying rotation (double tap in the air), ascending swipe (slide upwards) , the ~crushed~ (slide down) and the charge (slide left or right). The basic attack is also automatic, i.e. the knight will start slashing as soon as he has an enemy within reach. It is a valid and well thought out solution, which makes the clashes fun despite a degree of challenge that is anything but trivial, which in the event of a game over sends us back to the immediately previous checkpoint. From a technical point of view, Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman defends itself very well, showing off a clean and very pleasant graphic style, fluid animations and a decidedly inspired choice of colors. The action is accompanied by a soundtrack up to the situation, just a pity that the effects are not as impactful.", "date": "2013-10-22", "grade": "8.6"}
