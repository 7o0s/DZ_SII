{"name": "Tony Hawk's Project 8 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-project-8-recensione.html", "text": "Tony Hawk has been a gaming fixture, synonymous with console skateboarding for the past 8 years. The series, already very well known in our parts, is practically mythological overseas, where the episodes of the Man-Hawk are practically comparable, in terms of proselytism, to FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer in Italy. Neversoft's success was built almost entirely from the first two episodes, still considered the best today, which achieved enormous success with critics and audiences, placing themselves in the top ten of the best video games ever in various sector newspapers. The brand then went diluting in the following episodes, as often happens, failing to maintain the high quality level and getting lost in game solutions and fluctuating settings. With the latest digression, American Wasteland, the saga seemed to be heading towards the ascent of china, a sensation confirmed by the latter Project 8, which undoubtedly rearranges the course on a more convincing road. Project 8 The story is extremely simple, as befits a skateboarding game on the other hand. You impersonate the guy on duty with a passion for skateboarding, who gets an opportunity not to be missed: in fact, there is none other than Tony Hawk himself in town, and he's looking for a team made up of the 8 best skaters in the area to create his own personal crew. Project 8, in fact. The whole game is based on trying to climb the ranking of the best 200 skaters up to become part of the top 8, and the road is obviously very long, since our hero will be forced to start from the last place. From the beginning, every race we participate in, every mission undertaken and every single successful trick performed will increase the score, which will gradually allow the long climb up to success. In addition to the legendary Birdman, there are several professionals included: among them some elements of the (relatively) old guard such as Bob Burnquist or Rodney Mullen, but there are several new introductions, with younger and particularly talented skaters such as Ryan Sheckler, Nyjah Huston and Paul Rodriguez, all faithfully reproduced (well, let's say with ups and downs) and inserted into the fray. It's a skate world A big novelty introduced by Neversoft in this new chapter is the large playing area made available: an entire city has been modeled to be able to be traveled freely far and wide with a skateboard, without intermediate loads or too many invisible walls, apart from those that delimit the areas to be unlocked by continuing in the game. At the end of the initial loading we will be faced with the choice of the character from a list of pre-established models, which can then be modified through the typical editor: the selectable models, unfortunately, are not that great and the editor is one of the poorest seen in the latest titles released , Sin. At this point, we are ready to launch into the big city directly from home, initially sowing panic and destruction only in the neighborhood, but soon paving the way for all the rest of the reachable neighborhoods. The city is vast and very varied, full of passers-by and skaters, and the fact of being able to freely roam it gives the pleasant sensation of being faced with a sort of free-roaming on a board, rather than closed within small separate schemes from millennial uploads. The scenarios range from the playground, to the school, to the center of the city: settings already seen in other sauces, but never so homogeneous and closely connected to each other. In some cases, the areas must be unlocked by achieving some particular objective, such as completing certain ~missions~, until all the available areas are completely opened. A demanding job The whole game is based on the accumulation of points necessary to increase personal stats (divided into the various fundamental skills of skateboarding) and climb the rankings of the best skaters on the square: the ways to achieve these objectives are countless. Essentially, every trick performed, roaming freely around the game area, allows you to earn points, but there are more profitable methods, consisting of ~quests~ and ~challenges~. The missions are often triggered by meeting some characters who populate the city, and who will ask you to do the most disparate things: there is the photographer who will force you to perform particular tricks in certain points, the boy who will offer to shoot your demo, which you will have to chase by performing the moves it will show you gradually, or some characters who will trigger the typical phases defined as ~Classic Mode~, a legacy of the previous episodes. In these cases, we will be faced with a time limit within which to executevarious tasks, such as knocking down signs, pulling off particular jumps, collecting the letters that make up the word skate or combo, and more. Things we remember from the first chapters of Tony Hawk. Then there are the challenges with the Pros and the competitions: the first are triggered when within the various areas we come across the professional skaters who are part of the cast chosen by Activision, who will challenge you in some techniques of which they are specialists. Competitions, on the other hand, are races, which are held in specific points on the map. These are divided into two distinct parts, in the first you will have to reach the minimum score to enter the competition, which will constitute the second part. Each event mentioned can be concluded with three different results, each characterized by a minimum score to be obtained to be achieved: ~AM~, ~Pro~ and ~Super~, the highest result will obviously mean a greater amount of positions climbed in the global ranking . Nail the Trick Nail the Trick mode is probably the most interesting addition in Tony Hawk's game structure. Imagine the scene: you head at high speed towards a cliff, or a particularly high jump, as soon as you are in the air, press any of the analogs and the magic is triggered. Nail the Trick The camera zooms in on the skater and board, time slows down in a magnificent slow-mo that focuses all attention on the trick, and the two analogs will allow you to freely control the legs of the character. Through light movements of the sticks, brief touches are made on the board, capable of making it rotate and move in different directions. Nail the Trick With the right lightness and good timing, it is possible to trigger devastating combos up to the last centimeters of flight, before landing. Exhilarating. What's new Beyond the graphics, the first novelty that stands out in this chapter is the vastness of the playing area and the freedom of action allowed within it, but this also brings with it a negative note: the design is not always convincing of the settings. The entire city is far too full of ramps, low walls, spines, overhead railings and half pipes, not to mention the ability to grind on virtually any surface. For example, one of the first missions will require you to attach posters by performing wallrides on different walls: the main difficulty lies in being able to holly in the exact segment to gain altitude and reach the wall, because if you press too soon the Y key will most of the time end up performing a grind on the curb. The elements of the scenario that can be interacted with and on which to perform tricks are too many and too close together, making the execution of the moves and combos too artificial and exaggerated. Conversely, you will occasionally find yourself seeking refuge in the training shed: here a host of professional skaters will instruct you on the various techniques in which they specialize (Paul Rodriguez on the ~Rail~, Mike Vallely on the ~Wall~, Tony Hawk the ~Vert Air~ is obviously dedicated), to be performed step by step. The relativity simplicity of the area is like a breath of fresh air compared to the intricate skein of lines that make up the city outside. Arguably the most impressive new additions are Focus Mode and Nail the Trick mode, in which the game puts out a great display of effects, quite impressively. Focus Mode can be triggered by filling the ~Special~ bar, through the execution and correct conclusion of tricks and combos. Once filled, pressing one of the analogs will zoom in on the skater and time will slow down in a spectacular slow-motion, which will highlight the tricks performed in the following time frame. Nail the Trick is instead a new mode, which is explained elsewhere in more detail, which allows the creation of tricks in real time, based on the use of analog and slow-motion, one of the most pleasant and satisfying features of this Project 8 Among the novelties, the poverty of the character editor is striking, which allows very few variations on already scarce and not very beautiful basic models, and the almost total absence of an editor to create customized areas from scratch. There are some points on the map where it is allowed to move the elements of the scenario at will, but we are far from a real ~create a park~ editor, which is strange given the next gen assumptions of this chapter. The Table Under Your Fingers Like every chapter in the Tony Hawk series, this too is essentially based on the mastery of the control system, coordination and the right timing with which to issue commandsi to the skater, obviously in relation to the position of the latter with respect to the elements of the scenario. The controller allows the execution of a huge number of tricks and combos, once you struggle a bit to tame it. The left analog stick is used to give direction to the character, and the right one controls the camera. The wide range of acrobatic movements available is distributed on the keys: the A key allows the holly and derivatives (wally, vert, etc.), the X is dedicated to Flip Tricks, simultaneously with the use of the analog (kickflip, heelflip, impossible, etc.), the B allows the numerous Grabs, again variable according to the direction given (nosegrab, tailgrab, stalefish etc.) and the Y triggers the Grind on the suitable surfaces. LT and RT allow body and board rotations. With the right timing, you can chain all the various single tricks building up a large amount of spectacular combos. By pressing LB and RB at the same time, you can get off the board to walk and get back on. Multiplayer The game allows multiplayer for two players offline or for up to 8 players online. In the first case we are faced with the classic ~double~ with shared screen, which will allow some mini-games already seen in the previous chapters such as Trick Graffiti, in general we notice a forced resizing of the game that does not even allow the use of Nail the Trick . The online multiplayer is more satisfying: up to eight players can challenge each other in various mini-games within a chosen area, which acts as a real lobby. While waiting to decide ~which game to play~, the skaters meet in an arena where they can freely talk and perform tricks, all in real time, which can be useful for learning or showing new techniques to fellow players. Once the mini-game to be played has been chosen, the race will start, which once concluded will bring everyone back to the lobby phase again, within the same area. There are 6 types of competition to be carried out: Trick Attack, Graffiti, Combo Mambo, Score Challenge, Combo Challenge and Walls. The top 5 are pretty much run-of-the-mill stuff, essentially head to head in terms of trick skill, grind, combo building, and high score achievement. A curious novelty is the Walls mode: the skaters, by moving, create a sort of wall, a trail that chases them and into which you have to try to crash the opponent. It closely resembles the video game based on the film Tron, where instead of the skateboard we found futuristic motorcycles, a rather interesting addition. In general, the online gaming experience is very smooth and practically lag-free. The connection to Xbox Live also allows you to keep an eye on the updated rankings and leaderboards for every aspect of the game: the scores of each player, all over the world, are recorded, linked to every single trick that can be performed, very useful and pleasant in a game like that. Graphics and sound Project 8 is therefore the first iteration of the series to reach next-generation platforms with a purely next-gen graphics engine, and the changes are remarkable. In particular, the motion capture-based animations are very realistic and pleasant, and the more detailed polygonal models make the movement much more believable, despite the obvious exaggeration of the game. The vast scenario is probably more striking for its breadth than for the graphic quality, which beyond detailed textures, bump mapping and rare effects does not impress that much, often also afflicted by frame rate drops that tend to make you lose concentration , as well as being inherently annoying. In general, the graphics sector does not make a miracle cry, but it performs its function well, especially in the quality of the animations and in particular during the Focus Mode and the Nail the Trick. The audio includes the predictable plethora of licensed songs, a feature that has always been closely linked to the series: the genres hover around Punk, Rock and something Hip Hop, with songs almost always spot on even if you regret them a bit (but it's a subjective opinion) the old tracklists full of Punk and Melodic Hardcore pieces, once considered genres closely related to the skate environment. For the rest, the audio is normal, focusing for the most part on the noise of the table sliding on the various surfaces and impacting on obstacles, with few environmental effects, beyond the occasional voices of passers-by nearby. Goals 360 There are 49 achievements for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints. The points awarded for each goal achieved range from 5, for the minimum ones, to 100, when you get to the first place in the global skater ranking. All al", "date": "2006-12-06", "grade": null}
