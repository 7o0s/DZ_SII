{"name": "Il Signore degli Anelli: La Terza Era", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-degli-anelli-la-terza-era.html", "text": "The Middle Earths The setting of the game, as repeatedly said, faithfully follows that of Final Fantasy, the tenth chapter to be exact, obviously in a more simplified way so as to make it accessible even to those who do not live on ~bread & Gdr~ alone, which, in my opinion, it limits this EA title in some ways, as we will be able to explore later in the article. On the screen, in fact, as usual, we will see only one character to represent the party during the exploratory phases, even if in this case we will be able to freely choose which of the six heroes to lead. The others will be visible to users only during the battles that will punctuate a large part of the adventure. Unfortunately, it must be said that these exploratory phases will not be characterized by the absolute freedom that one would expect from a similar product. In fact, the evolution of the adventure proceeds quite linearly, with moments of the game interspersed with CG movies which, if on the one hand are very useful to immerse us more in the context in which we find ourselves, showing us the daily events of our group of characters, perhaps sitting around a fire intent on discussing what to do, on the other hand, presenting themselves continuously and a little impersonal in the description of our six heroes, they end up being a little annoying. In fact, they limit themselves to providing some indication of the missions to be tackled or to the description of what happens in that while in Middle-earth, but not to delve into the personality of the elements of the party. In the world of the Third Age there are, unfortunately, not many possibilities for interaction. And this is probably the real limit of LTE: the absolute lack of even minimal exploratory depth, the absence of cities to visit, of citizens with whom to interact, to catch your breath after a tough battle, to discover a possible sub -quest, to collect clues or secret objects, or for the simple pleasure of visiting a city, new virtual tourists and getting to know its inhabitants, thus fully immersing ourselves in the simulation in which we are participating. Which, in fact, contributes in large part, like the not excellent level of general difficulty and the easy upgrade of the characters, to a reduced longevity. The sub-quests themselves, often the flagship of certain themed productions, are quite simple to complete and being practically related to the path that is being done at that moment, there is no concrete possibility of freely choosing whether to complete it immediately or at a later time. They must, except on a couple of occasions, be completed immediately. Let the battle begin The strength of La Terza Era, beyond the fascinating settings, is to be found in the fighting. As in the always mentioned FFX, they will be random, even if unlike the Square-Enix title, here we will be able to understand when we are about to be attacked by a special indicator that highlights the probability of an encounter with the enemy as we get closer to a goal, be it a treasure chest to open or a particularly important place for the continuation of the adventure. Once transported to a special battle screen, always on the model of most J-RPGs, one of the most interesting novelties of this title immediately catches the eye: the introduction of a cooperative mode, which will allow you to experience the fight alongside a friend of yours. Simply press the Triangle Button during gameplay and select Co-Op to enter this two-player mode. During the fights, the second Player will come into play, and even if he doesn't have access to inventory management, he will still be able to give his important contribution to the cause. In this phase, control will alternate between the two adventure companions, who will take turns leading a certain group of characters (except for the special ones, such as Gandalf, who occasionally join the group, who will always be controlled by player number one). This turns out to be fun especially in moments when particularly difficult Bosses are faced and where a certain careful strategy is therefore required. It is interesting to highlight the fact that this will absolutely not affect any changes in single saves, so it will always be possible to resume from the point where the game was saved with or without the turn partner. Now it's my turn The clash takes place, as per tradition, following the classic canons of turn-based combat. The three party characters deployed in battle can be replaced by the other three remaining in the ~rear~ by simply recalling them from a menu in the upper right of the screen (Final Fantasy X docet) and attacking the enemy only whenor the appropriate Action bar will be full. The types of attacks that can be performed are many and spectacular, and largely embrace a whole sample already seen and tested in other fantasy / Rpg titles. They range from simple blows inflicted with weapons to special ones capable of inflicting heavy damage on the opponent, from spells to particular and exciting evocations in many cases taken verbatim from Jackson's Trilogy (as well as obviously from the book of the same name), such as that of the Water Horses seen at the cinema in The Fellowship of the Ring. In some fights, the introduction of a double battle phase is very interesting, which gives greater quality to the strategy level of the battle in progress. An example? It may happen that you are attacked head-on by a horde of orcs from Moria while some of them well positioned in a distant point of the battle screen will shoot you with arrows. In that case it becomes essential to prepare a winning tactic capable of eliminating the more distant enemies with magic, perhaps with Idrial, while the other elements of the party beat them to the closest ones. Of course, at the end of each combat session you will be assigned a certain number of experience points in relation to the number of enemies defeated, the techniques adopted to do so, etc., aimed at leveling up the various elements that make up your party. Interesting in this sense is the possibility that the gamer is given to customize the evolution of the characters as much as possible by choosing on his own which skill to acquire and which to give up along the lines of the FFX Spherography. Furthermore, the various objects found along the way will also take care of modifying the abilities of Berethor and his companions, usually inside chests placed at the edge of the paths. The peculiarity of these objects is that in addition to allowing the character who owns them new ~technical~ attributes, they will also contribute to modifying their aesthetic appearance, given that, for example, armor, helmets, and anything else wearable will be physically visible on our virtual alter ego. The game also features a pleasant mode called Evil, which allows the player to impersonate some of the villains of the Tolkjen saga. Too bad it is limited only to a review of some battles, at the end of each ~normal~ chapter, relived from the point of view of the enemies. An Oscar-winning graphics Another of the strengths of La Terza Era is undoubtedly the graphics sector. The level of detail of some locations almost borders on visual perfection thanks to the skilful work of the Redwood Shores graphic designers who have succeeded in the difficult task of perfectly recreating every single aspect, environment and location seen in the film of the same name, and beyond, given that there are unprecedented scenarios, optimally replicating even the most complex structures. Too bad for some textures which are sometimes not up to par with the entire aesthetic sector. But otherwise nothing to complain. The same technical care has been reserved for the creation of the polygonal models of the characters. The various Elegost, Berethor and Hadhod are very well characterized visually, and their striking resemblance to the various Aragorn, Boromir or Ghimli does nothing but make us appreciate them even more. Unfortunately, all this good things are paid for relatively in terms of frame rate, especially in the most important fights, full of characters on the screen and various (wonderful) light effects. But even here, nothing particularly annoying. On the other hand, the animations of the various PCs appear a bit disappointing, at least in a similar context. Mind you, we've seen worse around, but in a graphic production as accurate as this one from EA, something more was expected in this sense. Finally, the audio sector takes care of making everything as engaging as possible, with a soundtrack worthy of Peter Jackson's films (and it could not be otherwise given that the same one conceived by Hans Zimmer was used) and a dubbing that can boast the original voices of the Italian dubbers who vocally brought the characters of the Trilogy to life on the big screen. On the other hand, the general effects are average, probably sampled directly on the film set, with a whole series of grunts, moans and background noises very faithful to the ~reality~ of the film, but sometimes with a slight decline in quality resulting from a certain repetitiveness of the sounds. Conclusions Despite some evident limitations in the gameplay, The Lord of the Rings - The Third Age is certainly to be considered among the best games inspired by Tolkien's world so far. The transition, albeit within its obvious limits, from an Action/Adventure concept to a more razor-sharp onegamed, less frenetic typical of role-playing games, is undoubtedly an excellent step forward made by EA with this license, in an attempt to offer the gamer a deeper and more complete gaming experience compared to a mere three-dimensional ~shot'em up~ . The hope, in the near future, is that the programmers will be able to make the definitive leap in quality, that is, creating a complete, true Rpg, on the model of the other illustrious competitors in the sector, with cities to explore, sub-quests to complete and greater longevity, greater freedom of movement and a more balanced degree of learning of the PCs, in such a way as to make the videogame experience lived in Middle-earth more satisfying for the end user. Pros: Well-crafted turn-based battle system. Effect-laden environments. Excellent audio and graphics. Cons: Little freedom of action. Inability to manage sub-quests. No cities to explore. Relatively easy and short-lived. Let's face it all: it's about time. It was about time someone realized that the fantasy universe conceived with such mastery by the now legendary writer JRR Tolkien deserved a much deeper and more accurate production than a simple fighting game to magnify its greatness even in the videogame field. Abandoned the type of game based on action and events strictly connected to Peter Jackson's film (in the sense that one does not simply ~repeat~ the same actions seen in the films as happened in the past), LTE gives a nod to the more reasoned, ~complete~ role-playing style, probably the most suitable for representing and reviving the world created by J.R.R Tolkien in its entirety. As mentioned in the introductory hat, this The Lord of the Rings  The Third Era is a traditional role-playing game, very similar to Japanese productions more than our own. For the first time, at least in the memory of the editor, a setting, a western fantasy universe is associated with a concept, with a Japanese-style gameplay, to the point that ~The Third Era~ can, in fact, almost be considered a J- Rpg in all respects, given its obvious resemblance (not to say more) to the oriental RPG par excellence, that is, his Majesty Final Fantasy. The idea of combining the two styles, needless to deny it, makes the latest work of Redwood Shores very attractive, certainly more than the recent productions that have seen Frodo and his companions as protagonists in third-person adventures almost exclusively based on fights and on the action, undoubtedly of great visual impact at first glance, but dull and lacking in terms of play and innovation. The story features a group of unpublished characters from Middle-earth, but visually absolutely identical to the best-known elements that make up the Fellowship of the Ring. At the beginning of our adventure, in fact, we will control Berethor, Captain of the Guard of the Citadel of Gondor, traveling to Gran Burrone with the task of reaching and escorting Boromir (of which he appears to be the beardless clone). But once he gets close to the place, our friend runs into those Nazgul fetentoni, from whose clutches he is saved by the intervention of the beautiful Idrial, Elven warrior in the service of Galadriel. From this moment on, the real adventure begins that will make you retrace the entire saga from a new point of view, that of your party, through a whole series of events that will take you on the trail of the Fellowship of the Ring. . Yes, because, as mentioned, this LTE is a RPG and like any good self-respecting title of the genre, even in this EA product you can form your own group of companions in misfortune, six elements in all., each of which has physical characteristics and different techniques. Already mentioned of Berethor and Idrial, it is the turn of Elegost, a ranger from the north, Hadhod of Moria, the ~twin~ dwarf of Ghimli, Morwain of Rohan and Eaoden, a Knight of the Mark, escort of the Royal Guard of Rohan. As can be seen from this description, strangely the group lacks hobbits and wizards, but in this last case you can rest assured that the spells will still be feasible by the other elements of the group.", "date": "2004-12-17", "grade": null}
