MOBA. Paladins Strike starts with these premises, which after several weeks in soft launch is finally available worldwide for iOS and Android terminals. The formula is the one we know well and can currently count on two different modes: Siege, which will see us conquer a central point of the map in order to generate a ~wagon~ which we will then have to escort to the enemy base, in order to destroy it; and Summons, which is based on a series of territorial objectives, with zones to control and defend to rack up a higher score than the opposing team. The two teams are made up of five components as usual, the matchmaking is fast and effective, but several elements are missing compared to the classic multiplayer online battle arenas, first of all the minions and the in-game store which determines the progression of the character inside the game. The latter has been replaced by a series of bonuses that can be selected after a while and which allow us to improve our fighter's skills, drawn from a rather large but slowly accessible roster if you don't intend to dip into your wallet : it takes a few hours to get the necessary tickets for each unlock. There are four classes (Damage, Flank, Support and Frontline), while there are five warriors available for free (Viktor, Grohk, Cassie, Makoa and Buck), with the possibility of unlocking an additional character in rotation. Paladins of the Earth Thanks to a rich achievement system that unlocks money and tickets, the Paladins Strike experience proceeds rather quickly, without constraints or limitations other than the accessibility of the roster. It is not the first time that we have seen such an approach for a freemium MOBA, and we consider it completely legitimate: those who want to play for free will be satisfied with the basic fighters or get new ones with a little effort and perseverance, while those who appreciate particularly the formula developed by Hi-Rez Studio will be able to contribute to the cause by purchasing some packages and enriching their collection of warriors. Naturally there are no openings to the ~pay to win~, each character starts with the same possibilities (although modifiable through the use of the runes) and victory is a matter of experience and coordination: the team needs to move cohesively, without solitaires in jeopardy, and that we help each other where necessary. The repertoire available to the paladins is quite varied: the anthropomorphic turtle Makoa, for example, can create an energy barrier, launch a grappling hook to attract enemies to him and transform himself into a real scourge with his own special, where the weapon it's basically a powerful shotgun that reloads slowly; while Viktor is the traditional gunslinger who can strike from medium range, throw grenades or order bombs from above, but can also resort to a quick dash to quickly reach objectives or perhaps get to safety. Health is automatically recharged when we manage to escape the clashes for a few seconds, but in MOBAs this aspect must also be evaluated with great attention so as not to weigh on the team: it is often better to stay and die, waiting a few seconds for the respawn, which do not run away and leave your comrades alone in a situation of numerical inferiority. Simplifications aside, the gameplay of Paladins Strike works really well and a third mode will be unlocked in the future, the team deathmatch, but unfortunately during our tests we encountered issues that are difficult to turn a blind eye to, specifically the presence of a constant lag that affects the enjoyment of the experience. The guys at Hi-Rez Studio absolutely have to improve this aspect by working on the online infrastructure, since otherwise there is very little to complain about: both from an artistic and technical point of view, the game is really a great sight , with great characters, convincing animations and a great fluidity. Excellent touch controls, deputies to two invisible and repositionable virtual analog sticks, assisted by the icons for special attacks on the right side of the screen.", "date": "2018-05-08", "grade": "7.5"}
