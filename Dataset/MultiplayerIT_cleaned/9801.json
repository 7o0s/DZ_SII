Luckily, a business-minded fairy comes to her aid and proposes that she open an item shop, allowing her to get busy repaying the debt. Every week, for five weeks, he will have to pay an increasingly higher installment until the final balance is paid. The girl is called Recette, a very lazy and naive little girl, however good and willing to trust anyone, while the fairy is called Tear, precise and very skilled in business. The name of the new store is Recettear, which comes from the merger of the names of the protagonists (as explained in the introduction). Don't be fooled by what you've seen in classic JRPGs: running an item shop is more difficult than it seems. First you have to find the goods. Basically it is possible to go to the market or to the merchants' guild to buy stuff to put in the exhibitors, but it will be a short time before having to turn to the main source of supply, the only one that allows you to earn enough: the guild of adventurers. We'll talk about how dungeons are tackled later, for now it's important to know that to go hunting for items you need to recruit a hero, equip him with equipment (if available) and set off on an adventure. Speaking of plot, Recettear is divided into two parts: the first, in which you have to repay the debt within the established time, and the second, in which you can continue playing to discover all the aspects of the game and in which you discover different sub plots, including the one concerning the fate of Recette's father. So, even if fifteen hours are enough (if all goes well) to complete the main quest, it will take as many (and even more) to discover everything that the game has to offer. Of course, don't expect amazing films or particularly dramatic sequences, because Recettear has chosen the comedy register and relies entirely on the sympathy of the two protagonists and supporting characters, with whom very amusing situations are created. Selling and buying Recipetear gradually reveals the complexity of its trading system. In summary, after having put the objects on display, it will be necessary to open the shop (taking advantage of one of the periods in which a day is divided) and wait for the customers to arrive to make their purchases. Successful transactions yield money and experience points for Recipes, which she needs to become an ever better trader. One of the bosses Each item has a base price which, at the time of sale, can be increased or decreased depending on the current situation and some external factors. First, you have to consider market fluctuations. For example, it is not possible to increase the price of a sword if you are at a time when the general value of the weapon category is low. A second factor to consider is the type of customer you are dealing with. More people will enter the shop and not everyone is willing to spend the same amount for the same item. Some are more penniless and will ask for heavy discounts, while others will tend to buy even in front of a higher price than the basic one. The important thing is to understand that, for example, a little girl has less money to spend than the head of the merchants' guild and that, therefore, raising the price with her means not concluding the transaction positively. Another case is when one of the adventurers comes to buy equipment useful for dungeons. Being able to sell him a better sword than the one he wields is important for two reasons: to make money and, above all, to upgrade him for future adventures. There are other variables to consider (orders, requests for non-exhibited items and more), but the picture should be clear to you: to become good salespeople you need to get to know your customers by trying to satisfy them. Conquer the market As already mentioned, to obtain items, Recipes must go to the Guild of Adventurers and hire one to face one of the available dungeons. These are divided into floors and are randomly generated. Unfortunately it is not possible to enter and exit the dungeons as you want: when you are inside them, you have to go down at least five floors before you find a door that allows you to return to the village. Dying is a misfortune in several senses: it prematurely ends the exploration and, above all, it allows only one of the collected objects to be taken out of the dungeon. The latter can be of different types (weapons, armor, food, ingredients, treasures and so onvia) and can be found in two ways: by killing monsters and by opening chests. The game mechanics of these sections are somewhat reminiscent of those of Zelda, even if the labyrinths do not reach the same complexity as those faced by Link. The aim of each is to find the portal that connects to the next floor, all the while collecting as much loot as possible. The fifth floor, the one that allows you to return to base, is usually protected by a boss, except for exceptions. The clashes with the bosses are well done and are hardly resolved by beating head down; each of them requires the application of a different tactic to be defeated. Half 3D Technically Recipear is a very simple title (it must be said that it also costs a fraction of triple A titles), even if it is not bad at all. The dialogues are shown with well-made even if immobile drawings, while the dungeons are in 3D graphics, even if they extend in only two dimensions. There is nothing to cry out for a miracle, but it was not legitimate to expect anything else. However, he lets himself be watched and, in some moments, manages to be even pleasant. From an audio point of view we are on the same level: there are several well-played pieces of music, but not very original. The same goes for sound effects. In general, this is the weakest aspect of the game, even if there is no need to be too critical of what remains an indie production (moreover with a few years behind it, given that it was released in Japan in 2007).", "date": "2010-09-19", "grade": "8.5"}
