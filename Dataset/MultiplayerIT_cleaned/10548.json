{"name": "Programmare con un joypad?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69699-kodu-programmare-con-un-joypad.html", "text": "Three years ago Microsoft announced Boku, a game development tool based on the XNA platform. An important announcement, especially if we consider the enormous relevance that user-created content has today. The XNA toolset itself is the result of a strategy aimed precisely at these contents that have already been populating Live for some time. In 2008 Boku transformed into Kodu and finally revealed himself to the world. In the previous two years, many wondered why an additional development kit for arcade games, since it was already possible to create independent titles with XNA. Each question dissipated with the first public presentation. No code, just images and a little girl busy creating her world in front of the public. Simple Kodu is an exclusively iconic development tool that uses only the 360 joypad as input and is accessible to almost anyone on the face of the planet earth. A simple scalable cursor allows you to draw strips of land at will and then fill them, just as simply, with asperities, lakes and various types of objects. As many as 121 types of terrain with a dozen different fluids allow for a discreet personalization of the world which must subsequently be populated by more or less intelligent beings and by objectives to be achieved, thus giving life to the playful dimension of the matter. Each selection, including choices concerning artificial intelligence, is managed through clear and simple icons that allow you to establish the movement possibilities of enemies, friends and surrounding elements. Even if the shootem up setting seems to be the most congenial to KODU it is possible to create games that go beyond the spin and destroy paradigm. Some objects, such as balls, can be hit and thrown across the map, allowing for the creation of every type of sports game possible. Through the menu it is possible to determine the reactions of the characters managed by artificial intelligence with simple logical sequences that incorporate all the triggers necessary to bring the action to life. In the case of soccer, the opponents will have a sequence of logical commands which leads them to: look for the ball when they see it, to take it somewhere once it has been picked up, avoiding the opponent when it enters the field of vision. Too easy The limitations of icon-only programming are immediately apparent. Without numerical variables, the possibilities of manipulating physics and articulating playability are significantly reduced. Certainly KODU is simple and fast and the possible choices are in any case numerous considering that the target is certainly not made up of programmers. It is in fact a product aimed at casual users, with the explicit intention of being an immediate programming language dedicated exclusively to the creation of arcade video games. In fact, we could consider Kodu a sort of Wii of game design but in this case the aesthetic rather than functional choices seem to attract a single audience. In fact Kodu, more than usable even by a child, seems to be dedicated exclusively to children. In the hands of a savvy user, the tool proves to be too simple and limited. The iconic language becomes an obstacle as soon as you become familiar with the creation process and from an aesthetic point of view we are faced with a degree of simplicity that is excessive even for a twelve-year-old. Among other things, the absence of tools to modify and customize the graphic elements is a big flaw in the age of youtube and shared creativity. It is a real paradox that is completed in the impossibility of playing online. It is obviously possible to share what you have created with other users but there are too many limits on what you would like and should be a step forward in the world of social gaming.", "date": "2009-09-08", "grade": "S.V."}
