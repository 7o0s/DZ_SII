{"name": "Rocky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rocky.html", "text": "It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt The game opens with a splendid presentation that composes a perfect mosaic of all the various chapters of the series, with scenes taken directly from the films of the five episodes of the saga. Once the heartbeat has stabilized, you will be able to see the start menu in which there will be the classic exhibition mode, the tournament mode (initially padlocked) and finally the film mode. The latter is certainly the most awaited and appreciated peculiarity of the game, that is the possibility of retracing all the meetings and vicissitudes that occurred to Mr. Balboa. Already from the initial frames of the first meeting one can sense the accuracy for the details employed by the Rage; in fact, it begins just like in the film, on November 25, 1975 inside a chapel on the outskirts of Philadelphia against the agile Spider Rico. From here begins an adventure of over 20 matches to be played including the main ones with Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan ~I spiezzo in two~ Drago and Tommy Gunn; each of them will have the specific style that distinguished them in the cinematic versions. The game structure is as simple as it is compelling: after each match you will have the opportunity to carry out two training sessions among five that can be selected, depending on the progress of the latter, Rocky's various skills will be enhanced. The growth of the character is essential to be able to complete the game successfully, as the player's skill alone will not be sufficient to complete all the encounters, which will increase in difficulty exponentially. In Tournament mode you can choose your favorite boxer and with him carry out a series of matches to get to the conquest of the title in three different categories: bronze, silver and gold. The controls are nothing short of perfect, presenting the blows to the body (right A and left B) and the blows to the face (right X and left Y) on the four front keys of the cubic pad, while with the two back keys (L and R ) dodges / parries and very powerful uppercuts will be carried out. The left analog stick will be used not only to move around the ring but also to perform the desired blow or dodge in a more than intuitive way, making the various matches as spectacular as they are simulative. Win Rocky Win As previously announced, this made in England production is characterized by an obsessive attention to detail. The main stadiums such as the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the one in Moscow are faithfully reproduced in every single detail, as are the polygonal models of the various boxers, where somatic features and body structure have free rein. The course of the episodes is also particularly detailed; in fact, Rocky's build changes according to the paragraph that will be treated, as well as the characters in his corner. Anyone who summarily remembers the encounters that characterized the big screen saga knows how much the mixture of blood and showmanship brought endless emotions. Well, in this polygonal production the whole essence of those encounters is located, where the hinge is precisely a system of facial damage beautifully implemented in the game; depending on the blows suffered, the faces of the various boxers will begin to deform between bruises, cuts and blood, the latter which will also cover the ring and the bodies of the contenders. Although the technical realization is good, it is necessary to denote some animations that are not exactly convincing especially in the KOs; a fluctuating system of collisions, regrettable mainly in the replays and a merciless quality of the FMVs. No easy way out Who hasn't hummed Rocky's main tune in the shower? Well I would say almost none, as ~Gonna fly now~ composed by Bill Conti is a real triumphal march which, remixed in several versions, also makes a presence in this videogame challenge. Unfortunately it is the only one to be present, as the motifs that make up Rocky's soundtrack, ~Eye of the tiger~ by Survivor and ~No easy way out~ by Robert Tepper in the first place, are missing, leaving a little bitterness in mouth to the most fans of the series. As far as the dialogues are concerned, the incitements that, at the end of each round, uttered by the various coaches in perfect style with the films, are very characteristic, as are the redundant sound effects that distinguish each single shot. Final comment The history of video games teaches us how difficult certain productions inspired by films manage to revive the emotions of the film through a pad. This is Rocky's classica exception to the rule, as the atmosphere and emotions given by the game are perfectly reflected with the cinematic counterpart. This title has a lot to offer both to fans of the saga or boxing in general, and to lovers of well-packaged games. Surprise of the year. Pros: Amazing facial damage. Arcade and simulation mixed properly. There is Gonna fly now. Cons: There is only Gonna fly now. Animations and collisions to review. Really bad FMVs. It was back in 1976, the year in which the first episode of one of the most successful cinematographic sagas of all time made its debut on the big screen, tepidly inspired by a legendary boxer such as Rocky Marciano. The film in question, Rocky (for those who didn't understand it), was particularly appreciated, so much so that it won the Oscar and gave birth to four more sequels, for the characteristic way in which it treated the discipline of boxing. In the past years, some videogame developers tried to reproduce, unfortunately with little success, the emotions of which the celluloid counterpart was strong. So will Rage have succeeded where the others have failed miserably?", "date": "2002-12-09", "grade": null}
