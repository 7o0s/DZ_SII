How long has it been since a title with such explicit sexual content hasn't come to the attention of the pubic glans ahem, the general public (say average, come on)? History teaches us that sexually explicit contents have hardly been included in projects worthy of the name. Spicy situations will always repeat the same Paradoxically, the best exponents of videogame eroticism came out in the 80s/90s, when technology allowed less but more imagination. Who remembers adventures like Geisha or Fascination? Not to mention the good Larry Laffer saga. Seduce Me, who became famous for his expulsion from Greenlight, starts from a narrative framework so thin as to be allegorizable in a Wicked Weasel: Pietra, an extremely rich woman, loves to invite friends to her very luxurious villa overlooking the ocean, to devote herself to orgies and various sexual excesses. The protagonist is one of the guests and must be able to seduce one of four of the women present on site. That's all? Yes. Amazed by so much narrative richness? Are we talking to you? So? Hey! Keep your hands out! Women without costumes The adventure, let's call it that, is experienced completely in the first person. In reality, the mansion consists of fixed screens where there is nothing to interact with. The only actions left to the player are to scroll through the images to examine the environment at three hundred and sixty degrees (the ninety come later...) and select a place to move among those accessible, perhaps following some noise that suggests the presence of other people (or coitus in progress). Secondary characters offer no interaction Pietra's guests (even the half theatrical quotation, but don't you feel better reading our reviews?) are of two types: the four women to be seduced and all the other exponents of the human race present in the villa. With the latter you can only talk to gain popularity or to be accompanied by one of the four above (also below, if necessary). With the former there are other forms of interaction, accessible according to the values of the two factors which determine the level of seduction (if you do not have enough points, it will not be possible to select an interaction from the special menu). Each approach attempt requires victory in a card minigame, the very core of the gameplay. By winning, it will be possible to increase the attraction of the defeat towards the protagonist and, consequently, increase the chances that the underwear will drop and the dialogue will evolve into some sexual act, represented by a non-animated albeit explicit cartoon (you from the club of the five curved fingers , we see you! Hands on the head!). The game ends when one of the four has been completely seduced, i.e. when her attraction values towards the protagonist have reached their maximum. At that point the final porno-comic will start which will conclude the sad story. Without foreplay One of the biggest defects of erotic video games has always been that of performance anxiety, i.e. the inability to pace events in such a way as to make the player sweat to get to the coveted prey (in the case of sex scenes). Seduce Me does nothing to remedy the problem and, on the contrary, is really silly in wanting to be immediately explicit. Lilia playing jealous. Maybe she doesn't remember she changed into her underwear after a couple of card games? We have already told you the plot worthy of a Michael Bay film, but as you may have understood the rest doesn't go much deeper (this is a very difficult review) in exploring the different facets of eroticism and seduction. Basically, the women to be conquered give themselves with an ease that would make the guests of an ~elegant dinner~ of B pale ... no, no politics. Just beat them twice at cards to activate the first sex scenes. After you have thoroughly understood the few mechanics, namely how to win the card mini-games, you can be able to completely seduce one in forty minutes. The fact is that, paradoxically, Seduce Me fails right where it could have shone, that is, it fails to involve the player in its red light coils. Let's be explicit: as anyone who has at least one hand under their desk right now will know, you don't need a title like that to find pornography on the internet. Focusing on good old sexual itches to sell copies is a bit childish. In fact, one could have expected a more refined narrative product played on the tension and effort of seduction, instead of this casual game for adults starring four lively little women ready to give it to left and right in about ten minutes. Those menus are the best that Seduce Me has to offer in terms of interactions Seduce Me is therefore reduced to wandering around a villa watching more or less explicit skits and playing cards to gain popularity and sex. The surrounding elements are null as are the forms of interaction, which limit themselves to having to select an item from pre-set menus. The stories of the four women make the readers of Fifty Shades of Gray laugh almost as much: we have the bored rich woman who sees sex as a purely social fact, the sexy waitress who loves taking orders regardless, another rich woman who is more nymphomaniac than horny and a sadomasochistic girl. Only the drawings of the girls, static in any case, and partly the design of the place are saved, which will certainly appeal to Briatore fans, but a little less to those who consider similar stuff only a big tacky film by Alvaro Vitali. Finally, it is worth asking yourself a question about the protagonist: we have counted that in a game session he can manage to have sex about twenty times or more... is it Rocco?", "date": "2013-01-17", "grade": "4.0"}
