After completing the necessary preamble regarding the birth of Robotech as an animated series, let's move on to the game created by the Vicious Cycle team. The first thing to say is that this title is based solely on the first of the three ~sagas~ of the anime, namely Macross. In the role of the pilot Jack Archer, a character invented especially for the occasion, you will have to participate in the epic conflict that pits the earthlings against the terrible Zentradi, an alien race made up of feelingless giants. The war is fought on both sides using the most sophisticated and lethal instruments, which in the case of humans are the enormous fortress SDF-1 (a spaceship of disproportionate dimensions, capable of transforming itself into a kind of robot) and the Veritech fighters, extremely agile aircraft, which can face battles in three different modes: Fighter, Guardian and Battloid. The first is the starting configuration, in the form of an aircraft: very fast and equipped with lethal missiles. The second is a mixture of plane and robot, which allows you to use less powerful but more accurate missiles, as well as collect objects. Finally, the Battloid (robot) mode is definitely the best for close-quarters battles, even if it doesn't boast exceptional firepower. During the Training mode you will have the opportunity to learn how to manage the transformations and become familiar with the control system, but to really understand the potential of your battle vehicle you will have to jump into the fray... Change or die Usually the back of video game packaging is full of sound bites, and Robotech Battlecry is no exception. In this case, however, the statement ~change or die~ could not have been more apt. Don't think you can win all battles using the same tactics and weapons: you will have to change your approach often, and most of the time you will have a few tenths of a second to decide. In this sense, the most enemy-heavy missions are best understood: ~lock on~ to as many targets as you can in Fighter mode and drop the missiles. Some Zentradi Fighter Pods (fighting pods) avoid being hit by evasive maneuvers and head towards you. When the distance noticeably decreases, quickly switch to Battloid mode and use the shotgun to do as much damage as you can, thanks in part to your greater agility. As the lone survivor of your attack leaves, switch to Guardian mode and fire the missiles (which have now become available again) to wipe him out once and for all. Congratulations, at this point you have entered the spirit of the game. But try to do it while dozens of Battle Pods chase you and you have to dodge the very powerful lasers of the Zentradi motherships You will have to be very, very fast. The control system provides you with an infinite number of maneuvers and, above all, allows you to fight at your best. Only the Guardian mode has problems in this regard, since it is necessary to move the vehicle with the left analog stick of the Dual Shock 2, but adjust its speed with the D-pad. Not very comfortable, actually. The technical aspect By now it is clear that new games based on anime must be made in cel shading, and Robotech Battlecry shows once again how effective this graphical approach is in making everything as similar as possible to a real cartoon. The different Veritechs available to the player (which increase as you progress), enemy vehicles and mother ships have been drawn in an absolutely faithful way, and fans of the series will not be able to make any criticism of this aspect of the game. The same goes for the music: the composers didn't have to work very hard, since they took up the soundtrack of the anime (remixing it in some situations) and limited themselves to adding some medium quality effects. The result, however, is exceptional: you face one of the first missions, the one in which you will have to fight against millions of Zentradi motherships, and the music will only underline the atmosphere of despair and gravity of the situation. As for the voice actors, they alternate in quality, including some people who worked on the American adaptation of the anime. The technical aspect Conclusion If we were to recommend a video game based on an anime and made recently, Robotech Battlecry would be the first title to recommend. It is fast-paced, challenging, fun and well done. It is not a masterpiece, thanks to some defects (including the presence of a poor two-player mode both from a technical and content point of view), but a well-made product, long enough and which will sometimes give the edge to twist even the most savvy players. Pros: Graphics faithful to the anime Great atmosphere in some missions Frantic and fast fights Cons: Difficulty balance a bit peculiar Two player mode not very interesting There are those who complain about the treatment that Italian broadcasters reserve for Japanese cartoons, distorting their names and plot or even cutting entire episodes. Perhaps, however, many do not know that similar things happen in the USA too, and that a successful series is sometimes not only modified, but even ~merged~ with others to take advantage of the same name. If the Japanese robot Dairugger IV became ~Voltron~ and improbable sequels were invented by renaming Arbegas and Golion respectively as ~Voltron II~ and ~Voltron III~, the case of Robotech is even more emblematic: three distinct series (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada) were ~glued~ to each other, creating a completely new ~generational~ story and exploiting the similarities in the mecha design of the robots to make the result credible. The operation was enormously successful, and the creation of Robotech Battlecry for new generation gaming systems is clear proof of this: so many years after the anime aired, the franchise has not lost its popularity.", "date": "2002-12-06", "grade": null}
