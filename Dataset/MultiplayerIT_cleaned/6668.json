It is enough for a ~cosmic~ character like Kang the Conqueror to take a stand because he wants to confront an opponent worthy of him; et voil, the Collector, another prominent figure created by the house of ideas, offers him not one but hundreds of possible options. Within a campaign currently made up of three acts (~The Challenge~, ~Climax~ and ~The End~), each in turn divided into four chapters of six missions, Marvel Contest of Champions sees us take on the role of a mysterious ~summoner~ who has the task of creating a team of superheroes (and/or super-villains) to face the champions under Kang's command. Each mission takes place along a space path formed by asteroids, often forked, which must therefore be explored several times in order to be able to complete it 100% (especially from a grinding perspective). However, when our ~pawn~ meets that of an opponent, the true gameplay of the title developed by Kabam emerges, that of a fighting game with very simple controls, based fundamentally on the timing and incidence of freemium mechanisms with respect to values such as ability to deal damage and resist blows from enemies. In fact, it is enough to arrive towards the end of the second chapter to bump into a rather clear-cut ~paywall~, made up of practically unbeatable opponents (unless you maximize your team, using crystals that you can buy via in-app purchase). and an almost survival approach to the clashes, given that during a mission the characters have only one energy bar, which can only be restored with the appropriate potions (also purchasable via in-app purchase). What if a team member dies? That's right, you can resurrect him using another item, also paid. Finally, let's not forget the traditional energy points, which are consumed with each new attempt and recharge over time. In short, if the developers' goal was to monetize, nothing is missing. Marvel Contest of Champions is a simple and spectacular fighting game, but spoiled by the limits of freemium Perfect timing Marvel Challenge of Champions suffers from the excessive incidence of freemium mechanisms compared to the enjoyment of the experience, this is a fact. However, the technical quality of the game is remarkable: beyond a somewhat too full and confusing interface, in which at first it is not clear where to go to perform certain operations, during the fights the show is guaranteed by fluid animations and rather detailed polygonal models, adhering to the design of the various Marvel superheroes and super villains. Of course, there are a few clones (see the Phenomenon and the Hulk, which share structure and part of the movements), but in general the work done is remarkable, just a pity for the mediocre sound effects that accompany the hits. The visual impact will undoubtedly guarantee the Kabam title a certain following from fans of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the many other heroes on the roster, together with simple and immediate gameplay, which uses the two touch zones screen to activate on one side the parry and the special maneuver (left), on the other side the light, medium and heavy blows (right), which can be performed by touching the screen, performing slides and holding down for a long time. This last maneuver is used to open the enemy's guard, but most of the time it turns out to be too slow to be effective. In general, in Marvel Challenge of Champions winning is a matter of timing and speed, of knowing how to read the opponent's moves to parry them and counterattack by scoring as many hits as possible, perhaps seasoning everything with a disruptive special. An approach that is undoubtedly accessible and also fairly precise, but which lacks depth and variety: two limits that after a few games will begin to weigh.", "date": "2014-12-20", "grade": "6.3"}
