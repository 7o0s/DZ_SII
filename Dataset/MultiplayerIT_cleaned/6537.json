It is therefore up to the here present The Bright Lord to try to straighten the shot and provide fans of the Monolith title with valid reasons to return to massacring orcs, and the premises are undoubtedly interesting: in fact, the player plays the role of only Celebrimbor at period of his escape from the clutches of Sauron by means of the One Ring, and therefore allows you to experience firsthand what in the main game was only hinted at through cutscenes. So let's see if the playful component has proved to be up to such an intriguing setting... Bad memories The Bright Lord begins with a brief ~recycled~ introduction from Shadow of Mordor, given that it is more or less the same cutscene relating to one of the flashbacks Celebrimbor had in his adventure with Talion: we therefore see the elf while forge the One Ring, then use it to escape the prison in which Sauron had locked him up. The actual game begins immediately after these events, with Celebrimbor determined to exploit the power of the artifact to subjugate the orcs to his will and thus turn them against their master. The map in which this DLC takes place is a reduced version of the Udun region (the one in which the first part of the main campaign is set), constantly shrouded in a sort of reddish fog: a choice evidently made by the Monolith graphics for give the scenario a more threatening tone, but which ends up debasing the graphics of the game, making everything too muddy and monotonous. Even the Uruk sadly adapt to the uniformity of the scenario, showing themselves covered by armor that makes them almost indistinguishable from each other, and struggling to show off a great personality even as regards captains and various commanders. Despite the change of protagonist then, the developers have decided to maintain the questionable setting already adopted with the previous Lord of the Hunt, putting in the hands of the user a fully enhanced hero even if equipped with some different characteristics compared to Talion: therefore Celebrimbor can't slow time when shooting a bow, but he can shoot arrows faster, and he has a couple more moves to mark opponents. A practice that allows you to fill the indicator relating to the power of the One Ring, using which you enter a sort of momentary bullet time with the ability to perform executions and special shots at will; considering how relatively easy it is to reload the skill, this new feature gives the clear impression of being too effective especially when used against captains and commanders, ending up bringing the difficulty level back to a decidedly affordable threshold despite Monolith's declared intention to make this More challenging DLC than the original adventure. The only spikes in challenge rate are seen in Trials of the Ring (a handful of side quests that, if completed, allow you to increase the artifact's usage window), not so much because they're arduous per se but because of obvious deficiencies of designs that make them particularly frustrating. The Bright Lord unfortunately confirms Monolith's poor feeling with the Shadow of Mordor DLCs Weak link Another perplexing aspect of Il Lucente Signore is its remarkable linearity, which clashes strongly with that freedom of action that represented one of the cornerstones of the Shadow of Mordor. The succession of the various main missions that make up the DLC is very guided, with Celebrimbor who must first kill Uruk captains to subject their followers and have them build some towers of the forge, and then go hunting for the proverbial five commanders to brand them and make them to turn against Sauron. The missions do not show great variety and the Nemesis System is literally held back by a structure that is too rigid, which in an attempt to propose a different type of challenge ends up making the title orphan of some of its most stimulating aspects. In this sense, the developers' decision to make the bodyguards always appear together with their leaders turns up their noses, thus depriving the player of the pleasure of dealing with the subordinates and then the boss as he sees fit: all in an attempt to make these clashes more difficult, an operation however rendered in vain by the aforementioned excessive effectiveness of powerof the One Ring. But when it comes to questionable design choices, the climax is reached by the Bright Lord in his doggedness to focus almost exclusively on the practice of marking enemies. Throughout the campaign, the user is challenged to take control of the Uruks rather than kill them, in order to raise a personal army to unleash against Sauron. Just what was in all respects one of the less successful elements of The Shadow of Mordor is here promoted to the cornerstone of the gameplay, with easily imaginable effects on the quality of the playful experience. We therefore find ourselves constantly busy branding orcs over which we then have no effective control, and which only end up getting in the way during the fights, generating an annoying confusion. The two new commands introduced by Il Lucente Signore are of little use, which allow the protagonist to gather a group of five Uruk in battle or to sacrifice them to restore their vital energy: if Monolith's goal was to give life to spectacular skirmishes between the orcs subject by Celebrimbor and those loyal to Sauron, the target can be said to have been spectacularly missed. Just as a substantial hole in the water is also the conclusion of the DLC, arrived in our experience after about three hours of play: what was meant to represent a sort of fine for the objectively uninspiring epilogue of the main campaign appears (again) as something made with obvious approximation. Without wanting to run into spoilers, let's just say that the decisive battle with Sauron is reached very hastily, and that the final fight itself turns out to be a sad compendium of all the gameplay problems we have expressed so far. And the fact that The Bright Lord managed to waste the opportunity to give a solid playful basis to such an epic battle says a lot about the value of this DLC, which unfortunately only confirms Monolith's poor feeling with this kind of expansions .", "date": "2015-02-26", "grade": null}
