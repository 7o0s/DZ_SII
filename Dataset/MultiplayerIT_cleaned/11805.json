{"name": "I Simpson: Il Videogioco - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-simpson-il-videogioco-recensione.html", "text": "Comment This umpteenth video game dedicated to the yellow Simpson family is, quite simply, the title that every fan has been waiting for. Not so much for the quality: the game is actually a decent action-game with platform elements that certainly doesn't stand out from the crowd for a particularly sharp game design, it is above all quite obvious and banal. But it is the exceptional translation from the concept of the cartoon to the console that is surprising, as none of those elements that have made every installment of the series from 1987 to today a hoot: there is the surreal comedy and there are the witty jokes, there are the original voice actors (both in the American version and in the Italian version) and there are real animated sequences. We are therefore well on our way to a new generation of video games dedicated to the first family of television media, this departure has been an excellent test... let's hope we don't have to wait for another cinematic film! Pros It's The Simpsons, little to add Very good video and audio sectors Fun, both to play and to see Cons It certainly doesn't win an award for originality Some graphical problems (unstable frame-rate, bad camera) Unbalanced difficulty level Doh! The meticulous reconstruction of a virtual Springfield and its inhabitants was a difficult task, but the programmers of Electronic Arts deserve a round of applause for the excellent three-dimensional engine through which the most faithful videogame representation of the most famous pop cartoon of the world. The Simpsons Video Game seems at times an interactive cartoon, if it weren't for that resolution which paradoxically renders better on normal and non-HD screens, attenuating an aliasing that is at times too evident; the bright colors, the complexity of the various environments and the excellent animations are all elements of a positive picture, undermined by some significant technical problems, such as a certain discomfort in the movement of the camera, often random and annoying, and an inconstant frame-rate . Of course the flagship of the game, even in the same Italian edition, is the audio sector. Not only the soundtrack, anonymous but in pure Simpson style, but also and above all the dubbing: the enormous amount of speech in the game has been entrusted to none other than the voice actors of the Italian animated series, which we have loved for almost twenty years and which have delighted with an exceptional voice acting (although sometimes a little desynchronized, especially in the animated cutscenes) and the voices of the Simpsons as we have always known them. Tonino Accolla, Monica Ward, Ilaria Stagni... all present, in full force, to help us immerse ourselves in a video game that is almost a cartoon... until we take the pad in hand. The Simpsons: The Video Game is available for Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for PlayStation 3. It is mathematically impossible that someone does not know the Simpson family: can you believe that almost twenty years and more than four hundred episodes have already passed since the first episode? In all this time it is difficult that someone has not come across the inhabitants of Springfield, the fictitious town in which the adventures of the Simpsons and their biting satire towards society are set, especially the American one. And of course it is not the first time that the Simpsons become a video game, but it is precisely on the occasion of the release of the first feature film that this Electronic Arts product peeps out: let's say immediately that more than other productions it has been able to capture the feeling of the cartoon and the ingenious irony of Matt Groening, creator of the series and of this incredible multimedia phenomenon. The new game dedicated to the Simpsons, available for practically every platform on the market, is almost an interactive cartoon, with the original (Italian!) voice actors and an exorbitant amount of goodies... Just like we've always wanted it? Fan Service! In Springfield there is a new catchphrase among teenagers: Grand Theft Itchy, the most ~in~ video game of the moment, which naturally cannot be missing from the pestiferous Bart Simpson's collection. Caught by his mother with a newly purchased copy of the game, immediately confiscated, a dejected Bart returns home, but ends up coming across the manual of The Simpsons: The Video Game, which explains how to use the superpowers of each member of the family. From that moment on, a long series of misadventures begins, in which the Simpsons, two by two, will have to face the most disparate crises: from the sabotage of a carpentry to an alien attack, passing through absurd incursions into the virtual world where they produced video games. Essentially presented as an meta-video game, The Simpsons: The Video Game does nothing but tease and make fun of itself, proposing a goliardic all-round satire not only of our society, as usual, but also of the world of video games itself. It's funny to bump into an invisible wall and be told it's a cliche by Comic Book Guy, but it's little cutscenes like these that make for an intriguing and hilarious experience. The entire adventure is configured as a sort of giant episode of the series, with a generous amount of cartoon sequences that introduce and conclude the various stages: the latter, then, mimic a bit of everything, especially in the videogame field , and they definitely do it with style. So here is the huge donut mannequin wandering around Springfield in a grotesque imitation of the masterpiece Shadow of the Colossus, and Homer and Marge will find themselves playing Link and Zelda in Neverquest, and the fat patriarch will have to wear a helmet and military uniform in the Medal of Honor parody... of course, Medal of Homer. Fan Service! The wealth of extravagant situations and the genuine irony of the series are intact in this video game adaptation, which boasts a truly extraordinary attention to detail and for the fans, in a truly exceptional reproduction of the Simpson home and the whole of Springfield, and not really no one is missing, it seems that all the wacky inhabitants of the city have found a place in the game, from Mr. Burns to Principal Skinner.
