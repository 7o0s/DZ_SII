{"name": "Uccelli da combattimento", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152346-angry-birds-fight-uccelli-da-combattimento.html", "text": "It all began with the puzzle game you know well, Angry Birds, in which birds were thrown against more or less complex structures with the aim of eliminating their evil inhabitants, in this case an army of green pigs. After various sequels and reinterpretations, the franchise has given birth to a whole series of spin-offs: first the excellent Bad Biggies, which put the little pigs at the center of attention in a Banjo-Kazooie-style simulation context: Screws and Bolts ; then a sequence of endless runners and puzzle games of various kinds, from the Puzzle Bobble clone to the Angry Birds Fight! present here, which deals with the match-3 sub-genre, however giving the sensation of wanting to compete with products such as the classic Puzzle Quest . Just play a few games, however, to realize how Rovio's approach is highly casual and devoid of those strategic and role-playing elements that have made the genre so popular. But let's go in order. Starting from an island structure, which the ~angry birds~ find themselves exploring on board a ship, we will have the task of facing a series of direct clashes to free each scenario and be able to move on to the next, in the meantime trying to unlock new characters of the classic Angry Birds roster. The matches are regulated by the tedious action energy system, a solution unfortunately common to many freemium games, and our opponents are the ~ghosts~ of real users, in an asynchronous perspective which has also been very popular for some time. How exactly does the combat take place? At the bottom of the screen is the classic match-3 board, with bird icons that must be moved and matched in groups of three or more, all within a time limit of forty-five seconds. When the timer reaches zero, the system sums up our actions and translates them into an increase in attack or defense power, then we see an animation in which characters literally bludgeon each other, and whose outcome depends on it starts from our ability to manage the board, in part (largely) from the level of experience and from the power-ups possessed by one opponent or the other, which make the attacks more effective. Angry Birds Fight! stands as one of the weaker spin-offs for the Rovio blockbuster Giant pigs in the middle of the sea As mentioned in the opening, the experience of Angry Birds Fight! it just mimics that of Puzzle Quest-style titles, as eliminations on the board do not produce immediate actions and rather fill a ~bar~ on which victory or defeat may depend. After a certain number of matches, the preponderance of a random element in the outcome of the clashes unfortunately appears clear, because it is precisely the equipment that substantially influences the effectiveness of the moves of the two ~fighters~. The same solution is applied to the random fights with the kaiju-pigs, which you come across from time to time, and during the fights with the green piggy ships, which mark the completion of a scenario in order to then proceed to the island next one. We are therefore rather disappointed by the lack of depth, which makes the game a little too light and devoid of bite, beyond impromptu entertainment, with the only factor of unlockable weapons adding a minimum of progression to the gameplay. However, if Angry Birds Fight! leaves unsatisfied when it comes to substance, the same cannot be said of the form, because in this sense the developers have done an excellent job: the characters have their own personality, the graphics are very colorful and the animations - especially those of the fights - succeed always eliciting a smile. Some found, then, like the aforementioned kaiju-pigs, are really nice. Of course, we would have liked these tantalizing ideas to be accompanied by a solid system, but maybe it will be for the next spin-off...", "date": "2015-06-26", "grade": "5.0"}
