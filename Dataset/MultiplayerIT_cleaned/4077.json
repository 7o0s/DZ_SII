It cannot be hidden that the multitude of outings has almost tired us out, delimiting a very blurred line between fun and boredom. The fact remains that some of these games have rightfully entered the common imagination of independent pearls and among these, without any doubt, Hyper Light Drifter is included. Released a couple of years ago, it is now in the process of reaching the Nintendo flagship with its special edition. We have replayed it with great pleasure, mainly analyzing what is the work done by Heart Machine on the porting for Switch. Net of some details and limitations generated by the very nature of the console, we can tell you right away that, as too often happens with this genre, Switch is the perfect platform on which to play Hyper Light Drifter. A patterned plot When Hyper Light Drifter was released on the market, the combinations with souls in terms of difficulty and non-linear progression led many to not even understand the nature of the title. If this is true, it is equally fair to say that the narrative follows the same stylistic features based on lore, rather than on a proper plot. Apart from the few initial scenes and some small interludes, everything else is reduced to interactions with non-player characters that will only lead to the display of simple artworks from which we will be called to extrapolate, if we wish, the reality of the facts. What is immediately clear is that we find ourselves in a world now adrift, still populated but close to its complete destruction and which has seen the death of almost everything good that used to trample the planet. The Drifter, protagonist of the adventure, is the one who has to purge the various areas of this alien world from an ancient and unspecified threat. From these simple and almost trivial premises, a story in images unfolds that hides multiple levels of reading, one more articulated and profound than the other, which pass through the collection of monoliths, keys, small conversations and observation of the key places in the world of game. The advent and fall of the librarians, the reason for the birth of the titans, the goal of the jackal (incredibly close to the god Anubis) and the descending and tragic parable of the Drifter himself, plagued by a dark disease, enclose together one of the most interesting and symbolic of recent years, elevating Hyper Light Drifter to a real work of art, far beyond the simple and excellent video game. It is useless to delve into each of these aspects, which would require a series of specials closer to philosophy and ancient history than to videogame journalism, for this reason we limit ourselves to advising you not to stop at the first level of reading, you would really lose a lot of Hyper Light Drifter. The gameplay in its dazzling form The Heart Machine game already two years ago had amazed by its incredible ability to combine a progression close to the idea of Zelda, with a combat system and an extremely action difficulty. Let's quickly recap the basics: it is a top-down game, full of platform sections, which can be managed in an extremely simple way through the Drifter's shooting ability. Each of the areas of the open world, immediately (almost) totally explorable, represents a different biome and, in addition to the classic exploration, hides a series of dungeons that open up to the whole underground world of Hyper Light Drifter. The conclusion of the dungeons and the progression in the areas lead to the natural conclusion dedicated to the bosses, among the best ever made for this genre. You will be called upon to put together all your best skills and the application of each action present in the title to emerge unscathed, especially as regards the fourth and last area, the only one not immediately accessible. The combat is a mix between close and ranged attacks, being able to count on a handful of white weapons and as many fire tools. The bullet reloading mechanic, linked to melee blows inflicted on enemies or some elements of the scenario, allows you to balance the combat sessions very well and finds its best application during boss fights. To fill an already rather dense title, we think about a series of collectibles, useful both to delve into the game world, but also to open normally inaccessible areas and which contain large amounts of currency or new clothes, each with its own specific characteristic. There are also sellers, from whom you can buy new weapons, but also upgrades for your shot or increase the quantity of transportable medikits. There is something for all tastes, therefore, confirming a title which, in its genre, represents a real essential pearl for all fans. The Special Edition Two words regarding the additions, in terms of content, to this Switch version. What we've come across, and what we know to be the two biggest additions, are a new pair of swords - useful and in some ways too strong in the game economy - and a whole new area, accessible via the main city and which presents us with a series of interesting challenges, including bosses. The feeling is that Heart Machine really wanted to pay homage to this complete version of its jewel, adding something very close to a real DLC, without playing cheaply and selling it separately. The graphics that help On an artistic level, we have already said how Hyper Light Drifter adopts that increasingly abused pixel art in recent times. Unlike the stereotype of dated graphics, useful only to mask a budget that would make it ridiculous to aim for something else, Heart Machine has made its choice a strength, setting up a lively and colorful world. This is not a technically mediocre title, on the contrary it could easily be a candidate for the best pixel art ever, with a recognizable style and capable of giving respectable glimpses and animations, demonstrating a superfine and never hasty artistic work. What makes this Switch version a real jewel is the possibility of playing it at a very solid 60fps, both in the portable version and when inserted in the appropriate dock, minimizing the loss of quality that instead we have often noticed on the Nintendo flagship when used via external monitor. To fill a cake of such goodness in the best way, we think a soundtrack that draws heavily from Vangelis and which tells in an exciting way the descending parable of a hero and his world, up to kidnap the player with his synths, proving once again that the video game can be art, to the nth degree.", "date": "2018-09-05", "grade": "9.0"}
