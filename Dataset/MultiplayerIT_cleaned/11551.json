{"name": "E non ne rimase nessuno - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/e-non-ne-rimase-nessuno-recensione_a.html", "text": "Eight very different people are invited to spend some time at the summer estate of a wealthy couple. The villa is located on an island famous for the difficult conditions of the waters that surround it, often restless, capable of making the place unreachable for days in case of storms. Upon their arrival, the guests find only the two servants waiting for them, who inform them that the hosts will be late in arriving due to an unexpected commitment. Ten people in all, therefore, who at a certain point will begin to die, one by one, following the verses of an old nursery rhyme. The game In this video game reduction, the novel ~... and then there was nobody left~ sees the addition of an eleventh character, Patrick Narracott, who accompanies the eight guests by boat to the island and then gets stuck with them due to sabotage. Patrick doesn't know what is about to happen, but there are several things that make him suspicious: one of the guests is involved in the arrest of his brother (perpetrated unjustly, behind unfounded charges), and he is probably the person who sabotaged the boat to force him to stay in that place. The hosts have sent each person an invitation, but they still haven't shown up or felt like they don't exist. And the guests, apparently so different from each other, could actually be united by something terrible. In the game we will play the role of Patrick Narracott, and we will have to move within various locations to discover clues and solve puzzles, following the typical mechanics of ~point and click~ adventures, of which this product is an all too classic exponent. Wii version is technically identical to the PC one, with the difference of a control system no longer based on the mouse but on the Wii-mote. In general, the two devices are quite similar, even if the Nintendo controller offers us the possibility of exploiting the motion sensors for some applications that are sometimes purely accessory, sometimes spot on and interesting. Control system and structure To move from one area of the scenario to another, all we have to do is move the Wii-mote, wait for the pointer on the screen to change into the footsteps icon and press the A or B button. In case we want to run towards the desired point , just press the button twice in rapid succession (a ~double click~, in practice...). In the presence of interactable objects, on the other hand, it will not be enough to point and click, but it will be necessary to move the controller miming the action that the character will have to perform (rotate the Wii-mote on its axis, for example, to open a door). A nice gimmick, which makes the difference when solving puzzles, given that you will have to move the controller in the most suitable way to turn on switches, move objects, etc. Let's also say that we will often find ourselves faced with a ~puzzle within a puzzle~, in the sense that not only will we have to figure out what to do with certain objects, but also how to do it using the Wii-Mote. Beyond these specific applications, normal picking and browsing actions are based solely on icons. We will have two distinct inventories available, one for objects (in which it will be possible to combine them) and one for documents and data sheets relating to the characters. Technical realization As mentioned, the Wii version of E none remained is identical to the PC version, released in 2005. The developers, unfortunately, have not made any improvements to a graphics that is not exceptional in itself, rather rather spartan in the polygonal models both during the cutscenes than in the actual game. So we will have to get used to quite angular characters, with all too visible ~joints~, animated in a barely sufficient way. A different argument can be made for the scenarios, which are static and have retained their charm over time. Even here, however, there is nothing that makes you cry for a miracle or even remotely exploit the technical possibilities of the Nintendo console. Well, at least the waiting times for loading the different shots are minimal. On the other hand, the sound sector is well done, with an excellent dubbing in Italian which covers the lack of quality music or effects. Finally, the control system is entrusted entirely to the Wii-mote alone and proves to be rather precise and sensitive, perfectly in line with what is required by the game. Comment And none remained is a good point and click adventure, of a classic nature, strong in a plot that, despite its years (the original novel was published for the first time in 1939...), manages to always be engaging and Interesting. Given the particular connotation of the game, it is clear that you have already readthe book it's based on and knowing how it ends takes away a lot of its flavor. Apart from this, unfortunately we must once again denounce an approximate technical realization, in this case the graphics of the game take up the one already seen on PC three years ago, without any modifications. The use of the Wii-mote instead of the mouse does not change the cards on the table as regards the standard action, while things change when there are puzzles to solve, with some nice ideas that are based on motion detection of the controller. Ultimately, we are faced with a title for fans of the genre only, who want to experience an adventure on the Wii and have no particular technical pretensions. Pros: Always engaging plot Good control system Excellent dubbing in Italian Cons: Spartan graphics All too classic setting Only for fans of the genre", "date": "2008-03-19", "grade": null}
