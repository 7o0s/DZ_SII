{"name": "N.o.v.a. 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83309-nova-2-la-stella-piu-luminosa-di-gameloft.html", "text": "From the story to the setting, from the design of the characters to the game interface, even going from the weapons to the available vehicles: everything, in the first chapter of N.o.v.a., traced in a singular way and without any shame, almost to applause for how obsessive in the details, the successful Halo series and the epic story of that Master Chief who has become a true icon of the market in just a few years. Yet, leaving aside the hackneyed criticisms of the lack of originality, Gameloft's game had enormous merit: together with Modern Combat, and perhaps even more, it represented a turning point for the development of FPS on mobile devices , setting guidelines for all the productions made subsequently, both in technical and gameplay terms, thanks to a robust single-player campaign and an even more fun multiplayer component. It was therefore unlikely that, after the success enjoyed by critics and the public, the French label would not decide to return to the App Store with a more epic, fast and impressive sequel to the previous chapter, in which the protagonist is once again Master Ch... pardn, Kal Wardin. Towards perfection Set six years after the events narrated in the first chapter, the N.o.v.a. 2 opens with an abrupt landing on a small plateau with luxuriant vegetation. Still, the strong sense of dj vu and the nagging impression that Yelena, Wardin's guiding AI, looks a little too much like Cortana, immediately give way to the game's graphical majesty. High definition and Retina Display support certainly do most of the work, but the attention to detail, the variety of environments, the quality of textures and graphic effects are a completely different story compared to the original N.o.v.a. Even the HUD is now much sleeker and more pleasing to the eye, although every element has remained firmly in place. All without obvious frame drops or major compromises, if not for some sporadic loading to interrupt the mission in progress. On balance, N.o.v.a. 2 is undoubtedly the most visually spectacular and technically the best FPS on the App Store, if we exclude Rage HD which, like a woman in a bodice, closes itself in a system on rails, sacrificing freedom of movement to be able to show all its forms. But it's not just the muscles that make the game spectacular: the variety and liveliness of the environments is remarkable, while an over-the-top direction pleasantly orchestrates each battle, with twists and excellent interludes. Too bad for a plot that could certainly be more consistent and original, while the action is almost always very linear. Fortunately, the developers have given the possibility to deactivate the compass from the game options, so as to satisfy those who hate always knowing in which direction to go and what to do. However, if making progress graphically is already a big challenge in the mobile sector, it is even more so to find new control schemes capable of adapting complex gameplay to devices with few keys or, in this case, without any keys. The convenience of the mouse, the Wiimote or the PlayStation Move, an FPS on the iPhone is dreamed of, yet Gameloft has managed to improve constantly, also thanks to the continuous relay between its brands Modern Combat and N.o.v.a.: the witness, this time, is the support to the iPhone 4 gyroscope, already introduced in Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus and further refined for the occasion. Being able to turn abruptly or simply move the camera is now possible even without taking your finger off the trigger, while the automatic aim, especially if set to high levels, gives an approach that is certainly less hardcore but also more immediate and not at all frustrating. Let me be clear, we are certainly not facing a point of no return, and indeed in the most agitated battles the weight of an interface is still felt which forces two thumbs to move, aim and shift the gaze at the same time. But, and there is no doubt about this, the controls of N.o.v.a. 2 represent the apex of a genre that on the iPhone tries to adapt brick by brick, in search of an alchemy that seems less and less distant. Over the course of its 12 missions, the single-player campaign shoots up ever-changing situations, which see the player face huge carnivorous plants in the Jungle, defend a temple using turrets, drive a gigantic mech or speed aboard a futuristic motorcycle. The multiplayer experience, already fundamental in the first N.o.v.a., has always been a very important element in Gameloft's FPS. It is therefore not surprising that the developers have paid considerable attention to the online mode of a title which, however, was born with the intentionone to build on a franchise that redefined multiplayer console gaming. N.o.v.a. 2 still has an advantage, recovering all the best that Black Pegasus has offered from this point of view, both locally (via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), and on the net, where, always relying on the excellent Gameloft Live! instead of on Game Center, the game offers 10 players at a time the opportunity to challenge each other in intense fire matches. The five modes available are quite traditional, ranging from classic deathmatch to Capture the Flag, through to frenetic team battles. More particular are the Instagib and Immobilize options, both inherited from the FPS for consoles and PC: in the first the automatic aim is deactivated and it is possible to kill and be killed with a single blow, while in the second one it is possible to revive the paralyzed companions before they die and thus give points to the opposing team. Probably the lack of integration of Game Center can make someone turn up their noses, but once online, you immediately change your mind: even in the most populated matches it is quite rare to suffer from lag, and at any time of the day it is always possible to find a bunch of players available. There are as many as 10 arenas available, although some of these unfortunately suffer from small dimensions and respawn points arranged in an inappropriate way. If on the one hand this ensures that you immediately find yourself in the middle of the action, even in fights with just a few players, on the other it risks becoming a serious problem when, especially in the most crowded matches, you end up returning in play with an enemy behind you. Finally, the addition of a perk system is particularly welcome: killing in battle earns experience points useful for leveling up, while based on the rank achieved, upgrades and new weapons can be obtained to be used in online battles.
