{"name": "Decarnation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/decarnation-recensione.html", "text": "Gloria's Dream Journal is prominently displayed in her apartment. Interacting with it, Gloria defines it thus: ~It was a nice idea, but now it's just where I write the shopping list~. On the eve of her thirtieth birthday, the dancer wonders where her lifelong dream has gone: to become a famous dancer, acclaimed in cabarets around the world. This is how Decarnation opens, in the name of the ambitions and vanity of a young vault who, right from the start, finds herself constantly confronted with the male world: intrusive admirers, bosses convinced they know what's best for her, sculptors who portray her but they consider it little more than a starting point for their sublime art. Decarnation lives and feeds on the intrusive gaze of men towards the body of a young woman, exposed and treated as a commodity, destined to be thrown without compliments into a spiral of horror from which it seems practically impossible to get out. Unfortunately, if it is true that the narration - net of some drops in pace and an excessively dragged ending - is undoubtedly the strong point of the production, in terms of interaction and gameplay Atelier QDB has not managed to do a job coherent and convincing. We talk about it in detail in our review of Decarnation. From cabaret to hell and back Gloria's inner world is full of fears, memories and traumas that we will have to face in the nightmares of the young dancer protagonist of Decarnation Paris, 1989. The sculptor Petrus, after discovering the dancer Gloria in a cabaret, uses her as a model for a bronze statue. The dialogue between the two lays the foundations for the entire plot and the themes of Decarnation: the power dynamic between artist and model recalls the violent reading of the relationship between these two figures given in Immortality (and explored in our special on Immortality, the crucifixion of the muse and the painting of Francis Bacon, of which, not surprisingly, a painting is shown in the museum visited in Decarnation). Petrus reflects on the fast and cruel passage of time and shows no regard for Gloria when, a few months later, the statue inspired by her is inaugurated in an important Parisian museum. During the visit to the museum, Gloria sees with horror that a man is touching the bronze statue that reproduces his features. From here on, Decarnation sinks into an endless horror, suspended between the reality experienced by the dancer and her nightmares, full of symbols and metaphors of her experience. Giant eyes open and engulf the young woman, catapulted into a parallel world visibly inspired by the cinema of Satoshi Kon and David Lynch. On the other hand, in our opinion, the reference made in the game's promotional material to Lovecraftian poetics is incomprehensible, by now used as a catalyst for public interest, but often emptied of its real meaning (a bit like recently happened, in a similar way, in The Last Case of Benedict Fox). The fears, regrets, idiosyncrasies of Gloria feed monsters, puzzles, ghosts that populate her dreams, more and more disturbing as the adventure progresses. Don't expect excessive and gory horror: Decarnation focuses on clean pixel art and a more disturbing than scary and surprising staging, with very few scares and a lot of psychological horror. In our opinion, the narrative is excessively dilated in some points, and the adventure deserved a more concise and incisive ending; overall, however, Decarnation is certainly interesting for how it deals with difficult and uncomfortable issues, leading its protagonist on a path of self-awareness and analysis lasting about five hours in total. Violence, oppression and ballets a bit like this The dance sections represent the lowest point of the Decarnation gameplay: imprecise and unpleasant, they are also characterized by a very little variety of the proposed pieces The gameplay of Decarnation - a title with a strong narrative traction, and with a considerable amount of text - is mainly based on small mini-games, some of which are repeated during the adventure (such as the parts dedicated to dancing), intended to intersperse the sections dedicated to reading the dialogues. In fact, these interactions are little more than parentheses, poorly integrated within the videogame fabric as a whole, and are often performed in a rather clumsy way. For example, the Gloria ballets are performed by pressing the keys indicated at screen: you have to press them when they arrive in a box placed above the dancer's head. Too bad these don't come in time with the music and their sound effect(both in case of success and in case of failure to press the key) heavily interferes with the soundtrack. On the latter topic, we generally found the pieces by the French band Fleur et Bleue pleasant, but the sound design of the game is not always adequate in relation to the moment and the situation. Not to mention that in the Nintendo Switch version we tested there are numerous sound glitches and bugs that have compromised the overall experience, forcing us to restart the game several times and rely on the (not always frequent) automatic saves, in the absence of a manual save option. The puzzles of Decarnation oscillate between the mundane and the obscure: it is not always immediately clear what to do In some cases, the interactions manage to clearly express the message of Decarnation, but for the majority of the adventure this is not the case. Atelier QDB fares much better from a visual point of view, managing to create nightmarish glimpses that will remain etched in our minds for a long time. Too bad for the lack of an Italian translation: its absence makes it impossible for an audience not equipped with a good knowledge of the English language to enjoy the game, given the considerable amount of text.", "date": "2023-05-31", "grade": "6.0"}
