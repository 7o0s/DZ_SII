After a long period in soft launch, SEGA's strategic RPG is finally available on iOS and Android in the traditional freemium format, downloadable for free, and you just need to play for a few minutes to realize how accurate this new mobile production is. In fact, there are many characters, even the lesser known ones: Zeta, the first opponent faced by Kenshiro to help Lynn; Hearts, the huge warrior covered in a layer of fat that neutralizes Hokuto's techniques; Amiba, the ruthless assassin who posed as Toki; Uighur, Cassandra's mighty guardian; and of course the various Toki, Rei, Raoul, Shew and the aforementioned Souther, for a total of almost thirty fighters that we will first have to face and then eventually unlock to add them to our party. In addition to this, the developers have also included in the game an avalanche of spectacular pre-rendered cutscenes that retrace the key events of the series and boast a style very similar to that of Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise, revealing how probably the two projects have been carried forward in the same period, at least as regards certain assets. The formula is the traditional one of the genre: you compose a team and launch yourself into a series of turn-based fights with an increasingly higher degree of difficulty. Specifically, with each blow inflicted by our characters it is possible to tap the screen again when the Big Dipper gauge fills up to get a boost and a flash chain with the other members of the group. After a while the specials load, and there things get very spectacular: Ken performs his attack of a thousand punches, Rei the Nanto Water Bird technique, Bart... gets into the car and runs over the enemies , and so on. Structure and technique In short, from the gameplay point of view, Fist of the North Star Legends ReVive does not introduce particular novelties nor does it boast a relevant strategic characterization: the duel is won by the strongest team, with very few exceptions, and the first hours slip away rather trivial, without any difficulty, until the completion of the fight with Shin. After that, in conjunction with the unlocking of a series of alternative modes (including a boss rush and an arena for automatic clashes with other users, not in real time) and the inevitable in-game shop, the progression slows down abruptly and the inevitable grinding appears, with the need to reach a certain level of experience before being able to continue the main story. In the advanced stages, the freemium elements also take shape, practically absent throughout the initial part of the game, but it is an adequate price to pay if we consider the incredible care required for the realization of this title. In addition to the large number of protagonists and the presence of numerous cinematics, in fact, the narration is also carried forward by showing the original plates of the manga by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, edited in a dynamic and engaging way. What appears before the eyes of a fan of Ken the Warrior is therefore a real encyclopedia of the series, which enhances the events of the comic (not of the anime: there is a certain difference) without being enthusiastic about the real mechanics, identical for example to those of Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 but with a little less variety in terms of the moves available. On the technical front, therefore, an enormous and passionate work has been done, but the graphics at the highest quality are unmanageable on the iPhone X (the terminal gets very hot after a few minutes) and therefore we would have appreciated a more careful optimization work, which perhaps will come with the next updates. The polygonal models are well done, the animations appear discreet but have the disadvantage of repeating themselves too often during the clashes, getting boring, while the main interface is so full of elements that it takes some time to understand. The action is accompanied by a very passionate rock soundtrack, supported by the original song ~You Wa Shock~ which is heard during the introductory phase.", "date": "2019-09-09", "grade": "7.0"}
