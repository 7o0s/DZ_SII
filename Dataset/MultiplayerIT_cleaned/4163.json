Good but certainly not transcendental, it is good to remember this given the fluctuating qualities of the franchise, although the gradual but constant evolutions have been sufficient to guarantee the survival of the modest but tenacious Cyanide sports series, capable of having its say also on consoles with the aforementioned Le Tour de France. Among other things, the chapter for PS4 and Xbox One finally balances the score with the PC counterpart thanks to the Pro Leader mode, practically identical to the Pro Cyclist mode, even if some career-related simplifications remain. The substance, however, is the same as what Pro Cycling Manager 2018 offers compared to the 2017 edition seems to be identical. Yet there is something new, something that is good for the entire series and is more important than it seems. All the same as the previous chapter, at least in appearance Something has changed in Pro Cycling Manager 2018 as well, but you need to pay attention to notice the most important change. The recipe of this new chapter, in fact, is the same as the previous titles, starting from the mechanics in the race to get to the graphics engine that creaks heavily under the weight of time. Fortunately, we are light years away from the robotic cyclists who moved in unison in the first chapters, but we know very well that Cyanide can do better and in the middle of 2018 we begin to turn up our noses in front of semi-paralyzed spectators and cyclists with rigid, with models so spartan as to be often distinguishable from each other only thanks to the difference in body size. The glance with the view from above holds up, also thanks to the number of cyclists and thanks to the good work done on the landscapes, while the distinctive signs on the faces of the athletes are not lacking, but they certainly don't attract attention due to the limits of an engine that stands out mostly for the lack of details, leading many to turn up their noses in front of a chapter that from the point of view of technical improvements brings absolutely nothing new. And we don't find anything new even in terms of content, with the main mode remaining the queen of the experience by asking us to play the role of manager and coach of a cycling team. Taking on their role, we deal with sponsors and budget management while looking for new champions with whom to enrich a roster of athletes to train and encourage in view of all the great two-wheeled competitions. Between races for single runners, high mountain stages and time trial races, our main task is to choose the fittest and most suitable athletes to face a competition that can have mixed characteristics or even be entirely characterized by demanding heights. Challenges like these can require both mixed-skill athletes and pure climbers, but don't overlook the sprinters who can be as vital in time trials as they are in sprints. However, they must be protected according to the latter, organizing the team so that the most resistant shoot the others, carefully evaluating the water supplies and using the energy gel when necessary. All of this, managed in the best possible way, actually makes it possible to obtain good results even if the challenge, and here we finally come to an important novelty, has become more demanding. The first race we faced immediately gave us an example of the improvement of artificial intelligence which, combined with an overall overhaul of the athlete transfer system, is undoubtedly capable of improving the experience. The importance of artificial intelligence The revision of the promotion and transfer system increases the realism of the management dynamics, giving depth to the coaching career which already benefits, like the Pro Cyclist mode, from the evolution of artificial intelligence. This, as we have anticipated, is less inclined to launch into reckless escapes to which it prefers sensible strategies that make the challenge more balanced, preventing us, together with the limits introduced on the possibility of sprinting, from exploiting the stupidity of the opponents to obtain too easy victories. Such a change has a net weight on the quality of an experience that still isn't doing badly thanks to the improvements and additions of the previous chapters. Let's talk about dynamic climatic conditionshe, of the use of authentic names, of increasingly less sterile music, of multiplayer and of falls that add up to various equally important refinements such as the data of the athletes or of the competitions which is more legible. Furthermore, let's not forget the evolution of the interface, the implementation of various disciplines including Keirin or Omniun, the faster loading than the massive ones of the first chapters and the Pro Cyclist mode which in this new chapter improves in terms of ability to customize the athlete's capabilities. And it is by choosing this path that it is possible to partially recover that epic breath of cycling that has a bad connection with the figure of the coach. Playing the role of an athlete, following orders and increasing statistics enhances the experience with a sense of growth and identification, even in the role of a good follower who is an important pivot in a team and can become a protagonist by facing competitions and workouts. But Pro Cycling Manager 2018 is still a technologically modest management system. There is no trace, both in the mechanics and in the staging, of that legendary effort that has crowned the greats of two wheels and this slows down a process of identification already made complicated by the technical poverty of the models, by the glitches familiar to the faithful of the series that generate profusion of visual anomalies and portraits that make our young athlete look like a centenarian on his deathbed. In Pro Cycling Manager 2018, statistics, peak form, health, freshness and quality of training are decidedly more important, vertebrae of a title which, as we have seen, has everything necessary to be able to call itself a complete simulator, even if it lacks of novelties now necessary and dares nothing from the point of view of technology and content. The heroes and contradictions of cycling, pillars of European sporting history, remain completely cut off from a title which, running some risk, could be much more profound and intriguing, also involving those looking for something more.", "date": "2018-07-09", "grade": "6.8"}
