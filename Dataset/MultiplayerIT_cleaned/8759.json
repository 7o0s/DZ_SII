One evening, while playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends, he gets up from the table to go to the bathroom and the unimaginable happens: the light goes out and a few moments later the boy finds himself in a completely different place, dark and cold... like a castle dungeon! Convinced that it is a hallucination due to a bad taste joke by his friends, who may have put drugs in his beer, Daniel makes his way for a few meters using the lighter to cut through the darkness, but immediately runs into into a supernatural creature that seeks to possess his body. The attack fails, and so the spirit finds itself ~stuck~ in the boy's body: the absurd dialogues between him and Daniel are undoubtedly part of the charm of UnEpic, but the screenplay is only one of the strengths of this mammoth indie production. Mammoth because, despite its respectable size (two hundred rooms, seven different weapon categories, dozens of objects and quests to face), it was developed over the course of two years by a single programmer, who then made use of the collaboration of some people to create extra graphic elements and to translate texts into various languages, including Italian. Once the game was completed, he decided to distribute it himself through the official site, leaving the decision on how much to pay for it to the end users in a range that starts from 6.50 euros and reaches 19.50. Obviously you don't have to buy UnEpic sight unseen: first you download a playable demo and then you decide whether to unlock all its functions by purchasing a code. Weapons... The castle of Harnakon, which forms the backdrop to the whole story, is made up of an enormous number of rooms and ~zones~ to which Daniel must gain access from time to time through the use of special keys. All these locations converge in a sort of ~hub~ represented by a room full of doors, each of which allows us to quickly return to the place where we were carrying out a quest. Despite this possibility, back tracking reigns and is substantially part of the gameplay of UnEpic, as well as the platform and RPG elements. In short, we need to see the game for what it is: a passionate tribute to a way of making video games that, unfortunately or fortunately, no longer exists. So arm yourself with pen and paper, because after a few hours you will realize that, to avoid too many idle runs, it will be appropriate to draw a map of the scenario as was done in the days of The Sacred Armor of Antiriad on Commodore 64. Convinced that it is all hallucinating but determined to go through with it, Daniel will find himself interacting with quite a few characters, hostile or not. Among the first are trolls, worms, ogres, bats, giant ants and even big bosses, which the character must face using the various weapons that are around or that can be bought in ~shops~. There are seven different classes of weapons, each more or less effective depending on the situation: swords, ideal against bleeding enemies; the daggers, light and fast; maces, quite effective for breaking objects and eliminating skeletons or armored opponents; the axes, a cross between clubs and swords, albeit rather slow; spears, capable of hitting the target from a certain distance and thus protecting us from possible counterattacks; bows, effective against distant enemies; magic wands, capable of casting all kinds of spells. Each category must be leveled, in full RPG style, and it therefore happens that there are weapons that we cannot yet wield when we get hold of them. Beyond all this thickness, unfortunately it must be said that the dynamics that regulate the fights are simplistic and are fundamentally based on the ~first hit~, without the possibility of parrying attacks or performing dodges other than simply running away. ...and luggage Weapons are just one of many item categories in UnEpic. In fact, every time an enemy is eliminated, it is possible to collect different types of material (from innards to powdery substances, from bat wings to snake tongues, etc.) which are then destined for resale or for the creation of potions, including those for restoration of vital energy. This type of solution eliminates interpretations other than the accumulation of material before an expedition, also because in the absence of objects for recovery from injuries it becomes really too easy to incur game over. The latter is not applied by the game ruthlessly, i.e. there is no obligation torestart from the last save, but the situation we find ourselves in is equally uncomfortable because without potions it becomes really difficult to go on, and therefore we end up resorting to the ring that teleports us to the place where we can save and restore energy, to then redo the path that separates us from the active quest on foot. In short, the edges of the experience are not lacking. These are undoubtedly design choices that recall a ~hardcore~ approach from the past, which on the one hand is frustrating but on the other produces great satisfaction when we successfully complete a mission. Everything is loved or hated, depending on one's sensitivity and expectations, as always happens when faced with controversial productions. On the front of the technical realization there is not much to say: UnEpic runs at its maximum resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels, has a nice bitmap graphics, with fluid animations (apart from a few) and a good general atmosphere, above all thanks to the idea of the torches with which you have to interact in each room and which, once they are all lit, completely illuminate the area, revealing any chests to open, crates to destroy and enemies to face.", "date": "2012-02-14", "grade": "7.0"}
