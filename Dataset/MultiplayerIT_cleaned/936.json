{"name": "Gnosia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gnosia-recensione.html", "text": "A pinch of Danganronpa, a touch of Among Us and a generous dose of Raging Loop are the ingredients of Gnosia, RPG visual novel developed by Petit Depotto: the idea of implementing role-playing game mechanics within a linear experience in its development has undoubtedly sparked our interest but, after the first two hours, we realized that something was wrong and to get to the end we had to give up every ounce of patience. Because Gnosia does start from an intriguing base, which however it does not prove capable of developing: there are far too many similarities with the aforementioned games, to the point that the authors have failed in trying to give an identity to their project. Gnosia is a clear mix of already seen and poorly implemented ideas, which could have done so much more thanks to an undeniably fascinating aesthetic and an interesting story - if you didn't waste time wasting time to put it together. Let's see the strengths and weaknesses in our review of Gnosia. Space killers As you may have guessed, Gnosia is one of several interpretations of the assassin's game: it is set aboard a ship where the survivors, coming from the most disparate planets, have taken refuge believing they can escape the Gnosia - an unidentified alien race capable of infecting other life forms, forcing them to kill anyone on board. It is enough to have played Raging Loop to immediately grasp the similarities over the approximately two hours useful for completing the tutorial: first of all, all the characters experience a continuous time loop of which, however, only we protagonists and another are aware; secondly there are several roles that closely follow the game developed by Kemco, including doctor, guardian angel, engineer, guardian and affiliate of the Gnosia, with the only exception of the bug which is a bit crazy about the situation and has the goal is the wanton destruction of the universe. Each loop begins with a sort of process, during which by voting (and again we return to the mechanics of Raging Loop) it is decided from time to time who could be a Gnosia on the basis of absolute nothingness. Gnosia: Raqio supports his suspicions about Gina during the trial You got it right, throughout the entire game there is no type of investigation that allows us to understand who to direct our suspicions to. Especially during the first days of each single loop, and until you develop your character's traits in an acceptable way, you navigate by sight and with what little intuition we are allowed. It doesn't help that all the other members on the ship are devoid of any development - we can unlock various pieces of information about them with a lot of luck from loop to loop, however they don't come to our rescue in determining their psychology. They are more of the details that enrich the story. At some point we will be able to see their strengths and weaknesses, what they excel at and where they are most lacking, but again knowing this helps us very little because during the processes everyone will always repeat the same sentences in rotation: they do not elaborate the speeches beyond the ~guy seems suspicious to me~, ~I don't think we should jump to any conclusions~, ~ah, so you suspect me?~ and so on. Everyone has their own way of posing these concepts, which are still useless for the purposes of individual shifts in the various processes. Gnosia: The trial has concluded and one of the crew members is sentenced to Cold Sleep For our part, leveling up (every time a loop ends, for better or for worse, we get experience points with which to improve our statistics) and choosing how to evolve the protagonist we will be able to have vague possibilities of turning the game in our favor, or to catch a liar out, perhaps even to avert suspicion from us. The problem, yet another, of Gnosia that collides with the very logic of the game is the deficient artificial intelligence of the other characters: if the flatness of the dialogues during the trials weren't already enough, it is impossible to follow a minimum basic coherence when you interact because they pass from the accusation, to the defense and again to the accusation of the same character within three shifts, obviously without developing the concept. They limit themselves to just repeating pre-set phrases like machines, often making all our attempts to cling to any form of criterion in vain. Added to this is the fact that from turn to turn, therefore within the same loop, the characters do not take into account the actions previously performed. Gnosia: from our room it is possible to level up after accumulating enough experience points He takes youLet's take a practical example: in Gnosia it is not possible for more than one person to hold the role of engineer, so if two people propose themselves, one of them is clearly lying. It doesn't matter if it's a Gnosia, an affiliate or a bug, it still represents a threat that must be contained. Given these premises, it is equally obvious that if one of the two engineers is killed during the night, the one left alive is an impostor: despite everything, the following day the characters do not consider the hypothesis at all and resume accusing each other on a completely random basis or, at most, related to their vague personalities - such as personal preferences, or the fact that they don't use logic but only follow their instincts and so on. Even in the face of clear evidence, the potential culprit is often ignored and, by a twisted turn, we have happened to be eliminated without any evidence to support it. Of course, the RPG mechanics intervene in this sense by piloting any consensus and disagreement based on individual strengths and weaknesses, as well as any skills related to the development of precise statistics, but even so we were unable to establish any criteria. The mix of repetitive dialogue, narrative inconsistency in not considering previous events and the absence of character personality makes the loops after the tutorial a pain, while looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, it is not known exactly what the narrative carries on, whether the number of loops, discoveries made about individual characters or a mix of the two: sometimes, without any warning, a loop can start or end unexpectedly , going to enrich a story that would certainly have potential if it weren't so difficult to put the pieces together. On the fiftieth loop, patience begins to deteriorate, on the seventieth we collect crumbs and on the hundredth we almost scream at the screen. This is because the conditions useful for unlocking individual information are random. Examining the cards it is possible to see how, in some cases, the character in question must be human or Gnosia and therefore satisfy a requirement (it is not said, however, that you will be able to unlock something), while others are completely white and can happen at any time. Gnosia: the navigation map during leisure time At a certain point, we will be able to manipulate the individual loops, i.e. decide the number of participants, of Gnosia, which roles are available and which are not - a sort of evolution of the Among Us settings. Alternatively we can let the system decide for us, setting the loop so that it is possible to unblock an event. However, if you think that this is enough to carry you forward, we have to disappoint you: the fact that a loop is tacked in a certain way does not give you the certainty of finding what you are looking for and could even run from start to finish without anything happening. Or, the events marked in red on the map during the rest phase could simply lead you to form alliances or show scenes you have already seen. In short, it's all too much left to chance, dragged into a spiral of loops that cease to have appeal almost immediately but never fail to be irritating even to the last cent. From Danganronpa, Gnosia in fact takes the moment of free time after each process, during which we can go back to our room to level up and/or interact with any important event that has appeared on the map: if there weren't any, you can choose a random character and talk to him but everything is limited to a senseless and often repeated line of dialogue. There is so much, too much wasted potential in Gnosia, which follows previous models without developing its own identity and even failing to re-propose already seen mechanics: a too bad because the story behind the game has really excellent and unpredictable moments, accompanied by an artistic sector that alone could invite you to buy. But when you look beyond the aesthetics and promise of an engaging thriller, you discover all the holes in a repetitive and often illogical game, whose use of RPG mechanics only complicates it.", "date": "2021-05-20", "grade": "5.5"}
