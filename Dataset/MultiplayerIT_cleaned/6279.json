Not even the gates of hades can hold back his fiery determination; and so, having formed a new army (in this case of undead), the leader sets out to conquer the afterlife as well. To oppose his advance he will find the one who struck him treacherously, Kurokawa, as well as a whole series of commanders who have passed away, who have found in the infernal hierarchies something very similar to the earthly life they were used to. Available for some time on Xbox 360, mobile and PC, where it was updated to the Bone-A-Fide edition, Skulls of the Shogun finally makes its debut also on PlayStation 4, and does so by taking advantage of the June offers reserved for PlayStation subscribers Plus, that is, becoming part of the Instant Game Collection. What is different about the Bone-A-Fide Edition compared to the regular edition of the game? Simple: an extra scenario with its four levels, set after the conclusion of the single player campaign, with a new protagonist, even more demanding challenges and a new type of monk. But also some changes to the multiplayer sector, which allows you to challenge your friends locally or online, in customizable deathmatches or team deathmatches, characterized by an additional progression system through which you can gradually unlock nice extras. Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition is a solid, fun and challenging turn-based strategy game It's your turn The gameplay of Skulls of the Shogun takes up the classic mechanisms of turn-based strategy, putting a handful of units at our disposal but managing the various phases in a different way than usual. In fact, we will not be able to move and attack with all the members of our group, but we will have to respect a strict limit of five moves per turn, so it will often be necessary to carefully select the units that we consider most important and temporarily leave the others aside. These are not just tactical implications, which in the more advanced stages contribute to creating a rather high level of challenge, even more so when you are greatly outnumbered and the enemy immediately has access to resources that we will have to earn by fighting. The control system uses the left analog stick for unit selection and the right one to move the view on the map, as well as the shoulder straps to zoom in where needed and the main buttons for actions. It must be admitted, however, that the interface is often unclear, as the components of our army and their opponents are equipped with the same armor, only of a different color, so it is difficult to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys and you end up losing a little time. Likewise, the selection isn't always precise and in some cases we'll have to play a bit with the zoom or make several attempts for the system to finally understand that we want to use the soldier who is between two or three companions. For the rest, the mechanics are the same: you move, you get within shooting distance and you attack the enemy, trying to concentrate the shots to eliminate the target as quickly as possible and not give him the opportunity to counterattack. The perfect soldier In Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition there are only three types of ~base~ units, namely infantry, archers and cavalry, but to these are added four different types of monk: the Fox, who has healing abilities but cannot attack except in return; the Raven, who uses the wind to move enemies and knock them off cliffs; the Salamander, who can emit fireballs from a distance; and finally the Tanuki, the quick-change badger that is part of Japanese folklore and which in this case possesses the ability to exchange its position with that of an allied unit, materialize ice behind an enemy to make it slide or act as an active target to distract hostile troops. The abilities of each soldier, as well as those of each monk, are amplified when the character eats the skull of a slain enemy, and when this is repeated three times, he transforms into a ~demon~ who can make two moves during a turn, with all the consequences of the case and a substantially greater effectiveness in battle. After passing the first of the five scenarios present in the campaign (to which is added the additional one, visible immediately on the map but accessible only after completing the story), the game introduces a series of elements to be taken into great consideration, because they can make the difference between victory and defeat. At the beginning of each mission Akamoto will in fact stop to meditate, an operationwhich allows him to gain extra hit points each turn, until we decide to awaken him. We will also see various points of interest appear within the locations, specifically the rice fields to be conquered, to collect the currency necessary for the purchase of new units, and two types of sanctuaries: one is used to summon new warriors, the other to recall the different types of monk. Playstation 4 trophies The eighteen Trophies in Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition can be obtained by completing the single player campaign and performing specific actions, such as bringing Akamoto up to demon level, resurrecting an ally using an upgraded fox monk and win a multiplayer match by a certain margin. The bones of your deceased In short, there are many facets in the experience offered by Skulls of The Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition, a lot of substance in a campaign that appears simple only in the first few bars but which soon becomes very demanding, with the surprise of the extra scenario to add a couple of hours to total calculation of the single player sector. Then there is also the multiplayer which, thanks to the fact that it is free for PlayStation Plus subscribers, seemed to us to be well stocked with online users available for a challenge, in all-against-all or team mode, and fortunately with the possibility of adjusting the duration of the shifts to avoid too long waits. The playful system is accompanied by an entertaining, well-written narration, capable of eliciting more than one smile, as well as by cartoon-style cel-shaded graphics, which are also nice and functional to the action, with the only critical point being that they are hardly readable when units overlap, since all soldiers have the same armor. What makes one turn up one's nose is mostly the music: to listen to a different song you will have to wait to reach the fifth scenario, and this will inevitably lead to always hearing the same piece, which after a few hours you will end up hating.", "date": "2015-06-08", "grade": "8.0"}
