The plot continues and concludes that of the previous two episodes. Not that the narrative is very important in such a title, but at least it makes sense of the action. For the rest, wanting to give a definitive judgment, it would be possible to copy/paste the articles of the other two episodes and add that the levels have a better design and the difficulty has been slightly recalibrated upwards, in order to eliminate that feeling of challenge nothing that characterized the games played on the first two difficulty levels - still try it on the maximum level to get the most out of it. At this point you will have already asked yourself a question: but if the game improves some elements of its predecessors, why define it as the least interesting? The reason is simple enough to explain: having chosen to create a series with what appears to be a single video game divided into three, produces a little tiredness in the use, especially if the first two thirds have not made you crazy. Basically, Alien Breed 3: Descent is identical to what we have already seen: it offers the same progression in upgrades, the same rhythm in the appearance of enemies and the same overall duration. The weapons are the five that we know well and also the members of the Race, which is not a fish but only the very original name of the aliens, have not received any restyling. The same levels, all very similar to each other in visual style and, consequently, similar to those of Impact and Assault, only reinforce the feeling of deja vu that afflicts every moment of the game. Do we cooperate? Another big problem of Alien Breed 3: Descent, at least in its PC version, a problem that does not depend on the developers, is called Alien Swarm, the recently released free title from Valve, which shares the same style of play with Descent, but is much more refined on a tactical level and, above all, it is very popular with players. Its existence, like it or not, makes the cooperative mode of the Alien Breed lose a lot of appeal, including the third chapter, of which it is a mirror image. Indeed, finding someone to play with online is no small feat, much more than finishing the single player campaign. A similar problem exists even if you play on consoles, but in this case because the competition is great and there are plenty of shooters that use both sticks. Technically, we are on the same level as the predecessors (and it could not be otherwise). The three-dimensional models are still the same, the textures are of the same level, the overall atmosphere is unchanged, and so on. We always live in anticipation of the imminent catastrophe, with the progressive increase in the intensity and cadence of the explosions and the occurrence of a greater number of scripted events. In general, we feel that it is more spectacular than the other Alien Breeds, but in some situations it is also more confusing. Brief history of Alien Breed The Alien Breed series was born in the nineties on the Amiga and immediately achieved great success due to the technical virtues and the non-linear gameplay inspired by Gauntlet. The first chapter is Alien Breed from 1991, of which there is also a Special Edition from 92 and a re-edition for CD32 from 1994. It is a bird's eye shooter with a very tense atmosphere, in which one is always in trouble due to the lack of keys and ammunition. Alien Breed II: The Horror Continues (1993) continues along the lines of the first installment, but is less difficult overall, while retaining the same charm. Alien Breed: Tower Assault is the third episode and, despite being well done, it adds nothing to the previous chapters except greater freedom in level design. Alien Breed 3D (1995) was born to follow the 3D fashion dictated by Doom. At the time it was well received, but today it is the weakest title in the series, no longer shining for purely technical virtues. Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds (1996) is the natural sequel to Alien Breed 3D and is the last official game of the saga before the recent trilogy. Curiosity: in 2007 a free remake of the original game was released, Alien Breed Obliteration, which can be downloaded at this address: LINK", "date": "2010-12-14", "grade": "7.0"}
