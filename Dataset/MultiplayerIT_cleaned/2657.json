{"name": "Kessen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kessen.html", "text": "Strategy and English... First of all it must be said that the game is completely translated into English, so you need to know this language well to be able to play. In fact, there are many rules to follow and only by understanding, and obviously by following the exhaustive initial tutorial well without skipping all the steps (perhaps out of enthusiasm for playing), you manage to ~make something up~. Being a real-time strategist, the timing of movements and decisions will be essential because obviously the game clock will always be running, and while you give orders to an army, for example your opponent will attack another, perhaps taking you by surprise. unprovided and producing numerous and serious human losses. Basically you will be allowed to control different armies and as the game progresses the number of these will increase more and more, making everything more difficult. The mechanics of the game are relatively simple, in fact on the right of the battle screen different faces are depicted in small squares and each of them corresponds to a general with a respective army. At this point, just press the X button to access RPG-like commands for each one, or rather windows that are very reminiscent of role-playing game dialogues, in which the various options that the player has are displayed. Among these, in addition to the classic movements, attacks and/or retreats, there is a command that allows in certain situations to carry out ~special manouvres~, i.e. special moves (eight in all) that each army can carry out without the enemy being able to defend itself . This is perhaps the most exciting moment of the game, in fact we witness a pre-calculated scene with your soldiers who, for example, in the ~barrage~ technique line up and, after the commander's fire, fire their rifles producing a vibration on your Dualshock. The first few times it's nice to watch these scenes but over time this can get boring, but of course you can skip it all with the push of a button. Moving on to the raw criticism of the game and initially analyzing the graphic aspect, we are faced with a good title that, taking full advantage of the physical capacity of the DVD, gives us tons of graphics and FMV at discrete levels. Being most of the game pre-calculated perhaps one would have expected a little more but overall the animations are nice and pleasant to look at. The light effects produced by the soldiers' rifles are very beautiful and also the zooms that are possible on the various fighting armies, with well over three hundred ~little men~ who fight without the slightest slowdown. The sound aspect is perhaps the weakest one, with repetitive and boring tunes that will accompany you in every moment of the game. Strategy and alliances... I forgot to say that in addition to real-time battles (which are the hard core of the game), there is also a section in which you have to manage war tactics, including alliances and the duplicity of some families, who may be under control of your enemy, but in the end they side with you. So what can we say about this KESSEN, a good game but not suitable for everyone and above all aimed at an adult and patient audience because it takes a lot of time to spend in front of the TV before being able to finish a battle and be able to save. The advice is to try it first, if possible, especially if you are people who love hit and run games and games that are quick and undemanding, otherwise a good title worthy of note for all fans of the genre. Strategy and Japan Set in the period of feudal Japan, or between 1600 and 1700 approximately, Kessen stands as the first real-time strategy game for the Ps2. Koei has now accustomed us to this type of game and in fact those who follow the parallel market will certainly know the appreciation that in the motherland (in Japan in fact) this software house collects with the endless sagas set right in the distant Japanese past. In a nutshell you will be asked to choose to play one of the two main characters, i.e. IEYASU TOKUGWA or HIDEYOSHI TOYOTOMI, the supreme commanders respectively of the Eastern and Western forces, obviously in constant struggle for the supremacy of one of the two families from they head over the whole land of the rising sun. The fact that EA has decided to distribute this game is commendable since it is very rare that products of this type arrive translated on the shelves of our trusted retailers. However, it must be said that Koei has invested a lot of money in the creation of Kessen, moreover with remarkable results (in fact, the second chapter is already in the pipelineof the series) given that numerous copies were sold at the oriental launch of the new Sony console.", "date": "2001-01-03", "grade": null}
