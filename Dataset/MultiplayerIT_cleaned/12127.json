The choices made in the past have not been up to the situation, having given birth to mediocre games on average; with the exception of the adaptation of the Goblet of Fire, a rather banal hack'n'slash, the other three episodes were built following the archetypes of the Zeldian matrix action-rpg. Every video game released so far, regardless of the genre, has not been able to recreate any basic feature of Harry Potter, extremely simplifying the universe and making it truly attractive only to the eyes of children, an audience captured more by the visual imagery of the films than from the contents of the books. The Order of the Phoenix marks a new starting point for EA, it was born with the intention of giving dignity to the playful version of Harry Potter: the project, unlike the previous ones, was carried out with clarity and mental lucidity. The title is no longer a cauldron of different ideas, but a sort of role-playing game that allows you to explore Hogwarts freely: not an adventure set in a wizarding school, but a wizarding school hosting an adventure, a game in which the scenario is granted absolute priority. The result is surprising: Hogwarts is meticulously cared for, everything you see in the film can be explored in real time in the video game without loading times, there are even rooms and details not present in the feature films but taken directly from the books. Wandering through the school is a pleasure, and no one will be disappointed by its representation, let alone fans of the series. The Order of the Phoenix The setting is therefore the focal point of the game, the element that undoubtedly makes it the best adaptation of the series: EA's work has been commendable, but it is not fully valued by the Order of the Phoenix. The new Hogwarts tends to be anachronistic, and would certainly have been more useful and appreciated if it had hosted a real role-playing game or even an mmorpg; however EA had the task of creating an adaptation of the Order of the Phoenix, not a Harry Potter game, and so had to confine its creation within the limits imposed by the story. The enchanted aura that envelops the castle is dispersed when you meet the characters, main and otherwise, because characterized superficially: the thickness of the inhabitants of Hogwarts has not been reproduced even this time, and this greatly hinders the identification. For its part, the plot moves the events, but more than the engine of the adventure, it seems like an intruder who shows up between one mission and another. Game design is greatly affected by these internal contradictions: if on the one hand it is fun to inspect the school, on the other it is boring to do it by carrying out the obvious quests, inserted to contain the evolution of the game on the tracks traced by the novel. The best part, or the free exploration, is thus relegated to a secondary level, surpassed by a disappointing and bridling main quest. Magic wand The attitude of third parties on Wii so far has been to convert multiplatform titles from other consoles, generally unable to exploit the full potential of the machine: for Harry Potter the procedure was the opposite. EA has always indicated the Wii version as the most suitable for hosting the gaming experience, probably imagining the attraction that the parallelism between the Wiimote and the magic wand would have generated on fans: the spells have thus been rethought, and each of them is a certain movement has been linked. The control system works very well, and the involvement is immediate: the commands tend to be intuitive and precise, so much so that it is fun to move objects here and there even without a specific purpose. The physics engine is realistic and satisfying, even in the management of objects in flight, certainly one of the best seen so far on the Wii. Spells performed standing still work much better than those required to fight: the clashes are often chaotic and confused, difficult to manage, not so much for the complexity of the movements as for the general setting of the same. Moving Harry is also a rather uncomfortable action, given that the analog stick is not fully exploited: the degree of inclination is substantially irrelevant, since the transition from walking to running is associated with pressing a button. In addition to the game design, the control system is also characterized by the simultaneous presence of light and shadow. The graphics Visually Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is undoubtedly among the best pproductions that appeared on Wii: in addition to boasting a fair polygonal complexity and excellent light effects, Hogwarts can be explored without any loading pauses between one section and another. Placing quality and usability on the same level is a wise choice, which makes the frequent moments in which the game allows itself to drop in framerate bearable, but not invisible. The 16: 9 mode is fully supported, and the only major flaw in the graphic design lies in the wooden movements of the characters, further aggravated by the unrealistic facial animations. The sound accompaniment is of a high level, with appropriate and evocative music. Finally, we advise you to play with the English dubbing, which is more serious and accurate than the Italian one. The Order of the Phoenix is certainly the best Harry Potter video game released so far: Hogwarts has been meticulously recreated, and it is a pleasure to explore it in its magical corridors without running into uploads. The spells managed via Wiimote, in addition to being precise, make the experience immersive as never before; the physics are among the most satisfying appreciated on the Wii, as are the graphics and sound. Unfortunately there are flaws: the game design is rather trivial, the characterization of the characters is superficial and the plot seems forced into the game. Despite the flaws, we warmly recommend the title to the adepts of the saga, thanks to the remote control / magic wand and the setting, which we hope will be reused in the future. Pros Hogwarts is Hogwarts The Wiimote/wand is exciting No loading in exploration Great physics, graphics and sound Cons Disappointing Game Design Monotonous Main Quest Shoddy animations Wanting to summarize everything, there are four elements that make the Harry Potter books valuable: the identification with the protagonist skilfully orchestrated by the author, the magical world connected with the real one, the characterization of the characters and above all the narration, with the interweaving that develops in a similar way to that of a ~yellow~. Dealing with the subject quickly, since this is not the focus of the article, one could say in a superficial way that any story that can be labeled as a detective novel is inextricably linked to the original means of communication: pauses, accelerations, details, clues, revelations, in general all the fundamental elements to give life to a story of this type are chosen by those who create it having already in mind the medium that will host the narration. Transferring a story from one container to another without it being soiled is a very difficult task, and it is even more so if it has to be done with a detective story: if the viewer then has the possibility of coming into contact with the substance itself and to alter its development, and this is the case with video games, then the mission becomes decidedly prohibitive.", "date": "2007-07-10", "grade": null}
