The leap into the world of video games was made in 2001 with the mediocre LightWeight Ninja and, in the same year, with the much better The Corporate Machine, a competitive and ironic managerial game that captured a large group of fans, becoming a cult game of those years . Fame, however, came in 2003 with Galactic Civilizations, a sort of modern Master of Orion, in which a decidedly advanced and realistic AI stood out, as opposed to the lack of multiplayer mode. The company was now very fast and nothing could stop it, or at least nothing could prevent the publication of Galactic Civilization II, an inevitable and highly appreciated sequel. So far the games have all been developed internally but, when Ironclad came knocking on Stardock's door, a perfect union was born that moved the company towards the role of producer, leaving the development of Sins of to the external team. at SolarEmpire. It goes without saying that, at this point, Stardock has taken a liking to it, given that he is currently at work, together with the famous Chris Taylor's Gas Powered Games, on the impressive Demigod project, soon to be released. History is a blank book In the game we imagine a galaxy populated by three races, each with its own history and differences, and perpetually in conflict with each other. While on the one hand their characterization does not shine for originality, since it re-proposes the usual clichs of the genre (there are humans, xenomorphs and psykers), on the other it generates a pleasant background capable of enthralling the player in his long games. In this regard, the first sore point immediately emerges: Sins of a Solar Empire does not have a single-player campaign. After the pleasant opening film, which narrates the events that brought the various factions to war, we are faced with the only choice between random scenarios and maps. Let it be clear, however, that the range of choices is very vast, with a very respectable subdivision between small, medium and large maps and scenarios (32 in total, excluding random maps, which can even be huge). To this must then be added the small tool with which to create your own personalized scenarios and, for the most demanding maps, Stardock also provides an editor that can be freely downloaded from the site. each single map can guarantee long and exciting matches in the same way as a series of small predefined missions would If on the one hand, then, the lack of the single player campaign is felt, on the other there is the possibility of playing a virtually infinite amount of games, each one different from the others. This feature goes well with the open style of the game and each single map can guarantee long and challenging matches in the same way as a series of small predefined missions would, if not more. Those who don't want to waste time with the game's AI can instead decide to use the Ironclad online service to challenge other players, taking advantage of the possibility of saving and resuming the game even at a later time. The universe in your pocket The game map is made up of a grid of stars and planets, joined by lanes through which it is possible to move from one to the other and vice versa. The play area is centered around the planets gravity well, where the asteroids are located, the structures, and where the fights take place. Each planet has a maximum number of slots for logistic construction and one for military construction, once these limits are reached it is necessary to expand on a new planet in order to build new structures, especially research laboratories. This system forces the player to expand rapidly to new planets if he wants his empire to progress. The definitely most impressive feature of the game is the applicable zoom level. Any ship or structure can be brought into close-up and then zoomed out until the whole galaxy is in the center of the screen. This fact allows you to manage the game in an extremely fluid way, since to switch from the local context of a fight around a planet to the global one of border control, just to give an example, just use the mouse wheel. To lighten the load on the computer, from a certain distance onwards the 3D units are replaced by icons, small but always clear. Create an empire The game develops on two tracks, that of civil development (therefore economic) and that of military development. Such duality resultsevident at all times, so much so that there are two distinct technological trees, one for civilian research and one for military. The ultimate goal of the game is to conquer all the planets on the map, wiping out any remaining resistance. There is therefore no room for non-military victories. To achieve this goal, then, it is necessary to develop an impressive fleet, but ships cost money, you know, crews need to eat and the energy to make everything work has its price, therefore it is necessary to collect money and resources from somewhere part. the whole game goes in the military direction: resources, technologies - even civilian ones - are all used to build increasingly large, numerous and powerful ships Create an empire The two standard types of resources are metals and crystals, which can be found on asteroids orbiting planets. As you can see, the whole game goes in the military direction: resources, technologies - even civilian ones - are all used to build ever bigger, more numerous and more powerful ships. Having to collect ever greater quantities of materials, forget the task of sending the mining units to do all the work, in fact it will be enough to build an extractor on an asteroid and this will automatically and relentlessly collect everything we need. In this sense, the economy has been significantly simplified, stripping it of all those repetitive routines that would have broken the fluidity of the game; therefore no more manual collection of resources, no more obsessive search for new mines to replace the old exhausted ones and space for a very comfortable black market where it is possible to buy and sell materials by exchanging them. All that's left for us to do is spend what we earn on structures, technologies and, most importantly, ever bigger and nastier ships to replenish the fleet with which we will conquer the stars. Power games As you progress through the game, the amount of planets under your control gets bigger and bigger, not to mention the size of the fleet and orbital structures. The only way to control such an empire, given its vast size, is through the Empire Tree, the brilliant invention of the guys from Ironclad Games. It is a very comfortable tree side panel, through which the commands are given through a click, choosing the target directly from the list. In this way, even the most distant events can be quickly monitored. A simple and effective solution: hat to the authors. The fleet consists of three categories of ships: frigates, cruisers and capital ships. At the beginning of the game we will only be able to build a couple of the first ones, just to explore, defend ourselves in some condominium dispute, and set up the first colonies. Later, more and more ships will be available, according to the now consolidated (and abused) stone-paper-scissors combat scheme, up to the cruisers. For capital ships, on the other hand, a separate discussion is needed. Unlike normal ships, they fill the role that in other titles was assigned to the so-called Heroes. These are special units, with a power far superior to any other existing class and equipped with unique abilities. Through a simple experience point system, capital ships can increase their power level and gain new abilities. Naturally, the number of ships of this type that a player can build is very limited, compared to the size of the entire fleet, but it can grow as the game progresses. Although the cost of each of them is very high, the game provides the first in a union manner, at no price. Pirates and ambassadors An interesting novelty is the presence of pirates, a privileged faction that manages the black market and carries out regular attacks against players, based on a bounty system that closely resembles the auctions that are usually held online. Basically, after a certain amount of time, the attack against one faction is triggered but it is possible, by betting higher offers, to increase the bounty on another faction. When the time runs out, the head with the highest size will be doomed to fall, or at least wear a large bandage. Withstanding the attacks of the pirates is not easy, as they have an arsenal and a fleet far above those available to the player towards the middle of the game. In the final stages of the game, however, it will be possible to get rid of this nuisance definitively. From the options it is fortunately possible, for those who don't want them, to disable the raids of these people. If desired, it is always possible to ally with other factions, partly to derive some economic advantage, partly to have greater visibility of the map and partly toor because having an ally around when you're under attack never hurts. Diplomacy according to Ironclad Games is not too subtle: do you want to win my trust? Give me 2000 credits or bring me the cast bolts of 10 of that player's ships there! Comment Sins of a Solar Empire proved to be a very pleasant surprise, as it combines the epic grandeur of conquest on a galactic scale with the immediacy of real-time combat. The best thing is that it sacrifices almost nothing, since the Empire Tree allows you to play cyclopean games fluidly with hundreds and hundreds of units on the screen, without ever making the player feel crushed by the excessive magnitude of the events. Starting a game of Sins means placing an unknown factor on the next few hours, if not on an entire night, as it is captivating and one would never want to leave. A bit of a turn-based syndrome but no turns. Of course, the lack of a complete single player campaign is felt, especially for more traditional players, but it doesn't take much to learn to appreciate the many skirmishes and random maps available, which ultimately constitute the real core of the game. Special mention must be made for the excellent soundtrack which is never tacky or intrusive while maintaining a clear cinematic imprint. Finally, the Italian localization is noteworthy which, even if it arrived late, is complete in every part, from the fine packaging to the subtitles.Pros Impossible to stop Excellent interface Lightweight even on older machines Cons No single player campaign Not there are alternatives to military victory Learning curve too high thanks to a minimal tutorial PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 1.8 GHz Single-Core CPU RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 128 MB 3D Video Card (Radeon 9600 / GeForce FX 6600 and up) Operating System: Windows XP SP2 / Windows Vista Hard Disk: 3 GB DirectX 9.0c Recommended Requirements Processor: 2.2 Ghz, Dual or Quad-Core CPU RAM: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista) Video Card: 256 MB 3D Video Card (Radeon X1600 / GeForce 7600 and up) Test Configuration Processor: AMD64 3200+ RAM : 2 GB Video Card: Radeon 9800 Pro 256 MB Operating System: Windows XP SP2", "date": "2008-10-17", "grade": null}
