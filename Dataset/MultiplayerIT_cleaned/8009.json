The sweet winged creatures of the woods, regretting the times when at most they had to put up with the moans of some ambushed couple, try every time to explain to the psychiatric cases mentioned above that there can be only one Dragonborn. In fact, apart from some individuals with chronic halitosis, the others achieve very little with the power of their voice, to the point that one might advise them to buy a smartphone with a voice interface to get some extra satisfaction. However, Bethesda has heard the desperate cry of these poor souls and with the Dragonborn expansion wanted to give them hope! Now there can be more than one Dragonborn alive at the same time. Of course, they are destined to slaughter each other, but these are details. And then when you've been brandishing a sword every day for a year, you haven't washed your armpits in legendary time and you feed only on pigeon droppings, you have to be willing to make some sacrifices to deserve Valhalla. Different from the others Already released for weeks on Xbox 360, the new expansion for the fifth chapter of the moldy parchment saga has also arrived on PC. We are talking about expansion and not about DLC, even if we could consider them synonyms, because the supplementary contents are so full-bodied that we want to try to clearly mark the difference compared to the other micro-expansions, even those for Skyrim itself. In short, we are not faced with the limitation of a content, albeit interesting and valid, such as Dawnguard, or the uselessness of someone like Hearthfire, little more than a trinket with which to pass the time with a yawn. Dragonborn is big and continues the tradition of Tribunal, thinking of Morrowind, or of Shivering Isles, in Oblivion. In short, many have turned up their noses when reading the price, but in reality it is in line with the amount of new content offered, much more substantial than a dress sold for three euros or a gun for four. Let's now find out if the PC edition is worth the money it costs ( 19.99) and if it is capable of confirming the supremacy of this version over the others. If you want to get more details about the story and content, read the review of the Xbox 360 version. Let's start by saying that the graphics quality is still unmatched. The new settings and the new models are enriched by high resolution textures (see box) which make a clear difference with respect to the 360 version. Obviously the advanced graphic settings are similar to those already modifiable in the base title, but the presence of very different settings makes Dragonborn a fascinating experience from a technical point of view. Attention! If you have MODs installed, be careful when installing Dragonborn, as some may be incompatible. If you experience instabilities, disable all add-ons, especially older ones. From the point of view of fluidity, however, little changes compared to the base game, so if Skyrim runs without problems even Dragonborn will not give you any. Just pay attention to the Texture Pack: if it's the first time you install it, pay attention to the growth of the recommended requirements. Unfortunately nothing has been done for the menus and to make them more comfortable using the mouse and keyboard. We know that it's not a simple matter to completely change the interface of a video game, but we also know that Skyrim on PC has sold several million copies and that there are many excellent MODs that greatly improve the usability of the various menus, so a specific effort could do without sacrificing too many resources on the way; it was enough to integrate the already existing material. Another small problem is the approach to the expansion, which in this case is not a specific problem of the PC version: playing with a high-level character, the challenge offered is not very great and many of the extras are quite useless. The story changes by replaying the adventure from the beginning and taking full advantage of the bonuses offered. This is not a decisive defect and, indeed, the problems described may appear rather obvious, but our advice is, after installing Dragonborn, to replay all of Skyrim. Also updated HD textures with Dragonborn Along with Dragonborn, PC users have received another nice surprise: the HD texture pack made by Bethesda, which has been available for some time, has been updated for all DLCs. So now HD textures are available for the base game, Dawnguard and Hearthfire, as well as Dragonborn. Obviously the requirements to install the texture pack without fear are slightly higher than those of the base game: 4GB ofRAM, a DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card with 1GB of memory and 4.7GB of extra hard disk space.", "date": "2013-02-12", "grade": null}
