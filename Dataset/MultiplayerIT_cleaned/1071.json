{"name": "Pathway to Glory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pathway-to-glory.html", "text": "Between enemy lines We were talking about the game mechanics, which is identified in the Western-style turn-based strategy genre; for those who have a few years on the back, good memory and excellent taste in video games, just think of the splendid Jagged Alliance, a Sirtech game for PCs from 10 years ago. In a nutshell, it is about guiding a handful of soldiers through various missions with objectives to be completed, preferably without losing any men in firefights with the enemy. The management of individuals is subject to a certain number of action points, to be spent in the most intelligent way possible. Running is the least expensive solution in terms of points, but it also puts dangerously open arms of the other faction in the war; crawling on the ground is less dangerous, but the amount of action points in this case is much greater. Obviously, even using the weapons in one's possession requires an outlay in this sense, with the possibility of considering the variable relating to shooting accuracy. Arranging your soldiers within the terrain, making them move with caution, using the terrain and structures for shelter are the fundamental aspects to take into consideration in Pathway to Glory, with a slow and reasoned pace of play but not for this less engaging . Variety is undoubtedly one of the most interesting elements of Nokia's production, both in the diversification of objectives (destroy a building, support allies, make your way through enemy lines) and in the tools available to the player. To a large number of ~conventional~ weapons such as pistols, rifles and hand grenades are added bazookas, fragmentation bombs, even aerial bombardments and so on... Added to this is the good interactivity offered with the elements present in the settings; it is thus possible to occupy the enemy turrets and use the powerful machine guns, but it is above all the use of the means that offers further strategic depth to the game. Trucks, jeeps and tanks have in fact different characteristics of mobility, as well as a different offensive and defensive potential; knowing how to exploit them in the best way can often prove to be the key to getting the better of the enemy. The control system uses practically all the console keys: after an initial loss, this solution allows you to have full control of the situation, and to quickly perform any type of action available. Each mission is preceded by a brief introduction which clarifies not only the focal points to be completed, but also places everything in a real and faithful historical context. In fact, the action takes place starting from 1943, starting from the American invasion of Sicily up to the entry into France, with an exciting crescendo capable of literally gluing the player to the N-Gage screen. War does not look at anyone Pathway to Glory is an all-round well-finished title, practically devoid of obvious smudges. The artificial intelligence of the CPU-controlled soldiers is credible and valid, often putting even the most experienced player in difficulty. Of course, it will be difficult to see the opposing platoons cooperating together or surprising for their tactical ability, but individually the men of the opposing faction almost never lend themselves to irrational or stupid behavior. Which is certainly a good thing, especially from the point of view of a game of this type. The game also encourages you to pay particular attention to safeguarding the integrity of your men through a growth system which, mission after mission, improves their characteristics and shooting accuracy. But the ability of the programmers also comes out from the level design point of view, always perfectly balanced and capable of offering even very large but never excessively dispersive settings; the tension is always constant, with the continuous sense of danger and the fear of seeing one's own man fall under the blows of a well-hidden soldier. The sound is very valid, complete with evocative and perfectly themed orchestrated musical themes and even capable of offering the voices of the enemies actually in their language. So here are the French, Germans, Americans and Italians using phrases in their own language; although sometimes not exactly well recited, these expressions help to provide a credible experience and above all they give a further sign of the attention placed in every aspect of the game. Last but not least, the graphics should be mentioned, which through a bird's eye view propose rendered landscapes rich in detail and drawn with a particularly realistic stroke. The majesty of certain ruined buildings, as well as the desolation of some victim glimpsessome bombings gratify the eye and immerse you in a truly high-level experience. The animations are slightly less successful, a bit woody and with a not exceptional variety. The very complete multiplayer mode present takes care of raising the overall longevity; via bluetooth it is in fact possible to challenge other human opponents within the range of the console, managing one's forces from turn to turn and waiting for the response of the other user. Added to this is the possibility of taking on online challenges in real time via the N-Gage Arena: a very interesting feature on paper, but partially undermined by the instability of the GPRS connection, its cost and the low number of users present. Comment Pathway to Glory is exactly what N-Gage was missing. The Nokia production is in fact a game that really exploits the potential of the console, and it does it in the best possible way by offering a deep, satisfying, engaging title, but above all really cared for in every aspect. It is a pity that Nokia managed to find the right way to exploit its handheld only after a long (too much?) time, but its willingness to continue learning from a completely new environment is certainly admirable, proposing titles of increasing quality and capable of gratify those who wanted to trust the N-Gage adventure. Pros Very good game mechanics Technically excellent Perfectly adapted to the characteristics of N-Gage Cons A bit too difficult at times Not suitable for casual players Online multiplayer mode not fully usable Although it has certainly been overshadowed by the recent debut of Nintendo DS and Sony PSP, this end of 2004 for N-Gage was not at all stingy with good-level titles such as Asphalt Urban GT, Pocket Kingdom and Colin Mc Rae Rally. But certainly the flagship game for the Nokia console of the whole year, and beyond, is identifiable in Pathway to Glory, a production on which the Finnish company has always bet a lot. And the reasons have always been very clear: the game in question has in fact from the beginning aroused the interest both for a respectable graphic aspect, and for a game mechanics and a setting - the Second World War - to say the least stimulants. In summary, Pathway to Glory was born and raised to perfectly exploit the characteristics of N-Gage, which certainly could not be said for far too many other productions aimed at the Nokia handheld.", "date": "2004-12-29", "grade": null}
