{"name": "The Sims 2: Nightlife - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-nightlife-recensione.html", "text": "Saturday night fever every night! University had had the advantage of greatly expanding the possibilities offered by The Sims, offering the player the opportunity to expand a phase of the life of the Sims, the adolescent stage, and to fully play this crucial phase of a Sim's life. By enriching the game with new social interactions between Sims and a new range of places outside the home to be able to visit, this first expansion had made even more sensational a title that already had many points in its favor. Throwing an eye to the past, and that is to some of those expansions that made the first title, The Sims, the most ~expanded~ game in history, Nightlife draws from the creative imagination already explored to bring out those aspects not sufficiently explored with the title original. Although University already focused a lot of attention on moments of aggregation and on the possibility of creating fun and unforgettable parties, Maxis considered it appropriate to further enhance this aspect, also doing justice to the recreational needs of adult Sims (and not just those of university age). Nightlife intends to explore together with the players that handful of hours in which every single citizen transforms into a machine thirsty for entertainment every night. This expansion is able to give the game a significant boost in terms of the sentimental sphere, introducing a special mode for managing romantic encounters. Only aspiration: have fun! Once the expansion has been installed and the game has started, it is possible to access the new features in the blink of an eye. The cities that already exist, saved on your PC, undergo a small revolution and gain a new area dedicated to recreational activities. When a Sim decides to go out and have fun, taking advantage of the appropriate means of transport, they can go to the crowded city center and find the place that suits them best. As was the case for University, Nightlife also introduces a new life aspiration that can be selected by the editor for creating characters; the aspiration to ~pleasure~ fits perfectly with this title and aims at the search for everything that is beautiful, comfortable and fun, carefully avoiding the excessive efforts deriving from an overly oppressive job and the stress associated with a flat life. The goal to achieve if you decide to give your Sims this aspiration is to guarantee a constant amount of fun for your alter ego, and, we can assure you, Nightlife does not skimp on means to achieve this kind of aspirations. Another novelty regarding the creation of the psychological profile of the Sims is that relating to the tastes for choosing one's partner, which will have a greater influence on the character aspect of the Sim. Vampires, fortune tellers and the like Entering the game, you immediately notice the differences introduced with this expansion. We found it very useful to use the practical tutorial that follows the player in a non-invasive way, showing suggestions from time to time as new situations arise. The first evident novelty is perhaps represented by the classic renewed wardrobe and by a completely new inventory of objects. There are among many things very extravagant objects such as a DJ booth, a poker table, a karaoke machine, a photo booth, or absolutely disconcerting such as the ElectroDance Sphere and the coffin. In fact, a fortune teller capable of altering the sentimental sphere of the Sims wanders among the houses of the neighborhoods Vampires, fortune tellers and the like You read that right, among the objects that can be purchased and placed in the house there is a comfortable coffin, because among the various characters that it is possible to meet on the streets of the city at night there are vampires; nothing horrifying though: vampires are distinguished from other Sims only by their extravagant clothing (the typical Count Dracula outfit a la Boris Karlov), their diaphanous skin and the absolute impossibility of living a quiet life during the day, on pain of almost inevitable death by desiccation. You will therefore have understood the reason why in a Sim house it is advisable to have a coffin available if there is a vampire among the circle of one's friends. However, always pay attention to the close bond with a vampire, or you could be transformed in turn into creatures of the night. Vampires are not the only bizarre present in this title. In fact, a fortune teller capable of altering the sentimental sphere of the Sims wanders among the houses of the neighborhoods, she can, against payment, combine magical encounters with more or less congenial partners (depending on how much you are willing to pay).That I don't know what It's time to take a closer look at the complex relationship management apparatus presented by this expansion. If from the point of view of the professions and the novelties that can be tasted at a glance, the first expansion had been truly surprising, the same can be said of Nightlife with regard to the profound revolutions in relational matters. The first novelty to underline is the possibility of forming the so-called ~informal groups~, that is aggregations of Sims united by the common intention of going out and having fun. To form a group, simply invite a Sim to join, using the action menu. At this point, the Sims who have joined the group will receive a crystal on their head, just like the one that appears on the head of the Sims controlled by the player, only smaller and of a different color. It represents the mood of the individual members of the group, actually constituting a sort of general mood indicator. At this point we are called to move the situation by creating fun and engaging situations, capable, in short, of keeping the group together. Nightlife introduces the fundamental ~alchemy~ parameter that manages the relationship based on that ~something~ that in everyday life makes us prefer some people to others ~skinlessly~. Alchemy plays a fundamental role to say the least in the management of a group, and one must always try to adequately manage this kind of dynamics, carefully avoiding making the characters interact that between them should highlight the exact opposite of alchemy , feeling capable of triggering quarrels for the slightest trifle. Scrutinizing the soul of a Sim in this sense is simple, in fact, it is enough to follow the indications represented in the comics to be able to understand which Sims get along. Nightlife introduces the fundamental ~alchemy~ parameter that manages the relationship based on that ~something~ that in everyday life makes us prefer some people to others ~skinlessly~. That I don't know what It is possible to increase the attractiveness of the Sims by resorting to the remedies offered by the fortune teller who, for figures that are not always accessible, can give the possibility of increasing this characteristic, through the use of a particular love potion. The interaction system between the characters has been significantly enhanced, allowing the player to be able to choose from a large number of options. It is possible to further investigate the interests of the Sims, by asking targeted questions such as ~What are your interests?~ or ~Do you like me?~, in this way the possibilities of interaction increase, sometimes reaching unthinkable levels; the developers ensure that among the surprising results derived from a strong gab you can get to the point of being offered dinner by a restaurant waiter! The strength of the pack Once you have formed a group, or catalyzed your attention on a probable partner, the time comes to explore the surrounding world. One of the handicaps that has always compromised the Sims' freedom of movement is the absence of autonomous means of locomotion that would allow the characters to wander around the city. Nightlife also thinks about this, proposing a small but fundamental revolution in gameplay. The Sims will no longer be forced to resort to a taxi for their travels, nor will they have to accept the company car to get to the office. Finally, each Sim will be able to have their own personal car to move around in total freedom. Having built a garage for the car and connected it to the main road via a special driveway, the family will have for the first time the opportunity to act without limits, visiting all the places that can be reached at will. Obviously the car represents a status symbol and will be the mirror of a Sim's wealth, for this reason changing car to increasingly expensive cars can have an influence on the change in the appeal of the characters. Now that our Sims know how to live in a group, recognize affinities in their partner and can move around in total freedom, the time has come to explore the world around us. The ~city~ of fun and entertainment offers everyone the opportunity to have fun and have fun. There are museums, pubs, discos, game rooms and restaurants. Each type of venue has its precise function and can help a Sim achieve their goals more easily. A romantic restaurant could prove to be the right place to positively affect your loved one, just as bowling could prove to be an excellent environment to encourage the development of bonds between the heterogeneous components of a group of friends. But how many are there??? The only negative note that we can attach to this expansion concerns, to dire the truth, a choice made by the publisher throughout the saga. The player who has purchased the CD-ROM version will in fact have to resort to a good dose of patience before being able to enjoy the joys of this title. Those who, like myself, will have to undergo the total installation of the game, get ready for a rather tedious experience. The original game combined with the two expansions constitutes a range of eight supports! A bearable penalty, however, if you think that soon you will be able to taste the succulent novelties of the latest expansion... The Sims 2 Nightlife gives the original title more depth as regards the relationships between the Sims, digging into their hearts in search of hidden passions and irrepressible impulses. Although it sometimes seems difficult to be able to follow the game action in its entirety, especially when the group of friends is large, the opportunities offered undoubtedly give greater longevity to a title that in itself already possessed the innate ability to always renew itself. It is worth emphasizing that Nightlife, while not being able to do without the original game, can be played in the absence of the University expansion, or together with it, without any problems. Worth noting are a couple of improvements introduced in the management of the graphics sector and the new (and highly anticipated) opportunity to activate the display of the scenic elements and houses in the neighborhood. From now on the player will be able to enjoy the decorations scattered on the map of the neighborhood during the game and enjoy the view of the neighborhood in its entirety. Even if the minimum hardware requirements are rather small, we recommend installing this title on rather advanced machines, to avoid running into exhausting loading times and slow-motion camera management. Finally, a last note goes to the renewed soundtrack signed by Mark Mothersbaugh, here reproposed in a disco key. Really captivating! In conclusion, we would like to recommend this expansion to all those who have enjoyed the Maxis protg in recent years and do not want to miss the opportunity to significantly increase the gaming experience and the longevity of this title. Pros Major changes to the Sim interaction system Neighborhood can finally be seen Sims can now own their own car Cons Setup times are grueling Those who choose the ~cd-rom~ formula should be prepared to be inundated with huge numbers of supports Sometimes it is complex to manage very large groups It is now Maxis' habit to delight us with periodic appointments through the regular presentation of a new expansion for its flagship title, the highly decorated bestseller The Sims 2. The policy of the software house led by Will Wright has been clear since the release of the title : ensure the release of expansions every six months that could deepen the gaming experience, deeply enriching the contents and offering renewed longevity. The first objective has therefore been achieved in full. Six months after the release of University, the first expansion pack for The Sims 2, Maxis is ready to launch Nightlife on the market. It is worth remembering that these titles require the presence of the original game already installed on the PC in order to work, since they are real expansions and not standalone.", "date": "2005-09-26", "grade": null}
