Beyond the setting, in fact, the game could count on a gameplay of a certain depth, on an arsenal of excellent variety and power, and finally on a graphics engine capable of making the physics of the fights better, with enemies that literally flew away after a rifle shot, or ended up in pieces under our rotating blade. Finally, the metal soundtrack managed to best underline the frenzy of the clashes, with the double bass drum that invariably started every time you were faced with a demonic creature. The protagonist of Painkiller, Daniel Garner, who died together with his wife Catherine in a car accident, ~wakes up~ in purgatory alone, separated from his better half who instead was able to reach heaven without problems. In this border place, suspended between good and evil, Daniel is informed that hell is about to launch its offensive against the kingdom of heaven, and that such a war will destroy everything. He is therefore assigned the task of weakening the armies of the underworld by making use of a respectable arsenal: if he manages to prevent the attack, he will be able to enter heaven by right and embrace his wife again. Portable analgesic Having acquired the license from the original publisher, DreamCatcher, Chillingo has decided to bring the People Can Fly FPS to Apple devices, entrusting the work to the guys from MachineWorks Northwest, already responsible for the discreet mobile reduction of Prey. But something went wrong, and so Painkiller Purgatory presents itself as a really bad product, afflicted by a series of more or less serious problems that completely undermine its enjoyment. In the first place, it is clear the attempt to attract older fans of the PC game more than anything else, tempting them with a portable version of the same which, however, is completely devoid of a plot: the protagonist is always Daniel Garner, of course, but he knows well what he's up to once again in purgatory, with the scenario once again full of demons and gruesome creatures to be eliminated. The structure of Painkiller Purgatory is quite simple: you enter a room, kill all the monsters inside it (including those that reappear thanks to the respawn) and then move on to the next one, in a sequence of fights that leaves no space for exploration and then culminates in the confrontation with huge bosses, increasingly angry. In the end it is not a gameplay very different from that of Painkiller for PC, but as regards the artificial intelligence of the opponents (in fact almost always immobile...) and above all the technical realization of the conversion, both from the point of from the point of view of the controls and the graphics, the operation soon turns out to be a real disaster. The shortcomings in terms of optimization are obvious: it is almost as if we wanted to run a latest generation shooter on a ten year old computer, which clearly trudges. The dramatic drops in frame rates become the norm at a certain point, and end up further worsening a control system that is already worth very little in itself. It is possible to use two virtual sticks or only one (in Modern Combat style, therefore moving the right thumb on the upper part of the touch screen), but in both cases the response to the inputs and the precision in general leave much to be desired. Even the developers have included an automatic aiming system because it is in fact impossible to aim decently from a standstill, let alone do it on the move or even having to open fire in the meantime. In conclusion, the graphics are of a good standard, with some interesting locations and with a large number of details. Too bad the engine can't handle it in a decent way...
