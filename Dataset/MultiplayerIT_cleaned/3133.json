{"name": "Dead by Daylight Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-by-daylight-mobile-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Dead by Daylight Mobile catapults us into a dark and disturbing dimension, grappling with a sort of perverse hide and seek in which a powerful and lethal killer has the task of finding and killing four unfortunate people before they manage to escape. The developed asymmetric multiplayer by Behavior Interactive has made its debut on iOS and Android a few days ago, and considering the great success that the game has enjoyed especially on PC, it would have been a shame not to try it in this umpteenth incarnation. There isn't a real story behind the experience, and so the short introductory sequence quickly leaves us in the hands of the inevitable tutorial, which provides a fairly simple picture of the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay, which differ depending on whether you are controlling the killer or one of the would-be survivors. In the first case, in fact, we move using a first-person view, exploiting special perceptions to find our prey, land them, grab them and hang them on a hook, literally, waiting for death to seize them. In the second case, the view is instead in third person, but the prerogatives are practically those of a passive survival horror, in which you can run away and hide, but not react to attacks. The goal naturally changes: activate the four devices that open the only way out of the map and cross it to save yourself. Gameplay With a single mode available, Dead by Daylight Mobile allows you to immediately familiarize yourself with the dynamics of the matches, which, as mentioned, use an asymmetrical formula, a four-against-one which however does not put all the participants on the same level at all and is therefore based on respect for roles. The fundamental point, however, is that the survivors must absolutely collaborate, on pain of defeat: when the killer knocks one out and hangs him on a hook, the others can intervene to free him and even heal his wounds so as to restore his ability to move. . The problem is that all this takes time, and it is therefore necessary that at the same time someone else lures the enemy away from the position of the player in difficulty. Well, obtaining this type of coordination on mobile is unfortunately not simple, and so the game arises in a very different way depending on whether you assume the role of the victim or the perpetrator, in the latter case finding greater freedom and simplicity of action (in the face of longer matchmaking times) being able to manage one's resources alone. A further obstacle is represented by the use on the move, given that Dead by Daylight Mobile should preferably be played using a pair of headphones or earphones to be able to warn noises and react promptly to them. Luckily the authors have emphasized in this version the visual rendering of perceptions, and so each sound has a corresponding graphic element to make things a little easier for us. The touch controls use invisible virtual sticks on the sides of the screen for movement and view management, while other buttons appear on the touch screen as needed, especially when you need to perform simple quick time events. Unfortunately, it very often happens that the system ~ jammed~, that is, that the view does not move correctly while we walk and this creates a woodiness and a cumbersomeness that heavily undermine the experience. The game does not support Bluetooth controllers nor will it in the future, apparently: a choice aimed at not fragmenting the user, especially in a delicate moment like this. Technical realization Dead by Daylight has never been a visually spectacular game and we certainly didn't expect a turnaround right in conjunction with the debut on iOS and Android devices, which is confirmed as a mix of ups and downs. The frame rate, adjustable to 30 or 60 frames per second, remains fairly stable during matches and the general atmosphere is unsettling, especially if headphones are used to increase involvement. However, the polygonal models appear angular and dated, but above all the textures are of the lowest quality and contribute to creating a clear feeling of ~dirty~ which is reflected in particular on the scenarios, very confusing on the design front. Speaking of changes compared to the other versions, in this case we are faced with a traditional freemium production, downloadable for free from the App Store or Google Play, but obviously based on a model that clearly points to monetization. You can also play without spending money, mind you, but the road to obtaining the characters and killers appears really long and tortuous, with the pricesfor the immediate release of content that appears quite high: we are talking about 5.49 euros for each new villain.", "date": "2020-04-22", "grade": "7.0"}
