{"name": "The Incredible Machine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-incredible-machine.html", "text": "There's no doubt that puzzle games are big on mobile, always. This is because these are products that can be used at any time, extremely immediate and fun, which lend themselves well to a quick and limited use. Having exhausted the classics of the genre, proposed and re-proposed in various sauces since the dawn of wireless gaming, the developers had to invent something new or, as in the case of The Incredible Machine, recover a game that came out years ago and redesign it as needed. But how exactly does the ~incredible machine~ work? The initial menu allows us to ~play~ or try our hand at a ~free mode~, or select the stages to try after having unlocked them in the main mode. If we choose to ~play~, we will see a short tutorial that will guide us step by step in solving a first, simple puzzle; after that we'll have to fend for ourselves. Using the buttons on the numeric pad, in each stage we will have to open our inventory and take out the available objects, and then place them on the seabed and activate them in some way. A practical example: we have to light a fuse and we have a laser beam available, so we will have to place this object so that its beam hits the fuse so that it lights up. Once the objects are arranged in the way we deem appropriate to solve the puzzle, we can start the experiment and witness the results, hoping that we have solved the puzzle. The Incredible Machine offers us the beauty of sixty levels, to which twenty extra ones must be added to unlock. The nature of each stage is different, and new objects are continually introduced to ~fit into the mechanism~ to arrive at the solution: lasers, balls, magnifying glasses, sticks of dynamite, etc. etc. The technical realization of the game is good from every point of view. The graphics of the stages are quite simple but functional, where the design of the characters that appear every now and then is really spot on and fun. Once you have solved a puzzle, you can even ~review~ the outcome of the experiment. The sound sector accompanies without shining but not even annoying, which is still appreciable. As far as the control system is concerned, everything is very practical and intuitive: the joystick (or the corresponding numeric keys) to move the object, the FIRE (or 5) button to select or deselect them, finally the asterisk and pound keys to enter the inventory and to start the experiment.
