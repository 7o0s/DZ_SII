Indeed, it is difficult not to be captivated by the splendid views offered by the stages that make up the competition, especially the one that leads to the traditional arrival on the suggestive avenue of the Champs-lyses, up to the Arc de Triomphe. Taking advantage of the fame of the French grand tour, the transalpines from Cyanide have linked it to their name in recent years, bringing the Tour to our screens in two different formats: on consoles with the more immediate Tour de France 2015, which we have already reviewed, which joins Pro Cycling Manager 2015 on PC, a manager with more complex dynamics. For those unfamiliar with this series, let's remember that it can now boast a very long tradition, which has rusted especially in recent occasions with the arrival on the market of titles that are a little too similar to each other: a classic problem for annual releases, with the which even teams larger than Cyanide are forced to contend with. This time, the guys from beyond the Alps have at least listened to the requests of their fans, adding an additional mode to Pro Cycling Manager 2015, on which we will focus without wasting time in further ado. The magic of the Tour de France returns with Pro Cycling Manager 2015, but the yellow jersey is far away! A new champion The arrival of the game mode entitled Pro Cyclist is certainly the main novelty of Pro Cycling Manager 2015: within it, we are called to take on the role of a single budding cyclist, with the aim of becoming the strongest in the world . Those who have already had experience with the NBA 2K series and its My Career will know more or less what we are talking about, even if at present the comparison between the modes of the two games is unthinkable: the one set up by 2K Games is in fact gigantic , while that of the Cyanide game is shown in a basic version, especially interesting in view of a future expansion. However, the idea behind it is similar: you start by creating a young cyclist between the ages of 19 and 22, choosing his specialty (sprinter, climber and so on) and then inserting him into a team where he can gain experience with the first racing. The choice is up to the player: by preferring a smaller team, our virtual alter-ego will be able to play it even for an important role, while in a more important team there will be more chances that he will end up at the bottom of the hierarchy compared to much more famous champions. Each event played provides experience points, thanks to which you can level up and improve in the fundamental attributes for the type of cyclist chosen. In practical terms, the Pro Cyclist mode is very similar to the classic Career, adapting the menus so that you only have to worry about your own cyclist: therefore all the components dedicated to the team disappear, to concentrate above all on the training calendar thanks to which better face the competitions in which you participate. Once on the road, you see the other changes: during the races it is in fact possible to give orders only to the cyclist we control, thus leaving it to the CPU to manage the other elements of the team. On the basis of the team strategy, for example, one can attempt an attack or roll to lend a hand to a teammate, in any case counting on extreme freedom to decide one's own actions: even too much, given that if one does not follow the tactic we would expect to see some consequence from the team. In addition to the various commands, there is also the possibility of moving left or right on the road with the arrow keys, which seemed to us to be an addition more of an aesthetic than a practical nature. Summing up the Pro Cyclist mode, we can say that it guarantees some immediate fun, however raising more than one perplexity in the long run due to its monotony: if desired, it can still be a good opportunity for novice players with the Pro Cycling Manager series, given that once again the Career mode tutorial does not stand out for its completeness. Same story, same place, same bar As well as the tutorial just mentioned, the remaining parts of Pro Cycling Manager 2015 are presented in a rather similar way to how we remembered them in the previous edition. Starting with the classic management mode, for which the developers have focused above all on the management of cyclists in this edition. Within our team it is now possible to create a reserve team, made up of promising players from the youth sector. The part dedicated to training has also been revised, to allow the player to better control the growth of the individual cyclesisti. Beyond the novelties, it is a pity that in some parts Pro Cycling Manager is still a mysterious object, for which Cyanide should do a little more to attract a new slice of the public to its product. Moving on to multiplayer, the Armada mode is back again this year, a sort of FIFA Ultimate Team in which you can collect cards representing cyclists and equipment, to be used to create your own ideal team among the many possible alternatives. As far as the race is concerned, Cyanide has thought of giving the player more control over the execution of sprints, where it becomes possible to control the trajectory of one's cyclist. In combination, we find a different management of fatigue, which compared to last year gives a significant additional weight to escapes and other actions that involve a certain physical effort. The player is therefore obliged to properly plan the way he wants to play his cards, with the knowledge that in the eternal building site of artificial intelligence he now finds more combative opponents: from the point of view of the challenge itself, it is undeniable that winning a stage is now more satisfying than ever. Moving on to aesthetic terms, Pro Cycling Manager 2015 does not add anything in particular to the graphics engine of its predecessor: getting closer to the runners, the technology inexorably shows that it is now a bit over the years, but the effect of the race seen with a television perspective it always retains its charm. The mispronunciation of the surnames of some cyclists also remains, caused by the only partial presence of the licenses: Chris Vroome is therefore still Froome, but fortunately this problem can be remedied with a patch from the online community. More complicated to fix are the bugs that once again Pro Cycling Manager 2015 brings with you: among those encountered by us or reported by players on the official forums, we point out crashes in various points of the game, disappearance of saves and an interface that is not very optimized for lower resolutions, where elements overlap and become impossible to click. In the race, however, we noticed a few too many crashes, even in relatively calm phases of the race. After the release of the game Cyanide released a couple of patches, but apart from the most striking cases, the reports haven't completely stopped: before making the purchase, it is a must to take this thing into account.", "date": "2015-07-10", "grade": "6.0"}
