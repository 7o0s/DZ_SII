The latter can count on the best version of the title developed by EA Motive, thanks to the presence of more advanced presets that do not have to be subject to any frame rate limitation, provided however own a configuration that is capable of withstanding a similar load: we talk about it in our review of the PC version of Dead Space. Story: Back on the USG Ishimura Dead Space, Isaac Clarke speaks and often appears without a helmet during the remake campaign As we have had the opportunity to explain in the comparison between Dead Space and The Callisto Protocol, the story of Isaac Clarke and his expedition aboard the USG Ishimura still manages to exert a great charm today, even more so thanks to some narrative elements that the developers have tried to enhance within the remake, even without really bringing the story to a cinematic level. The protagonist goes with a rescue team on the huge space ship that ended up adrift after receiving a request for help from the his ex-girlfriend, Dr. Nicole Brennan, but once he arrives he finds only death and horror. The crew has in fact apparently been exterminated by hordes of gruesome creatures, the Necromorphs: the unhealthy union between an alien parasite and a human body, which in their most frequent form develop long sharp appendages. The only way to eliminate these monsters is to literally tear off their limbs, and after witnessing the massacre of some of his companions, Isaac finds the perfect tool for this purpose: the Plasma Blade. The iconic weapon of the original Dead Space is for long stretches the absolute protagonist of the action, as we push ourselves to explore the different sectors of the USG Ishimura in an attempt to recover Nicole and find an escape route together. If in the 2008 original the main character did not utter a word and remained covered up until the final sequence, in an attempt by the developers to increase the player's degree of identification, in the remake it was decided to immediately give him a face and a voice, that of the actor Gunner Wright, who had played Clarke in the first trilogy: a decision that we found understandable but controversial, and which inevitably takes away some of the charm of the experience. Gameplay and structure: redone and improved Dead Space, lights and shadows contribute substantially to the atmospheres in the exploratory phase The new version of Dead Space is not limited to revolutionizing the technical aspects of Visceral Games' masterpiece, but also introduces various innovations in terms of gameplay and structure, managing to offer an even more solid system but above all in step with the times, in field of solutions that are very reminiscent of the work of Capcom that we told in the review of the remake of Resident Evil 2. The developers have decided to remain adherent to the classic canons of survival horror and an already credible setting, that of a protagonist who he cannot move very quickly or agilely due to the armor he wears, also designed to carry out repairs on the external elements of the ships and therefore capable of moving in open space, this time thanks to the use of a pair of thrusters. Dead Space, the Plasma Blade used against a Necromorph's limbs The combat system therefore requires keeping your distance from the Necromorphs, trying to use the weapons that gradually become available in order to dismember them: a solution that emphasizes the monstrosity and danger of these creatures, and which is combined with the use of Stasis and the Kinetic Module to complete a repertoire that paves the way for action shooter mechanics capable of giving great satisfaction. A system made even more solid not only by the excellent characterization of each individual instrument, but also by resource and ammunition management which requires giving time and attention to the exploratory phase, which in the remake takes advantage of the security permissions expedient to promote backtracking that remains optional but can actually add something to the experience. Dead Space, navigation aboard the USG Ishimura is often guided by handy mission markers Behind the sounds, the sudden sorties and the positioning of the Necromorphs within the scenario there is in fact the'Intensity Director, a system developed by EA Motive to basically manage the game's ability to take us by surprise. Thanks to it, returning to previously visited places, perhaps to recover the contents of some chests or to access previously inaccessible rooms, can lead to unexpected events, such as furious clashes with newly ~activated~ creatures. In this regard, the Dead Space bestiary is confirmed to be phenomenal, both in terms of the design of the monsters, which actually inspire fear, and for their variety. The primordial instincts of many of these creatures, who charge headlong regardless of the weapons we have, are matched by the unpredictable behavior of the Lurkers, who tend to hide from sight and then hit us with their darts. Technical realization Dead Space, sections of the ship set on fire If it is true that the EA Motive remake does not take the opportunity to bring the narration to a cinematic level, preferring to keep the standard character models during most of the intermission sequences, with all that follows also and above all on the in front of facial animations and general detail, in terms of effects there is no doubt that the game offers a new generation experience. The key elements of a sci-fi survival horror, therefore the alternation of lights, shadows and mist, can count in this case on extremely sophisticated and convincing technologies, which also contribute in a very clear way to the gameplay mechanics. The fog that you come across in certain places, for example, prevents you from seeing enemies and even from using the laser pointing of the weapon, which is projected onto the smoke. Dead Space includes zero-g sections revamped with the introduction of thrusters If it is true that the design of the Necromorphs has been kept faithful to the 2008 original, under their hideous skin layers of muscles and bones are hidden which are horribly revealed under the blows of our weapons, thus giving us a precise idea of the damage caused and how much more it will be necessary to insist for those monstrous appendages to be severed, finally stopping the advance of the enemy. It is interesting to see this aspect as an addition to the historical graphical interface of Dead Space, which allows you to check the indicators directly on the armor of the protagonist of his life energy and Stasi. In short, we move between fidelity to the past and the need for renewal of a product from 2023, which we find in particular in Isaac's animations, less wooden as his steps are more agile and quick through the corridors of the USG Ishimura. Dead Space, the communications carry on the plot together with many surrounding elements, such as documents and audiologs The huge spaceship plays a fundamental role in the adventure, which it once again interprets with great competence and conviction thanks to a solid and in its own way iconic design, again a successful middle ground between respect for the original work and the desire to introduce something new; even with regard to the supporting actors, better characterized not only from a narrative but also a visual point of view. In this sense, unfortunately, the Italian dubbing is not convincing and ends up taking something away from the experience rather than adding. Blame a blind interpretation without references, as often happens in video games? We don't know it, but the result often leaves something to be desired in terms of intensity and conviction, with the only exception of the actor who plays Isaac. Ah, obviously in the remake we spared Dario Argento, iconic director but nightmare voice actor. The PC version Dead Space uses dark, light and haze in an excellent way So how does the remake of Dead Space behave on PC? At the beginning we talked about the ~best version~ not surprisingly: although the qualitative presets adopted by the developers are basically the same used on PS5 and Xbox Series X, depending on the hardware in our possession we will be able to push a couple of settings and above all obtain a better compromise in terms of effective resolution and frame rate. Of course, in all cases one does not disregard some upscaling technology, whether it is DLSS 2.0 or FSR 2.0, which seem to behave in a similar way but with a slight advantage of the system developed by NVIDIA: apparently the graphics of the EA Motive title is so complex that at the highest resolutions it literally sends any GPU to mush, with the only exception of the top models of the still unapproachable 4000 series. Dead Space, the graphics options of the PC version Usefulicing a configuration that includes an Intel Core i5 13500 processor, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM and what is currently one of the most popular video cards among PC gamers, the RTX 3070, this extraordinary weight translates into around 50 fps at Actual 1440p, with all settings maxed out (excluding ray tracing) and no DLSS or FSR. By activating these latest technologies with the ~quality~ preset, the game undergoes a substantial boost, exceeding 100 fps. However, by enabling ray tracing, which the Dead Space remake applies to ambient occlusion, the situation changes a lot and to keep everything maxed out at 1440p and reaching 60 fps you have to opt for the ~balanced~ preset or activate the dynamic scaler, which decreases the resolution where it is needed, thus managing to limit performance just enough to fill small gap. Dead Space, Isaac discovering a new area Another way is clearly that of the fine adjustments, after all the options are not lacking if you want to experiment: in addition to resolution and vertical synchrony, we are given the opportunity to resort to VRS or not, choose the antialiasing between TAA, DLSS and FSR, then set the quality of the light, shadows and reflections, the volumetric resolution (which greatly affects fluidity), the aforementioned ambient occlusion with or without ray tracing and the depth of field quality.According to our tests, with an RTX 3070 you can successfully achieve 4K and 60 fps output, but not without lowering the presets and activating image upscaling technologies. In all cases it is important to deactivate the ~film grain~ effect, which adds noise to a situation already prone to reconstruction artifacts, and to try to maintain a certain percentage of performance surplus in order not to run into obvious stuttering phenomena, especially in the passage from one section to another.", "date": "2023-02-14", "grade": "8.5"}
