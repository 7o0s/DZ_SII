{"name": "Guitar Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-3.html", "text": "Heroes of our times Developed by the same authors of Frequency and Amplitude, Guitar Hero is nothing more than a rhythm game entirely focused on the figure of the rock guitarist. If this doesn't appear entirely original, it is because Konami had already tackled the same videogame subject with his Guitar Freaks in 1999 on Playstation, apparently offering the same contents: a guitar-shaped peripheral, a substantial tracklist of songs and a gameplay derived from the indestructible structure of Dance Dance Revolution. So why was this Guitar Hero acclaimed by many as the probable holder of the palm of the best rhythm game of all time, given this precedent? The answer is very simple: everything in Guitar Hero is bigger, better looking and more fun than Konami's product. Starting from the peripheral: a convincing plastic reproduction of an electric guitar, complete with five colored keys on the neck, a flipper instead of strings and even a whammy bar for distortion. Armed with this splendid big toy, the user just has to follow the information that appears on the screen: a sliding bar marks the progress of the song, with various colored icons indicating the corresponding key to press on the guitar obviously accompanied by a ~ pizzicata on the pinball machine. Guitar Hero is an extremely immediate and fun product Heroes of our times In addition to the basic notes, you are busy performing something similar to chords whenever you are asked to press several buttons at the same time, while the presence of an elongated signal on the screen involves the prolonged execution of the same sound. As it is easy to imagine, Guitar Hero is an extremely immediate and fun product: anyone can pick up the guitar and strum a few songs without much difficulty. But at the same time the Harmonix title stimulates the player to continuously improve, putting him to the test with increasingly complex melodies and with four decidedly distinct levels of difficulty, which gradually involve a greater number of keys to use and chords to play. What is most striking about Guitar Hero, however, is its exceptional selection of songs, made up of 30 really good quality covers: while mainly focusing on classic rock and metal (with names like Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd and Judas Priest) , the tracklist does not disdain some excursions into contemporary music (Audioslave, Sum 41, Franz Ferdinand and others), but the astonishing fact is that, regardless of personal tastes, every single track offers literally exhilarating guitar solos to perform, to the point of pushing everyone to accompany their performance with the movements and attitudes of a true rock star... Audience in a frenzy As if all this weren't already enough to make Guitar Hero a galvanizing and exciting product beyond every level of guard, Harmonix has well thought of peppering the gaming experience with the Star Power mechanism. At more or less regular intervals during a song, a series of star-shaped icons appear, the correct execution of which leads to the filling of a special indicator: once a certain margin has been reached, it is possible to exploit the Star Power - which can be activated by lifting the handle of the guitar up - which doubles the points multiplier, with obvious benefits. In addition to being choreographically spectacular, the Star Power adds a dash of strategy to the whole, since it serves both to exponentially increase one's score towards a high-score and to save oneself from a dangerous situation of disgruntled audiences: every performance in Guitar Hero it is in fact accompanied by a frame of spectators, whose approval rating is representative of their ability to correctly execute the chords of the song. Among its many advantages, the Harmonix title also includes that of offering a particularly convincing single-player section, consisting of a career mode that sees your character (one of the eight selectable) starting from the cellars up to the stadiums, unlocking during the path new songs, guitars and various bonuses. The multiplayer is also good - obviously a bit limited by the need to have two peripherals available - in which two players can challenge each other to the last solo. All accompanied by an unusually accurate cosmetics for a rhythm game: the real-time sequences that describe the performance of your band's concert appear solid from a polygonal point of view and above all extremely pleasant as regards the movements of your digital alter-ego . Even the reproduction of the ambient audio makes a good impression, with tasty effectsreverb tti related to the scenario in which you play and above all with an audience that reacts realistically to the actions performed by the user. In short, the attention to detail of Guitar Hero is absolutely first-rate, an element capable of further elevating the value of a rhythm game capable of truly involving like few others. Comment Guitar Hero is undoubtedly one of the most successful rhythm games in videogame history. Although born from a non-original idea, the Harmonix product presents an impeccable realization in every aspect: starting from a simple but incredibly captivating gameplay up to a spectacular tracklist in no uncertain terms, passing through graphics that are decidedly up to par. and a solid and functional dedicated peripheral. In short, Guitar Hero is the dream come true of every ~air-guitarist~ and a title that no enthusiast of the genre should pass up. Pros Impeccable game structure Excellent quality tracklist Good technical realization High levels of involvement and challenge Cons Almost prohibitive at higher difficulty levels Playing the guitar is a very demanding practice. It takes practice, dedication, passion and above all a lot of time to be able to imitate even imperfectly the numbers of your favorites. Not to mention what comes next: forming a group and attempting the climb to success by starting to play in the cellars is certainly not an everyday thing. Much better to buy a copy of Guitar Hero and do everything brilliantly and without leaving your home...", "date": "2006-05-30", "grade": null}
