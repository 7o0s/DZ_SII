In the case of Bring Me Sandwiches!!, the protagonist of the game is the mild-mannered clerk of a fast food restaurant who suddenly finds himself having to defend our planet from an alien invasion. As? Taking care of preparing megalithic sandwiches to appease the hunger of the alien that threatens us. Invested with the authority to interact with dangerous extraterrestrials by the President of the United States himself, we will therefore have to explore five scenarios (USA, Mexico, Italy, Japan and finally Planet Nuzz) to prepare sandwiches from time to time bigger, following some precise indications about the ingredients with which to fill them. Does the terrible alien feel like a cat? Well, let's find a nice little kitten to put in the sandwich. Want to taste the famous Mexican chili? So let's recover some specimens. Do you want to bite the hard leather of ten soccer balls? We try to please him. The gameplay is that of classic platformers and we can choose between three different control systems to move the character: the accelerometer for moving left and right and a single button for jumping, an invisible touch keypad or a visible keypad, which includes two arrows for movement and one key for jumping. The latter solution proves to be by far the best in terms of accuracy and reliability, while not equaling the best things seen in this regard on the iPhone (the virtual stick that automatically repositions itself, implemented by Pro Evolution Soccer, is currently unmatched). It's always me, the sandwich maker! If in the Monsters Ate My Condo review we complained about the lack of depth and progression, a feature unfortunately common to puzzle games with a survival type structure, in Bring Me Sandwiches!! you immediately notice that the contents are much richer than what a first glance reveals. The almost fifty stages that make up the game can in fact be tackled again to complete ~sidequests~ (that is, prepare sandwiches that are not essential for completing the level) and obtain 100% of the achievements. Furthermore, from time to time, elements of variation are applied, for example the scenario will move continuously in one direction and we will therefore have to put the sandwiches together very quickly, to then deliver them to the ~alien delivery boys~ who also provide us with slices of loaf of bread. These slices get bigger as we satisfy the invader's demands, and so the objects with which we can fill them go from plants, fruits and soccer balls to people, tables and dumpsters, and finally entire buildings that we ~hook~ and transport like new little princes in any episode of Katamari. The similarities with the Namco Bandai franchise become quite evident from a certain point on, even if the completely different setting makes the experience of Bring Me Sandwiches!! unique of its kind and far from being able to be defined as an imitation. Stuffing the sandwiches by collecting anything that comes within range, reaching the required percentages, finding the particular ingredients within the scenarios and then switching to larger slices of bread is a lot of fun and above all it does not prove to be an end in itself. Furthermore, the gradual increase in difficulty will imply a certain effort to complete the more advanced missions, given that the pitfalls from which we will have to beware will multiply. Finally, as far as the technical implementation is concerned, a really excellent job was done. The design of the protagonist, of the funny characters that populate the locations and of the aliens is very funny and convincing, just as the colorful backgrounds represent a feast for the eyes, always very rich in objects that, in most cases, we will be able to put in the middle to bread. The sound is also excellent, especially the amusing disheartened verses of the poor clerk. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-11-16", "grade": "8.5"}
