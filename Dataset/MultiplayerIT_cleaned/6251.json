As anyone who follows the events of the Kyoto house closely knows, the team entrusted with the project is Good-Feel, already author of that Kirby and the Hero's Cloth which on Wii was able to leave its mark above all thanks to the particular stylistic choice of reproducing the entire game world and the characters as if they were made of wool and various fabrics. The main defect of that title was unanimously indicated in the excessively calibrated level of difficulty downwards, which if on the one hand favored - also thanks to the local multiplayer - a ~family oriented~ experience truly accessible by anyone, on the other it left little satisfaction to more experienced users, able to easily continue through the levels even with the proverbial hand tied behind his back. Well, on the E3 2014 show floor, after finishing the demo, the feeling was more or less the same, with the impression that Good-Feel had limited itself to doing little more than ~the homework~ by largely replicating the same formula. Take out Kirby, put in Yoshi, add high definition and that's it, right? If you too shared the same suspicion, get ready for a nice surprise... Yoshi's Woolly World is a platformer that is beautiful to look at and play, and quite challenging! Washed with Perlana In reality Yoshi's Woolly World in the very first bars doesn't do much to overturn this impression, on the contrary: some changes in the basic structure of the series lead us to believe that the most suitable target could be that of children, or even worse than those casual users always watched with suspicion and distrust from those who were born and raised with a pad in hand. For example, it is enough to know that this time there is no Baby Mario to protect on the back of his own Yoshi: on this occasion the matter only concerns the lizards of Gomitolo island, upset in their peaceful and very soft life by the arrival of the evil Kamek who he turns most of them into skeins of wool which he carries away with him. Even more sensational is the discovery of the complete disappearance of one of the cornerstones of the platform genre, on which entire generations have built their videogame certainties: lives. That's right: in Yoshi's Woolly World there are no lives. If you make a mistake in a level, you simply restart from the previous checkpoint. Don't make those faces, come on: in an absolute sense, and even more in the context of modern Nintendo platformers, it was a concept with increasingly impalpable utility, a legacy of mechanics belonging to another era. The confirmation comes from the fact that, in reality, this choice changes little or nothing in practice. The very first levels of the adventure roll by simply, without any particular jolts. But it doesn't take long to realize that things are bound to change: is it the dull reflections? Or maybe it's the concentration that is missing, compromised by the splendid work of the Good-Feel artists? Yet we find ourselves more and more often having to repeat some sections, or reaching the end of the level without having collected all the objects necessary for the maximum score. The reality is that the Japanese programmers have simply decided this time to get serious, proposing a truly challenging level design product. In fact, it is precisely in this aspect that Yoshi's Woolly World shows the most marked differences compared to Kirby and the Hero's Cloth: if the latter was practically a walk in the park, the return of the Nintendo dinosaur is instead a ~true~ platformer. which behind a welcoming and very warm appearance hides a much less tender heart towards the player. Obviously we are not talking about a hardcore title, it would be silly to think so: what we mean is that the effort of Good-Feel requires such knowledge as an entrance ticket, attention and coordination certainly not typical of the casual genre. The beauty, however, lies in the fact that the experience can be adapted to your abilities: if your goal is simply to reach the end of each level, you probably won't have to work too hard. Of course, there are some more complicated passages, in which precision and reactivity are essential elements in order to continue: if this should prove to be an excessive request, know that at any time it is possible to activate the Relax mode which gives Yoshi wings to overcome any obstacle , increases its energy and makes enemies less dangerous. And already the mere fact that this option exists, I give youIt should make it clear which target the Japanese team has aimed at. If, on the other hand, you want to go out with your head held high, collecting all the Laughing Flowers, balls of Magic Wool, stamps and full of energy - all conditions necessary for the maximum rating - well then get ready to have to sweat a lot. In this case the exploratory element of the levels is highlighted in an absolute sense, in reality it has always been a distinctive feature of the entire series dedicated to the dinosaur: you have to sharpen your eyes, search in every nook and cranny, push the scraps of fabric and undo some portions of scenery by pulling the strings, so as to be able to really recover everything. An operation that will often require repeating the same level more than once, extending a longevity that is already more than discreet thanks to the approximately 50 basic levels available. Warm hug One of the most evident merits in the gameplay of Yoshi's Woolly World is the variety of situations that the programmers have tried to insert: without wanting to reinvent the wheel, Good-Feel has introduced a series of variations that actively contribute to making the progression more interesting. For example, in addition to the classic scrolling linked to the player's movements, there are stages with forced scrolling, others that develop vertically, still others that recall Donkey Kong's mine cart races. And then there are the transformations, recovered from the aforementioned Kirby and the Hero's Cloth: in practice, these are short sections that can be reached through special doors hidden in the levels. Once inside, you find yourself controlling a Yoshi transformed into a whole series of disparate vehicles such as a motorcycle, a submarine, a helicopter, a mole and so on. The aim is to reach the exit within the time limit, possibly also collecting objects and as many beads as possible. The latter are practically the game currency, and can be spent to buy the Pins of Power: behind this name there are essentially perks, which can only be activated one at a time, and which are able to give the protagonist additional abilities. Some are less useful, others are instead real blessings, such as the possibility of recovering objects even with the tongue. The boss fights also deserve a mention, never really complicated but still very pleasant and rewarding. Yoshi's Woolly World is therefore a rich platformer, made with great care, with a level design probably lacking the spark of genius of the masterpieces of the genre but which in any case more than amply compensates for this ~lack~ with out of the ordinary quantity and variety. And then there is, of course, the graphic aspect that we would never tire of talking about: even if there is no real abyss compared to that Kirby on Wii of which Yoshi's Woolly World in some ways represents the spiritual successor , the greater capabilities of the latest Nintendo hardware and - above all - high definition have allowed the artists of Good-Feel to express their vision in an even better way, giving a sense of concreteness to the reproduction of wool, buttons and fabrics almost capable of transmitting the relative tactile sensations. Suffice it to mention, by way of example, the tiny and characteristic fluff of the wool that can be appreciated in the Yoshi models that can be examined closely using the appropriate mode. And there are really many variations, because by collecting all the balls of Magic Wool in each level it is possible to recompose a dinosaur with a unique skin, which can then be freely used as a protagonist by the player. The aforementioned variety is then also reflected in the settings which differ not only in the theme of the individual worlds, but also simply between one level and another: in a few minutes you go from the toy room to a world full of sweets, from a challenge between flames and lava to a water area and so on. Truly a remarkable effort that makes the progression always fresh and stimulating; the fact that everything runs at a constant 60 frames (except in level selection) is an aspect that deserves to be properly underlined. A small stroke of genius then in the exploitation of amiibo, which also allow you to unlock versions of Yoshi with the colors and features of the relative statuette: if you manage to remain impassive in front of a saurian with Link's green tunic and blond hair, probably you are playing on the wrong console...", "date": "2015-06-22", "grade": "9.0"}
