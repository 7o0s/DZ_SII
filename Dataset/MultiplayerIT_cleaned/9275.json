The Japanese Cave are a prime example, pioneers and ambassadors of the old school shooter genre, after bringing us little gems like Guwange are ready for a little big surprise, namely this Nin2-Jump. Title that surprisingly embraces the dynamics of the two-dimensional platform, offered at a very low price (400 MP, about 5), the proceeds of which will be donated to the Japanese Red Cross for the victims of the earthquake. This alone would be a good reason to spend a few Microsoft points, but we are only at the beginning of a truly hilarious project. The protagonist of the game is a typical feudal ninja, engaged in the most canonical of tasks: to save Princess Sakura through 50 levels of increasing difficulty. The goal to finish each level is disarmingly simple, our task is to recover a series of scrolls scattered across the map, and then reach the exit, which however will only become available after having recovered all the packages. Simple? Not exactly, as the whole operation must be carried out in the shortest possible time in order not to run into death, an invincible opponent who starts chasing us after a certain amount of time. It is therefore peremptory to finish the level in an arc slightly greater than a minute. The best times are of course recorded and uploaded to the Live leaderboards. The schemes are also littered with various enemies, deadly traps and increasingly intricate self-propelled platforms, which require careful reading, obviously at the expense of the rhythm and fluidity necessary to bring home the skin. Every ten schemes we have to face increasingly dangerous bosses, with attacks to be studied carefully to understand exactly how to defeat them. It goes on stage What leaves you stunned about Nin2-Jump is its exceptional technical realization, in stark contrast with the standards imposed by today's productions. Instead of amazing effects or polygonal loads, the developers have staked everything on style, originality and a manifesto of the most folkloric Japanese culture. The whole game is presented as a children's Kabuki play, i.e. Japanese comedy theater. Scenario and protagonists are nothing more than cardboard silhouettes set up on a virtual stage, complete with screaming spectators, commentators and all sorts of antics. In essence, the feeling is that of attending a goliardic school performance devoted to the most unbridled racket. The first impact is nothing short of devastating, with our ninja who seems to be scribbled by some mischievous student, with the typical red scarf reduced to a decomposed pile of pixels. The animations of the characters are also eliminated, replaced by the support rods, functional to their movement. All this is contrasted with a mocking paroxysmal violence, with exaggerated blood splatters that smear the screen cloth, obviously all in general hilarity. The sound accompaniment is particularly exciting, full of vocal expressions that will make those who know the Japanese language, or at least some terms, smile. Exceptional are the compositions created for the occasion by the talented Ryu Umemoto, who seems to be in complete harmony with the scenario. Amusing tunes that alternate electronic synths with wild electric guitar solos contribute to the sense of urgency and chaotic frenzy that characterize this bizarre title. Xbox 360 goals Nin2-Jump as usual offers 12 objectives for a total of 200 player points, so we are in the classic Live Arcade standards. Half can be achieved simply by finishing all the levels, but there is also a particular objective that requires the recovery of special scrolls (the CAVE-kun) hidden in the levels. Or hold out for a full three minutes in Score Attack mode. Against death Although the unusual aesthetic set-up manages to capture the player's attention, as well as the elementary dynamics of platform games, once you get used to this delirious amalgam it is impossible not to notice some imperfections that inexorably emerge. The difficulty of the levels makes itself felt all too soon, thanks to a much more punishing design than the childish aspect might suggest. A peculiarity that does not surprise too much, knowing Cave, but there is no doubt that many of the difficulties are unrelated to the player's ability, but rather to be attributed to the choices decided by the developers, both aesthetic and gaming, not all of which are convincing. There are obvious problems withproportion; the self-propelled platforms are excessively small and are often confused in the scenario, which has the typical transparency of a wall projection, ditto the rotating ones, adjustable through specific switches, whose reading is not always clear. Added to this are sessions that require high precision, and which are poorly associated with the need to finish the level as soon as possible, not to mention the exploration for the recovery of the scrolls. All elements that dangerously close the mirror of success. The aforementioned death increases in units over time, until it is practically impossible to avoid it. As the levels progress, new features are added, such as a grappling hook to be aimed at certain anchor icons, but this only adds to the visual confusion. Surprisingly, the jump is not without defects in terms of precision, a factor that is hardly justifiable in relation to such a fiscal framework. Finally, the bosses are also too cryptic in their understanding, with the result that victory is achieved thanks to instinct, rather than logical sense. In essence, all this contributes to a potentially frustrating trial and error formula, not exactly compatible with the fluidity that one can expect from a product like this. NIn2-Jump is a title designed entirely for the single player, but there is a timed mode to beat the best scores, to then compare in the Live leaderboards.", "date": "2011-05-18", "grade": "6.5"}
