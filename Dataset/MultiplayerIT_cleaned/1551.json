{"name": "Psyvariar", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/psyvariar.html", "text": "Buzz! Skills, we said. Taito has focused attention precisely on the players' dexterity, considered the focal point of Psyvariar: by dodging enemy blows from close range (causing a spark on the hull of your ship), you will get experience points (called ~Buzz~) capable of increasing your horsepower, as well as the attitude of the vehicle. Given the immense amount of bullets you will encounter, it will not be difficult to score something like three hundred consecutive Buzzes (my personal record is just under four hundred): the alien ships fire bursts with particular trajectories, which sometimes cover the entire screen and leave only specific areas free. Ultimately, learning the modus operandi of your opponents is the key to getting the best results. Nonetheless, sometimes avoiding being shot down will be really impossible, and at that moment you will have to be ready to shoot a smart bomb to cancel the bursts that are about to hit you and, at the same time, cause damage to the hostile vehicles on the screen. This type of approach is certainly original and interesting, but a little too limited: the player is not allowed to choose a different vehicle, or manage his own weapons (very few!). The movement of the spaceship is sometimes too slow to extricate itself in enemy fire, even when perhaps you can figure out the right trajectory to get away. Furthermore, visually everything is too chaotic: your fire and the enemy's fire sometimes get confused, and being able to dodge in those conditions is a desperate operation. The stronger ones have more chances The number of Buzzes collected and the power level reached also influence how the game is played. In fact, between one internship and another, you will be given the opportunity to choose a different destination (with relative level of difficulty), of variable number depending on the experience achieved. Setting aside, however, the structure of the levels is clearly similar: a certain number of enemy ships, small and large, attack you until the arrival of a final boss. All this also takes place in a very short time, however. Of the two games featured, the Revision version is the better, as I wrote earlier. Basically for a gameplay discourse: the spacecraft maneuvers better and the trajectories of enemy fire leave a few more openings, in order to give you the possibility of getting away without always resorting to smart bombs (limited, of course). The game graphics are fully polygonal. The ship you control is not beautiful, while the design of the enemy vehicles remains average for this kind of production. Nothing very original, really. The backgrounds show a fluctuating quality: some offer some interesting ideas and rotate in different directions, others are really poor and poorly colored. Finally, the soundtrack is full of catchy but not exceptional electronic melodies. Concluding... Einhander, for PSone, a few years ago left me a very good impression of what the shoot and run could do with polygonal graphics. Psyvariar, on the other hand, seems to reject progress and proceeds down a wrong path, in my opinion, finding solutions that remain bound to the old school and do not take into account what good has been done since the advent of 128-bit consoles, in the various videogame genres . So we are dealing with a product dedicated to ~old guard~ players, who will undoubtedly find it fun (even with all the limitations of the case) and will also appreciate the possibility of playing in two at the same time. Without wondering if it was possible to do something more. Pros: Original power-up system Two games in one Cons: Short levels Graphics not suitable for the console Extremely limited Complete Edition The game includes both of its incarnations: Psyvariar Medium Unit and its sequel, Psyvariar Revision. After the introduction, it is possible to choose which of the two to grapple with. The first is naturally more ~older~, therefore less graphically complex and with some slight differences in the game structure (no big deal, just the possibility of using a different weapon), while the second I found better in terms of playability I'll explain why in a moment. First of all the story, dismissed through very rapid textual screenshots (little interest in having it read?): the planet is threatened by an alien armada, and you are the only man capable of using psychic energy at a certain level, aboard a vehicle spaziale specially designed to translate your skills into firepower. So you launch into space and begin an indiscriminate slaughter of everything that moves, receiving in return billions of laser beams and bombs to dodge. One button to shoot, one to activate the classic smart bomb and one to rotate the spacecraft, in order to obtain an attack with greater piercing power: it won't take hours to learn how to play with Psyvariar. As in the shoot-and-run tradition, there are few rules and what matters most is skill.", "date": "2003-09-01", "grade": null}
