RedLynx has been able to capitalize on the experience of Trials HD and package a product more compliant with a canonical videogame form - in the conceptual and content sense - without renouncing the innovative thrust and immediate fun of the particular project that started as an indie and then became almost a phenomenon mass. The idea is essentially the same: it involves driving a vehicle, which in this case is not a motocross bike but a quadricycle of various kinds, within routes bristling with ramps, jumps, platforms and obstacles, trying to dose acceleration and rotation of the axis in a balanced way in order to take advantage of the right trajectories and reach the finish line in the shortest possible time, avoiding falling or getting stuck somewhere. It's a rather ancient idea but one that has been enriched in recent times by the introduction of realistic (or at least coherent, since talking about realism in a game of this kind is a bit risky) physical behaviors applied to the vehicles, which open up the the way to challenges made up of highly calculated accelerations and careful management of landing angles after jumps, to avoid rollovers and get the vehicle right where we want it. And this is exactly what works in MotoHeroz: once you get the hang of it, you begin to master the physics of the game and you get to control the car in an extremely precise way, making it jump and land exactly where you want, studying the trajectories at the millimeter and elaborating concatenations of jumps, landings and loops of the loop able to shave off precious seconds and satisfy one's desire for acrobatics. To this, which is the main core of the game, we then add the presence of various levels with different settings, a nice characterization, the presence of multiplayer (indirect, but still present in a constant manner), power-ups, customization and secrets to discover and we have the complete picture of this RedLynx title, which doesn't replicate the completeness of the WiiWare version but comes very close. Small heroes There is something different in this iOS version, which is not fully convincing, while maintaining the solid and excellent basis of the WiiWare version. The structure of the levels has changed and they have been greatly reduced in quantity, going from the approximately one hundred of the original edition to the current thirty divided into 6 different settings. The reduction could be part of a DLC plan and progressive expansions aimed at increasing the game's contents, a trend towards monetization which is also evident in the possibility of purchasing vehicle upgrades directly by spending real money instead of waiting to accumulate the necessary points for the purchase , but on the other hand it's a feature we're learning to live with, especially in the iOS environment. On the other hand we're talking about a 79 cent game compared to the WiiWare one which costs around 15 euros, a comparison that seems at least unbalanced and pushes us to forgive, from this point of view, the reduction (even strategic) of the contents. The control system was transferred quite easily, being based on only four keys (one for accelerating, the other for reverse, to be used strategically to take advantage of sudden gear changes and two keys for vehicle rotation) but the feeling in certain cases it is slightly less reactive, in particular as regards the maneuver to rearrange the vehicle after an overturning, or the need to shake the device, which very often results in an exaggerated counter-overturning which brings us back to the same situation. In short, there are some edges that have not been rounded off properly, as was done for the WiiWare version, but it is still difficult not to consider this MotoHeroz on iOS a title to recommend. The immediacy of the gameplay captures immediately and although the ~trial and error~ structure can be frustrating, the fact of being able to restart the level in a fraction of a second, simply by pressing a button, guarantees a continuous succession of attempts without any interruption, a solution that is really powerful in creating addiction (something similar to what happens in the Bit.Trip series, for example). On the one hand, all that pseudo-narrative component that characterizes the Wii version has been lost, with the ~spirits~ of the pilots to be collected to get to know new characters, but the vehicle upgrade system through the spending of the points earned in each game guarantees however a steady progression in status dthe game. Finally, the indirect but constant multiplayer system helps to substantially strengthen the sense of challenge, proposing in real time a ~ghost~ of another human opponent to beat in each game, in addition to the one provided by the CPU, and constantly updating the online rankings .", "date": "2012-03-19", "grade": "8.8"}
