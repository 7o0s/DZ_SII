It tells of a hyper-consumerist society of 2067 where the public only enjoys seeing ultra-violent shows. Among them is GUTS, a kind of reality show in which the participants literally have to tear each other apart, trying to become the champions. Overall, there are nine playable characters in the roster, all psychopaths who love blood and violence. For example, Jack is a rude lumberjack angry because a multinational corporation has taken away his taste for felling trees, Risa is an artist who uses the blood of living creatures, including her kitten, to compose her works, Anita is a ruthless combat android, Maromba is a bodybuilder priest who wants to cleanse the planet of fat people, Samuel is an ex-soldier who loves to fight and doesn't accept a world without conflicts and so on. The roster is made up of nice psychopaths Everyone has their goals, but to be able to achieve them they must first unseat the overall champion of GUTS, D.B. Judge, who to celebrate the fiftieth edition has decided to take the field directly (we translate: she too is selectable). No energy bar As we said, GUTS is a match fighting game, but it has its own mechanics. The most original is the absence of the energy bar, replaced by the limbs of the characters. In fact, in GUTS it is not the one who beats the most who wins, but the one who manages to tear off the opponent's arms and legs. The system works as follows: fighting loads the so-called GUTS bar which, when full, allows you to perform one of the four GUTS attacks available to each character. If the blow lands and is not parried in some way, the opponent loses an arm or a leg. When a character is left without limbs, one last GUTS attack is enough to send him to the other world. There are actually other methods of dismemberment: hazards and traps, which are quite self explanatory and are related to the scenarios. For example, a speeding car crossing the stage is a hazard, while a circular saw is a trap. A third way to deprive opponents of their precious limbs is to throw at them one of the limbs already torn off and left on the battlefield ... or one of the spectators. Doing so costs U points, visible at the bottom of the screen. The latter are accumulated by fighting and can also be used: to heal oneself, i.e. to reattach one of the lost limbs; to parry GUTS moves and to instantly charge the GUTS gauge. Another original feature is the absence of a timer. So the fights can go on even for several minutes. D.B. takes care of regulating the duration. Judge, who occasionally introduces new rules: for example, he can load the GUTS bars automatically, so as to make the use of GUTS moves more frequent; or it can inhibit healing, or it can double the limbs lost for each successful dismemberment and more. GUTS offers different game modes, which follow those of the most famous fighting games: two tutorial levels, the training mode, the single player campaign in which you have to defeat all the other opponents and the single match. Blood everywhere There are also multiplayer modes, which can be played both locally and online. Unfortunately we were unable to try the online mode, still experimental, due to the chronic absence of other players. Local multiplayer, on the other hand, offers the classic 1vs1 mode and some variations of the rules that are interesting to try, but that leave a little the time they find in the long run. Sublime and full of flaws GUTS is a title that is both sublime and full of flaws. Playing it, you soon realize that many things work badly. For example, the bad collision system produces embarrassing situations, with shots that go or miss in an often arbitrary way. Especially the GUTS moves are problematic from this point of view and cause more than a few problems, especially when you are in the most agitated phases of the match. Another problem is the artificial intelligence of the opponents, effective overall, but in some cases a little deficient, which prompts them, for example, to throw themselves into traps for no reason or to perform random GUTS moves. Finally, the loss of limbs causes a lot of confusion because it inhibits some moves, modifies GUTS attacks, and renders certain tactics unenforceable. With time and practice you can compensate by learning all the various possibilities, but it is still a big annoyance for several hours of play. In short, many GUTS mechanics work little or nothing, the characters are not many and the scenariosthere are only four. The characters are definitely over the top Moreover, graphically it is not even beautiful, with elementary 3D models, imprecise animations and side elements of semi-amateur level... yet we guarantee you that when you get into the spirit of the game, you can no longer tear yourself away from it. It will be for the blood that splashes everywhere filling the screen completely, smearing scenarios and characters; it will be for the gameplay as a whole, which in its excess of brutality manages to involve and relax; it will be because despite everything we are faced with a title with original mechanics and, therefore, we tend to be benevolent towards it; the fact is that we played it with great pleasure and went back to it several times even beyond what was necessary. Particularly tried with a friend, GUTS was a great experience. In short, we are faced with an ambivalent title, which arouses immense sympathy, fails a bit in everything, but overall it has involved us and, in a certain sense, convinced us: it is difficult to recommend it, but it is also difficult to advise against it.", "date": "2017-11-21", "grade": "7.0"}
