The delay does not depend on us: initially the Radical Fish Games production was supposed to debut on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and other consoles in 2019, then there are hitch states. And so, a year and a half after its first PC debut, it's ready to demand (heck, it should!) its fair share of attention. CrossCode is one of those unknown games, which pass away in the shadows hardly noticed by a handful of fans, and which instead should be placed in a display case, on display, polished every day. We explain why. The plot: in an MMO The influence of Sword Art Online on CrossCode is clear. The game world is nothing more than a gigantic MMO, a virtual universe where anyone can enter to have fun inside the dungeons, in the company of the others present. But the plot immediately captures the attention despite the not exactly original premises, thus discovering the cards on the table: something profoundly wrong is happening in the CrossWorlds. Strange figures have even come to openly threaten human beings. The protagonist of the production is Lea, an avatar who remembers absolutely nothing of her original human and why she entered the MMO in question: but immediately the various supporting actors are very keen to underline that she is a very special newcomer. And so a curious crew of an equally curious cargo ship trains her, instructs her on how to fight, provides her with all the necessary information. Lea's path will lead her to regain lost memories, to repair the vocal synthesizer (she can no longer speak due to a malfunction, and this favors identification with the real player) finally to reveal the mystery that hides behind the virtual game world. All in a main adventure that runs for 12 hours, but which we advise you to enjoy little by little, also dedicating yourselves to the myriad of side missions, useful both for revealing the background of the game world and for increasing the level by Leah. In this way it will be easy to at least triple the initial game hours. The gameplay: an RPG If from the point of view of the game setting CrossCode is an MMO, its structure is instead that of the old-fashioned RPG. A strictly 2D RPG, with 16-bit graphics reminiscent of SNES productions; and at the same time with gameplay, accessibility and styles that come (thankfully) from modern times. The soul of the production is basically that of the action: Lea wanders around the game world, whether dungeons or not, beating up the enemies present with a set of moves that is only vaguely inspired by classic RPGs. No turn-based combat, no stats to keep in mind: one button for melee attack, some combinations for ranged, one to guard; all strictly in real time. Different does not mean shallow, on the contrary: adequately mastering Lea's entire moveset (which expands, enhances, refines from chapter to chapter) will take time. Add to this the fact that the developers have tried to offer as often as possible new stimuli, new possibilities during construction: and therefore the sensation is that of a continuous discovery. Progressive, procedural, but continuous. From the console, the protagonist's pointing and remote attack system is clearly less intuitive than the PC version, but no less efficient for this: a simple matter of habit. Continuing in the main adventure, obviously, Lea will meet new friends and join a party: it must be noted, however, that most of the details are already pre-established by the developers. For example, you cannot choose a precise game class, favor certain paths over others: the RPG soul is evident, but much less pervasive than you might think. More than a load-bearing and binding structure of the gameplay we could instead define it, like the MMO setting, a CrossCode context. But the final mix is valid and original. Playstation 4 trophies CrossCode brings a glittering Platinum Trophy to PlayStation 4. Obtaining all the trophies shouldn't actually take you away from more than one game ~run~: they are almost exclusively linked to completing the main chapters of the narrative, and the battle with the bosses. Progression and style We have already said that in CrossCode there is a lot of fighting: a fluid 2D action that never hesitates, and which also leads the player to contend with more than a dozen gigantic bosses (some less inspired than others). The otherhe soul of progression is that linked to dungeons. Lots of dungeons. Too many dungeons. Dungeons overrun with environmental puzzles, puzzles, puzzles everywhere. Some dungeons will even take away an entire hour of puzzles: it's okay to vary the adventure, anything goes, but the temptation to let everything go to the best of times comes from time to time. Fortunately it is never really definitive: we are talking, in fact, of a production that has invested practically all its workhorses in the care and depth of every smallest aspect of the game. That of style, for example. Every CrossCode environment deserves to hang around for a few hours, enjoying the small refinements, the inordinate talent of Radical Fish Games in polishing and polishing and polishing its own pixel art. CrossCode is also this, a work of craftsmen. Which is offered, among other things, at an accessible and honest price. Even considering the many hours of play offered, it is difficult to find real defects in the production, such as to penalize it. And in fact we can't find them.", "date": "2020-07-04", "grade": "8.2"}
