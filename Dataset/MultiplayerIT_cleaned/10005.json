A time when the concept of ~score~ was something common, if not taken for granted and often essential. In this journey back in time, it is not at all difficult to come across some treasure... or rather, some Treasure, if you allow us the obvious link with the name of one of the software houses that have most marked the experience of ~hardcore~ gamers with a capital a. A career, that of the Japanese company, studded with some truly unforgettable gems; many of them sadly still usable only by recovering the original hardware and game (without counting the emulators) such as Guardian Heroes, Silhouette Mirage, and above all Radiant Silvergun, others available on Virtual Console, see Gunstar Heroes and Sin & Punishment. And precisely for this last title, the almost eighteen-year-old Tokyo-based company wanted to create a completely new sequel, available exclusively - guess what - on Nintendo Wii. Casual to whom? How much will Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies sell? Probably very little, but frankly this is the least of our thoughts. Or rather it certainly represents a disappointment, because it further questions any further exponents of a genre that is already niche in itself. But the pleasure in playing Treasure's new title should start from a respectful as well as gudurious mental reset, essential to unplug from everything that the gaming world in 2010 has led us to take for granted, and thus return to reawaken (or activate for the first time, for the youngest) those survival instincts linked to memorizing the patterns of enemies, repeating the same steps over and over again, finding the right combination of movements to obtain the best result. Because Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies is essentially this: an exercise of effort to be faced knowing full well that it will not be a walk in the park. Certainly there is a selection of the level of difficulty that allows you to adapt the challenge, making it more accessible - even if never really easy -; yet tackling a Treasure shooter in this way is equivalent to emptying it of its essence, depriving it of the fundamental spark. A Treasure shooter ~must~ be difficult, pissing and making you want to throw the disc still inside the Wii out the window; this is because then, with the umpteenth attempt, when you finally manage to get the desired result, the satisfaction is simply unique. Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies collects the legacy of its predecessor which, we recall, was released on Nintendo 64 at the end of the console's life cycle, and for this reason it never officially crossed the Japanese borders. The landing on Virtual Console then finally also allowed the Western public to appreciate what was in fact a shooter on rails characterized by a very good gameplay and a leading technical component built on a setting with typical features of the iconography of the sci-fi manga and anime. In the same way, the sequel in question follows its traits starting from the protagonists; in this case it is Isa and Kachi, a very young couple of heroes (female + androgynous male) who find themselves falling due to mysterious circumstances near a very secret base from which they are forced to flee in order not to be killed. Premises rich in the most obvious Japanese clichs, which in reality would also offer interesting ideas, unfortunately however poorly developed by the in-game sequences. But fortunately the plot is certainly not the main component of Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies... The importance of a Wiimote We were talking about the gameplay, and the track structure: in practice, the game proceeds by itself in moving within the levels, while the user is given the ability to move the character within the framework, obviously with the aim of avoiding being hit and lose precious energy. So like any self-respecting shooter, the defense phase has a specific weight equal to that of the offense phase; specifically in reference to the controls, the first is linked to the nunchuk (stick to move, C to jump, Z to dodge), while the Wiimote manages the second. Pointing it towards the screen obviously allows you to move the viewfinder, while the continued pressure of the B key allowsyou to shoot; on the contrary, pressing it repeatedly generates a close-up shot, very powerful and useful in situations of melee contact. The A key, on the other hand, offers the possibility of hooking enemies with a lock, thus guaranteeing greater precision of one's projectiles at the expense of their lower power. Finally, holding it down gives life to the EC shot, a sort of smart bomb that requires a short recharging period in order to be able to reuse it. The configuration just described is the one with the standard controls, but there is the possibility of playing Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies also via Classic Controller or Gamecube pad; solutions that could make purists happy, but which in reality turn out to be less precise and reactive and therefore simply inferior. Too bad for the two-player mode, an uninteresting filler that merely provides the companion with a simple support viewfinder with which to help the protagonist. We said at the beginning that the Treasure production is an old school hardcore title; a concept that is strengthened not only in the face of the medium difficulty, but also in the presence of an online ranking on which to send your scores and compare yourself with other players scattered around the world. As a result, the overall longevity becomes a less defined and precisely traced concept: if in fact it is true that it will take a maximum of 7 or 8 hours to reach the title screen, repeating the levels to improve one's performance can exponentially increase the attractiveness well beyond such duration. As per tradition, the fundamental component for earning a high score is that of the combos, with the multiplier that grows for each enemy eliminated and resets to zero on the contrary if you suffer a hit. Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Skies is thus a sight to be played, but equally a sight to behold; except for the character design of the main and secondary characters, from our point of view trivial and not very incisive, all the remaining elements of Nintendo's production exude class from every pore. The levels unfold step by step with a succession of spectacular camera changes, within spectacular environments of extraordinary variety and populated by dozens of enemies for an orgy of bullets and high-impact effects. And if this weren't enough, there are many huge bosses to face in moments of climax capable of exalting even the most tepid player, within a game rhythm that is always dosed with the balance. It is therefore useless to complain about the low definition and the blurred textures, daughters of a hardware that was never designed to amaze from this point of view. Finally, the music is absolutely 90s, with guitars galore that elicit a smile but nothing more.", "date": "2010-05-20", "grade": "9.0"}
