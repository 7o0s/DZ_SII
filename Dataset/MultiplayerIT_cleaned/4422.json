We talked extensively about its key features in the preview phase and in a very recent tried, based on a near-final version of the game; so we won't be listing them again. Instead, let's try to understand how Rise and Fall affects the gameplay of Civilization VI. More than anything else, let's try to tell it. Let's take a big leap forward: we're around the two hundredth shift. The continent on which we built our civilization is home to two more, as well as several city-states. Using emissaries and governors we managed to take control of two of them. One is placed between our border cities and those of one of the opponents. Aside from a few barbarian villages, we have hardly ever fought, instead aiming to strengthen the loyalty of our cities. Furthermore, by virtue of our cultural and scientific development, we exert a very strong influence on some foreign cities. Why not try to get one? Making risky moves would mean alienating those who are peaceful neighbors, so let's try to act up: we replace the governor of the border city-state, dedicated to economic development, with one that increases our influence even more, therefore, after a handful of shifts, we send some spies to stir up the spirits of the enemy territory. Without attracting attention we manage to cause some chaos and two cities end up rebelling. Too bad that in the meantime we had forgotten to pursue the goal selected for the age in which we find ourselves and plunge into a dark age. Our influence over foreign cities drops sharply, the loyalty of our border settlements shrinks, slowing down the economy and growth of the entire nation. In essence, we are forced to review short-term plans and we start to take better care of internal affairs. Since there is no end to the worst, one of our historic allies asks us to go to war alongside him against the civilization of another continent, with which we are in peaceful relations. We are then asked to give him military support. What to do? Ruin relations with a long-standing ally by denying him the requested help, or deteriorate those with other nations, which surely will not like our intervention? And the costs? We are in a dark age, can we afford a war? Fortunately, as mentioned above, we effectively dominate the governments of several city-states and have amassed vast resources in an earlier Golden Age, thanks in part to our rich deposits of iron and copper (not to mention luxury goods some leaders cannot do without it). Then, using our influence and spending some of our gold, we take control of the troops of one of the city states and send them to the front in support of our ally. At the same time we reactivate some old units built during the turns in which we didn't have the wheel yet, we update them, and we send them to the front together with the others. Unfortunately it is not possible to wage war with discretion, but in this way we have guaranteed the support required by our ally, without slowing down the development of our civilization too much. Of course, there is little we can do to prevent other nations from starting to distrust us, but we will try to recover relations with them at a later time. Maybe we will temporarily allied with those who despise us today to go against those damned Russians, who are growing a little too big and have a terrible army. Who knows what the future holds for us. The influence on the gameplay of the new systems As you will have understood from the previous paragraph, the new functions offered by Rise and Fall can radically change the course of the games, especially in the advanced stages. From the first rounds, in fact, it is difficult to understand the extent of certain innovations. Of course, the age system emerges right away, as does the historical chronology, which is a very pleasant narrative addition: it is basically the graphic account of the progress and the most relevant facts of our civilization. The same system of influence on the city is shown from the first rounds, but as we said, to understand the scope of everything you need to get to the advanced stages of the game, when you can verify its integration with the old systems and, above all, when choices made in previous rounds can be taken to their extreme consequences. It is in those moments that, for example, one really understands the difference between centralizing power in the hands of a single governor or distributing it among several officials. Similarly, it is only in the advanced stages that the innovations related to diplomacy emerge strongly. TObecoming central are in particular the alliances, which managed in a certain way can overturn the fate of the entire planet. In short, Rise and Fall is an expansion that does not aim so much to revolutionize Civilization VI, as to complete some aspects of it, adding new ways to play the game and opening the field to problems that were not previously considered. For example, now positioning the new settlements becomes more complicated, because you have to consider, in addition to the resources, also the influence that the opponents exercise on certain territories. At the same time, city-states become more important than they used to be, because they can be put to practical use as advanced resources. Artificial intelligence and other content Every time you write about Civilization VI, comments criticizing its artificial intelligence inevitably appear. After all, it also happens for many other similar titles (practically all 4X). Let's be clear right away: the AI is not flawless, but in principle it does what it has to, also because it is called upon to manage an impressive amount of functions. However, it must be said that the most critical are those who by now know the game inside out and are probably a little tired of playing it, even if they don't want to admit it. The truth is that Civilization VI has an artificial intelligence in line with that of previous chapters, including the justly acclaimed fifth chapter, and superior to most other 4X on the market. Rise and Fall confirms this aspect. Indeed, it improves it, given that the CPU is able to exploit the new functions very well. Of course, if you expect behavior closer to that of a human being, perhaps it is better that you immediately devote yourself to multiplayer, because some simplifications are inevitable, just as it is inevitable that after many games played at the highest difficulty levels, begin to recognize some of the patterns adopted by artificial intelligence (applies to all games). This is not meant to be a justification, but only an observation of the fact that it is easy to expect, to understand a little less. Speaking instead of the new regular content, what to say? They are fair and they do what they are supposed to: they increase variety. Eight additional civilizations with specific abilities and units, new leaders, eight new great wonders, seven new natural wonders, several new units for all civilizations, two extra districts, some new policies, and much more are welcome additions, but they certainly revolutionize the game. Let's say that they represent the right seasoning of an already rich offer, but nothing more. For the rest, the interface has remained the one we knew, with the new functions integrated. Not bad, considering that it had already been revised through free updates and is almost perfect. In this respect Firaxis has only to teach the competition. Finally, also from a technical point of view, there is little to report, given that, apart from a few small tweaks, there is nothing new apart from some trivial refinements. The quality of the various additions is in line with that of the base game, which is really high for the world of 4X. Of course, don't expect to see your graphics card bent. After all we are talking about a Civilization: the brain (the CPU) counts more than the muscles (the GPU).", "date": "2018-02-07", "grade": "8.8"}
