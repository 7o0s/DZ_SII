Developed by Indrasoft, a Chinese team that cut its teeth creating graphic assets for various triple A titles for PC and consoles, the game manages to occupy the beauty of 7.7 GB on iOS, which makes it a somewhat complicated product to manage and maintain if you have a terminal with little memory. However, we soon realize how this amount of data has been used to maximize the visual sector of the experience, in the context of a story that sees a handful of warriors brought back to life to face the terrible demonic hordes that have invaded the world. Technical realization Let's start with the technical implementation, undoubtedly one of the characterizing elements of Raziel: Dungeon Arena, which can in fact boast truly extraordinary graphics and with very few uncertainties. In addition to the spectacular cinematic sequences, it is possible to appreciate a high level of detail, great attention to detail and an enormous variety for the scenarios that we will find within the game's full-bodied campaign, made up of over sixty missions. The guys from Indrasoft took care of assets and they wanted to demonstrate all their experience with this project, in short. We don't remember ever seeing a mobile game where the map grass bends when stepped on by a character, or in general such a large amount of environments instead of the traditional ~recycling~ in order to dilute the actual contents compared to the potential duration of experience. However, the matter does not end here, because in addition to the excellent scenarios, the game can also boast excellent protagonists: there are currently twelve that can be unlocked and used from the perspective of a sort of tag team, facing various types of enemies along the way, as well as big bosses who will not fail to give us a hard time. In short, the design and animations are top notch, and surprisingly everything runs smoothly at 60 fps on a 2018 iPad Pro even with the visual quality set to maximum, and without the device tending to overheat. The action is also accompanied by a valuable sound sector, with dialogues in English (the localization in Italian is completely missing at this moment) and convincing music. Gameplay But let's go back to the gameplay, which while on the one hand can boast undoubted solidity and rest on very well-tested foundations, on the other hand unfortunately proves to be excessively simplified in certain respects. At the beginning of the adventure we are asked to choose our hero among three different warriors: an Ice Priestess, who strikes her opponents with spells; a Ranger, who dispenses death and destruction with his bow while remaining at a safe distance from the targets; and finally a Beastmaster, powerful and unstoppable. During our tests, aware of the limits of action RPGs without defensive actions for the protagonist, we opted for the Ranger and the choice proved to be decidedly sensible, given that we managed to overcome the first campaign acts far too casually. The aim of the ranged attacks is in fact completely automatic, where a twin stick shooter-style approach would have guaranteed greater satisfaction and involvement, and this trivializes the challenge a little too much. The touch controls are almost perfect, with a repositionable virtual stick and a very good arrangement of attacks on the right side of the screen. However, the fact that a few suffered attacks are enough to see one's vital energy reduced to a minimum confirmed our suspicions: probably with a character expert in hand-to-hand combat the experience would prove to be difficult already after the second chapter, as it would become complicated avoid taking damage by having to get close to enemies to hit them. The inevitable paywall can therefore be perceived differently and it is clear that the game provides us with a series of microtransactions with which to accelerate progression, obtain better weapons and armor, as well as upgrade the statistics just enough to be able to overcome any critical phases. However, wanting to avoid spending money, it is possible to replay the missions already completed on a higher difficulty or perhaps experiment with the multiplayer modes, both competitive and cooperative.", "date": "2020-10-03", "grade": "7.8"}
