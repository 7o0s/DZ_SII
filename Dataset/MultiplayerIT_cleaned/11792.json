{"name": "Fantasy Warrior 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fantasy-warrior-2.html", "text": "The genre of role-playing games on mobile phones is making decisive steps forward from every point of view, thanks to the achievement of a certain threshold of technical capabilities that allow current terminals to manage maps of a certain size as well as characters with fluid animations. It is also pleasing to note that these products in the mobile sector have already started with a modern-type structure, abandoning the elements that characterized the old role-playing games on consoles and which greatly limited their playability, in particular the random fights. Fantasy Warrior 2 takes inventory management a step further: whenever you pick up a better weapon, in particular, it's automatically equipped without having to select it from a menu. What the game has kept is the classic top view, with the map scrolling in various directions and managing to have a certain color contrast with the characters that move inside it as well as with the objects that can be collected. As anticipated, FW2 does not have a random clash system, but you can choose how and when to face an enemy to raise your experience and therefore look for level-up. To enter a fight, all you have to do is come into contact with an opponent, after which the scenario moves to a sort of room and you don't need to press buttons to attack: you just need to ~touch~ the enemy to cause him damage, but we'll have to stay be careful to approach only when his side is exposed, or we will suffer a blow in turn. Generally the difficulty of the fights is not low, and as you go on things get more difficult. The problem is that this challenge is not supported by an effective recovery system, in the sense that if you are defeated you have to start the dungeon again from scratch and with half energy, with a high probability of dying before returning to the previous point. If these are the consequences, it is clear that losing a fight turns into a rather frustrating experience. The differences between the Good and Evil versions of Fantasy Warrior 2 are limited to the basic story, as the enemies and settings are the same. And the control system is also the same, really simple and immediate: the joystick moves the character, while the lower keys of the numeric pad are used to display the map or repeat the last text dialogue. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the new Digital Chocolate product is slightly above the average: the colors are used very well and manage to characterize each location in the best way, with a series of elements that generally don't give an idea of repetitive. The characters are equipped with a good level animation even if limited in quantity, while there are no qualitative differences in the design of the enemies, historically subject to less attention than the protagonists. Something more could have been done in the context of the fights, however, which are very little spectacular. The sound consists of a series of musical themes of fluctuating quality, which have the task of underlining each different phase of the action and succeed in this without particular problems. The controls, as mentioned, are quite simple and the game responds promptly to inputs, without ever being cumbersome regardless of the quality of your phone's joystick: not a small advantage, but largely due to the genre of FW2 membership.
