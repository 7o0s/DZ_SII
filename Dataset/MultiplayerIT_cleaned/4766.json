Yet, as often happens, it was precisely through this derogatory definition that a new and high-impact expressive channel was created, which conveyed the ideas of various independent teams, finally canonizing a way of building stories and narrating them through the video game. After the first experiments, these tools are now used with a certain mastery, in some cases with a great maturity that leads to remarkable results in terms of narration and What Remains of Edith Finch fits perfectly among these, as we have already had the opportunity to evaluate from the review posted at time of launch. We reiterate the same conclusions today that the game has also arrived on Xbox One: the work of Giant Sparrow probably won't move the position of those who refuse to include this type of product in the videogame field, or who cannot accept only limitedly interactive experiences and too short compared to the standards now imposed. If anything, What Remains of Edith Finch helps to make these trifles even more irrelevant, because in the face of the stories told in these strange ways by the authors of Unfinished Swan, the categorizations decay and only the idea remains of being faced with a work that enriches , somehow, who experiences it firsthand and deserves to be tried by anyone, regardless of their specific idea of what a video game is or not. The history of stories Following the main feature of this trend, What Remains of Edith Finch essentially has a story to tell, and builds everything else on the basis of this fundamental narrative. Indeed, it is a series of stories, a sort of anthological collection based on the strange deeds of the Finch, a family that for generations has found itself fighting against a sort of curse that has then ended up consuming all its members. Edith Finch's return to the old family home - a bizarre mansion that old Sven had built following the shipwreck of the original house during a crazy transfer by sea from Norway to Washington State, in an attempt (failed) to free himself from misfortune - represents the starting point and the common thread that leads us to know the stories of the various family members, all united by the same tragic ending and each presented in a different way and with different elements of interaction that we could define as ~playful~. A story that is gloomy only on the surface, and reveals itself along the way as a reflection on life that is sometimes delicate, romantic and tender, other times cynical and ironic and very often in all these ways put together. As in the Spoon River Anthology, which What Remains of Edith Finch often makes us think of, death is an ever-present, pervasive topic, but not necessarily threatening or disturbing. The result is a meditation on the ineluctability of the end, but also on the possibilities of escape, on dreams, loves, undertakings and life's conquests which can only be partial and temporary, but are in any case all that matters and which it remains as a trace of its passage. Augmented storytelling Talking about gameplay in a game like this seems somewhat misleading, but it is about exploring the strange Finch house by gradually discovering the different rooms that compose it, each one belonging to a family member and containing traces of his life and a sort of object able to summarize its existence, which acts as a catalyst for the launch of each episode. These represent different ways of telling particular stories, involving various interactive digressions on the main theme of first-person adventure. They are rather basic mechanics which however serve to give a new thickness to the narrative, bending the playful structure to the needs of the story in a way that has rarely happened to be seen previously. On the so-called environmental narration and on the different levels of reading, Gone Home has reached other levels of construction, just as Soma and Oxenfree have probably managed to put together a more compact and coherent overall story, but What Remains of Edith Finch has the merit of pushing interactive storytelling towards truly new levels with unprecedented involvement for the spectator/actor. In short, beyond the contents of the stories, the ~levels~ of the game are presented as narrative devices endowed with an impressive force: a domestic tragedy experienced by pure and dreamy eyesi of the newborn Gregory, the fantasies of the hungry little Molly, the alienating descent into lucid madness of Lewis are lived in the first person, precisely through the new element given by interactivity, as experiences of great impact. Results impossible to achieve with other means with this sensory intensity, and which demonstrate the importance of this title in the evolution of the entire medium. What remains Even the aesthetic solutions reflect the fragmented structure of the narrative, although the game remains rather compact on the realistic style most of the time. This generates an interesting contrast between the almost photorealistic representation of certain environments (in particular the interiors, created with considerable attention to detail) and the discordant elements that derive from the intrusions of the absurd and the fantastic into the stories. Even in this precarious balance between normality and the surreal, we find a connection with the magical literary realism that the authors seem to have been inspired by. The decision to place the subtitles (also in Italian) directly within the setting, as an integral part of the environments, increases the feeling of being constantly within a unitary story, also indicating the path to follow in a practical way. All this helps to maintain a remarkable compactness by favoring the pace of the narrative, which also does not seem to want to resort to any expedient to dilute the contents, tightening the entire gaming experience in just two or three hours. The heterogeneity of the characters treated is reflected both in the characterization of the different rooms of the house, which act as real monuments to memory, and in the style in which their stories are presented, in terms of storytelling and graphic representation. Taking into consideration the technical aspect, there are some flaws in the game as regards animations and above all general fluidity, with frequent drops in the frame-rate. The sound accompaniment is truly remarkable, with a well-made dubbing (exclusively in English) and an always high-profile soundtrack, despite the fact that it often finds itself ranging between decidedly different genres and atmospheres.", "date": "2017-07-19", "grade": "8.5"}
