Hunting for Necromorphs! Isaac isn't the only one battling necromorphs on Sprawl. This first expansion, promised at the time by the developers, puts us in the shoes of Gabe Weller and Lexine Murdoch (from Dead Space: Extraction) and tells two unpublished chapters that run chronologically parallel to the main story, and three years ahead of what we saw in Dead Space: Extraction. Gabe, in charge of security, will have to find and rescue Lexine aboard the Sprawl after having unleashed the murderous fury of the necromorphs on the Titan mines next to the spaceship. The parallelism of the story with the main one is immediately obvious given that during the adventure it is easy to come across the ~remains~ of the fights faced by Isaac shortly before. The plot is not trivial and it is not simply about facing Necromorphs, running away and saving yourself. Lexine, Gabe's wife, is entangled in a secret project bigger than her that puts her life (and not only hers) at risk, and which requires the protagonist to find her and save her. Double rescue then: ours and that of the beloved, in a daring adventure that starts from the mines with a sort of backtracking in the footsteps of what has already been seen with Isaac, up to the heart of the Sprawl (and its mysteries). We certainly don't want to anticipate the (few) twists, but know that the narrative is not so linear and obvious. We therefore focus on the gameplay, in all respects identical to that of Dead Space 2 if not for the greater brevity of the game. Dead Space 2: Severed once again features almost all the ~classic~ Necromorphs appreciated in the main chapter, with the return of the beloved TWitchers from the first chapter and the addition of an unpublished monster at the end. If the base game represented a great exponent of horror, for its part Severed focuses more on fear and fights. Not that this DLC doesn't have anything interesting to tell, but it's certainly difficult to get attached to characters with whom we only spend a couple of hours, which is the average length of this little adventure. The fights are once again one of the cornerstones of the gameplay and certainly always fun and well implemented. Gabe starts with an almost harmless pulse rifle and soon finds himself loaded with weapons of destruction that make the happiness of every gamer who loved the films of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. On normal difficulty, the game equips us well with ammunition and health power ups, consequently the progress of the adventure is quite linear and simple to complete as equipped as a perfect war machine. In short, if mowing down monsters and killing enemies is what you like, Severed will give you (for 560 Microsoft Points, so to speak!) a couple of hours of healthy action-horror, but it could also just make your mouth water without feed you. Curiosity and final comments Many of the areas that Gabe faces in the mines are nothing more than redesigned and rebuilt sections of the Titan Mines multiplayer map, hence the sense of familiarity these areas will give many. Furthermore, exactly as happened between the first Dead Space and its spin-off Extraction, there is a curious relationship of exchange and interweaving also between Dead Space 2 and Severed: for example, many of the actions performed in the mines by Gabe will be necessary to perform them on the contrary with Isaac in the main story, and vice versa many actions performed by Isaac in the hospital influence the subsequent ones of Gabe in a sort of space-time game that intertwines in a very curious and intelligent way. Last curiosity: there is still no news of the third survivor, Nathan McNeill, who escaped with Gabe and Lexine from Aegis 7 and the Ishimura. This only means that his fate is not yet known, and who knows, maybe this void will be exploited in the future for another game or spin-off.", "date": "2011-06-16", "grade": "6.0"}
