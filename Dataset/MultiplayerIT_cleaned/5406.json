The new female Ghostbusters - directed by Paul Feig - is perhaps one of the most illustrious victims of the hatred of the web, where fans of the historic original film and its sequel rejected it without appeal even before its release, due to the nostalgic attachment to the brand and a couple of very uninspired trailers. Yet starting biased in this case is not entirely wrong; Hollywood has turned classic films into soulless Americana in recent years, through purely commercial operations that have never really understood what made the original works great. Feig's film may even exceed expectations, but it cannot replace the first Ghostbusters in the hearts of fans and its arrival depends only on the desire of the majors to make money once again on a historic name. With the new feature film, therefore, the inevitable spin-offs have also arrived, and we have obviously got our hands on the videogame one. Simply called Ghostbusters, this new title has recently appeared on Steam at a ~relatively~ budget price of around 40 euros, ready to ride the wave of stars and stripes marketing. Aware of the decent quality of the old Ghostbusters: The Videogame, we expected at least a passable tie-in, perhaps capable of making the most of the background material. Instead, we found a monstrosity such that it cannot be countered even by crossing the flows. Forbid Gozer the Gozerian. The new Ghostbusters video game is... spooky: here's our review Where is Bill Murray when he's needed? We know we talked about the new film immediately, but the truth is that this Ghostbusters has very little to do with Feig's film as well. In fact, the events of the game take place after its conclusion and they don't see you as the new team of heroines, but as a mixed team of characters that we will call amicably: stereotypical blonde emo 1, stereotypical Aryan American 2, bearded variant of Heavy Stereotypical Team Fortress 3, and black doctor with stereotypical afro 4. If they have names they aren't worth remembering and if they have a characterization, it is slaughtered in seconds by the atrocious quality of story, jokes and acting. Don't expect a team even remotely charismatic in this game, we are faced with a squad of ghostbusters that genuinely makes even the protagonist of Ride to Hell Retribution seem well acted. But there's always a bottom in an abyss, so if you've touched it in characterization and narrative you can only go back up, you say. But you're wrong, because the true horror in Ghostbusters can only be seen once you pick up the pad, or the mouse. The game is actually sneaky: graphically it's a top-down shooter, with a pleasant cartoonish style that in some ways recalls that of DOTA 2 . Only slower than a lame turtle in quicksand. It's not an exaggeration, the pace of the game is devastating and it gets boring almost immediately. All four available characters move in almost slow motion, and can only accelerate thanks to a roll that recharges after a few moments. Enemies aren't much faster than they are, and gunfire usually boils down to a haphazard amalgam of bullets fired at staggering pseudo-zombies, skulls and floating books that go down with one shot, or ridiculously patterned mini-bosses that they take a while to get back to the creator. The ectoplasm in the brain With the fact that you play accompanied by three characters controlled by artificial intelligence, which can also be used by other players, the action should quickly become chaotic, but it really never takes off due to absolutely crazy game design choices (or dictated by the desire to create a trivial product in a short time). The levels are in fact quite extensive, something that could also be positive if it weren't that they are all structurally identical. Whether it's the tutorial framework or any of the subsequent ones, you will always do the same things in a loop: kill enemies and advance slowly, finding bonus points scattered around the map with the help of a sensor that further slows down your walk, to then be interrupted from floating enemies or some more dangerous specter to exhaust and capture in order to open the next door. Even the capture of ghosts becomes tedious to almost poisonous levels, because the dedicated mini-game is paradoxically simple and you will have to repeat it a reckless numbertimes for each map. There are secret items, collectibles, and even a final score in each mission, but you'll be so bored you'll hardly care after the first half hour. Not only that, outside of a grenade with variable effects and a specific weapon, the possibility of using any of the four available ghostbusters does not offer the slightest panache. The overheating mechanic is badly exploited, the development of the characters is basic, the co-op doesn't help at all and even the bosses are ridiculous, all with a very low general challenge level (your companions can bring you back to life instantly with the maximum life points just eliminated and you can do the same, the medkits are not scarce). At some point you will get to such a level of disbelief that you decide to exploit the errors of the programmers to escape the experience as soon as possible. Oh yes, we haven't told you yet: the game even has some ~broken~ elements. Damn her Many of the levels are structured in checkpoints and zones, so running around avoiding all enemies by force of dodges can quickly have you completing a stage that would have taken almost half an hour to finish. This works up to a certain point, due to the doors blocked by some minibosses we were talking about earlier, but in general it is a good way to avoid yet another repetition of an enemy already seen a thousand times or a new group of very slow mobs to exterminate. The artificial intelligence is programmed just as superficially, with companions who sometimes get stuck in the map (even without running and playing normally) and don't reappear until the next cutscene, or enemies who wander drunk around the areas crashing here and there. Combine these problems with the atrocious gameplay, the very flat cutscenes, the non-existent story and the endlessly drawn levels, and you will get a title that makes listlessness its essence. Sometimes it even seems that its developers have done on purpose to make it so silly, because some solutions adopted really are not explained. And it's a waste, at least from the point of view of graphic talent, because if there is a department that has shown that it can do something in this road accident it is the one dedicated to the game engine. As mentioned, Ghostbusters is not too bad graphically, while never seriously surprising, and at times even manages to be quite inspired from an artistic point of view. Sure, it's not excellently optimized and betrays an interface designed for consoles (we tried the PC version), but you don't really believe you'll find a completely flawless look in this product after reaching the end of the article. .. come on.", "date": "2016-07-15", "grade": "4.0"}
