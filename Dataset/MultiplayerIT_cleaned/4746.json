A phenomenon that for several years seemed to be outdated, thanks to the increase in production costs (which imposes stricter controls on projects in the pipeline) and greater awareness on the part of users. Yet here we are, faced with an action game that technically seems to have come out of a PlayStation 2 and in terms of gameplay has so many problems that it leaves us dumbfounded. Structure Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising, a gym fight sequence In terms of content, Cobra Kai: Dojos Rising offers four different modes, all accessible from the starting screen. The Story mode is the main one and tries to reinterpret the events of the Netflix television series from the point of view of a clumsy and ramshackle scrolling fighting game, giving us the opportunity to tackle the various levels by selecting a martial arts school between Miyagi-Do Karate, Cobra Kai and Eagle Fang Karate. Basically you choose one of the areas of the map unlocked up to that moment, you organize a team made up of four characters (belonging to the faction we selected at the start) and you launch into a series of fights without too many thoughts or narrative insights that are not simple static screens dialogued by the original actors. Cobra Classics instead arises as a scenario mode, with fairly demanding challenges to be faced with different protagonists depending on the situation, while the All Valley Tournament is exactly what one would expect, therefore a sequence of one-on-one clashes in the area of sports competition that fans of Karate Kid should remember well. The equipment is completed by a classic survival mode, in which you try to survive as long as possible against endless waves of enemies, and a jukebox through which you can listen to the many songs that characterize the rich (and in some ways valid) Cobra soundtrack Kai 2: Dojos Rising. Gameplay Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising, All Valley Tournament mode is something really unwatchable If on paper the experience packaged by Flux Games can count on a good number of contents, albeit tainted by an extreme degree of repetitiveness, it is the gameplay that represents the most problematic and approximate aspect of the package. Without bringing up purely technical speeches (yet) we are talking about an extremely obsolete system and spoiled by a lot of flaws. The authors of Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising had no intention of faithfully reproducing what is seen in the series television, and so they stuffed the game with special moves halfway between Kung Fu Panda and Dragon Ball, with elemental effects, fiery kicks, ice barriers, projections of whoever has more, more. Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising, Johnny performs a fiery flying kick The idea in itself is not bad, but the combat system immediately reveals itself as a nightmare of busted collisions, paperwork, incorrect couplings, polygonal interpenetrations, more or less serious glitches and a camera that often and willingly gets stuck where should not. From this point of view, All Valley's Tournament mode represents the apotheosis of ugliness, because all these flaws are brought to the fore and it becomes impossible to ignore them. Unfortunately, the trivial upgrade system and the large number of unlockable characters, so many that the introduction of dojo ~maintenance~ mechanics that also consider the use and ~satisfaction~ of the various fighters, in no way manages to limit these critical issues, frankly unacceptable for a video game in 2022. Technical realization Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising, a fight during the village festival highlights the technical limits of the game As if that weren't enough, on a technical level Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising is unwatchable. The dialogues interpreted by the actors of the television series and some music of the aforementioned soundtrack are saved, indeed quite substantial, but otherwise it seems to be faced with a (ugly) title for PS2 that has taken the longest step of the leg, but the floor was wet and he found himself on the ground in a ruinous crack. The funny thing about this graphics system is that it even allows itself the luxury of slowing down on PS5 as soon as more characters appear on the screen than usual, and in any case it fails to go beyond 30 fps: absolutely resultsridiculous tees for a project carried out in evident bad faith and offered at a completely out of this world price.", "date": "2022-11-17", "grade": "3.0"}
