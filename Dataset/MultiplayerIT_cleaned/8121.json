The answer is obvious and it has been successfully used by a large number of horror film productions, even and above all at a time when technology and the quality of the special effects could not guarantee ~bad guys~ as scary as expected that they were. It's been a long time since the release of the original Alone in the Dark, with its green zombies full of edges, and although even on iOS devices the visual rendering of these pathetic creatures has achieved excellent results (see the captivating The Bowling Dead) , one felt the need for a little freshness, even from an artistic point of view, to give back to the undead their perverse charm, the aura of mystery and the sense of tension that accompanies their laments. So here is that Into the Dead bursts onto the scene by offering us just that, and at the same time giving a jolt to the stale running game genre thanks to a series of original and convincing solutions. Our character is aboard a helicopter during what looks like the classic zombie invasion, but something goes wrong and the vehicle crashes in the middle of the countryside. While we look in disbelief at the burning metal sheets of what could have been our only hope of saving ourselves, the fog envelops us and with it the not too distant sound of chilling moans. What to do in such a situation if not run away? He ran at breakneck speed The Into the Dead control system provides for three possible variants: it is possible to control the run of our alter ego using the accelerometer and therefore tilting the device to the right or left to head in the relative direction; rely on the touch screen by pressing it on the sides to move accordingly, and in the center to use the equipped weapon; or resort to the traditional analog stick, the latter can be positioned both on the left and on the right for left-handed people. The solution that seemed more effective to us is the second one, both in terms of immediacy and precision. As in all games with a survival structure, the new production of PikPok asks us to reach the greatest possible distance during a single ~stint~ without getting caught by a zombie, accompanying our games with many achievements that add a sense of progression to the game. experience and allow us to unlock new weapons. As we run through the meadows, getting dangerously close to cornfields where the undead can hide better or to forests full of trees on which our character can ~bounce~ continuously (the effect is rendered excellently, with the view ~wobbles~ and makes it difficult to perceive the distance from the closest threat well), in fact, we can come into contact with ~green packets~ which contain various types of offensive tools, randomly drawn from the list available at that moment: a handgun, shotgun, chainsaw, and so on, all of which have limited ammo. Downloadable for free, Into the Dead technically stands as a freemium, but in reality it gives virtual money in a very generous way, allowing us to play quietly without ever spending a euro and to achieve respectable results, waiting for the developers to make available two other modes (~massacre~ and ~hardcore~), currently blocked. In terms of graphics and sound, as already mentioned, an excellent camera job was done, capable of giving the zombies a creepy appearance despite its simplicity and the fog creating a great atmosphere.", "date": "2012-12-11", "grade": "8.2"}
