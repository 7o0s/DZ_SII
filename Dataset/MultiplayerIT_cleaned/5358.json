It is one of Square Enix's most ambitious mobile productions, a turn-based RPG developed by a team of veterans of the main series. In short, the ingredients for a Final Fantasy with all the trappings are all there and all that remains is to immerse yourself in the mechanics to understand if the developers have succeeded in their endeavor. Mobius Final Fantasy is a good achievement in the mobile arena, but it is not yet a ~real~ Final Fantasy Many chosen ones, only one name In the prologue of Mobius Final Fantasy the protagonist wakes up in an unknown place, the victim of one of the clichs most loved by developers: amnesia. The only thing he remembers is his name which, coincidentally, coincides with that of the hero of an ancient prophecy, the so-called warrior of light. He is destined to save the planet Palamecia from the clutches of Chaos, but there is a small problem: with him there are many other aspiring heroes, all with the same name and the same right to aspire to an official investiture. How then to determine who is the real one? Simple: those who survive fighting the army of Chaos may have the honor of facing the god of darkness. Unfortunately it is currently impossible to make a complete judgment on the ambitions of the plot, given the episodic nature of the production. In the first two chapters, however, the story proceeds on tracks and in a rather fragmented way, with interlude scenes that are inserted between a long series of fights and another. Here, characters that evoke the first Final Fantasy stand out, such as those of Garland or Princess Sarah, however their roles in the new story are not yet well defined. In between there is also some brief dialogue with some of the secondary characters, but the jokes of a little moogle named Mog or those of the fairy Echo only serve to sketch the personality of the supporting characters and the protagonist. The bland pace and the predictable twist at the end of the second chapter complete the picture of a narrative that is a little below expectations for now, which we hope will improve when we get to the heart of the battle with Chaos. Believe in the heart of the cards Filed a plot that still seems just a simple frame, we come to another aspect that over the months has aroused a lot of expectations around Mobius Final Fantasy: the game system. In fact, the gameplay offers classic RPG mechanics with turn-based combat, complete with summons and special moves. The so-called ~job system~ is also back, that is, that series of specializations that change the protagonist's abilities. However, there is only one character led by the player and his abilities depend mainly on two factors: the enhancement of the equipped specialization and that of his deck of cards. The latter is the most controversial aspect of the production, since it is the cards that determine the progress of the fights. These represent iconic characters and evocations of the series, such as Yuna and Ifrit, or monsters defeated during battles: their role is to offer special attacks or stat boosts, passive bonuses and elemental ~skillseed~, i.e. the semi-skills needed to enhance the different trades. Finally, the attack and defense phases are based on the affinity between opposing elemental pairs, which influence the effectiveness of blows and skills. Everything is very articulated and offers a good strategic depth to the fights, but the developers have decided to also include a random component typical of every card game. Thus, during the fight, small spheres of elemental energy are ~drawn~, useful for activating the special moves of the cards. Together with the bonuses of the fairy Echo, these all too often determine the margin between a victory and a ruinous defeat, effectively nullifying a part of the strategies and the work of building the character. To increase the effectiveness of the cards and their supply of semi-skills, it is then necessary to enhance them through fusion mechanisms that require many resources. The pay-to-win risk is therefore imminent, especially when the alternative is to repeat the same battles over and over again. In fact, the energy necessary for the clashes recharges over time and the very nature of the enemies, which differ little from each other, makes free leveling tedious and repetitive. Finally, not even the technical sector is free from problems in this first phase. The images are sometimes very dirty, even setting the resolution to maximum, while obtaining acceptable fluidity is difficult even for top-of-the-range devicesto. As for the artistic side, the level of detail on the main characters is good, but the scenarios are static, bare and repetitive. Even the effects are minimal and, despite an overall pleasant result, we are still far from what was promised in the pre-launch phase, also due to the momentary absence of the advertised high definition texture pack. Finally, the soundtrack by Mitsuto Suzuki is catchy, accompanied by a good dubbing in English in the interlude scenes (the localization in Italian is completely missing).", "date": "2016-08-08", "grade": "8.3"}
