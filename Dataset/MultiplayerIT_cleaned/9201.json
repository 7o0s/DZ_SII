{"name": "Monster Hunter Rise: la recensione della versione PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-hunter-rise-recensione-pc.html", "text": "In Japan Monster Hunter has always been a cult. Inextricably linked to portable consoles - culturally the most widespread among Japanese gamers - after the monstrous success of Monster Hunter Freedom 3 (here known as Portable 3rd, in fact) the saga is considered in those parts a sort of must have for any hardware ~to journey~, and it is therefore not surprising that Nintendo wanted at all costs to grab an exclusive chapter for Switch ... especially after the explosion of popularity in the West following the excellent World and Iceborne. This peak of notoriety has exceeded -most likely- even the considerable expectations of Capcom: taking advantage of the loss of audience of some well-known online titles and cleverly placing itself in the middle of that exodus, the software house has captured a gigantic fanbase of newbies who have made a series in the past noticed from a few on our shores more mainstream than ever. With the increase in success, however, the expectations of the public also levitate, ever more hungry for news and content; it is therefore a testament to the ability of the current Capcom that Monster Hunter Rise has managed to keep up with these wishes, thanks to a more advanced gameplay than ever and to a technical sector that is nothing short of exceptional if we consider the chosen platform. Today, however, our the intent is not to retrace the success story of Monster Hunter Rise or of the whole saga, but to analyze its placid landing on the tumultuous shores of PC users: an important litmus test both to further consolidate the already highly appreciated RE Engine that drives everything, both to ensure a further expansion of the fanbase after the excellent sales on the Nintendo console. For the review of Monster Hunter Rise for PC we tried the game for a long time, trying to evaluate its technical characteristics properly, and we found ourselves in front of a real optimization gem, even higher than our most optimistic expectations. Let's see why. Structure: the old and the new Monster Hunter Rise: the teostra set always has its why We have already reviewed Monster Hunter Rise on Switch and analyzed its structure, but it is always a good and right thing to brush up on everything. Capcom's latest Monster Hunter is in fact a curious fusion between old and new, which sensitively evolves several elements of the saga, but at the same time detaches itself slightly from what we saw in World and Iceborne to return to a more classic vision of progression . The narrative element is in fact here skin and bones, less integrated with the progression and mainly linked to the Village Quests (although, especially on the final, not exclusively to those). These are mostly cutscenes inserted between one main mission and another, and designed to carry forward a trivial plot that resembles those seen at the dawn of the series. If nothing else, the characters that surround the events are pleasant, however don't think you're in front of a Monster Hunter with a particularly structured story: as always, the heart of the series is the fundamental loop of the gameplay; everything else is decoration. Monster Hunter Rise: A pair central to the game's plot Speaking of the village quests, these return in perhaps even easier form than in the past, and represent a perfect introduction to hunting for those who have not had the opportunity to practice with the previous chapters (or for those who want to quickly get to the more difficult challenges offered by the game). After all, the monsters during these missions have low life points, and any hunter with some experience can complete them under ten minutes each. Finishing the mandatory ones also allows you to unlock special quests with multiple monsters to eliminate that allow you to move to the next level of the ~guild quests~, more similar to the challenge level of past Monster Hunters and necessary to unlock High Ranks later, where it starts in some ways the real game. It is a careful content management, which does not get lost in frills and allows players to approach the adventure at their own pace. Furthermore, it is nice to see how the more boring and backward structures - such as the egg and material recovery quests - have either been largely eliminated or dampened by the changes to the gameplay, for a general experience much more focused on real hunting. Undoubtedly the best choice, given the level reached by the combat system in this chapter. Gameplay Monster Hunter Rise: Wire Bugs offer unprecedented mobility in the series As already mentioned above, the gameplay here is emperor: each chapter is an action of rare mechanical complexity, where the choice of a weapon changes immensely.te approach to battles, the variety of systems is absolutely impressive, and the development of the character is related exclusively to the crafting of his equipment with the pieces of the eliminated monsters. Already World and Iceborne had implemented multiple novelties in all this goodness, significantly speeding up and modernizing the experience (even if not everything had gone down gently to the veterans), yet Rise is perhaps the biggest systemic revolution since then, because not only does it apply a ~customizable~ approach in some ways close to the one seen in Generations with styles, but it significantly expands mobility with the addition of wire bugs: to all intents and purposes the equivalent of charging maneuvers that allow hunters to move freely in the air. Thread bugs are a stratospheric addition that we already talked about in the previous review: they offer a myriad of additional escape and approach options, control of your alter ego never seen before in the series, allow you to recover from the ground instantly, and they even change the basic maneuvers of the weapons used. Yes, because their charges are also consumable for the execution of some special moves, which can be replaced as the game progresses. The connection with Generations lies right here, because these choices lead to the use of styles that are often completely different from the basic one (such as for example for the double blades, which can almost become an aerial weapon, or the hammer, whose charges transform into small chargeable combos that vary the pace altogether). The transition from one fighting style to another is not sudden and immediate as in that chapter, but there is a greater degree of customization that allows you to adapt your weapon in a way that, in our opinion, is even more pleasant to your habits. Monster Hunter Rise: This is not the right time to be facing a Valstrax All in all? Fabulous for anyone who loves complex and well-calculated combat systems, and a sensible step forward that really bodes well for the brand's future. And yes, we are well aware that there were some stumbling blocks this time too: the possibility of riding monsters perhaps excessively facilitates multiple hunts (although not as abusable as the repeating wall stuns seen in Iceborne speedruns), the companions sometimes make the somewhat chaotic clashes (and the Felynes are infinitely more useful than the Canynes, despite the possibility of riding the latter), and the implementation of the Furies - horde phases to be faced in a similar way to tower defense sections, very different from the classic hunts - not everyone liked it, given that this new mode is sometimes badly balanced (too easy in a group, even irritating at times in single); yet it would still be foolish in our opinion to criticize the playability of this Monster Hunter. It is mechanically the highest point of the series, without ifs and buts. If we then calculate the fluidity deriving from the unlocking of the frame rate on PC, things get really sensational at times; on the other hand, a system built around complex movement where the fluidity of dodging and flying attacks are an integral part of almost every battle gains infinite points from precise commands and without any delay in response. Technical compartment: a king of hunting optimization Monster Hunter RISE: A Chameleos, prominently displayed Already on Switch Rise it was a small miracle of optimization, with its all too stable 30 fps and a graphic quality among the best seen on Nintendo's hybrid. On PC, however, the always excellent RE Engine once again finds its natural ecosystem, thanks to a truly high-quality port. We tested the game on a pretty powerful configuration, true, but we never had a hiccup with every option maxed out, high-res textures and unlocked frame-rates. If you decide to keep everything at 60 fps there are no drops, frameskips, or freezes of any kind (very few microscopic scatterelli seen only in the village of Kamura have only happened once, and we have never seen them appear in the maps). Things get even more striking during the exploration of the maps, where with the unlocked frame rate we were constantly traveling above 150 fps regardless of the location, even in the most agitated phases of the battles (Furies included). The fact that the movies are still at 30 fps, however, is a negligible lack to say the least. Even the graphic options available are very respectable, and apart from the ~predictable~ ones it is even possible to set the screen to 21:9 for ultrawide (also usable on normal screens to widen the view, although obviously you have to live with the black bordersi), the vignetting effect, depth of field, motion blur, and even some rather suggestive additional aesthetic filters (including a couple that bring the aesthetics of the game very close to black and white films). Of course, the polygonal models are always the same and the general level of detail is not scary, therefore it is quite obvious that an engine already optimized very well on Nintendo Switch sparks on a good PC; yet, considering certain modern ports that are anything but glitzy, it's really nice to see Capcom once again on the piece with a respectable job. The only real drawback? It is not possible in any way to import the saves from the Switch version, and cross play with players of that platform is not foreseen. So if you want to be ready for Sunbreak, you'll have to do it all over again. At least it won't be the basic version of the game waiting for you: Rise on PC contains all the updates after launch, including the real ending of the game, and you won't lack of things to do in the final stages. Just one note, during the review phase we did not have the opportunity to properly test the stability of the title on the net. We don't think there will be big problems, but it should be emphasized, because flaws can always occur in this field, and the online experience is always an integral part of Monster Hunters.", "date": "2022-01-10", "grade": "9.0"}
