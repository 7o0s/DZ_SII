For this reason, we awaited with interest the second test of the team in the iOS field, and the opportunity has arrived in these days with the release of the here present Supermagical: let's see if the developers have therefore reached the proverbial maturity or if the result is not lived up to their high-sounding appellation... Witch commands color While fully falling within the puzzle game category, Supermagical offers an unusually well-finished narrative sector by the standards of the genre: the protagonist is Nina, a clumsy wizard who inadvertently ends up calling her wicked six sisters and their henchmen back to earth, taking on followed the burden of sending them all back to the confinement dimension they came from. The game is full of textual dialogues and cutscenes that describe the unraveling of a plot that is certainly not unforgettable but still invested with a prominent importance rarely found in these areas. Even the RPG nuances with which the work is imbued are the result of a successful mix of elements of which credit must undoubtedly be given to the developers: therefore, one moves from one level to another on a map from which it is also possible to access to shops useful for stocking up on objects and mini-games thanks to which you can stock up on riches. And that's not all: during the adventure, Nina will come across hats capable of increasing her skills and ingredients to be combined in recipes through which it will be possible to upset the fate of the most difficult battles. In short, it can be said that the attempt to give a more substantial outline than usual to the more conventional puzzle routine has been perfectly successful, without however detracting from the importance or value of the basic mechanics of the game. The latter are inspired by a classic like Puzzle Bubble, shuffling the cards just enough to make the experience engaging and exciting. The user is therefore called to make creatures called Minix disappear from the screen by throwing specimens of the same color at them to form a group of three or more units, using the least possible number of moves to prevent the little monsters from advancing and fleshing out their own line. There are some characteristics that differentiate Supermagical's gameplay from many similar products: first of all, if you manage to separate a handful of Minix from the main group, this will automatically flee, guaranteeing a bonus; then there are particular types of enemies that do not have a color to be combined with, and which therefore must be killed using different strategies; finally, continuing in the adventure, Nina will be able to make use of the help of her sorcerer friends who will intervene in battle by making their peculiar skills available in exchange for a bottle of soda that can be purchased in the shop or obtainable by performing particularly successful combos. Supermagical works like a pleasure, is fun to play and offers a considerable amount of content for the price at which it is offered: it can be argued that it is not very original in its foundations and that it is somewhat naive as regards the control system , but also considering that a multiplayer mode is planned for a future update, it's really hard to complain. Also because from a technical point of view we are faced with an authentic delight, strong in colorful graphics and an excellent soundtrack, which it is no coincidence that the game recommends appreciating through earphones.", "date": "2012-09-05", "grade": "8.6"}
