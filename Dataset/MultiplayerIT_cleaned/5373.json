{"name": "This is the Police", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171971-this-is-the-police-piedipiatti-in-pensione.html", "text": "Jack Boyd is the archetypal anti-hero: bald, paunchy, scratchy voice from years of cigar-drinking. Commander of the Freeburg police district, violent and fictitious theater of the story, sees his life fall apart: a wife who ran off with a Jehovah's Witness and a career abruptly interrupted on the threshold of retirement. Mayor Rogers, colluded with organized crime, has decided to behead the leaders of the police force to make way for trusted men. And so the sixty-year-old Jack has six months of hard work left before his forced leave: 180 days in which he undertakes to raise half a million dollars, as many as he deems enough to pass an honorable old age. The player in This is the Police, an ambitious production by the Belarusian team Weappy initially conceived in tandem with Team 17, whose collaboration was however interrupted last year, obviously plays the policeman in a curious blend between visual novel and management. Two very different genres share the scene equally according to a precise logic: every working day (which corresponds to a game shift) spent at the headquarters coordinating the actions of the subordinates, a recited part alternates in which not only is shed light on Boyd's troubled past and the shady intrigues of corrupt politicians, but where the player continues to have an active part by deciding, based on multiple choice dialogues, which turn to give to the story. In the day of ABZ , another very interesting indie. This is the Police is full of original ideas which, however, are watered down by a certain repetitiveness At the police station... The management part is the main pillar on which Weappy's gaming experience is based, and it is truly complete. Although the ~action~ is limited to a model of the city where to send the patrols, there are many aspects that enrich the daily routine. It starts with two teams of men, who alternate from day to day. Crime runs strong in Freeburg, and at every hour there are numerous calls for the most disparate cases: from the writer who smears the walls of an apartment building, to the robbery of an old lady, through robberies, murders, attacks and so on and so forth. has more to put. Depending on the seriousness of the situation, you can decide which and how many men to send to the scene of the crime - conceptually the game follows the logic of the Assassin's Creed minigame: the higher the level of the cops, the greater the chance of success without no one gets hurt. The fall on the battlefield is a variable to be sadly taken into consideration, and it will be all the more painful the greater the policeman's experience. Not everything is just about the number of successes in the curriculum: each agent has distinctive characteristics that influence their effectiveness in the field, but also the commitment with which they face the job. Always and constantly employing the best resource could be a good idea to be sure of the success of the mission, but in the long run it leads to operator fatigue and consequently invalidates its effectiveness. Juggling human resources is also important to avoid tragic consequences: having used a hard fist against an employee who had gotten drunk the night before, denying him an unjustified day off, caused the policeman in question to enamel himself against a plane tree on the first call, also bringing with him the expert companion we had provided him with (but who would have ever thought that the drunk would actually get behind the wheel?). The effort made by programmers to give each action a consequence is truly commendable, even if the choices that are made do not always go in the desired direction. The player can sometimes play a small but significant part in carrying out the mission: in fact, it can happen that the agents do not know how to behave and therefore ask the superior for directions. In the case of a fight in a night club, for example, it can be decided whether to proceed with a ~noisy~ intervention, by clearing the room and questioning the people involved (a decision that will certainly lead to finding the culprit) or whether to adopt a low profile, to prevent the evening of the other patrons from being completely ruined, with the risk, however, that the case will not be solved. There are also very ~profitable~ decisions: for example, dedicating a couple of very precious resources to controlling the entrances of a cinema (to verify that no one illegally films the premiere of a blockbuster) on the one hand will leave the control unit unguarded with the concrete possibility that far more dangerous criminals get away with it, but on the other hand it will allow the good Boyd to pocket a large ~bribe~ utile to the achievement of the fateful half a million. ...the inspector says: ~What do you want it to be?~ The management of the operations center is not limited to sending the police, but also concerns the investigation cases that are entrusted to the detectives. The latter provide a series of clues that the inspector must put in the correct order to solve the case or at least to give a name to the culprit, even if reality doesn't always follow the most logical track. We also have to deal with hiring and firing, and politics, asking the administration for additional funds to strengthen the workforce or to equip it with more effective tools. One of the major obstacles lies in the coordination of the agents: it often happens that there are several calls at the same time and that there is not enough human material to manage them all in the best possible way. Is it preferable to send all the reinforcements for a single mission, with the hope that the firepower put on the field guarantees excellent chances of victory, or is it perhaps better to select a small number of men to try to buffer as many emergencies as possible? And how to manage the teams? Is it better to support our best man with a rookie or send only the strongest on a mission? For each of these questions there is a precise answer which, however, must be understood by dint of attempts both because the title is very penalizing and hardly allows you to recover from wrong choices, and because the missions are all pre-established, so the path to follow it's almost obligatory. Just to be clear, if two or three men are killed in the very first missions, being able to continue successfully becomes impossible, because it is not possible to process all the calls and the sack will have a much shorter notice than the canonical six months. In this delicate context it is necessary to know how to maintain good relations with the mafia, with local politics, with the church and with the unions: that is, the main players to be milked for our very personal severance pay. Being a policeman in one piece will only lead to the premature end of the game, just as failing to meet the demands of the local administration, such as the forceful repression of a feminist demonstration (against the first lady) will make it impossible to boost one's headquarters, and consequently reach the coveted $500,000. What happened won't stop us (maybe yes) The other side of This is the Police is the narrative part, entrusted to comics and other interesting gimmicks (there are even psycho-aptitude tests to evaluate the commander's sanity) which however have the demerit of putting the player at crossroads the outcome of which is not absolutely clear, with the result that there is a risk of ending the title prematurely. The example given a few lines ago gives an idea: in our first game we had decided not to help the Sand family mafia in any way, denying them any support action and, indeed, interrupting any criminal activity. In doing so, however, we found a bullet stuck in the head at the threshold of the second week, and it was therefore necessary to restart the game. At this point the second of This is the Police's main problems emerges, namely the absolute arbitrariness with which the system sets up automatic saves. By default, the action is recorded at the end of each working day, to allow the player to pick up where he left off. However, if things did not go as desired, there is no possibility of repeating the specific ~wrong~ turn, but you have to go back until you find the first useful placeholder, which could even be several weeks earlier. From a technical point of view, Weappy's choice to simplify the game interface to the extreme, which gained in cleaning but which could have been much more detailed and captivating, was not completely convinced, especially considering that almost all of the title takes place in front of a single screen. The clipart-style graphics of Word, in monochrome colors and vector figures, are in any case very refined, as is the soundtrack, perfectly adhering to the noir dynamics of the title. The work of the artistic direction is further supported by a first-rate English dubbing, with the voices of Duke Nukem (Jon St. John) and Serious Sam (John J. Dick). The rhythms are slow, but all in all they can also be suitable for quick games because, as written, it is jagged in many small shifts. Finally, longevity is high, but above all for those design choices described above which prove to be at least questionable. The robust script, richtinged with twists at every turn, it invites you to repeat the game to see what developments lead to the choices that were initially discarded.", "date": "2016-08-02", "grade": "7.0"}
