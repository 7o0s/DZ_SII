Starting from the game bundled with the console, Wii Sports, to continue with its ~remastered~ version, Wii Sports Resort, passing through a whole series of third-party products which, however, often try to attract a certain audience without offer suitable features. Go Vacation was born precisely with the aim of changing things, of establishing itself as a point of reference for the family game genre, and it tries to offer us a huge tropical island, Kawawii Island, on whose surface beaches and mountains alternate, and which hosts four different resorts: one on the sea, one in the city, one at the foot of the mountains and one located on their snow-capped peaks. Access to the various resorts must be unlocked by successfully completing a certain number of activities: there are twenty for each location, for a total of fifty individual minigames which can then be accessed directly from the start screen, for a quick game and lacks the exploratory element. Already an exploratory element: once we have selected our Mii (or created a character from scratch) and landed on the island of Kawawii, we will be able to move around the map using shortcuts but also and above all explore the scenarios freely, proceeding on foot or using one of the numerous vehicles available: quads, jet skis, horses, skateboards or rollerblades, snowmobiles and more. Welcome to Fantasyland The one proposed by Go Vacation is basically a ~guided tour~, in the sense that the player is suggested activities in sequence that gradually lead him to visit all four resorts, as well as to access new levels of challenge. Each of the fifty minigames can in fact be more or less accessible if it is the first time we face it or we are already returning from a successfully overcome challenge. Let's take for example sky diving, or parachute jumping in formations of four people, called each tot to cling to each other to form a ~pattern~. Well, during the first stint we will simply find ourselves alternating between these figures, holding the Wii-mote horizontally to move the character in the air and using the d-pad to change its angle until it locks; in subsequent attempts, however, ~combos~ will be introduced, i.e. positions to be taken in rapid succession, and so on. We began the analysis of the minigames with one of the weakest and most boring, in fact, but as mentioned, the offer of the Namco Bandai title is quite vast and multifaceted. There's quad racing, in which you have to move the Wii-mote and Nunchuk as if they formed a steering wheel and press the B and Z buttons respectively to accelerate and brake, with even the possibility of taking off jumps if necessary. It is a very nice activity, even if we tend to appreciate its dynamics more during the free exploration of the island rather than within real competitions, given the excessively simple structure of the same. A similar argument can be made for racing on jet skis, with an excellent rendering of the movement of the waves that adds depth to the experience, as well as the many variations that see us use ramps to make jumps and perform spectacular acrobatic maneuvers looking for the high score. The motion detection controls can take advantage of the MotionPlus or even the Balance Board, but the normal controllers already prove to be sufficiently precise and we had no problems trying our hand at all possible sports. The only limit in this sense can be attributed to certain solutions, which are indeed rather uncomfortable: we can mimic the movement of the reins with the Wii-mote and Nunchuk while we are on horseback, but carry out this maneuver while at the same time having to tilt the controllers to ~shoot~ is not the best of life. And the same problem occurs when we skate or skateboard, for example. Carefree fun The ~open world~ nature of Go Vacation in some ways impresses, in others it disappoints. Once our tour guide has shown us the possible next activity, we will see it indicated on the map of the island and we will have to reach it in the way we prefer, for example by getting on board the aforementioned quad bikes or a jet ski. However, this same philosophy is not extended to the many characters who are like us on the island, with whom it is not possible to interact. The doubt is that if it had been a Nintendo title we could have exchanged a few words with the NPCs, perhaps discovering secret missions to complete and things like that. The fact that the developers have not thought about it allin the end it's not a mortal sin, but it would have been the icing on the cake of a structure that is in any case above the average of the genre on the Wii. As for the multiplayer aspects, it is possible to move around the scenario and participate in minigames together with up to three friends in split screen, which can be a lot of fun if we think that the target to which the product refers is clearly that of the youngest. In the same vein, the lack of online multiplayer can also be understood, which however would have been quite handy. Technically, the game boasts a very successful and nice graphic style, with lots of bright colors and with a great design for the characters. A good job has also been done for the locations, which clearly don't shine in detail and definition but offer great landscapes, especially the mountain ones. Finally, the sound sector is chock full of catchy tunes, whistles and effects in line with the holiday atmosphere.", "date": "2011-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
