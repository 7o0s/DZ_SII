When we talk about a title in an embryonic state, which precisely needs funding to see the light, all we can do is get a summary idea of the production and decide if the typology, plot and setting seem interesting enough to make us uncover some money to support the developers. If important names are missing within the software house or if we are talking about a new intellectual property rather than a famous franchise exhumed from the ashes, it is not easy to hit the funding objective with the result that few projects take millions of dollars by going far beyond initial requests and others narrowly fail to see the light. When Thunder Lotus Games debuted on Kickstarter in July last year with Jotun and a request for fifty thousand dollars, the situation could have been similar, but the Canadian team managed to recover all the funds necessary to give life to Thora and to his adventures in the Norse lands, placing himself as a launch window in September 2015 and meeting the deadline. After passing the further greenlight gallows and having received acclaim in the beta phase, Jotun has finally arrived on time in the presence of the fans, but will it really be a small masterpiece? Jotun puts us in the shoes of the Viking warrior Thora in an action adventure with many ups and downs Attack on the Giants Jotun proposes a theme very dear to the videogame world, or the contrast between men and gods, in this case with a Viking theme. The Canadian title tells the story of Thora, a warrior who bears the feminine name of the God of thunder, trained by her father from an early age to wield a double ax and to sail the icy northern seas. However, despite the great experience in navigation, returning from a battle, Thora and his comrades in arms are surprised by a terrible storm that sinks the boat, swallowing all the crew in the depths of the sea, leaving no survivors. When she regains consciousness, the warrior is no longer in her physical body, but not even in Valhalla so coveted by Viking warriors. Now he is a soul forced into Ginnungagap, the cosmic purgatory where those who have yet to earn the favor of the Gods are relegated to finally access paradise. The Ginnungagap is a sort of link between various realms that persist outside of space and time, each of which is governed and protected by semi-divine giants with prodigious powers - the Jotun of the title - which Thora will have to defeat to gain entry in the afterlife. However, to be able to track down the giant and challenge him we will have to go around the two settings that make up each of the five game kingdoms in search of specific runes, challenging enemies and environmental dangers that are anything but trivial. In fact, one of the characteristic features of the Thunder Lotus title is that it is very little permissive and quite demanding especially in the fights against the Jotuns, risking more than once to lead to frustration for game design choices that we are no longer used to lately. Jotun is a very hermetic title, leaving you alone in the middle of the Ginnungagap with a constant feeling of uncertainty about what to do, forcing you to grope through each realm in the hope that you have taken the right path to find the runes. Once in the level we have a stylized map without an indicator that shows the position of the objective, but it's up to us to orient ourselves and above all to discover the other points of interest, such as for example the Fountain of Life which acts as a checkpoint and restores health and powers , or the trees of Idhunn, the guardian of the apples, which with its precious fruits lengthens the bar of vital energy. Rhythm problems In the same way, the fights with the bosses are always challenging: the Jotuns are strong and powerful, capable of knocking us down with a couple of blows, forcing us to start the fight every time. It is necessary to study the attack patterns of each of them very carefully and to deal with the slowness of our virtual alter ego who, due to the cumbersome double ax that he always carries with him, moves rather awkwardly and has only the somersault available to dodge enemy blows. Furthermore, all Jotuns undergo transformations during battles that modify their attacks and increase the pace of the action, with the result that it is very difficult to defeat a boss on the first attempt, either because you have to learn its movements during theclash, you want because we don't have access to healing potions to restore health. The only thing we can do is practice timing in dodging, but let's not hide that more than once with the umpteenth unsuccessful attempt, frustration began to peep out. In this sense, however, Jotun allows you to explore all five kingdoms freely to accumulate new powers to reappear in the presence of the Jotuns not yet defeated, increasing the chances of victory, but obviously the fate of Thora and the genesis of Ginnungagap will be revealed only after defeating them everyone. For example, we can create a copy of Thora thanks to the power of Loki to deceive opponents or enhance the ax with Thor's favor to release powerful electric shocks when we charge the blow. In its simplicity, therefore, the game structure that supports the title is quite valid in the action connotation, but loses a lot in terms of bite once you move on to exploring the various realms. The levels are well characterized both in terms of the aesthetic aspect and for the dangers they hide, but they suffer incredibly from the point of view of the rhythm, flattening the game action for tens of minutes in an aimless wandering in which occasionally let's swing an ax. For example, in the mines we have only sporadically encountered a few hordes of dwarves to be faced with cold weapons and in the volcanic kingdom a handful of enemies scattered here and there. The kingdom of heaven, on the other hand, won us over with its well-thought-out puzzles, albeit of simple resolution, while the snowy one of Niflheimr once again showed its side to a very uninspired design. Despite these critical issues, Jotun remains an incredibly beautiful title to look at and evocative in its atmospheres, a pity that it gets lost precisely in the exploration, the aspect that should have been more valued given the so inspired artistic direction. The pastel colors and the soft music accompany us in the sterile wandering between the realms, inevitably leaving us with the feeling that Jotun has not fully expressed all its promising potential.", "date": "2015-09-30", "grade": "7.0"}
