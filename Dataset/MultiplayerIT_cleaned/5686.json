But after all, I often tell everyone that that cross without justice that was my asylum has only revealed me the great power of life~ Alda Merini The Town of Light takes us into the drama of asylums, where lives were raped and erased Folly It's not the first time a video game has tackled the subject of insanity, and it probably won't be the last. It's not even the first time we've found ourselves walking the corridors and rooms of a mental asylum, and even in this case it's difficult to say that there won't be more. The place where the ~crazy~ were segregated and treated and fear, with subsequent attempts to destroy or understand their state, are part of human culture: they fascinate and terrify the ~normal~ with a force that few would be able to explain. Typically, however, video games have limited themselves to exorcising madness. They have shown it, of course, but they have also deprived it of its natural dimension, transfiguring it into frescoes full of conventional symbols, as fascinating as they are dehumanizing in their own way. Many authors limited themselves to staging madness, starting from a highly individualistic point of view, as if they wanted to describe it from within; almost as if it were a way to psychoanalyze themselves and tell their story, rather than to give a general view of the subject. Mind you that this is not a criticism, but an observation. What sensitive human being hasn't felt somewhat insane? And how better to represent this inevitable state, if not resorting to a strong representation, which takes account of the suffering one is undergoing? So madness and asylums have easily become places of horror, where the unspeakable happens (Sanitarium, Outlast); or they have been used as an allegory of a looming and incurable despair (Dear Esther), but always focused on the individual and his struggle to maintain his sanity. The Town of Light takes a step forward and inevitably presents itself as a clear break with what has been seen so far, while apparently respecting some canons of the tale of madness. A historical truth As we were able to say in the preview phase, of which many of the considerations made are still valid, the first work of LKA.it starts from reality to tell a drama that was above all social and historical. The story told in the game is that of a certain Rene, hospitalized for years in the former asylum of Volterra, who returns to the place where she was deprived of her life as a girl, trying to reconstruct what happened to her together with the player. The facts of the game take place in the present, but Rene's story dates back to the 1930s, in the midst of Fascism. It is a journey that gradually becomes more and more dramatic and that directly involves us in the role of ~conscience~ of the woman (from time to time we will have to choose from a series of answers to give to her questions, partially influencing the events and unlocking some contents). From the outset, Rene's story is superimposed on another, which is that of the asylum itself as an institution. The place is in ruins, both physically and morally, but still shows the rationality and strong sense of helplessness that was behind the inhumane treatment that was meted out to the patients. Wandering through the rooms and solving the simple environmental puzzles that are proposed to us (we will talk about them later) we come into contact not only with the life of a person, but also with the functioning of the asylum machine which was simply not able to understand it and take care of it as it would have claimed to do, but only to contain it and exclude it from the sight of society with a violence that is all the more desperate, as often dictated by operational needs (short staff, insufficient space to contain all the guests and so on) or by the emergence of the bestial nature of those who were supposed to help her, but who often turned out to be just tormentors frustrated by the situation (and probably by their own life). Electroshock Now, it would be really interesting to examine the whole story of Rene with all its implications, because only in this way could we really realize how much we liked The Town of Light, and how the ending, with an unheard-of visual and dramatic strength, involved and upset us, to the point that we wanted to start from there to tell you about the game. In truth there are many very successful sequences, told a bit by non-interactive scenes, created with the graphics engine (Unity, for the record), a bit by beautiful drawings made by the artists of the studio. It is also true that many couldfind it inconvenient to find the whole story in the review, so let's avoid, trying to stay generic, as we have done so far. Just know that the script of The Town of Light has no problems showing Rene from every point of view, including sexuality, but at the same time it never becomes gratuitous or out of place, not even when it forces the player to suffer the same violence suffered by the lass. There are moments so strong that you almost want to look away from the monitor; moments that are never accompanied by some form of consolation, a fact that makes them even more visceral in their exclusion of any escape route for the user. In this The Town of Light is incredibly ruthless, because it offers no absolution and because it transforms Rene's only positive memory into a kind of delirious ghost, also taking away from her that only foothold she had left. It's not wrong to say that nothing like this has ever been seen in a video game. Supervise and punish In terms of mechanics, the title of LKA.it offers nothing too complex. The few puzzles present are not designed to block the player (it would be a contradiction in this case), but to make him participate in the search for Rene. For example, in one of the initial chapters you have to drag a wheelchair to a certain point in the asylum, while in another, more advanced one, you have to be able to get water to flow into a bathroom by turning knobs. It is often Rene who suggests what to do and, in the unlikely event that we get stuck, we can always press a key to talk to her and get a suggestion. The focus of The Town of Light, however, is not the puzzles, but the exploration. The excellent reconstruction of the asylum makes it a pleasure just to observe the degradation of the various environments, but in reality there is another reason to do research. The developers have in fact done a great job of documentation, putting many period artifacts into play, such as real documents and objects that were actually used by doctors and nurses. Again, these are not free additions, but a way to fully enter the story. Some documents then, even if not essential to move forward, serve to better contextualize what happened and to refute other documents concerning Rene's life, in a remarkable game of references that removes any certainty about what is true and what is false. For example, let's mention the diary of a psychiatrist, which shows how his initial enthusiasm for the work he has achieved, with which he wants to try to improve the lives of patients and put what he has studied into practice, turns into impotence in the face of malfunctioning of the asylum, which ends up transforming him into a bureaucrat called only to ratify documents with his signature, to do what the power deems most convenient. From a technical point of view, the work of the LKA.it guys is really excellent. As already mentioned several times, the asylum was rebuilt with painstaking care (go and visit the real one after playing to realize it) and walking around it seems like a truly lived-in place, of which it almost seems you can smell the smells of the time coming out of the walls and from the rubble. Also spectacular is the inclusion of some murals (they also exist in the actual asylum), which look like spirits imprisoned in the walls. The highly sought-after soundtrack deserves particular applause, which does not just accompany the viewer, but helps him immerse himself in Rene's story, accompanying her emotional states with a crescendo of sounds that end up exploding in the finale.", "date": "2016-02-25", "grade": "9.0"}
