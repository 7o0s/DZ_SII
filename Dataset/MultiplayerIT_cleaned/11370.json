{"name": "Fifa 08 N-Gage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-08-n-gage.html", "text": "Once upon a time there was N-Gage, a mobile phone/portable console hybrid made by Nokia that managed to survive very little, crushed by the superior play quality of Nintendo's handhelds and the victim of serious design errors. But for the Finnish house N-Gage it was a start, an experiment that allowed them to gain experience to then be instilled in a more convinced and balanced ~second attempt~. Today with the brand in question, which has been kept intact, it is therefore no longer defined as a single terminal, but a platform compatible with various Nokia mobile phones, and which is taking its first steps in these days. Among the games of the launch there is also Fifa 08, an ad hoc edition of the famous EA brand created especially for the occasion. And in fact the differences between this N-Gage version and the one for ~normal~ mobile phones are evident right from the start, with a quantity of modes available that are certainly closer to those that characterize real console games. And so between quick matches, tournaments, cups and scenarios, there is no shortage of irons in the fire for every fan, further strengthened by the large amount of teams available with lots of official licenses (even if the squads are far from updated at the last minute ). Absent however any multiplayer option, both locally via bluetooth and online; the only disappointing possibility of interaction with the community is linked to the sending of one's career statistics. But it is certainly the technical and playful component that marks the distance between what the Nokia platform is capable of compared to traditional phones. Obviously 3d has been adopted, with a more than fair amount of polygons that makes a good impression especially during normal action and therefore with a remote camera; on the occasion of the replays, however, we realize that we are in any case roughly around the polygonal qualities of a Nintendo DS, which in reality, considering that we are talking about cell phones, is not bad at all. Above all, the discreet frame rate and the good variety of animations allow Fifa 08 to stand out and make a pleasant figure from a purely aesthetic point of view. The positive notes then continue with regard to pure and simple playability, able to offer a fairly rich and robust experience; the actions available to the player are different and such as to allow for the construction of sufficiently articulated and varied actions, in a way not too dissimilar from what can be appreciated on home consoles. Unfortunately, however, once again we are forced to bring the limits of a mobile game not strictly to its own demerits, but rather to the poverty of the interface of practically 99% of the terminals present on the market today. It is in fact impossible to conceive a satisfying and complete experience in a dynamic game like Fifa 08 if it has to rely on numeric keys or uncomfortable and inaccurate directional crosses evidently not designed to support video games. On the Nokia N81 used by us it is practically impossible to think of dribbling, and very difficult to make the athlete follow a diagonal direction. A real pity, which, however, added to the poor artificial intelligence especially of the goalkeepers, greatly reduces the appeal and the final value of the Electronic Arts effort. We are therefore impatiently waiting to be able to witness the necessary birth of new mobile phones capable of truly supporting the gaming experiences at the interface level that by now the pure and simple technical component can amply offer. PRO Technically very good Large variety of actions available Packed with teams and modes AGAINST Playing it with number keys is demeaning No multiplayer mode Revisable artificial intelligence", "date": "2008-06-12", "grade": "S.V."}
