A long time has passed... ah no, in fact, it hasn't been long since the last iteration of the ~official~ series, that Pokmon Platinum which, as per tradition, served as an appendix to the previously released Diamond and Pearl versions. As if the canonical extra episode per couple weren't enough, lately Nintendo has also taken a liking to it with remakes, a trend that began a couple of years ago with the Fire Red and Leaf Green versions, which re-proposed today's players with the adventure that began earlier of ten years ago with the Blue, Red and Yellow versions, naturally updated to the so-called fourth generation of the series with the mechanics already seen in Diamond and Pearl. This little path of memories takes us straight to the new proposal of 2010, SoulSilver and HeartGold, remakes of the Silver and Gold versions of 1999. Really important remakes, and you will find out why by continuing to read. Return to Johto The Silver and Gold versions of Pokmon are generally considered by fans and critics to be the best in the franchise. One of the reasons is certainly the fond memory of that excursion into the world of pokmon, for the first time in color on the Game Boy Color screens, with features that were practically innovative at the time and which made it a small blockbuster in the varied portable toy library of the late 90s. It is therefore natural that the expectations towards this release are very high. We want to be blunt right now: HeartGold and SoulSilver are almost a finishing point for the franchise and in a way it would be significant if the circle were closed like this. The new combination born from Game Freaks is essentially a summation of the most convincing and acclaimed features of the series, combined with the setting and the key elements of the two historic original episodes. The story is always the same: as a young pokmon trainer you will have to embark on a journey to confront the gym leaders of the Johto region, capturing new creatures to train. And since there can't be an adventure worthy of the name without an antagonist, in this case the player will have to thwart the conquest plans of the evil Team Rocket, coming to discover the secrets of some legendary pokmon and revered as gods. As usual, the plot is extremely simple, a real pretext to immerse the player in a colorful and extravagant world, which manages to give real addiction: collecting them all will soon be the real goal, exploration becomes a continuous surprise and the fights random a means necessary to become the best, those who have more pokmon, more medals, more levels and even more patience. SoulSilver and HeartGold therefore offer the already surprising contents in 1999, enriched by those mechanics that have evolved over the course of ten years, from episode to episode, until they become practically stagnant. But let's be honest: what we have in front of us is nothing more than a version of Silver and Gold reworked with the look of Diamond and Pearl. An enjoyable look that certainly doesn't leave you speechless: the world of Pokmon is a mix of two-dimensional sprites and simple 3D structures, colorful and detailed but certainly not the top of the Nintendo DS capabilities. Mind you, the sprites of the little creatures in combat continue to remain practically motionless. And the sound effects? The verses of the pokmon remained the 8-bit ones of the first generation, unbearable and annoying screeching. But those who buy Pokmon certainly don't do it for the technique. And SoulSilver and HeartGold are a real treasure trove of gameplay. Everything and more The structure remains the same: capture pokmon, upgrade them by making them fight and then assemble a team and go black with that of the opponent on duty. The progression from area to area is gradual, our pokmon have access to skills that allow us to cross some environmental obstacles and continue our exploration of Johto, reaching new areas and cities to fight again. It's still. The combat system remains the same as always, based on the rock-paper-scissors rules extended to the multitude of elements to which the little monsters belong: fire, water, grass, lightning and so on. Pokemon evolve by leveling up or under certain conditions, new skills are learned and others are forgotten, the game gradually becomes more and more complex and careful planning is needed to win in the final stages. But HeartGold and SoulSilver are never frustrating and Game Freaks has managed to re-propose the development of the adventure by balancing it around the features of the fourth generation, such as pair battles or pokmon at elmultiple element. In short, already seen and already done, what is the point of returning to Johto? It makes sense because HeartGold and SoulSilver are probably the longest running cartridges in the franchise's long history. The amount of content on offer is simply appalling. Not only do the two games contain the settings, the pokmon and the history of the Gold and Silver versions: Game Freaks has also thrown into the cauldron the features of the Crystal edition which was complementary to the two original episodes at the beginning of the millennium, such as for example the quest related to the legendary Suicune, expertly integrated into the new adventure. In fact, limiting HeartGold and SoulSilver to simply defeating the starting eight Gym Leaders would be wrong, as the player will have the option to return to the original Kanto region to capture new creatures and beat new opponents. There are also numerous secret pokmon to obtain, taken from all the episodes of the series, from Mewtwo to Rayquaza, which will put a strain on the patience of the most tenacious players, giving enormous satisfaction in return. The daily events based on the calendar also return, abandoned right in the days of Gold and Silver, and now reintegrated to offer greater situational variety, also guaranteed by the numerous mini-games inserted to pass the time between one battle and another: it stands out above all the Pokecathlon, a series of hilarious mini-games to play using the stylus together with three of our pokmon, up for grabs rich prizes and cotillons. That's all? No way. How do I sell you the remake At this point it is quite clear that HeartGold and SoulSilver offer so much stuff to literally drive the fan of the series crazy. Yet, herein lies the dilemma: there's really nothing new in HeartGold and SoulSilver to recommend the purchase to those who have regularly chewed each new generation of the franchise from 1999 to today. Those who have already completed their PokDex ten years ago but also those who have known the series after Silver and Gold will certainly find these remakes worthy of interest and probably even better than Diamond and Pearl, but there is nothing really new that makes them essential . Apart from the Pokwalker, of course. In fact, in the game package you will find a small accessory similar to a Tamagotchi: the player can transfer the data of a pokmon to the memory of this peripheral via infrared, and then simply take it with him and let the pokmon ~follow~ us in our daily life. An internal pedometer will count our steps, making the pokmon on duty gain experience, and even allowing us to capture new pokmon. It will take just a few moments to transfer our walk to the Nintendo DS: the mechanics are extremely basic, yet it is a small touch of class that makes the experience decidedly interactive and engaging, thanks also to the downloadable ~paths~ that expand the possibilities of this simple accessory . It's a bit like carrying a Cyndaquil or a Totodile when we go shopping or jogging, a bit like that Pokmon Yellow feature, taken up in HeartGold and SoulSilver, which allows us to view the sprite of our pokmon team favorite, out of its Pokball, just like in the cartoon. And speaking of interactivity, we can only close this review with a nod to the Internet component of Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver: nothing new under the sun, actually, given that exactly as in Pokmon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum it will be possible to connect to the Internet or locally to exchange pokmon and make them fight with friends and strangers.", "date": "2010-04-07", "grade": "8.8"}
