If this title had come out years ago, when the independent market was still in its infancy, we are sure that Bojan Brbora wouldn't even have had the courage to produce but above all to offer his experiment in digital delivery for 4. But today, accustomed by the indie tsunami to swallowing any morsel, from the bitterest to the tastiest, we have become accustomed to very low-budget productions, which, like a tribute to modern art, often base their ambitions solely on minimalism and visionary essence. This universe can reserve very pleasant surprises such as heavy disappointments, and 4PM is such an experimental work that judging it with rational criteria one cannot fail to label it as a failure. If we were to rely on what the product has left us, the feedback certainly couldn't be less flattering. The stories and backgrounds of independent developers who put their heart and soul into making what they have in mind alternate, are an extremely labile qualitative boundary, a territory in which, however, one must have the courage to reject if necessary, even at front of the humblest creative background in which the creator - as in this case - is only one man; it would be disrespectful to applaud a poor narrative frame like 4PM solely because of the heroic indie label attached to the production. There is no posterity that holds: Bojan Brbora's ludic proposal seems only a grotesque joke bordering on the embarrassing. Even with ambitions, 4PM is a gaming failure in almost every way Snack experience The story of 4PM unfolds along 4 main environments, which will lead us to experience the story of Caroline, the protagonist, from 11AM to 4PM. However, we will reveal a secret to you: the complete arc of the game lasts just over 20 minutes. Short, just long enough to boil the water and cook the pasta, but at least intense, right? No, completely the opposite. The promise of enjoying an articulated narrative had been waved several times in the presale phase, but what was put on the plate is a poor narrative sector, also thanks to a cheap, poorly managed and decidedly insufficient direction by any standard, and not just modern. Perhaps inexperience, perhaps the desire to rise above one's potential, the fact is that in 4PM there is very little that works. Let's start with the controls: cumbersome, cumbersome, completely unrealistic: the developer will certainly have wanted to experience the sensation of mental and physical chaos of the protagonist, a chronic alcoholic, but the consequence is an excessive accentuation that incredibly weighs down every step, with the only result which seems to move a Shinji Mikami zombie instead of a healthy girl. The point-and-click part is badly programmed, with a frustrating pointer-to-target collision study, but don't worry: if nothing else, a few clicks will be enough to take you to the end. Visually - compared to the general average - the title shows some hints of quality in the modeling of a couple of objects in the final, but overall what is proposed is absolutely insufficient: flat textures, environment and character design a dozen years old, animations unreal. The only really active phase - the escape from the office - is marred by an absolute poverty of gameplay, a sequence that flows with such a playful superficiality that it is right to ask: why insert it? The dubbing is the only point above the sufficiency, but it is not enough to justify a story with some interesting ideas but too concise from the few minutes of the game duration. In the three endings, which can be unlocked in a matter of seconds, by compressing everything into the final lines of dialogue, Bojan Brbora just has time to hastily tell us what happened, and then leaves us in the credits with a huge question mark in our head: really the experiment unsuccessful that we have experienced is sold for 4 euros?", "date": "2014-07-14", "grade": "3.0"}
