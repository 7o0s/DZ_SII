{"name": "Infinite Golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186413-infinite-mini-golf-larte-dello-zen-in-infinite-golf.html", "text": "Mini golf is undoubtedly one of those activities that can transform man into a beast. Behind the calm of the putt, the creativity of some holes and the atmosphere designed for the little ones hides a sadistic and ruthless game in which we are only one wrong shot away from the worst version of ourselves. Seriously, both golf and minigolf are based on the same principle of maintaining Olympic calm and iron concentration so as to give the ball the right thrust and angle to reach the hole in the least possible number of strokes. The problem is that we have to maintain this state even when the shot has gone wrong, otherwise the situation plunges into a spiral of frustration from which it is difficult to get out. Those who played Neo Turf Masters on the Neo Geo knew it and those who play Infinite Minigolf will soon find out, a title released about a year ago on Steam and soon available on Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One complete with compatibility with PlayStation VR then adds much, if not a closer point of view. Houses, monsters and Christmas Infinite Golf is the classic minigolf arcade game that is always a pleasure to keep in one's collection and show off at the right time, or when there are some friends at home to challenge each other to the last shot. If you want, you can play alone against the computer, against friends and online. It is also possible to compete in a series of courses divided into three main settings: a house, Halloween and Christmas. If that's not enough for you, the game will soon be populated with thousands of user-created content and if that's still not enough, you can always create your own. The game editor is extremely simple, but it will allow you to create an infinite number of holes, relying on crossroads, obstacles, boosters, loopholes, ramps and traps. The only constraint for those who create a course is obviously to go into the hole at least once, to demonstrate its feasibility. The huge number of courses is undoubtedly one of the most important strengths of Infinite Golf, but if you really prefer to play only on those created by the developers, you would still have several hours full of increasingly intricate and complex courses available. The objective of the game is obviously only one: to make the hole in the least possible number of strokes. However there are bonuses that will allow you to increase and multiply your score. For example, blue spheres and a purple diamond are scattered along the track which will award additional points, hitting one will double the final figure, and finishing in a short time will further increase your chances of staying in the lead. Does minigolf protect you from the minicold? If desired, we can customize our alter ego by choosing gender, hair, shoes, pants, belt, shirt or jacket, color of the bat and ball. Some items will be unlocked simply by completing the single player campaign or by winning online tournaments, others can be purchased using some cards that we will get after our victories. There are various types of cards, divided by each type of object that we can buy and that we can only spend in that category. Therefore, the ~pants~ cards are only for trousers, ditto the belt cards and so on. Infinite Golf also provides a series of achievements that aim to discover the game in all its parts and that increase our level and consequently the objects that we can unlock. Others, on the other hand, are the objects that we will find in racing and that we will have to exploit to squeeze the most out of a track. There is the magnet, which attracts nearby bonuses, the rocket, which gives a small speed boost, the glue, which allows us to stop the ball in place, the spring to jump and we can even use the remote control, which will allow us to guide the course of the ball for a few precious seconds. Some tracks also provide for the presence of special characters who, if hit, will ensure that the ball is directed towards the hole. Perfect for making ~Hole in One~, a little less if you are looking for the maximum score. Visually Infinite Minigolf does what it has to do, it's colorful, cute and cartoonish, while the physics forgive mistakes, but without exaggerating, so it's a title suitable for every type of player, with an eye to the little ones. If you want to be picky, the character editor is a bit reminiscent of The Sims. In short, we are faced with the classic cute mid-ranking game that perhaps will give its best on Switch.", "date": "2017-07-25", "grade": "7.8"}
