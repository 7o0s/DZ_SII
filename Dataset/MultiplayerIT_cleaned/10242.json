The Wii Remote, we have seen it on many occasions by now, can become an infinite number of different things depending on the situation: from various tools to sports accessories to lethal weapons. However, one of its most widespread applications, despite the revolutionary concepts that motion sensors should also entail, is the simple replacement of the good old mouse. The ability to move a pointer to a distance with short wrist movements resolves in the blink of an eye the historic question on the inadequacy of controllers (and consequently of consoles) when faced with particular genres, such as graphic adventures, also allowing construction of games particularly suitable to be enjoyed with a few simple gestures and short presses of the buttons. So here is a simple yet addictive idea: it involves finding a certain number of objects hidden within fixed screens within a given time limit, hovering over them with the pointer and pressing the A key, while with the B key it is possible to carry out a localized zoom to the area that we are crossing with the cursor. Apart from the possibility of interacting with some objects present within the various screens - which allows for example to open chests, barrels, doors and various pieces of furniture to reveal any hidden objects - there is practically nothing else to do in The Mystery of Whiterock Castle. So it is a title that borrows the typical principle of pointing and clicking and object hunting to build its entire structure on top of it, revealing itself as a real skill game based on speed in seeing and recognizing the elements present on the screen. The concept appeals to everyone at first in its sheer simplicity, but it certainly has a greater appeal to younger children - provided they know how to use the Wii Remote with some precision, of course. Sharpen your vision The story of The Mystery of Whiterock Castle is based on the good old immortal canvas: the protagonist is the simple boy of the castle who decides to go in search of the missing princess. Trying to gather clues about her whereabouts, the player is forced to help various characters living in Whiterock by answering their questions and thus advancing from level to level until the discovery of the beloved princess. The levels are made up of simple fixed screens in which we have to find a certain number of objects within a certain time limit (variable elements based on the chosen difficulty level). One of the peculiarities of the game is that of proposing a minimum of variation for each game by randomly changing the objects to search for and their arrangement within the screens, in order to create diversions at each game, given that we are forced to starting from the first level at the beginning of each session. Obviously, the more we go on, the more difficult things will become, with increasingly smaller objects camouflaged with the surrounding environment as well as ~environmental~ obstacles such as darkness, which forces us to use a torch and therefore to illuminate only a small portion of screen at a time. Furthermore, to avoid that you start pressing randomly on the whole screen, the developers have seen fit to insert a scoring system that increases with the discovery of objects (also triggering multipliers in case they are at a close distance on the other) and decreases if you ~click~ on the wrong objects. After the first rather simple levels, things actually start to get challenging and the threat of having to start over greatly increases the level of challenge even for the most experienced players. On the aesthetic side, the good workmanship of the fairytale-style screens and the medieval music do everything to immerse us in the dreamy atmosphere of the game. Comment Simple but always valid idea Random level changes Beautiful fairytale atmosphere It's all about pointing and clicking Price not high but not low either Boring in the long run", "date": "2010-01-20", "grade": null}
