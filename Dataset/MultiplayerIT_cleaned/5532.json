Dear Nintendo, if you read us we would like you to understand once and for all that a week of time is not enough to sift through RPGs that last forty hours, if that's okay. Our sanity is at stake. Thank you. That said, with bleeding eyes and Legacy credits rolling across the screen of the Nintendo 3DS still on, we remind you that the new Fire Emblem will arrive on shelves in two versions: in the dedicated box we explain exactly how things are with the cartridges and downloadable content; in the meantime, know that we played the two titles alternating the chapters of Legacy and Conquest, proceeding hand in hand in order to grasp the substantial differences. There is a lot of confusion around this double/triple appointment with the Intelligent Systems strategic saga, and there will probably be even more when our review of the Revelation version arrives in exactly one week, but in reality it's all very simple and yes summed up in a simple statement: Pokmon has nothing to do with it. The two Fire Emblem Fates are outstanding strategy RPGs, but they disappoint on the story front #teamHoshido #teamNohr Fire Emblem Fates is certainly not the first game after Pokmon to come out in two versions, and among its more or less illustrious predecessors we almost always find titles for Nintendo consoles such as Mega Man Battle Network, Inazuma Eleven or, more recently, the sequels of Yo-kai Watch still unreleased in the West. It is normal to compare this strange experiment to the Game Freak franchise precisely because of its popularity, but in reality that of Intelligent Systems is a completely different proposal: the two Fire Emblem Fates only share the prologue, consisting of the first six chapters, and then take totally separate streets depending on the version chosen. On balance, however, we have to admit that the maneuver of the Japanese developer has not borne the desired results in terms of narration, but let's go in order: whatever Fire Emblem Fates is purchased, we always put ourselves in the role of Corrin, prince of Nohr and son of the unmistakably evil King Garon. Unlike his father, Corrin has a kind soul, and it will be his nature to get him into trouble when the sovereign entrusts him with a difficult mission. The situation, however, will take an even more dramatic turn when Corrin discovers that he was only adopted by the Nohr: his real brothers are his alleged sworn enemies, the Hoshido, and our hero will have to decide which of the two families to side with. This decision is at the heart of Fire Emblem Fates and the game will make it for you if you have purchased one of the two versions individually; if you have bought the limited edition, boxed or digital, you will be able to decide the path to follow and possibly restart the game from the beginning or from the prologue and follow another path. Whatever your choice, Fire Emblem Fates stands out from the canonical ~double version~ titles such as Pokmon, precisely, because the structure changes almost completely. And we are not talking about simple details or alternative dialogues, but about totally different storylines that justify the more apt original Japanese subtitle, If. It is an absolutely brilliant solution, from many points of view, which guarantees two fundamentally different stories instead of forcing the player to retrace the same steps as happens in many similar productions. The problem is another, however, and that is that both scripts are quite disappointing. The blame falls above all on the shoulders of the knee-deep dialogues and on those of the characters, real walking stereotypes of Japanese animation. From a Fire Emblem we certainly don't expect Shakespearean jokes or Breaking Bad plots, but compared to Awakening the writers of Intelligent Systems have taken huge steps backwards. All things considered, the two parallel/alternative events are intriguing: in Legacy we have the Hoshido trying to defeat the enemy empire to curb Garon's ambitions; in Conquest, however, Corrin leads a war on two fronts, against his real brothers and against his adoptive father, in an attempt to win the battle and overturn the cruel philosophy on which the kingdom of Nohr is founded. The various protagonists, however, are far from memorable. Corrin's brothers and sisters, whether related or not, respectslook for the usual clichs: the possessive goth-loli, the shy and awkward young girl, the suspicious and impulsive handsome, the energetic tsundere, the firstborn in one piece and so on. Obviously the reference version allows you to get to know them better through their interventions in the narrative, relegating the members of the enemy family to the uncomfortable positions of bosses and minor extras. The Italian adaptation probably tries to cushion the superficiality of some situations and certain dialogues that sometimes appeared so stupid as to be almost offensive, and the meeting with the old wise man of the Temple of the Seven Rooms in the Legacy version is a shining example of this , but unfortunately he can hardly do it, thanks to the excessively youthful linguistic register that somewhat demeans the epic and fantasy atmosphere of the franchise. If anything, it's the slip-ups in terms of consistency that really annoyed us. If in Awakening the second generation of protagonists had a precise sense for the purposes of the narrative, in Fire Emblem Fates the children of the characters were evidently forcibly wedged as a simple gameplay option: a concise message warns us of their birth when two heroes get married, but the children recruited - moreover through a narrative device bordering on the ridiculous - have practically no weight in the screenplay, almost as if they didn't even exist. Even worse, in some cases Corrin can even marry her own sisters (or brothers, in case she changed her gender at the beginning of the game) anticipating an important detail of the Revelation version, but in the default story dialogues, later , your wife or husband will continue to address you as a brother or sister! To recap... Let's clarify once and for all. Fire Emblem Fates will arrive on your physical or digital shelves in two versions, one subtitled Legacy and another subtitled Conquest: in the first, the protagonist Corrin sides with the Hoshido family, while in the second he fights for the Nohr family. The decisive moment occurs at the end of chapter 6, after which an option will appear in the main menu that allows you to purchase the alternative version via digital download and at half price. Later, from the same menu it will also be possible to buy the Revelation chapter at the same price, which we will review in a few days and which represents a middle ground both in terms of story and gameplay: in Revelation, in fact, Corrin remains neutral, and the plot takes a completely different turn. In any case, it's best to play at least one of the two versions first to better understand some details of Revelation that would otherwise remain rather confusing. It's a matter of Fates As you may have guessed, the textures of the Conquest and Legacy versions of Fire Emblem Fates didn't particularly excite us, but it wouldn't be fair to omit the fact that they still managed to deliver some pretty good twists, especially from mid-game onwards, with the edition dedicated to the Nohr faction significantly more complex from the point of view of the narrative plot. Despite this, every fan of the series knows very well that the real protagonist has always been the gameplay, and in this sense Fire Emblem Fates not only lives up to its name but clearly surpasses its predecessors. The latest effort by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo is perhaps the most complete and layered, and the much-reviled gimmick of the two versions has managed to guarantee a variety and a level of customization that is truly over the top. The differences between the two games, in fact, are not limited to the development of the individual plots, but also to the structure of the experience itself, more similar to that of Awakening in the case of Retaggio and more faithful to tradition in the case of Conquista. First of all, it must be emphasized that Fire Emblem Fates revolutionizes the foundations on which the series has been based for years, introducing innovations that initially may seem marginal, but which from a strategic point of view turn out to be simply colossal. While still relying on the ~pencil paper~ of weapons, in which the sword wins over the axe, the ax over the spear and the spear over the sword, the new Fire Emblem also integrates spells, bows and the brand new hidden weapons, i.e. shurikens and throwing knives, greatly expanding the player's possibilities and limiting the influence of chance. In short, the Japanese developer has filed practically every corner to balance the experience perfectly, and so the weapons are no longer consumed, but the more powerful ones temporarily reduce the statistics of the characters who wield them. And it is precisely from this point of view that the guys from Intelligent Systems have also tweaked the grid positioning system, giving the player greater control over paired actions: now adjacent units always strike together while those positioned in the same square protect the unit from enemy attacks or counterattacks. Although it may seem that these innovations oversimplify the action, we must always keep in mind that enemies can also take advantage of them, which translates into an even greater stratification of the combat system if we also consider the skills that the characters learn by increasing level, which can be passed on to their children and which allow for the development of even more sophisticated synergy tactics than in the past. The possibilities are countless, in other words, but this does not mean that we should despair after dozens of figures, percentages and parameters, and it is precisely from this point of view that the subdivision into versions of Fire Emblem Fates gives its best . The two editions allow you to set the level of difficulty and the permanent death of the characters, guaranteeing a fair amount of freedom in customizing the game; however, it is precisely the two separate paths that offer almost completely different experiences, and not only in the formation of the army which, inevitably, differs in the Conquest version from the one we can recruit in Legacy. The path of the Hoshido has been designed for new players approaching the series for the first time and who perhaps have never tried the previous Awakening: it is generally easier, the objectives of the missions are very direct and the structure of the maps is very more linear than in Conquest. Furthermore, between one main mission and another it is possible to face not only the secondary and optional ones, but also the enemies that appear on the world map completely at random, allowing us to gain experience and resources at will. In short, if a mission is too difficult, you can always level up and try again with brute force. In Conquista, on the other hand, it is not possible to take advantage of this feature: money is limited, seals to promote classes as well, and the player must immediately decide which characters to improve and take with him on missions, because he may not have the opportunity to train them until it's too late. Conquest's missions are also more complex, often featuring multiple and imaginative objectives compared to Legacy's; in this sense, between the two versions, Conquest is certainly the one that gives the most satisfaction but also the one that risks being more frustrating, especially if you play by setting the permanent death of the units as tradition dictates. Fortunately, it is possible to save at any time during the fights, although to reload the game after losing a character - a fairly common practice, in fact - it is necessary to restart the software. In short, you can't have everything in life. The small steps of evolution Anyone who has played Fire Emblem: Awakening will immediately recognize the same graphics engine in Fire Emblem Fates, which does not differ dramatically from its predecessor except for many small changes that improve the audiovisual offer in general. The narration has been made more dynamic by the alternation of the various ways in which the story is told: through the silhouettes of the characters who dialogue, mostly, but sometimes also through animated sequences of excellent workmanship, during which it is possible to listen to entire sentences of meaning done in English. The Japanese track is in fact absent, but the characters limit themselves to pronouncing a word or two at most for most of the time, expressing their state of mind while the text on the screen shows entire dialogues. This is not the most elegant solution in the world, but we don't feel like criticizing it particularly considering the amount of texts in question and, above all, the splendid soundtrack composed by various musicians including Hiroki Morishita and Rei Kondoh themselves who had already worked ad Awakening: compared to the latter, the tracks of Fire Emblem Fates are perhaps less memorable, but definitely more varied. Graphically, as we have mentioned, Intelligent Systems limited itself to designing slightly more complex and detailed three-dimensional models, finally giving them the feet that many players had lacked in the 2012 chapter, net of a general visual dirt caused by the usual aliasing accentuated in stereoscopy; beyond these details, we must really applaud the imagination and creativity of the artists and the character designer Ysuke Kozaki, the q", "date": "2016-05-04", "grade": "8.5"}
