{"name": "Guild Wars: un MMORPG quasi perfetto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guild-wars-un-mmorpg-quasi-perfetto.html", "text": "The story does not act as a side dish that is essentially ignored, but will act as a leitmotif for the growth of our character. It too has been entirely translated into Italian, and presented in the form of manuscripts, which in addition to presenting the various game features, will also tell, in the form of a book, the first part of the plot, the following chapters of which will be made available gradually on the official website of the game and whose reading is highly recommended (but at the time of writing this review not yet translated into our language, and therefore available exclusively in English). By completing one of the missions assigned to us in this first phase of the game, which we could also consider as a sort of extended interactive guide, the player will find himself jolted two years later, in the ruins of what was once the city of Ascalon, and now invaded by Charr and many other kinds of creatures, which make life impossible for the survivors of the massacre. Of course, we have the task of helping to bring things back to the glories of the past... Creating the hero of tomorrow In reality, before starting to venture into the lands of Tyria, we will be called to create our avatar, and this is where the new features offered by GW already begin. First of all, we will be able to choose whether to create a character for the role-playing game, i.e. see him start from scratch and follow the events of the story, or create a character for PvP (Player versus Player), who will start from the maximum attainable level (the twentieth) and can be equipped with all the objects and abilities that we will have unlocked during a game in ~role-playing~ mode (thus making it, intelligently, an integral part also for PvP lovers), as well as an assortment of equipment , skills and basic predefined characters for those who want to immediately try their hand at Arena battles (which we will discuss later). Once we have made our choice, we will be faced with two completely different screens. In the case of the role-playing character we will be asked to choose a primary class among the six available (Warrior, Explorer, Mystic, Elementalist, Mesmer and Necromancer), then to define its physical appearance and then we will finally be ready to be immediately launched into the story, during which we will be able to develop the character, acquire new skills and equipment and, if we wish, also to undertake a secondary class. the guys from ArenaNet have managed to make a system based on six classes extremely broad and varied Creating the hero of tomorrow If instead we had chosen to create a character for PvP we would find ourselves having to choose everything down to the smallest detail, starting from the choice of using a character created entirely by us or to use and modify one of the predefined ones, which offer - among the other - a valid starting point for novices, because they were created by the game's authors themselves and the best guilds who battled each other during the game's beta test. At first glance, the game doesn't seem to leave much variety at the time of creation for those who will start (as it would be recommended to do) an RPG character, but the guys from ArenaNet have managed to make a system based on six classes extremely large and varied. First of all, the skills of each class will revolve around four fundamental attributes that characterize them (accuracy in archery for explorers, curses for necromancers...), one of which will be the primary, and available only to those who choose this class as a primary, effectively making a Scout/Necromancer different from a Necromancer/Scout, who would respectively have access to three of the attributes of their secondary class but not the primary. At each level-up the player will be rewarded with some attribute points to be distributed according to his preferences, and a skill point, with which it will be possible to acquire new skills as a reward for some missions, or by having them taught by some of the NPCs (non-player characters , and therefore controlled by the computer) scattered throughout the game world. Note that by gaining experience we will also be provided with ~refund points~, thanks to which it will be possible to change our allocation of attribute points in a different way, without forcing us to create a new character just because we were not satisfied with our initial choices. Mass game and not Another interesting component of the game is the possibility of freely choosing who to venture outside the inhabited centers with, thanks to the creation of customized instances, which therefore prevent players who do not parof our group, to follow us outside the cities, and give life to the unpleasant inconveniences that characterize most of the MMORPGs on the market, such as for example the so-called ~queue~ or ~waiting list~ to be able to face a monster necessary for the completion of a mission because we are not given time to attack him first, or he is killed by someone else, or those players waiting for some object to be dropped by an enemy defeated by us, to immediately pick it up and steal it from under the nose, in short, situations that from a certain point of view can stimulate competition and push the player to be more alarmed, but which for many, who would just like to enjoy the story or play in peace, are simply a source of stress and frustration. Upon our return to a town, however, we will be able to find ourselves again in connection with the other players where it will be possible to recruit our adventure companions, accept the missions to be carried out and interact with the various NPC blacksmiths, gunsmiths and so on to create, sell or buy items and equipment. Exploring the game lands, we will realize how some inhabited centers in particular are in fact the place where the primary missions can be undertaken, or those that will allow us to continue in the story. This subdivision allows you to know where to easily find other players who have to complete our same mission, thus favoring the creation of an adventure group with a common purpose. Although the recommended way to play GW is in company, it is however also possible to play alone, because in the inhabited centers there will also be NPCs available that can be recruited for free by the player, to make up for a partial or total shortage of flesh and blood players. However, the artificial intelligence is not the best (and is totally automated, without any possibility for the player to give him even basic orders such as ~wait here~ or choose for their more or less aggressive set-up), and their performance, both as potential of their character, which as performance, do not naturally highlight them as the best choices, although it is possible to go on using only these NPCs during our adventures. All the inhabited centers will also have their ~copies~ to allow a homogeneous subdivision of the mass of players between the various servers, and are called ~districts~. We just need to select the district number from the list to find ourselves on the same server as our friends (with which we can still communicate via private messages even if we are in different districts, provided of course we know the name of the character in question). It should also be noted that international areas have also been made available, in order to allow all players of all nationalities to be able to gather in a single common district, while leaving the possibility of going to the other districts (the default district will be the one corresponding to the language chosen, therefore choosing Italian as the language we will automatically be taken to the corresponding district). A particular style of play Playing GW is really something curiously pleasant, because although the things to do are always the same, i.e. fight different kinds of creatures, solve missions that are often similar to each other or fight against other players, each of these actions can be undertaken with a certain style and personality. First of all it must be said that in GW even before the fights begin, we must prepare for them in the city, choosing only eight of all the skills at our disposal, which will then be the ones we will take into battle. It goes without saying that this choice will prove to be fundamental for the success of the mission we are about to undertake, and it will often happen that we will be able to complete one with difficulty and then think about how everything would have been easier if we had remembered to select that skill in We had had it for a long time and that we had never used because it seemed useless to us. In short, one of the peculiarities of the game is the non-linearity in the advancement of the character's potential, because the skills acquired later in the story will not always be better than those already in our possession or vice versa depending on who, how and where we will find ourselves fighting. Yes, because the pitch and the type of mission (whether timed or not) will also have an impact on our choices. But we'll go deeper into the fights later. Speaking instead of the primary and secondary missions, it must be said that they are definitely not very role-playing, but this was not really the intentiondeveloper ions for that matter. However, there is no shortage of appreciable situations even for those who do not only like to swing or shoot arrows. For example, during my first game I happened to witness the alleged conversation between two NPCs from afar. Initially I didn't pay much attention to it, but then as I got closer I noticed that some comics appeared showing their conversation, and that interrupting them or moving away blocked them, while remaining still to watch the conversation, in the end one of the two would have gone away, while the other from that moment he would be available to assign us a secondary mission. Other types of missions may consist of convincing an NPC to abandon a certain purpose, finding certain objects (or buying them) on behalf of someone, escorting or assisting civilians and combatants, in short, although it is not a title aimed at role-playing games, one can glimpse however a certain variety and a certain care in the realization of the same. Speaking instead of the primary missions - that is, those necessary for the continuation of our adventures - we will soon notice how much they will mostly consist of eliminating the enemy presence in certain areas or in the liberation of some NPCs taken prisoner. Yet, their quality of implementation and - above all - their ~narrative~ variety always guarantee a certain dynamism of the game. For example, if we have to free an area from the presence of the Charr, we could find the support of a team leader together with some soldiers who will help us. If during the fight the team leader were to die, we will not be able to have access to a BONUS mission, which would have otherwise been assigned to us, if he had remained alive, or if we have to reach a certain place, we could come across an unexpected event, such as a raised drawbridge , and therefore be forced to find an alternative route, during which we may be able to find the easiest and shortest way or the longest and most difficult one, naturally obtaining a proportional reward depending on which one we find ourselves taking. Another interesting aspect of these missions given by the large gain in experience for their completion, more than what is earned by adding the experience for all the fights won up to that moment during the mission itself, in order to discourage the continuous repetition of fights and push the players to move forward in the story. Furthermore, some primary missions are often also necessary for the acquisition of new skills, which can only be unlocked by completing them successfully. Finally we have the PvP, present in the form of arenas scattered throughout the main cities in the game world, where players face each other in team fights (random or guild, i.e. a group of players fighting under a certain hierarchy, whose members help each other in and out of the arenas), in which the coordination between members and the constitution of our character will be essential to emerge victorious. In these tournaments it will be possible to choose between different types of battles, each with different rules and victory conditions that will make them even more interesting, especially considering that the most deserving guilds will not only be able to earn the opportunity to build their own guild headquarters, but will also included in a ranking on the game's official website. Tactical combat The fights are certainly the flagship of GW and immediately denounce an extreme attention to detail, making them an extremely satisfying gaming experience. First of all, it must be said that each character has a health and energy bar. Any combination of classes for each character starts with a fixed and predefined number of maximum health, and will gain a fixed amount of ~health points~ at each level up, which symbolize the current condition of our character, at the time of their reset the character ~dies~ and is momentarily knocked out of action. The energy bar instead, which is used to use the various skills in our possession, is linked to the choice of the primary class, in fact the combat-oriented classes, such as the warrior and the explorer, will start with less maximum energy, while the others, oriented towards the magical arts, will start with a greater maximum reserve. Energy regenerates constantly, and the player's skill lies precisely in knowing how to dose it, using skills with the right timing and avoiding immediately wasting our entire reserve. Even the health bar recharges by itself, but this only happens if you are not involved in combat, or if we manage to get away", "date": "2005-06-28", "grade": null}
