The developers of Prettygreat are well aware of this, and after the success of Land Sliders they have wisely decided to stay in extremely accessible territory with this Slide the Shakes, a game that requires the user to slide delicious cups filled with a smoothie over a counter with the aim of making them reach the designated area. Slide the Shakes aims to be a delightful mobile pastime, and it succeeds perfectly And slipping is sweet to me on this marble The gameplay of Slide the Shakes is so intuitive, that the very short initial stages of the tutorial even seem superfluous: the title is in fact based on a control system that from Angry Birds onwards has become an integral part of the common videogame lexicon of anyone with a minimum familiar with a touch screen. You therefore need to place a finger anywhere on the screen and drag it to the left to adjust the power with which you want to launch the smoothie, conveniently indicated by a colored indicator and highly effective sound effects on an increasing scale. As mentioned at the beginning, the player's task is to get the glass to reach the green-painted portion of the counter, an operation that proves trivial in the very early stages but which the Prettygreat developers have been able to constantly enrich with new elements over the course of the 100 levels that make up the product. Thus, the journey of the smoothie can have frozen sections which increase its speed and inertia or vice versa show parts covered by a pink sludge which slows it down; again, one can come across inclined counters or marked by dangerous empty spaces, not to mention the mobile platforms that peep out in the more advanced stages. Whenever the player is faced with one or more of these elements, he must modify his launch strategy, increasing or decreasing the power as appropriate, and things change even when the software periodically assigns the user a new type of milkshake to be launched: with a touch of notable class, in fact, Prettygreat has made sure that the very nature of the various cups has an influence on the gameplay through a different physical behavior, with slender and tapered glasses that travel faster but also risk tipping over more frequently and capacious bowls which on the contrary are heavier to slide but enjoy considerable stability. All this works without however affecting the best virtue of Slide the Shakes which remains that of being an immediate and fun pastime, the ideal protagonist of a few short games in your spare time during the day. A method of use that also seems to be suggested by the particular structure of the levels, made up of several completed sub-scenarios which you can move on to the next phase: a formula evidently designed to encourage consumption in bits and pieces, also because particularly prolonged game sessions they would forcefully bring out the inevitable repetitiveness of such a basic gameplay. Distinguished by a very colorful afternoon cartoon look, Slide the Shakes does not give up on offering a challenge factor that is not particularly high in absolute terms but which increases progressively as one proceeds, and which invites the player to prefer a prudent approach: if with a launch you don't reach the finish line you can try again immediately without any penalty, while if the glass ends up crashing on the floor you have to start over from the beginning of the level. In any case, the recovery time of the action is almost instantaneous, without banners or invasive advertising to annoy the user, an absolutely uncommon aspect for a free to play title.", "date": "2016-03-02", "grade": "8.0"}
