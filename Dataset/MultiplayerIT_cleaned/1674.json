{"name": "PacMan World 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pacman-world-2.html", "text": "PacMan Returns 2003 is therefore the year of the great return of the Namco mascot: in fact, after a long wait, the Japanese software house has finally brought Pacman to the PlayStation 2. After inserting the optical support into the tray, you will have the opportunity to enter a world which, especially to nostalgics and retrogamers, will bring to mind what was another title that saw the yellow ball as the protagonist: PacLand. Following in the footsteps more of a Crash Bandicoot than of a Mario64, PacMan World 2 develops a rather linear game concept, giving the opportunity to be played by a vast target of users, with a wink particularly to the younger ones. In this new PacMan adventure you will mainly have to try to recover the magical fruits, stolen by the clumsy ghosts, which are actually seals grown on the tree that imprisoned a cruel demon. After freeing him, the ghosts, intimidated by the villain, decide to join him, thus starting a crazy project against Pacland. It will obviously be up to poor PacMan to try to put things right, collecting all the fruits and defeating the bad guy on duty to avoid the inevitable destruction of his own village. From story to realization As you can already imagine, the graphic style of this game appears very simple, however well characterized by clean graphics and varied and almost never repetitive settings. Preferring, as already mentioned, a style of play based more on the lines of Crash Bandicoot, divided into 18 levels between Adventure or Time Trial modes, you will have to jump, swim and collect objects and then reuse them to unlock passages. The game might even seem a little too simplistic, but in the end this is precisely the spirit that has always distinguished the title in its history. The bonuses of the energy balls are inevitable, which as always will guarantee a few seconds of immortality and the possibility of eating one's opponents, in addition to the unprecedented feature of providing you with some power-ups for a few seconds (such as the possibility of transforming yourself into metal). Depending on the situations in the levels you will also be able to use various means of locomotion, such as rollerblades, ice skates and the legendary Pac Submarine, plus many, many others. By collecting coins you will also be able to access the games room, where you will be given the opportunity to play old glories such as Pacman, Ms. Pacman, PacMania and PacLand: for all those who have followed the series since the dawn of time, an opportunity to enjoy them again , for all others a valuable opportunity to remedy and get to know the complete series. The sound comes with music suited to the spirit of the game, also dusting off the classic liet motif that was already present from the very beginning of the series, while the background sounds perfectly characterize the movements and movements of the objects. The control follows the standards that Namco has always guaranteed in its titles, guaranteeing an immediate feeling with the movements of the character. The view almost always guarantees the view of the entire game path, even if there is some small uncertainty in sporadic situations, however with the right practice the inconvenience can be overcome by manually adjusting the shot with the right lever of the pad. Comment As a good old Pacman fan, my impressions can only be very positive, given that this new Namco title succeeds in the difficult attempt to evolve the game mechanics of a classic video game history, arriving at a refined mix that draws on hands full of experiences created by the competition. However, this does not mean that PacMan World 2 is only a title that steals ideas here and there, but rather transforms them and makes them its own, giving the player a gameplay full of interesting ideas and increasing its longevity. However, there are some frankly somewhat naive defects, such as the aforementioned difficulty of the virtual camera in always providing the most suitable shot for the circumstances, however it is not a problem that frequent. Longevity is ensured by the many secrets to unlock, as well as obviously by the splendid arcade that will be able to satisfy both fanatics of the series and newbies. Ultimately a title recommended for all gamers, with particular regard to those who obviously particularly appreciate the nice yellow ball of mother Namco and the little ones, who thanks to the very cartoony graphics and the complete absence of violence will find this Pacman World 2 a particularly enjoyable game. Pros +well studied concept +Mix of gimmicks from other platform games +It's PacMan Cons -Camera a bit too static -A bit simple graphically Beginning of a fairy tale We take a yellow ball; let's put her arms, legs, eyes and insert her in a world populated by ghosts and other little monsters; finally, let's add the possibility of eating energy pills, mix everything, and only one thing can come out of this cocktail. Ladies and Gentleman, Pacman, one of the videogame icons of the eighties, is finally back! When it comes to games that first started a genre, it's often not easy to figure out what the real forerunner was. In fact, one of the most discussed disputes concerns the throne of the first puzzle game: although Pacman is from 1980, this genre has been identified by many with Tetris, released in 1985. As a partial excuse, it must be said that Pacman, although it is a worldwide fame, it is not very easy to classify, however for the writer of this review the Puzzle is the genre that comes closest to it. Pacman, which originally should have been called ~Pukman~, a word deriving from a Japanese phrase which describes the noise of chewing with the mouth, can undoubtedly be considered one of the forefathers of the videogame world, as well as the title that most Japan's dominance in this field began. Made by Namco, the game has as its protagonist a small yellow ball equipped with a mouth that opens and closes continuously emitting a curious sound, while the aim was to eat the pills scattered inside a labyrinth, being careful not to get captured by the ghosts that haunted him. Luckily our hero could count on a limited number of ~super-pills~ which gave him the temporary power to eat even ghosts, thus having the possibility of continuing his meal without problems for a few seconds.", "date": "2003-04-25", "grade": null}
