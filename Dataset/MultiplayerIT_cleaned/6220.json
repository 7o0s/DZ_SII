{"name": "Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152826-samurai-warriors-chronicles-3-guerre-tra-samurai.html", "text": "The musou is a real cult object in Japan, a genre as mistreated in the West as it is revered at home, which every year leads to the release of new titles almost all the same in terms of design and game mechanics. Portable consoles certainly can't avoid this playful expression, and so the usual suspects of Omega Force and Koei Tecmo take advantage of the excessive power of Nintendo 3DS to give us a new incarnation of the Samurai Warrior series, a classic musou with a traditional Japanese theme, with weapons and period costumes. However, although the formula is always the same with all its limitations and weaknesses, lovers of the genre continue undaunted to buy the new title of the moment and we are sure that precisely because of its portability, this Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 will also be no exception . Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 for Nintendo 3DS is yet another musou that doesn't change the formula at all Usual formula The sixteenth century was a transitional period for Japan, with the Spanish and Portuguese who began to frequent the lands of the rising sun, bringing with them Christianity and the introduction of firearms, as well as the European military tactics that proved to be fundamental in the draw the new balance of a country that is constantly divided between turmoil and civil war. There were many houses that at that time tried to overwhelm the others in an attempt to establish themselves by earning the title of shogun with weapons and blood and Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 catapults us into a similar context. After giving a name and a minimum of aesthetic customization to our virtual alter ego, we immediately enter the heart of the action in the service of Dosan Saito who must defend himself no less than from his son, determined to kill him in order to take power and govern his territories . Choosing the name, expression, hairstyle and types of voice is not the only way we have to customize the adventure, given that during the interlude between one chapter and another we will be called over and over again to answer questions or to give an opinion to the regent, to thus give a sort of character inclination to the character and also influence the degree of approval of the superiors towards us. We will find ourselves coming into contact not only with fictional characters, but also with generals and daimyo who really existed during the sixteenth century, such as Shingen Takeda and Kenshin Uesugi. In fact, if you are passionate about Japanese historiography, thanks to the large number of generals, commanders and officers that we are going to face, the Tecmo Koei title is full of interesting ideas, but when it comes to gameplay, the ideas are very few. The cross and delight of all musou is the extremely simplified combat system which assigns the Y and X keys respectively the normal attack and the most powerful one, with the addition of a special move to be used in conjunction with the filling of the appropriate indicator. This recharges rather quickly based on the combos collected, very easy to pull off given the presence of many enemies on the screen. Without doing all you can in difficult sequences of moves, you can easily ring series of hundreds of shots that drastically shorten the reload times by filling the bar in a very short time. A good variation, at least from an aesthetic point of view, is given by the different weapons to master which give rise to different combos based, for example, on the use of a single or double katana, or a halberd. Camera problems On a playful level, the accessible and simplified mechanics make the type of weapon equipped irrelevant, but everything becomes interesting in terms of variety since within each scenario we find ourselves guiding a party of characters towards the objectives and we can take control of each one at will. Nothing innovative given that the switch respects the standards of Omega Force titles, but it is still an adequate introduction to give some vigor to an otherwise tedious and very repetitive combat system. It took more than eight hours to complete the campaign, which all played with the same character would have been even heavier. After a couple of hours, in fact, all the limits of the musou promptly emerge ready to make us turn up our noses at fights that are always all the same, with dozens of enemies controlled by an almost null artificial intelligence that appear in front of us just waiting to be slaughtered. Likewise, each level is structured in the same way as the previous one, with the settings divided into successive sections to be unlocked only when specific objectives are met, such as killing an enemy parparticularly strong, defend a key facility from enemy army assault or destroy specific points of interest. By unlocking the various sections and conquering land, we then arrive at the bosses, rather dull and devoid of bite. However, the real problem with Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, even more than the gameplay, is the lack of a second analog stick in the classic Nintendo 3DS which makes the camera unmanageable. If you don't own a New Nintendo 3DS or a Circle Pad Pro you'll find yourself with the view going on its own and only hooking up to the enemy can put things right. Unfortunately, however, targeting is automatic and we found ourselves in more than one situation of being blind to the position of the main objective as we were targeted at any opponent. In addition to the story, there is also the Challenge Mode, a race against time to complete objectives, kill enemies and earn points, accompanied by a ranking system where the scores obtained at each challenge are recorded and compared in global rankings. At the start of each game the clock starts with a five minute countdown, but as you complete various objectives precious seconds are added to the count allowing you to improve your score. On a technical level Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 defends itself discreetly thanks to a careful work on the models and animations of various protagonists which clashes with the approximate one carried out on all the other fighters, one a photocopy of the other. Likewise, the settings are bare and not very detailed. Finally, it should be noted that the title is completely dubbed in Japanese with subtitles and menus in English.", "date": "2015-07-07", "grade": "5.7"}
