{"name": "Scribblenauts 2.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82468-super-scribblenauts-scribblenauts-20.html", "text": "2010 was certainly not an exceptional year for the Nintendo DS, evidently far from the happiest moment of its long life cycle and closer to the retirement period, ready to pass the baton to the now imminent 3DS. Among the few great titles for the Kyoto laptop in recent months, Super Scribblenauts undoubtedly deserved a place of honor, the sequel to the Scribblenauts that just a year ago had caused so much praise for the incredible creative and original vein on which it was been built, how irritating in the face of obvious gameplay problems. Having collected the criticisms and made a local mind, the programmers of 5th Cell therefore rolled up their sleeves rather quickly, creating a second episode intended to put all things in place. Or not? At the tip of the pen Probably the most irritating problem of the debut of the series was in the control system, imprecise to the point of constituting a real burden for the whole experience; said done, here is that Super Scribblenauts puts a patch of discrete consistency in the most obvious and obvious way, that is by offering the possibility of controlling the movements of the protagonist Maxwell via the directional cross and keys. An undoubtedly preferable solution, adaptable to both left-handed and right-handed people, and which finally leaves this limitation behind. As far as the actual gameplay is concerned, without a doubt the most interesting component is contained in the introduction of the adjectives; giving life to any object simply by writing it was already the ~magic~ keystone of the entire Scribblenauts experience, but now being able to add special characteristics makes everything even more fun. Do you want a flying green dwarf? Just write it down. Or a robot zombie? Or even a rusty washing machine, a giant cow, an explosive dog, and so on as far as fantasy or madness can take you. In reality, one has the distinct perception that so much potential often remains on paper, unexpressed, or rather is not channeled sufficiently well by the game structure. Let's try to explain ourselves better: the freedom made available by the system designed by 5th Cell finds its best expression in the free mode, in a context of pure experimentation in which Super Scribblenauts becomes a kind of toy, a way to fantasize and have fun in a simple way and genuine. It is no coincidence that the most enthusiastic reports on the eve of the previous episode's release were precisely those of people who were surprised and amazed to see (almost) anything that came to mind appear. The problem comes when you get tired and try to give a purpose, or a progression to all this; on this occasion the marriage with the puzzle structure of the Warner production proves to be unable to marry happily with the idea behind Super Scribblenauts, simply because it is fundamentally in contrast with it. Almost all of the 120 levels available are organized in such a way as to place Maxwell in front of a certain situation to be resolved; the critical point lies in the fact that the solution is often and willingly delimited and rather precisely requested, a factor that inevitably crashes head-on with the freedom instead offered by the creative potential offered to the player. More often than not, one simply has the impression of having in one's hands an unexpressed, or in any case limited, power; solving a puzzle with creativity is very different from having the feeling of having to guess what is precisely required from the start, by trial and error. In this sense, the aid system seems to be going in this direction, indicating in an ever more precise manner what specifically needs to be created in order to continue. When the first chapter was able to give its best, we were really faced with situations that could be solved in a lot of different ways, from the most obvious to the most elaborate, amusing and paradoxical ones. In Super Scribblenauts, on the other hand, everything seems more rigid, albeit with some exceptions, and the embarrassment of programmers unable to find an effective way to give an organization and a satisfactory progression to the basic concept is quite evident. But probably there simply isn't a suitable solution, because Scribblenauts is not meant to be played in a traditional way and with a concrete goal to pursue; on the contrary, it is evident that, in any way one tries to propose it by giving it rules, the basic concept is simply limited by its very nature and therefore loses effectiveness. In the first chapter the excessive ~opening~ potentially gave way to continue in the game using andor a very limited set of ~winning~ words and thus reducing the challenge factor, in this sequel on the contrary the excessive rigidity of contrast limits creativity too much and makes everything simply not fun. Unless particular surprises or strokes of genius in a hypothetical third episode therefore, we are simply led to consider the 5th Cell creature more of a fun and original toy than an interesting video game. Anyone looking for this is welcome to Maxwell's world.", "date": "2010-11-19", "grade": "7.4"}
