The very light story and the few bugs encountered do not in any way hinder the future of this title that promises infinite replayability and high-risk emotions. Made by Behavior Interactive, the developers of Dead by Daylight, this game will put you in the shoes of a Keeper, a robot tasked with assaulting outposts created by other players scattered across a post-apocalyptic world with the aim of recovering genetic material with which to save humanity. Your mission will be to collect resources and then build your outpost that the other Keepers can attack. In this Meet Your Maker review, we'll tell you about Behavior Interactive's plan to replicate the popularity of their previous title with an exciting, engaging, and solid formula. Games like Roblox, but also Mario Maker have shown that success can be achieved by giving the community the right tools to create wonders and now Meet Your Maker seems on its way to transforming itself into a haven of creativity. Assault, die, build, repeat In Meet Your Maker you die a lot but it is in overcoming all the challenges that another player has in store for you that the magic of this video game is hidden Replayability is one of the most important metrics by which the longevity of an experience can be measured. Meet Your Maker, if its developers continue to introduce new features regularly, has the potential to keep us company for a long time with its gameplay halfway between a first-person shooter and a sadistic dungeon builder. Humanity is on the verge of extinction after a mysterious virus corrupts everyone's genetic code, igniting nuclear wars on a global scale. Now the most important resource on Earth is MatGen, or genetic material dating back to before the collapse and therefore not contaminated by the virus. Players will take on the role of a Keeper, a robot designed to protect a Chimera, a strange being whose origin is unknown, but who asks us to go and steal the MatGen from other players to produce a cure that will save the humanity. Thus begins the ingenious gameplay cycle of Meet Your Maker. First you will have to assault the enemy outposts, collect the MatGen and deliver it to the Chimera. By exploring, destroying and defeating enemies, you will then obtain resources that you can use to upgrade your character or start building an outpost. Once published, this structure can be attacked by other players who, with each death, will leave you with bonus resources. It may seem repetitive, but the creativity of Meet Your Maker users has left us speechless and demonstrated the potential of this game. Just one hit From traps to sentries, everything can kill you with one hit in Meet Your Maker but you will have the same offensive potential and a grappling hook to be able to surprise enemies The premise of Meet Your Maker is simple: one hit is enough to die and to kill others. In the outposts that you will assault, the traps and cybernetic guards take a moment to get you back to square one, but it is almost impossible to resist the challenge that other users throw at you when they make their outpost available. The ammunition of your main weapon, then, are only two, but you can recover and reuse. For everything else there is a handy sword, but to use it you will have to get very close to those who want to kill you. Storming an outpost isn't a thrilling experience just because your life hangs in the balance. In fact, the enemy base can also be an artistic experience that took dozens of hours to perfect or the reconstruction of a real level of Doom Eternal, with a room full of enemies and half the floor made of lava. At present the arsenal available to the Wardens is very limited with two main weapons, two swords and a shield but Behavior Interactive has already published a roadmap of the upcoming content as part of the live service development and there is an abundance of tools of futuristic death. Each outpost has a harvester, a small four-legged robot, that goes back and forth from the MatGen container placed in the heart of the structure to the starting point of the assault. To get to the depths of the outpost, just follow it, it's up to you to avoid the dozens of traps and humanoid guards that the creator has scattered around the structure. In addition tomain weapons, then, you will also have gadgets available including a grenade, a rebirth point, a barrier and a syringe of stimulants to improve mobility. Resource issue Building your own outpost in Meet Your Maker is intuitive, simple and gives a lot of satisfaction. The commendation system, then, is an addition that we really liked The other half of Meet Your Maker (although you'll spend proportionally more time raiding than crafting) is building your own outpost. The system set up by Behavior Interactive is not exactly very rich in customizations but, given the plans of the developers, it has the potential to transform itself into the legitimate heir of the Halo 3 Forge. Build walls, corridors, towers that challenge the sky or dungeons from Nightmare in the dungeon is simple and intuitive even with a controller. The requirements of each base you set up are: have an unbroken path for the harvester and have a minimum number of traps or sentries to block the way for enemies. To build complete structures and with materials other than the basic rock, however, many game resources will be needed, especially if you have in mind a very intricate and brutal labyrinth in which to test the other players. Each outpost you build, then, has no disadvantages for you. You will not lose MatGen if other players complete it and the longer you stay online the more MatGen you will receive through the mining process. When this is finished, the outpost will become inactive and you will have to reactivate it using your resources or building it so that it kills enough opposing keepers to become prestigious and therefore self-sustaining. Another way to keep your outpost alive is through the commendations that the keepers who beat it can give it. It can be rewarded for brutality, cunning, artistic wit, or just plain fun, a feature we really enjoyed and added extra joy to our completions because we had a way to let the author know we had fun. Whether you want to build towers of Babel or sentry-infested dungeons, Meet Your Maker has the right tools to do it For those more dedicated to conquering the wastelands of Meet Your Maker, then, there is the Overdrive mode in which the risk-reward ratio becomes more serious. If you choose to put your outpost in this mode your MatGen earnings will be increased by 100%, but every time a keeper manages to beat him you will lose 300 units of the precious resource. There are three difficulty levels: normal, dangerous and brutal, with the first taking an average of 4-5 attempts to beat, the second 10-15, and the third a minimum of 20. This is because you can design your own outpost with traps that are activated only after the core of MatGen has been stolen so the way out is almost always as dangerous as the way in. The joy of company Everything is easier in co-op, from raiding the toughest outposts to building the perfect tower of death Storming and building are fun on their own and epic in company. Now that Meet Your Maker is included in the lowest level of the Playstation Plus subscription, if you have friends on the Sony platform, invite them to play because not only will the most difficult experiences become easier, but also because together you can create your very own room of the torture and frustration for other players becomes very simple. The building system of this game is very intuitive and tackling the most brutal levels in two will be a great source of inspiration for your outpost. There are dozens of ways to be mean to traps, but the more you play the more you find that the patterns start repeating themselves and your mastery level increases. Meet Your Maker is a kind of PvP match between one player armed with patience and the perverse mind of a designer who tried to build the cruelest underground cave or tower of Babel around. The icing on the cake of this game, then, is the grappling hook with which to start experimenting with mobility techniques and high-stakes melee combat. There's even an entire exoskeleton for your Guardian dedicated to melee weapons and it takes some time to unlock. Every aspect of the game, then, from traps to guards through weapons and gadgets can be enhanced with the resources you have even if, after about 25 hours of play we collided against a wall of progression that only new content can break down.", "date": "2023-04-20", "grade": "8.0"}
