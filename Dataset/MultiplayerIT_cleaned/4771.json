The player's goal is clear: to restore luster to the House of Kay and her possessions. Succeeding is another matter. The Pixelated Milk title immediately presents itself as a tribute to Final Fantasy Tactics, that is, as a mix between a Japanese role-playing game and a turn-based strategy. The start is all narrative, made up of long dialogues that introduce the setting and explain some fundamental concepts. The tones are comedy, with Kay who would like to do everything in life except become a ruler; with his sister, much more determined than him but perpetually annoyed by what surrounds her and with his servants completely dedicated to the cause. There is a lot of work to be done to rebuild the kingdom During the adventure, many other characters will be unlocked, each with its own narrative line and, above all, with its own needs and characteristics. Entering the castle you face the first fight, needless to say against giant mice. We will come back to it in a dedicated paragraph. For now, the important thing is that you understand how starting the game was largely thought of as a tutorial, complete with pop-up messages that explain the various mechanics in detail. Once you have completed your first tasks and taken control of the situation, it's time to decide what to do. The choices of a budding monarch The possibilities available are really many and will have to be balanced during the game. In general, we must follow some assigned objectives to continue the story, but in the middle we can decide whether to dedicate ourselves to the reconstruction of the kingdom, or to the development of interpersonal relationships with the other characters, or even to face mini-campaigns in the surrounding territories. The first task is self-explanatory: having obtained the necessary resources (money and materials), one can rebuild or improve one of the structures of the village that rises in front of the castle. The second task, on the other hand, is more sibylline and needs to be explained in detail. Regalia has a lot of narrative sections, full of really funny dialogue Characters gravitate around Kay with whom you need to improve your relationships to unlock all their abilities. For example, by becoming more friends with Kay, party members improve some characteristics and unlock extra skills, while characters who offer services, such as the classic merchant or blacksmith, improve their offer. Developing relationships is quite simple: you go to a character and choose to spend a day with him (only one action can be performed every day), trying to impress him by answering his questions well, using a multiple choice system. Obviously we must decide which characters we consider most useful for our strategy and dedicate ourselves in particular to them, because becoming friends with everyone is not possible, at least in the short term. It should also be specified that each character has his own life and to be able to spend a day there he must be free. For this reason Regalia provides a real calendar with their activities. The system itself works well enough, but honestly we would have limited it to just characters in the party, who make sense to give their all for a ruler they love. Extending it also to merchants and others weighed it down a bit too much, tying loyalty to aspects that have little to do with us, such as economic interests: why shouldn't a merchant sell his most profitable merchandise until he trusts us? It's a contradiction, given his role. Finally, Kay can go to one of the regions of her kingdom to cleanse it of monsters and solve its most pressing problems. The regions are divided into boxes that must all be explored to consider the campaign closed. Each square can contain one combat, one adventure and one camp. We will talk about the fights later, suffice it to say about the camps that they are used to save the game and treat the wounded in battle (as well as to assist in some dialogue), while the adventures are real mini-game books in which situations must be solved described through a multiple-choice system, which can also lead to fighting. By winning the fights and successfully passing the adventures, you get resources that can be spent in the castle or objects that are useful for improving the party. The latter is managed through a unified system: each character has its own peculiarities, but is influenced by a common card. For example, if as you level up you select the power that gives 100 more life points, these go to all the characters and not just one. The additional skills of the individuals are unlocked with the already described sistopic of interpersonal relationships. The choices of a budding monarch The turn-based combat system (we finally got there) on grid maps created by Pixelated Milk is really well done and original, despite some problems. Let's go in order. At the beginning of each battle we must first place our units, following the rules dictated by the map, which may require that they are scattered, or that they all start from a single side. During its turn, each unit can move and use one of its abilities. Given that, as already mentioned, each hero is different from the others, learning about their abilities is the only way to create a party that reflects our aptitudes. Life points are one of the determining factors to take into consideration to win, because they cannot be healed in any way. Once exhausted, the characters die and must be revived by sleeping in a camp or returning to the castle. Some fights are really tough On the other hand, armor points are restorable, which absorb damage instead of life points. For this it becomes essential to have in the party a character who has the skills to restore them, or to use special but more expensive potions. In reality, it is also possible to play by betting everything on dodging and other features, this is to make you understand the versatility offered by the system, which can cause difficulties at the beginning, because it forces you to study different tactics from ~attacking head-on trying to do as bad as possible~, with the latter turning out to be the fastest way to get wiped out. The player is therefore called upon to balance attack and defense, studying the positioning of the units and trying to make the most of extra skills and moves, the latter guaranteed by points that accumulate each turn (one per turn), which can also be used to carry out special techniques available to the characters. The system itself works very well and is very rewarding, especially in the late, long and difficult battles; pity for some defects, which we mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph. The first to mention is certainly that of the ambiguous management of the view of the characters. Let's explain: the fights take place on isometric maps and each skill has its own range of use and its area of effect. Each character has its own skills To use a given skill in a certain square/area, the character's vision must be clear, otherwise you have to move or fall back to another square, or change skills altogether. So far nothing strange, except that, at times, it is not clear why the view is obstructed, when in reality it seems free. It is probably the fault of the style chosen for the graphics: naive, stylized, simple and pleasant, but also an enemy of legibility in some situations, especially when the objects of the scenario cover the trampling boxes. Another problem are the states of the characters, which don't always give the effect they should. For example, we have successfully provoked enemies to force them to attack a certain hero, but they completely ignored him. We also happened to have used an ability that makes a character unassailable, only to find them targeted anyway. They are certainly trifles that you get used to, especially after many hours of play (it takes more than thirty to finish Regalia), but it's difficult not to notice them, because they go to dirty an otherwise really successful and exciting system.", "date": "2017-07-18", "grade": "7.8"}
