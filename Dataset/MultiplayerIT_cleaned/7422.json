Let's say right away that the action RPG developed by the German team Deck 13, clearly inspired by God of War (with a pinch of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow as regards the ~forest~ design of some locations), combines strengths and (big) defects in an all in all pleasant and digestible mix, especially considering the retail price. Let's start with the incipit, which unfortunately falls into the category of things done less well: a war is underway between Crusaders and vampires, and during a high-risk mission Commander Jeremy is ~infected~ by an enemy and transformed into one of the creatures at which he always hunted. His (now ex) companions take it philosophically and understandingly, in fact they tie him hand and foot and throw him off a cliff together with Alysa, a vampire who is apparently linked in some way to Jeremy, even if unfortunately there is no why is explained very well. It is enough for you to know that in the game it is possible to control one or the other character, making an instantaneous passage by pressing the Triangle button, or both in cooperative multiplayer mode (moreover of the ~drop in, drop out~ type). Awakened at the bottom of a valley, still alive (that is, in theory they are not alive, since they are vampires), Jeremy sets out with Alysa to complete his original mission, which is to make sure that a magical object of extraordinary power don't get into the wrong hands. Square, square, triang... ah, no The choices made by the Deck 13 guys regarding the control system sometimes appear a bit strange, see for example the only combo available to Jeremy, which is carried out by repeatedly pressing only the Square key, while acting on the primary backbones is You can deliver a single powerful blow or a spin attack. All the most effective maneuvers require a cool down period, as often happens in action RPGs, and character change is also part of this interpretation. We very much appreciated the marked differences between the former Crusader commander and his bloodsucking ally, with the latter having a different repertoire and approach as she proceeds shooting arrows from her two crossbows as if she were the protagonist of a ~twin analog shooter~. However, it is also true that this dual classification, ~ranged~ and ~tank~ let's say, is also adopted by adversaries with results that are sometimes really ugly to see, for example the archer who does not defend himself in any way in hand-to-hand combat, or the group of enemies who stand still to catch arrows in the distance without even reacting if we don't get too close. These are the inevitable side effects of a limited budget production, even if the defect that is most noticeable when playing Blood Knights is the lack of effective enhancement of the impacts, which is felt quite a lot in a product of this type. This means that Jeremy can beat like a blacksmith, and he certainly does, but the user is left with very little of his combos: that sensation of impact that instead represents the strong point of titles such as the aforementioned God of War and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, also obtained with bullet time shots and short ~slowdowns~. The quality of the experience suffers a lot. Blood Knights is an at times enjoyable action RPG, but with a lot of gameplay issues Playstation 3 trophies The twelve trophies contained in Blood Knights are obtained by killing a certain number of enemies, collecting all the blood coins hidden in the scenarios and completing the campaign. Part of the trophies is also linked to the choices we make during the dialogues, and which can shift the balance of our character towards his human or vampire nature. Hey you pig, get your hands off her We mentioned at the beginning a not exactly thorough introduction for the protagonists of the game, but continuing with the adventure it becomes clear that the problem concerns the whole plot a bit, which together with the direction give a sense of great approximation. The basic elements are hackneyed, but a story could certainly have been told better which, in the end, is less trivial than it initially appears. There are also some interesting ideas, see the appearance of the wooden exoskeleton (which we will also be able to control in one level, just to shuffle the cards a bit), but in general the storytelling is of low quality and it doesn't help that the dialogues are told with the game engine, showing off polygonal models that from the distanza looked much better and set of ~old gen~ animations. It would probably have been the case to hire an illustrator and make the ~Japanese-style~ exchanges, also because some design solutions appear quite tacky, see Alysa's clothing, as well as that of some vampires that we will face during the course of the countryside. Along the way, which has a linear connotation (even if the map would have us believe otherwise), we will find quite a few frustration-proof checkpoints, in the sense that they are very frequent, as well as a merchant where to buy more powerful weapons and sell equipment that we no longer need. This aspect of the game is unfortunately one of the worst made in terms of interface, and it's a shame because very little would have been enough to do better. Finally, let's spend a few words on the technical sector, which moves between ups and downs: there are internships that are beautiful to look at, with good detail and good design, while others inevitably give a feeling of ~dirty~ and poor definition. Tackling small platform sections in such situations is a bit of a pain, luckily we haven't focused much on these elements. We also note the presence of quite marked drops in frame-rate during the most crowded situations, with many enemies on the screen. Total rejection instead for the dialogues in English, recited really badly, with little conviction, capable of giving the coup de grace to a plot that in itself does not shine, while at least the music tries to load the atmosphere a bit.", "date": "2013-12-06", "grade": "6.0"}
