Augmented reality, or more real than reality? In practice, as we saw with the recent Start the Party, thanks to the PlayStation Eye camera it is possible to enter the screen directly, superimposing our image on that of the game, dramatically increasing the identification component of the whole. It is therefore natural that Sony exploited this ability to develop a title in which our aim is, as in any tamagotchi, to look after a puppy, feed it, make it grow and have fun with the different games and challenges available. The idea behind the title is that the player develops a strong emotional bond with his creature, as if it were a sort of real pet. Grow, be born, become strong! The transition from movements made with the hands to those made with the Move is completely painless, there seem to be no recognition problems whatsoever of the various activities, everything works without problems, even if obviously scratching our pet's head for a long time more taste if done with the fingers rather than with a controller with a rubber ball, but from a purely technological point of view the implementation of the new peripheral appeared perfect. After a long initial part in which a funny doctor from the Pet center explains how to prepare the room and position the camera, preferably at the bottom so that it frames the floor, we immediately started playing with our puppy, still in the form of a to hatch, to be heated and tapped to make it open. Once this is done, the real game begins, paying attention not only to his needs for fun, but also the ~physiological~ ones, such as hunger and sleep and cleanliness. Really easy operations to do, at the right moment, for example, the Move on the screen will turn into a baby bottle, and to check if our little creature is okay, just use our scanner/Move. The games are many and structured in a series of exercises to be performed in fifteen days, so as not to tire the pet and they are of different types, such as catching objects on the fly, taking pictures or jumping inside hoops, or something a little more ~ action~ like driving a plane or a car. Obviously, the player doesn't stand by and watch, but entering the field of the camera he can use all the objects and have fun watching the reactions of the cute little animal that are always varied and different, with some even very hilarious moments such as when, in an attack of malice, we paraded from under the back of the puppy the trampoline making it fall to the ground. Nothing particularly complicated, the game's target imposes a bland and relaxed pace, but the implementation of a medal system certainly makes you want to replay those sections in which you earned a poor bronze medal. Just cute! Our test confirms the good sensations previously had with the game, and that the feeling of ~touching~ the puppy is strong, also corroborated by the way it interacts with us, with movements and animations that really seem to be instinctive and real and not generated by a cold artificial intelligence. In short, it really seems like you can take care of the pet, cuddle it and play with it, then seeing each other on the screen does nothing but increase the empathy that is generated between the player and the puppy. However, all this has a price, although the challenges are not lacking, its being an evolved version of a tamagotchi could tire after a while, given that the ~challenge factor~ is at risk of falling rapidly and with it also the novelty and surprise that in the first hours of the game it is obviously very high. We must therefore be aware of the fact that EyePet does not work like all other video games, there are no enemies or final bosses to kill, but only a ball of fur to spend time with, to which we become attached and amazed at how it reacts to our requests . In short, a good pastime, which will entertain and surprise us, thanks to the excellent ~emotional~ use of the technology available, but which remains strongly recommended to all those who love tamagotchi and friends.", "date": "2010-10-05", "grade": null}
