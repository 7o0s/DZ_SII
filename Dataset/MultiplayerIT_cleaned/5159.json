But let's proceed in order. Set in a world devastated by an invasion of the living dead, the game puts us in the role of a survivor determined to counter the advance of zombies on the streets of Paris. Teamed up with five other users, in the main mode our goal will be to survive a variable number of waves (from four to ten) and finally face a fearsome final boss. Will we be able to defeat him? Killing Floor 2 is a solid and fun multiplayer shooter with lots of different weapons and enemies I live without rules The structure of Killing Floor 2 has not changed since the beta, although from the main screen it is now also possible to access a single player mode with few waves and fewer enemies. No companion controlled by artificial intelligence as in Left 4 Dead, therefore, for an offer that inevitably appears less attractive than the online sector and which could hardly convince those who do not have an internet connection and therefore focus on experiences to buy in single. We then come to the fulcrum of the production, the Survival mode, which puts us in a team made up of a maximum of six elements within a map selected from a shortlist of twelve different scenarios: Paris in flames, Biotics laboratory, Outpost, Volter residence , Catacombs, Evacuation Point, Farm, Black Forest, Prison, Containment Station, Hostile Terrain and Hell Realm. The locations offer a good variety, alternating very different and interesting situations: ranging from urban views complete with an abandoned shopping center to completely open areas such as forests, passing through the infernal places from which the Zeds, the undead to be eliminated, seem to come from . At the end of each stage you have to face one of the two bosses currently present, Doctor Hans Volter and the Patriarch: the first is a half-zombie and half-machine German scientist, equipped with many weapons for ranged attacks, while the second is a former executive turned into a huge and very powerful creature. It goes without saying that collaboration is the key to success and isolating yourself from the group never leads to good results, however in this sense Tripwire Interactive's shooter distances itself from the aforementioned Left 4 Dead, as there are no enemies blocking a player until someone goes to help him, therefore it would be virtually possible to also take an independent approach and take advantage of the fragmentation of the group to hit enemies intent on chasing their companions. Infinite space The maps of Killing Floor 2 are very large, and although there is no story to support the progression, the game succeeds in showing them to us in their entirety using the expedient of the shops that are activated between one wave and another , and which allow you to spend the money you earn to restore your equipment or modify it by buying new weapons. The arsenal is extremely varied between pistols, shotguns, light machine guns, assault rifles and extravagant devices, and is hand-in-hand with the class system, given that the completion of achievements and therefore the unlocking of special abilities depends on the 'use of certain tools in combination with the type of character we have selected. We have the Berserk, especially skilled with close quarters; the Commando, who instead wields an assault rifle for ranged combat; the Support, who shreds zombies with his shotgun; the Medic, essential to heal the wounds of team members; the Demoman, who knows how to wipe out enemies with his explosive charges; the Pyromaniac, armed with a flamethrower with which he roasts Zeds; the Pistolero, who keeps himself agile by firing two revolvers; the Sniper, who specializes in shooting from long distances; and finally SWAT, which favors light machine guns and flashbangs. Each class can be combined with a ~skin~ of purely aesthetic value, which draws on a decidedly out of the ordinary cast of characters. The weapons are well differentiated and offer a discreet feeling, they shoot well but unfortunately the yield that characterizes the most noble productions is missing. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-four Killing Floor 2 Trophies must be unlocked following mainly three paths: the exploration, collecting all the collectibles around the levels; progression, leveling up with all available classes; and finally the competition, eliminating a set number of enemies and winning online matches in competitive mode. Among the stars that don't die Moving from one area to another, looking over your shoulder and using, if necessary, a syringe to restore vital energy that recharges with the passage of seconds, Killing Floor 2's Survival mode manages to entertain and involve, as well as proposing a consistent degree of challenge, especially in the final parts of the stages, when the bosses burst onto the scene. However, there is also a second mode, Survival VS, which sees two teams made up of six players collide taking turns assuming the role of the survivors or the Zeds. The mechanisms are very similar to those of the competitive modes of Left 4 Dead, but the same limitations are also present: playing as zombies proves to be a highly fragmented and very uninspiring experience, given that in order to succeed in defeating humans need strong cooperation and a decent strategy. On the technical front, the situation appears to have substantially improved compared to the beta in terms of performance, the frame rate is therefore higher while not boasting the stability that can be found on PC, provided of course that you have a decent configuration. We move between forty and sixty frames per second, depending on the crowding of the screen, but fortunately the variability of these values does not affect the enjoyment of the gameplay, which remains solid and consistent. The waves are accompanied by very rhythmic pieces, which however inevitably blend into the general noise, lacking a precise direction. The impression remains of a dirty and poorly detailed graphics, with good enemy design but little else of note.", "date": "2016-11-22", "grade": "7.4"}
