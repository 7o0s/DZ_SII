We are not talking about tried and tested solutions such as playing a villain or a normally marginal element in the classic action adventure mechanics, no: here we are in an even more radical perspective because, essentially, we find ourselves acting in the role of a spade. ~Spadina~ is a very well-characterized character: inseparable companion of the Queen in a thousand adventures, this prodigious and intellect weapon is suddenly exiled by an enemy attack and thrown into the middle of a quiet rural area, where it is found by a simpleton shepherd of country. The latter awakens the weapon by extracting it from the pasture among the sheep and soon finds himself involved, despite himself, in the epic adventure to rescue the queen and the entire kingdom. However, it is easy to see how the dominant one of the two elements is the sword, which in fact conditions the protagonist's gait and shapes the whole gameplay based on his particular behavior: Spadina (~Swordy~ in the original) not only has the characteristic of speaking and thinking on one's own mind, but also of growing by hitting enemies and interacting with elements of the scenario. Increasing in volume, with its slashing it also determines the gait of the poor shepherd boy, who in fact finds himself dragged by the weapon and thrown around the levels like a sort of accessory equipped with legs, necessary for the movement of the sword but somewhat clumsy and not very skilled in combat. Slash Quest is based on this particular inverse relationship, translated in a dubious way as Sharp Search, born moreover from a project that emerged for the first time in 2017 during a Game Jam and evolved however substantially, especially from a stylistic point of view. The sword first All interaction in the game takes place through the Spadina blade, the central element of the gameplay, which lengthens when hitting enemies and shortens when bumping into obstacles or entering some mechanisms. The levels are littered with switches and machinery that react to contact with the sword, but often they are placed in normally inaccessible places, thus requiring, in one way or another, to lengthen the blade of the sword or to transform its characteristics through the powers -up. In this way, the puzzle elements merge with the action components, because to increase the length of the blade it is necessary to knock down the enemies: which on the one hand becomes progressively simpler as Spadina increases in size, but on the other hand complicates the maneuvers more and more, due to the inertia that the enormous blade imparts to the poor protagonist. Another important part of the gameplay plays on the relative complexity of the controls, because otherwise the combat system would be very simple. This feature is an integral part of the game but can be a double-edged sword, just to stay on topic: it requires considerable character control skill to maneuver through the numerous obstacles, traps and enemies that fill the screen and the thing is decidedly complicated by the fact that the controls are ~tank~, i.e. not contextualized based on the location of the character but always centered on the character. This, combined with the strong inertia imparted by the weight and thrust of the sword, makes even the seemingly simplest movements to avoid danger rather difficult. When the control system intrinsically represents an element of challenge, the risk is to unbalance the gameplay too much and make it frustrating, because everything can become a kind of fight against the game itself, but Sharp Quest fortunately finds a good balance, at least for a large portion of the game. On the other hand the level design, the arrangement of the enemies and their characteristics and also the design of the puzzles are all well calculated to be consistent with each other, making the game pleasant even if decidedly shallow, both as far as it's more about fighting than solving puzzles. To enrich the gameplay a bit there are also light RPG-style elements with the possibility of changing the characteristics of the sword and the protagonist, with a constant progression through the levels. The graphic style of Ricerca Tagliente is certainly one of its strengths: sword and protagonist are perfectly characterized and seemthey come out of an Adventure Time-style cartoon, but the scenarios also have a truly remarkable variety, creating a continuous succession of different situations and disparate settings that stimulate you to move forward in the game even beyond the actual qualities of the gameplay itself .", "date": "2020-10-09", "grade": "7.0"}
