{"name": "Crypt of the NecroDancer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148928-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-dancing-dragons.html", "text": "Debut game from indie team Brace Yourself Games, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike that owes much of its originality to both Spelunky and Michael Jackson. Canadian author Ryan Clark's goal was to find a formula capable of mixing the turn-based mechanics typical of the roguelike genre with the dynamism and balance in the design of Spelunky. Derek Yu's title is difficult, unpredictable, severe, but invites those who play to recognize their mistakes and not repeat them, just what Brace Yourself wanted for their project. Still, Clark says he only had the enlightenment later, by pure chance, testing the game while listening to the notes of Thriller. Whether and how much the king of pop has actually influenced Clark's work doesn't matter, because Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the most interesting roguelikes released this year, a delicious mix between dungeon crawler and music game in which every little action, from movements of the protagonist to the attacks of the enemies, is punctuated by the rhythm of the music. Crypt of the NecroDancer turns a dungeon full of monsters into a silly dance floor Lootloose On the surface, Crypt of the NecroDancer ticks all the typical items on a traditional roguelike's list. Permadeath? There is. Procedural dungeons? Mashed potato. Movements in boxes? Obviously. And so, between enemies, traps, loot and power-ups, we make our way into the depths of the dungeon up to the fight with the boss of the chapter. The controls are also reduced to the bare minimum, with only the arrow keys allowing you to move, attack or interact with the environment (one of the rare cases where the keyboard works better than a pad). Unlike NetHack and other classics of the genre, where every action of the player corresponds to a reaction in the game world, this time rounds are marked by the beats of background music, an idea that brings the title closer to the genre of rhythm games and which adds much more spice to a traditionally more thoughtful and slow type of game. Since the flow of turns depends on the music and no longer on the actions of the player, in NecroDancer you can't have the luxury of stopping to think about your next move, both because the enemies move on their own and because going in time takes say get bonus money. It is a small trick which, however, encourages those who play to never stand still and to change boxes with every beat. Similarly, the difficulty curve depends as much on the type of opponents as on the background music: as you descend into the depths of the dungeon, the monsters get stronger and more resistant, but at the same time the intensity of the musical accompaniment increases , giving the player less time to think and increasing the overall sense of urgency. The ~rhythmic~ component at the base of NecroDancer can also be seen in the behavior of the monsters, which, unlike many traditional roguelikes, follow a very specific pattern. There are zombies that line up dancing the conga, skeletons that attack on every other beat, demons that hop in circles, minotaurs that charge without stopping. While trying to memorize the behavior of each opponent, to then avoid it and counterattack, what happens on the screen is a sort of funny dance between the heroine and the monsters that populate the level. It must be said that this smoothie of predictability and urgency is quite atypical for the roguelike genre, and we don't struggle to imagine that purists may not entirely like it. The developers have included the possibility, playing as the Bard, of tackling the experience through a turn-based structure more similar to that of NetHack and Rogue; however, it seems more like an addition for newbies, given that, stripped of the need to follow the rhythm of the music, NecroDancer becomes a superficial and somewhat banal roguelike, absolutely unable to satisfy those looking for deeper and more classic experiences. Dancing in the crypt In spite of the plot of the game, narrated through interlude scenes and which perhaps takes itself a little too seriously, visually NecroDancer has a very goliardic feeling and in line with the ~dancer~ gameplay. As long as you keep up with the music, the dungeon transforms into a bizarre disco, the shopkeepers sing in tenor voices, and the enemies seem to dance rather than wander through the environment. Bosses range from a gorilla called King Conga to a metal-loving grim reaper to the final showdown with the Necrodancer. Much of the charm of Brace Yourself's roguelike, however, lies precisely in the soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Canabalt), which ranges from blues to rock, from metal to jazz, with influencesranging from Marilyn Manson to the Prodigy. Similar to Audiosurf it is also possible to play using the .MP3 files on your computer, and online fans use forums, Reddit and Wiki to share the most suitable songs. Compared to the Early Access version, a fourth and diabolical setting has finally been added (with the respective boss) and new unlockable characters that change the gameplay by adding special skills or handicaps: Eli, for example, has infinite bombs and is able to throw them at different squares away, but cannot be equipped with other weapons; the Monk, on the other hand, can get one of the items sold by the merchants for free, but dies as soon as he collects money from the ground. Then there are hardcore modes and daily challenges, but NecroDancer can turn into a small party game thanks to the cooperative mode and, above all, the support for Stepmania or Dance Dance Revolution mats.", "date": "2015-04-27", "grade": "S.V."}
