Everything changes, just a look at the images, but although the title does without the stunts, fights or 2D structure of Mechner's previous games, it carries with it the enormous care for the narrative and for its characters. It's a real shame that the quality of a title isn't always the forerunner for its success, and with the last millennium drawing to a close, The Last Express has just had the satisfaction of becoming a small cult among graphic adventure enthusiasts, thanks to a slew of positive ratings from critics. Fifteen years later, with the first Prince of Persia reproposed on iOS and a remake of Karateka arriving on XBLA, the time seems to have come for the author to tell again about the mysterious journey to the East. A laden ship loaded with... The year is 1914, the stage is the Orient Express, the famous luxury train that traveled from Paris to old Constantinople. With an interlude scene lasting a few moments, you are immediately launched into the fifth into the mystery that forms the backdrop to the entire adventure: the protagonist is Robert Cath, an American doctor wanted for an alleged murder and who clandestinely entered the train to meet his old friend, Tyler Whitney. The twist is not long in coming, and upon reaching his cabin, Robert finds Tyler's bloody corpse. The murder of his friend thus lights the fuse for a story of intrigue, secrets and conspiracies, in which the user has the double task of discovering which of the passengers is the murderer and what was the so urgent reason why he had been summoned on the Orient Express. To do this, you have to mingle with people, interact with them and question them, sometimes sneaking into their cabins or meeting them in the corridors of the train. With The Last Express Mechner has achieved a long series of goals, but there are certainly two that, today as in '97, strike the most deeply. Following evident research and studies, the author managed to recreate an extremely credible cross-section of European society on the eve of the First World War and of the forces that were at stake: from the British gentleman to the Austrian musician, via a Serbian officer, a Russian anarchist and a German arms dealer; if we count controllers and passengers of minor importance for the purposes of the plot, we easily arrive at about thirty characters, but each one is characterized by a unique profile and personality. As they chat with each other, they can be heard speaking in German, French, Russian or Serbian, and depending on whether Robert knows their language or not, the various dialogues are subtitled in Italian. However, these are not stereotypes, and indeed as the plot progresses, all the backgrounds and truths of each of the key characters emerge. The second strike Mechner did it in being able to transmit in an almost perfect way the thousand sensations one experiences traveling by train; it is a fabric made of subtleties, of details that can only be appreciated by those who often move while sitting in a carriage, perhaps those who commute, those who occasionally spend the night in a couchette or those who are simply fascinated by this means of transport so romanticized. Of course, traveling in a luxurious carriage at the beginning of the 20th century must have been very different from taking a regional train in Italy today, just as the social conventions among the passengers were different. Yet the habitus will certainly notice those who on a human level have always been the fixed points of a train journey: from those too sociable subjects to those who instead avoid making eye contact by always keeping on their own, from those who get angry if conductor, always attentive and cordial but constantly ready to reprimand anyone who does not behave properly, from those who leave their compartment to light a cigarette in the smoking carriage up to that petulant child who runs noisily around in the carriage while his mother tries in vain to calm him down. The impression of traveling in a real train is reinforced by what was one of the most characteristic aspects of the original game: the entire journey from Paris to Constantinople takes place in real time, which does not mean that the game lasts three days (the time it takes for the Orient Express to arrive at its destination), but that certain events only take place at specific times and at specific times. For example, it may happen that you have an appointment in the refreshment car at cena, or that some passengers have to leave the train in the morning, or that Miss Wolff performs a long concert to entertain those present; the user's actions can influence the agenda of the characters and the actions they carry out in a more or less evident way, but in general it is always good practice to check the clock and always have everything under control. Each situation is told through a very successful aesthetic alchemy, which combines the artistic style of art nouveau with the use of rotoscopy, a digital technique already used by Mechner in Karateka and Prince of Persia and subsequently taken up by television and film productions such as A Scanner Darkly. Runaway train! The Last Express did not need patches, and it is no coincidence that the finishing work of this port was limited to a few additions. DotEmu, the team that dealt with the iOS version of the game, has in fact only integrated a few side elements, such as the possibility of unlocking objectives or of rewatching the cutscenes at any time. More sensible is an unprecedented gallery in which the biographies of the characters are unlocked as you interact with them, but probably the most important novelty concerns a system of dynamic ~layered~ suggestions, which allows you to receive more or less vague clues at depending on how many times you press a key on the screen. Where DotEmu failed resoundingly was instead in the task of adapting and modernizing the game interface to make it enjoyable even on the iPad touchscreen: in particular, the control system proves to be very lacking and imprecise, making it all too difficult to move from one screen to the other; this is valid both for the most trivial situations and for the slightly more intricate ones, and even the simple turn of 180 to get out of one's compartment can in some cases require several attempts. Crossing the corridors in search of the right cabin becomes a very mechanical process, and obviously it is the interaction with the scenario when it comes to solving puzzles that pays the most. It's truly absurd how frustrating it can be to move inside a train whose geography is limited to a series of corridors and compartments, perhaps with the risk of being stuck for several seconds or losing orientation inside a toilet. Let me be clear, this is not a defect that completely reverses the evaluation of the work, but it is clear that it negatively affects part of the experience, not allowing even the most patient player to immerse himself completely in the adventure and carelessly appreciate the enormous and flawless made by Mechner.", "date": "2012-10-15", "grade": "8.3"}
