The game landed on PC in October 2014, at the end of a growth path carried out through the Steam Early Access platform, to then also arrive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One almost two years later, with a reduction that was not without sacrifices but however very valid, exciting and structurally sound. Still on consoles, it's now the turn of the Ultimate Edition, the traditional edition that natively includes all the DLCs released so far and which brings the Assetto Corsa experience to offer the beauty of one hundred and seventy-eight cars and sixteen circuits with over thirty variants. A big step forward, no doubt about it. The Real Driving Simulator Thanks to the default settings set to the ~very difficult~ challenge level, the first impact with Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition can be traumatic, especially if you are returning from the most famous simcades of the moment, in this case Gran Turismo Sport and Forza Motorsport 7. That proposal by Kunos is in fact a true simulation, a product endowed with a degree of challenge that can easily be defined as ~extreme~ and which varies dynamically depending on the car you choose to drive, passing from relatively manageable situations to real rides on the back of untameable beasts. In short, the cornerstones of the gameplay are very different from those you might be used to, and this will not fail to confuse you or even frustrate you during the first attempts with the career mode or with simple quick races, when you will see the opponents distance you clearly even at in the face of fairly clean and cautious driving. However, it is precisely in this great effort, in this obsessive attention to control of the vehicle, that the soul of Assetto Corsa lies. It often happens to talk about how the most popular racers manage to differentiate the performance of each car, but this particular aspect is absolutely valued in the driving game of the team founded by Marco Massarutto and Stefano Casillo; so much so that every single car represents a universe unto itself, to be understood, to become familiar with within hours rather than minutes, in an attempt to move on to the next step, perhaps increase the degree of difficulty of the experience and give up some electronic help. From this point of view, the options are numerous, but it is impossible to speak of a model that is actually scalable downwards: to fully appreciate Assetto Corsa you must be truly passionate, accept the challenge that the title offers, equip yourself with a good quality steering wheel and experiment set-ups and adjustments until this is reflected in a substantial improvement in your performance on the track. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-two Trophies of Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition appear unchanged from the original edition of the game. This means that to win the twenty-six bronze achievements you must basically complete your career, while for the most prestigious awards you must complete much more complex and demanding challenges. The ultimate experience Assetto Corsa's career mode manages to clearly express the growth path that we will have to undertake, putting ourselves at the wheel of very different cars with a view to increasingly complex and multifaceted competitions, which we will have the task of completing in every part (taking home at least a third place) in order to unlock the next stage. Beyond this, however, the structure of the title of Kunos Simulazioni does not impose constraints and allows, in the other modes, to immediately access the entire car park and all the tracks, which as mentioned are sixteen but count in total on over thirty variants. The laser technology used by the developers to faithfully reproduce the tracks guarantees an absolute degree of proximity between the digital version and the real one of each circuit, as well as the different usable views, with those from inside the passenger compartment that boast excellent performance, absolutely among the best, in terms of detail, accuracy and care of materials. However, the real protagonists remain the cars, so much so that Assetto Corsa could tell us many different stories even in the presence of a single track. The almost one hundred and eighty models introduced over time, often through DLC, offer unique and unmistakable sensations, precise feedback that strikes and involves,emphasized by engine sounds never so faithful and rigorous: so much personality that makes you willingly turn a blind eye to the music of the menus, catchy but anonymous. Going back to the subject of the structure, as already written in the previous reviews, the package is really rich, it also allows you to create custom championships on consoles (while giving up the mod substrate) and boasts a huge number of immediately accessible special events, as well as quick challenges based on simple practice, full races, Hotlap, Time Attack, Drift and the online multiplayer. The latter is still well populated, with a series of fixed lobbies in which it is possible to enter to confront other users on the basis of variable rules, being able to count on a solid and irreproachable netcode, able to guarantee the absence of problems related to latency. The inclusion of all the DLCs (yes, we also tried the Ferrari S-F15T and it's an indomitable monster) gives Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition an aura of completeness and solidity, but at the same time the presence of all the updates confirms the goodness of a technical sector that we found impeccable on PlayStation 4 Pro, firmly anchored to sixty frames per second and capable of offering truly suggestive sequences, especially during replays. Of course, two years have passed since the game's debut on consoles and the genre has made concrete steps forward in terms of production value, so there is a lack of some precautions, advanced effects and above all more favorable weather conditions. complete and dynamic: elements for which we will have to wait for the launch of Assetto Corsa Competizione.", "date": "2018-04-19", "grade": "8.5"}
