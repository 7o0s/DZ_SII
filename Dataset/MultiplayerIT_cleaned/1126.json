{"name": "Dull Grey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dull-grey-recensione.html", "text": "The main problem when it comes to reviewing visual novels lies in the impossibility of speaking properly about one of the main elements, the plot and how it is managed, without the risk of running into spoilers: we always tend to mince words, circumnavigating the crucial point in the attempt to make the reader understand what we are talking about while avoiding ruining the experience. With Dull Grey, the second work of the Russian studio Provodnik Games after Railways of Love for mobile devices, we do not run this risk because the experience offered is almost non-existent: we write almost because we have played something anyway but the laughable duration of the whole made it impossible to appreciate it properly despite the interesting bases. So find out what works and what, above all, doesn't in the Dull Gray review. Minimalist throughout Dull Gray's inspirations must be sought outside the videogame world and, rather, in that of literature: imagine a point in the middle between Cormac McCarthy's The Road and the prose of Haruki Murakami. We're about there. We are presented with a short story whose young protagonist, Kiryusha, is called upon to decide what job he will have in the future as he travels with his mother to his destination. The narrative revolves entirely around growth, thus offering us what we could define as a digital bildungsroman in which Kiryusha (but in general of all the inhabitants) have two difficulties: continuous environmental disasters and an authoritarian state called Progress-Program, which constantly observes everyone and checks every communication. A sort of Big Brother, only in a more desolate and bleak key since, between damaged giant robots and ruined buildings, the setting is not the most reassuring. This is a very important day for Kiryusha: precisely, the one in which he will decide his future. Which is why anyone he meets can't wait to know what his choice is about: from the aunt, to the grandmother to the mother's lover but also perfect strangers, everyone will want to know. The curious thing is that the only two choices available to you (we are however talking about a reality where your life is not really yours) will not be expressed by the boy, but by the mother: when you select the answer, she will in fact answer for you. There are many interpretations, one of which is that not even the only decision that belongs to you is yours - and therefore that there will always be someone who will decide for you, you will never be free. There are two possible paths: to help the people, by doing a job that is socially useful but equally dangerous; or become a social pariah and serve the state through a more secure job but, at the same time, frowned upon by the people. We would need a third option, hidden in silence, which could lead to interesting results. It could simply because, despite the atmospheres rendered very well also thanks to a very impactful and spot-on minimalist style, the narration is inconsistent: the premises are there, as you have seen, but the brevity of the whole prevents even from metabolizing what is happening. We are talking about a quarter of an hour, a maximum of twenty minutes for a game that does not benefit from great replayability (if not just to see Kiryusha's fate based on the two main choices) and does not allow you to immerse yourself in its atmospheres. The only flicker is in the paragraphs leading up to the end credits, where the boy's future unfolds one way or another, yet the experience is empty. Why are we rewarded for this action? What is its relevance? What happened to the world, or at least to this particular area, to be reduced to such a miserable condition? Nothing. We understand the desire to make the player one with Kiryusha, so accustomed to his reality that he does not ask himself the most trivial questions; however we are not really him and it is inevitable to ask at least the contextual doubts, leaving out the potentially existential ones. We are taken by weight and slammed into this very short story where the only significant interaction is to answer about our future job. The lack of choice or important interactions, coupled with its laughable duration, thus places the burden all on the shoulders of the prose. It must be able to emerge as a short story, to motivate its very existence: unfortunately it fails in this, since despite having a couple of effective parts, the rest is all an incoherent whole, where we also found some smudges in the translation and whose characters hardly have the time to show up, let alone emerge. Even if we had replaced them with each other, the difference would not have been noticeable. Dull Gray is not a game that canhope to compete with other visual novels: too short to be anything other than a sketch, a teaser of what perhaps could have been, we cannot define it boring but it certainly does not return a defined image of itself.", "date": "2021-05-10", "grade": "5.0"}
