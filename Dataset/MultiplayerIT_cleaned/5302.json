{"name": "Il ballo delle debuttanti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173766-forza-motorsport-6-apex-il-ballo-delle-debuttanti.html", "text": "Exactly in the days in which the CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella announced the promotion to head of the Xbox division of Phil Spencer, considered the man of the rebirth - especially in terms of image - after the ~disaster~ of the Xbox One reveal signed by Don Mattrick, a curious tech demo of Forza Motorsport 5 on PC was presented at the GDC in San Francisco 2014, a taste of the potential (still largely unexpressed) of the innovative DirectX 12 libraries. Although it was a simple programming exercise, many hoped for the project to materialize, with the landing on personal computers of one of the most representative and tasty sagas within the Xbox brand. After all, even if with mixed fortunes and in a decidedly partial way, both Halo and Gears of War of the ~glorious triptych~ had already crossed our monitors. Exactly two years after that demonstration and a handful of months after the launch of the spectacular Forza Motorsport 6 on Xbox One, that dream just cherished has turned into reality, with the announcement of the development of an exclusive Free to play version of Forza Motorsport for Windows 10, translated from the last brilliant chapter for consoles. Son of the new App system and the abolition of the concept of exclusivity in favor of the so-called Windows ecosystem, Forza Motorsport 6 Apex is basically a starter of the classic experience, a sort of experiment created to test the waters and practice with parallel development , which in these days will blossom thanks to the debut of the spin-off Forza Horizon 3, waiting for Forza Motorsport 7 which next year, most likely, will also be one of the spearheads in the Scorpio launch line-up. After a few months spent in the beta phase, Forza Motorsport 6 Apex has just been updated to its final version, and we were finally able to test it with our racing wheel. The Turn 10 flex their muscles on PC with the excellent and free debut title Forza Motorsport 6 Apex The first round is free Free to play often rhymes with poor quality, invasive microtransactions or even worse with the infamous ~pay to win~, but fortunately this is not the case with Forza Motorsport 6 Apex. Indeed, for the first work of Turn 10 on PC we can speak of a free title in all respects, given that the gold medals necessary to unlock the various cars - about sixty in all - are easily obtainable in the game and without even investing too much time. In short, the 0.99 cents to bring one of the racing cars into the garage early is an absolutely avoidable expense. As specified in the introduction, the game is a bare-bones reduction of the chapter for Xbox One, which translated into a nutshell means little content and clear cuts to modes and frills (not all), while maintaining the same, very solid playful substance. For this reason, if you want to discover the alchemy of the delightful gameplay, we can only refer you to the aforementioned Xbox One review; in this case we limit ourselves to adding that the support for the steering wheels, and specifically for our trusty Thrustmaster TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, is truly excellent and has a good number of advanced parameters to set. Compatibility with these peripherals, which will be enriched with new models also in light of the imminent launch of Forza Horizon 3, was one of the most awaited features, which was made available precisely on the occasion of the exit from the beta phase. For those who don't want to go and sift through the review of Forza Motorsport 6 for Xbox One, we emphasize that Apex is a very solid sim-arcade, with a plethora of options capable of shaping a driving experience suitable for both beginners and so-called hardcore gamers. Among the most intriguing elements of the sixth chapter there is an amazing rendering of wet asphalt; a real gem that we are sure will also be revived in Forza Motorsport 7, perhaps with support for dynamic weather, the only drawback of the latest Turn 10 masterpiece together with the absence of the day-night cycle. In Apex, the upgrade card system (Modifications) appreciated in Forza Motorsport 6 has been removed, which in this case, also due to the concentrated experience, would not have made much sense. The whole part relating to the customization of the cars (mechanical and aesthetic) is also absent, although PC players can apply a selection of the best liveries uploaded via Xbox Live. As for the modes, we must also highlight the complete removal of multiplayer, both local and networked, while being able to have the excellent Drivatar technology for CPU-controlled pilots. Instead of the gargantuan World Tour, there is a so-called ~Motorsports Tour~, a series, in Apexof twelve events which, starting from the old American Muscle Cars, leads the player from category to category up to the challenge at Spa with the Le Mans class Sport Prototypes (LMP). The closing event is a fascinating race on the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the cover car Ford GT 2017, the same setting of the introductory race to the game. In each event, accompanied by comments from James May, Richard Hammond and a replacement for Jeremy Clarkson (the triptych of the old Top Gear), the player must win three gold medals, obtainable by submitting to specific rules involving the level of difficulty , the implementation of electronic aids and real secondary objectives, such as detaching a certain time, reaching a maximum speed or perhaps never leaving the track. Getting the three medals is anything but prohibitive, and in our experience we had some difficulties mainly with the Spa race aboard the Sport Prototypes, due to the storm and the need to remove the traction control. The Motorsports Tour is accompanied by the ~In the Spotlight~ mode, a series of dynamic events constantly updated by the developers, where you can unlock other medals that contribute to your Forza Hub profile score. The competitions work exactly as in the Tour mode. The circle of the playful offer closes with the classic ~Free Game~, where it is possible to set up the races as you prefer and challenge up to fifteen opponents controlled by the CPU. The cuts to the contents do not only concern the cars but also the tracks: of those present on Forza Motorsport 6 there are six settings in all, namely Brands Hatch, Spa, Rio de Janeiro, Sebring, Top Gear Test Track and Yas Marina, each of which are available in different configurations and variants. Weather conditions and night racing, just like Forza Motorsport 6, are only available on select tracks. Brute force Although the technical missteps of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and above all of Quantum Break are there for all to see, the balance of exclusive Microsoft games on the Windows Store is not so disastrous. The excellent Killer Instinct and the object of our analysis, in fact, certainly represent a solid starting point, and the next games, starting from the imminent Forza Horizon 3 followed by the equally awaited Gears of War 4 and Dead Rising 4, will necessarily demonstrate a further step forward in this regard. Forza Motorsport 6 Apex stands out for the huge selection of advanced graphics options, but above all for the possibility of setting a dynamic optimization which, shaped around the limits of your configuration, allows you to maintain a constant framerate at 30 or 60 frames per second. In case you have a particularly performing system, it is also possible to push the work of the Turn 10 up to the wonders of 4K with Ultra settings. Curiously, this setting is not accessible to everyone, even if only for testing purposes; in fact, your machine must meet certain parameters to be able to access it, especially in terms of RAM (the requirements for 4K at 60 frames per second are 16 GB of RAM and 6 GB of VRAM for the GPU). With our test configuration, which you find indicated in the box below, we were able to push Forza Motorsport 6 Apex in 2K resolution at 60 frames per second with almost all settings at maximum, keeping the particle resolution dynamic, the MSAA antialiasing filter at 2x and the quality of the mirror, shadows and reflection on the windshield to ~High~. Among the other configurable items, in addition to the one relating to the quality of the car models, there are some dedicated to textures, procedural quality and some parameters related to reflections. One of the most widespread problems encountered by players is represented by stuttering phenomena, which occur - and which sometimes increase after a few races - if you force your hand too much with the graphic options. Working on the individual items we managed to find a solid and stable solution with our configuration, without any fluidity problem, except for some very rare shots in the most chaotic situations, such as replay phases in Sebring in the rain. Overall, an excellent job has been done and the graphic brilliance already appreciable on Xbox One is presented in perfect condition on PC, thanks to a truly enviable video cleaning, the best anti-aliasing filter and the wealth of details and effects guaranteed by Forza Tech. The car models are splendid, which, embellished by the excellent work done on shadows and lighting, reachesare photorealism in Forza Vista mode, also available on Apex for all reproduced cars. Finally, the three-dimensionality and incisiveness of the audio sector are also excellent.", "date": "2016-09-14", "grade": "8.5"}
