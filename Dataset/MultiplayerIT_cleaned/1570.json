{"name": "Poison Control", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/poison-control-recensione.html", "text": "Nippon Ichi is a historic publisher and developer who turns thirty in 2021, to whom we owe several interesting video games: the Disgaea series, Yomawari: Night Alone, Yomawari: Midnight Shadows, A Rose in the Twilight and many others. Primarily focused on RPGs, including tactical ones, with Poison Control it is a bit out of the familiar schemes by presenting an action role-playing game with third-person shooter dynamics: a sort of Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, devoid of that charm that the series signed Spike Chunsoft has more or less maintained even with its spin-off. Poison Control is a game that pinches here and there, especially from Persona 5, but failing to distinguish itself in anything, to the point of becoming boring, repetitive and predictable within the first half. The short stories it tells don't hold a candle to Atlus' masterpiece, but they don't even come close to it, while the obvious fanservice - for those who find reason to buy in abundant female graces - is not enough by itself to offer the right motivation to get to the end without getting overwhelmed by boredom. Let's see it in detail in our Poison Control review. A story without bite Poison Control puts us in the role of an amnesiac protagonist (male or female), who suddenly finds himself in hell and no longer in control of his own body: or rather, without having had much say in the matter, he found himself having to share with an otherworldly creature called Poisonette, who after having deprived us of the mortal remains will become our Soul Mate and will accompany us along our journey. Which trip, you ask? Simple, apparently we - or at least people like us, since we are not the only ones with special abilities - have the power to purify spirits, all strictly female, prisoners of their own desperation, which manifests itself in the form of poison. To do this we will have to access what we could define as their personal hell (imagine them as the Palaces of Persona 5, because conceptually they are the same thing), eliminate the source of their suffering and thus free them from the limbo in which they have found themselves prisoners. he incredible resemblance to the work of Atlus, which also extends to the aesthetics and music, the experience could still have been captivating. Unfortunately it fails due to a dull presentation of the stories themselves, which only in rare cases stir a vague sympathy for the sad fate these girls have fallen into, and you will soon end up skipping all the dialogue to get to the end of the story. level - the same twists and turns are phoned, failing to surprise as they should. The amnesia of the protagonist and the very nature of Poisonette could be the only reasons sufficient to go to the end of the game, were it not that where the narrative opens an interesting glimmer of light, the gameplay arrives at a straight leg to bury everything once again. Boring and repetitive gameplay Poison Control, a moment of confidence with Poisonette As anticipated, the gameplay of Poison Control is divided between the third-person shooter and the RPG in terms of character enhancement. The unsolicited ~fusion~ with Poisonette has transformed our arm into a mouth of fire capable of injuring the evil entities known as Klesha that inhabit hell. At our disposal we have a discreet arsenal, largely derived from the souls of the liberated maidens (excluding the basic weapon linked to Poisonette): it is divided between Toxicants and Deliriants, respectively main and secondary weapons, Antidotes that affect the defensive characteristics, to conclude with Catalysts which instead act as general support by increasing our purification capabilities, allowing us to collect objects and coins more easily, and so on. While passing from one weapon to another, the shape of the arm will remain identical, the type of bullets, the rate of fire and the power will change. It is also not possible to change the loadout during a mission, you will have to think about it first by going through the appropriate menu. During our trips to the individual hells, specific interactions with Poisonettes called Heart to Heart will occur, which once again recall the Confidants of Persona 5 and allow us to improve our traits based on the response offered. If we exclude exploration, there are two main actions to take: shoot and purify. During the game we will meet different types of Klesha, none of these memorable in terms of design, which we will have to break down making our way to the heart of the problem. There is no particular strategy fordeal with them and soon it all boils down to choosing your weapons of choice, aiming and firing, alternating with a special area of effect attack that helps you dispatch any large groups. Each girl to be saved, or Belle as they are called in the game, requires different approaches related to her personal drama but even in this case we don't find particular variety: we will have to purify a certain amount of poison, kill a certain number of enemies and very little else. In some cases, before finding the solution it is necessary to understand the contingent situation by exploring the realm in question and only then will it be revealed to us how to proceed to put an end to the pains of the spirit in question. There's no shortage of boss fights but, like the rest of the game for better or worse, they don't shine at all in the making. Poison Control is a game that gets boring and repetitive before you even get halfway through the adventure, where neither plot nor plot shines; what little that could be saved is completely ruined by the lackluster gameplay. Technical aspect Poison Control, shooting and purifying are the only actions in the game Visually, Poison Control proves to be as mediocre as its playful counterpart: there's nothing that really stands out and it certainly doesn't share the more pleasant aesthetic for which Nippon Ichi is known. The level design is incredibly basic, again repetitive to the point that many levels look like a collage of many others, the artificial intelligence has not come through and if the enemies have the upper hand it is by virtue of the number or the fact that in some areas they appear endlessly, becoming a constant annoyance that makes already tedious gameplay frustrating - this is mainly because if you are defeated you will lose all progress and restart from the main hub. The soundtrack, which follows Persona 5 again but does not reach its glories, becomes forgettable in a short time. Then there are technical problems here and there such as blurring, light effects that come and go depending on how you rotate the camera, voices that are covered by the background music, occasional drops in frame rates and so on. In short, even if you want to look for something good, we can't really find valid reasons why you should get to the conclusion of Poison Control, much less try to replay it.", "date": "2021-04-13", "grade": "5.0"}
