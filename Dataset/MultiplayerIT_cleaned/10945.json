{"name": "Superman/Batman: L'Alleanza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supermanbatman-lalleanza.html", "text": "In the field of comics, ~crossover~ means an episode (or a saga) which involves the meeting of characters belonging to different publications. Superman and Batman, or the standard-bearers of DC Comics, have been the protagonists of hundreds of crossovers over the years: theirs is an established friendship, which often leads them to act in symbiosis to resolve even issues of ~cosmic~ relevance. On paper, these are completely different superheroes, poles apart: the first is a virtually indestructible alien, who is only rarely put in difficulty by his opponents, endowed with a strong sense of justice and unable to break the rules; the second is a ~metropolitan~ vigilante, devoid of any superpower, who acts driven by the desire for revenge and is willing to do anything to get the better of his enemies. Recently the two were the protagonists of a miniseries that was also published in Italy, and which in fact saw them join forces to counter Darkseid's latest conquest plan: to open a series of gates to send Apokolips' soldiers to Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. This mobile tie-in developed by Glu probably refers to those events, given the numerous quotes At the beginning we will be asked which character we want to use between Superman and Batman: our choice will not change things much, we will simply face the stages in a different order. The game is in fact structured in such a way as to make us alternate in command of one and the other character, facing different situations from time to time. The levels featuring Batman are platform based, with the superhero being able to jump, use the classic grappling hook to reach high areas or drop down by pressing the d-pad down twice. The 5 button is used for punching and kicking, and pressed while jumping results in a powerful dive attack, while pressing the d-pad forward twice unleashes a hard kick that pushes enemies away. The 1 and 3 keys are used respectively to launch the batarang or rather effective bombs: these are the quickest solutions to eliminate opponents, with the only limit being the bar that regulates their use, placed below that of vital energy. Don't worry, however: it recharges over time. Using Superman is obviously different: while sharing the vulnerability with Batman (you couldn't make him invincible, of course), the man of steel moves in flight and therefore doesn't need platforms or anything else. The controls don't change, but they produce different maneuvers: pressing the d-pad forward twice results in an in-flight charge, pressing it down twice initiates a dive attack, while keys 1 and 3 are used respectively to use the ~heat vision~ or freezing breath. Performing the second and then the first in rapid succession proves to be a truly spectacular combo. Both characters can sometimes make use of a ~smart bomb~ that is as effective as it is beautiful to look at. On the technical front, the game looks very good, with truly exceptional graphics in terms of the quality of the drawings: both Superman and Batman appear at their best, with the developers evidently relying on the work of the very good Jim Lee (who designed the miniseries from which the title Glu is inspired) to make the sprites. It cannot be said that the animations are very fluid, of course, but the quality of the frames is not discussed and is very ~cartoon~ style. The basic enemies appear clearly less cared for, while the various Metallo and Darkseid boast a quality equal to that of the protagonists. As for the locations, there's a good variety of colors and two levels that scroll in parallax, giving a decent depth effect, but the general impression is that they're too repetitive and uninspired in design. Finally, the sound is unfortunately mediocre in MIDI music and only acceptable as regards the sampled effects. PRO Beautifully drawn sprites and backgrounds Two characters with different abilities A must for fans of DC characters AGAINST Very long uploads The controls are not responding as they should Too easy and linear", "date": "2008-12-30", "grade": "S.V."}
