{"name": "Baldur's Gate : Dark Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance_c.html", "text": "Preparations As soon as I picked up the game I was concerned to see the cover written entirely in English and, having ordered the game on the internet, I thought I had been given an unlocalized version of the game. Opening the package, the situation has certainly not improved since the manual is also all in English without even the shadow of a word in Italian, when instead it would have been interesting to be able to read it in our mother tongue. When I was resigned to playing the entire game in English, I had the ~good~ idea of inserting the DVD into the console to notice that ~at least~ it was in Italian. Not to nitpick, but after locating the entire title, both lyrics and speech, would it have been so expensive and challenging to translate the cover and the manual as well? Luckily these are just subtleties that disappear immediately once you pick up the pad, ready to get into the action! A Story of Betrayal and Revenge As soon as we enter Baldur's Gate we will be robbed by a gang of thieves who will deprive us of all our possessions and only the timely intervention of the city guards will allow us to survive. Thus begins our adventure in the world of Dark Alliance (in the best way), a story that will make us travel the coast of the sword in search of a woman named Eldrith animated by resentment and a desire for revenge against Baldur's Gate. Out of respect for all those who don't want to know the story of the title, I avoid telling it in these lines, but I still remember that anyone who knows English can read it directly from the manual, or logically, by finishing the game. Let's start fighting! As you all know, the game will allow us to choose between three characters with totally different characteristics. As the first character we find a Dwarf warrior trained in the art of hand-to-hand combat and suitable for anyone who prefers to jump into the fray rather than mow down enemy lines from a distance, a technique that instead succeeds very well in the second usable character, or the elf enchantress. For those who prefer to choose the technique to use from combat to combat, I recommend the use of the human archer, a hybrid of the two previous characters, who manages to combine ranged attacks with melee blows. Once you have chosen the character that best suits your style of play, you will find yourself having to face the first missions, some of which will be mandatory, while others will only serve to increase your budget or to make you gain experience. Unfortunately the ~side missions~, as they are usually called, will only be present at the beginning of the game and will gradually disappear as the story progresses. In the game there will initially be three difficulty levels, in my opinion for anyone familiar with games of the genre the ideal difficulty would be the difficult one, as it would certainly make the game more long-lived and compelling. The game mainly consists of exploring areas and eliminating all opponents who are crazy enough to challenge us; all this might seem monotonous, and it would be, if it weren't for the infinite possibilities that the world of Dungeons & Dragons opens up. The RPG component of the title helps a lot to increase longevity and completely erase the monotony, as each character will have 40 levels available to upgrade to the maximum in the skills you prefer. The level advancement system is very similar to the one used in Icewind Dale II, each character will have common characteristics (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma) each of which will be more or less high depending on the fighter who you will have chosen, and your own skills, which will form the basis of the level up. The common skills will be upgradeable with one point every four levels, while the personal ones can be increased from level to level. Another classic element of the D&D world is the variety of weapons available. Not all the most powerful weapons will be purchasable in shops, nor will it be possible to acquire them from bosses, there is only one way to get hold of the best weapons, a method where a good component of luck is necessary, but also of persistence; Many times it is the most insignificant enemies that give the player the strongest weapons or objects, not to mention the racks and chests scattered in the middle of the stages, denamong which it is easy to find something of interest. This simple possibility is enough to give rise to doubt in the player and thus prevent him from abandoning battles or passing a stage without having explored everything in search of the last enemy or a simple casket inside which anything could be hidden ... even a bomb... short story, but... Perhaps one of the harshest criticisms that can be made of this game is due to the poor longevity of the story. By the term story I mean the game from when you choose your character to the defeat of the final boss, and therefore by this statement I absolutely do not mean that the longevity of the game itself is short. However, to compensate for this, Dark Alliance offers us many bonuses that cannot leave any of the lovers of the D&D world indifferent. The first of these bonuses is the challenge mode, which will be activated as soon as you complete the game. In this mode we will have to defeat all the enemies present within 15 minutes, without the possibility of saving or importing our character, as we will be able to ~only~ use Drizzt Do'Urden, the legendary dark elf protagonist of many books inspired by the series D&D. Once this mode has been completed, a new difficulty level will be available, Extreme, in which we will have the possibility to import our characters. These characters will keep their experience level unchanged but will lose all the items they had hard earned in previous games. Also completed this mode it will finally be possible to use Drizzt in the normal game. Graphically speaking Graphically, the title does not excel but neither looks bad, managing to recreate a pleasant and playable atmosphere. The view that has been chosen for the title certainly prefers the Gameplay to graphic detail, as you will never have problems with the camera. Fortunately the magical effects are done very well, making it much more enjoyable. We must also dwell on the aquatic effects, which in my opinion are made with great care. The characters will also change their way of dressing depending on the armor they wear. This is a feature that may seem due, but which is equally very well done, as you can easily recognize the garment you are wearing simply by looking at your character. To conclude Dark Alliance is certainly an exciting and pleasant game, especially for lovers of the D&D series. The gameplay it offers, the vastness of objects it makes available and the possibility of playing in 2 players simultaneously make this game a high-level title, which does not deserve a 9 simply due to the low longevity of the story, which honestly could have be much longer. Ultimately Dark Alliance is a game that as the only major flaw has only longevity which, although good, is not comparable to that of the other titles in the series. Recommended for all those who love the action / rpg style and who are looking for a title that gives immediate fun, with the awareness, however, that this will not last more than two or three weeks (depending on how much you play it of course). Pros: RPG component Lots of bonuses Fun bike... ...more in 2 player Cons: Short story Not everyone can like it You have to start it over too many times Baldur's Gate, a name a guarantee This mythical saga began in 1998 with Baldur's Gate which, after two years, was followed by Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Both titles were developed by Black Isle and offered an astounding style of gameplay, granting the player almost (the ~almost~ could also be omitted) total freedom. To this day I can say that Baldur's Gate II was one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen, and I can testify that all the other titles in the series, including Icewind Dale, are no different. I waited for Dark alliance for almost a year, and after continuous postponements of the release date, I had almost given up on buying it, what mistake would I have made... Dark Alliance is based on a totally different style of play from the previous Baldur's Gate, but not for this subtracts from the magic that surrounds the titles in this series. Let's get ready to enter the Costa Della Spada to discover all the secrets of this title, which I announce already great.", "date": "2003-05-29", "grade": null}
