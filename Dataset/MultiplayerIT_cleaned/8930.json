Subsequently renamed Indie Games, sold in most cases at ridiculously low prices, these great little games continue to inflate the list of available titles every day, which is practically boundless and extremely difficult to skim off. Multiplayer has chosen a decidedly particular title for you, born from the fervent mind of Monufrak1, get ready to land in the world of UnBound. Lord of the Spheres Developed entirely on the XNA platform, UnBound is a first-person adventure that catapults us into a beautifully rendered desert island, where we face various challenges that have a single purpose in common: the collection of all the spheres scattered throughout the territory. Like Pac-Man without ghosts or labyrinths, all this title asks of us is to collect the spherical objects in three ways that change the contextual rules, taking advantage of the only action allowed to us in addition to normal movement, that of jumping. The first mode, called Adventure, allows us to freely explore the island in search of 30 blue spheres, many of which are impossible to reach without enhancing the agility value, which allows for powerful jumps and is increased by collecting the normal green spheres. The same formula is replicated in Survival Mode, but with several additions that dramatically increase the challenge. This time the player has limited energy that depletes over time, after which it will be Game Over, and a sensitivity to damage caused by falling from great heights. The aim is to survive for a week, after which all the spheres on the map will be replenished, and the protagonist's skills will be canceled. The energy falls with worrying speed, forcing you to memorize the location of the spheres, especially the red ones capable of restoring energy, but above all the purple ones, capable of increasing resistance. The most successful feature is that of the blue spheres, able to give bonuses in relation to the collected quantity of gold spheres, real multipliers. The bonuses are among the most diverse, if the most striking is the one that allows you to speed up time, it is equally true that its conquest must be paid with almost all multipliers, which will not be restored before the end of the week. The player therefore finds himself making strategic choices in an extremely limited amount of time, where every mistake is paid dearly. We at Multiplayer managed to survive for 14 days, will you be able to beat our record? Dangerous calm The last mode, called Challenge, is one of the most intriguing, as it commits the player to face various tests where the scenario itself becomes a threat, from the fog that prevents the spheres from being identified, to the rising water level inexorably, forcing the player to take sudden actions to recover the spheres before they are reached by the lethal liquid. Unfortunately it is also the only mode with obvious balance problems, as really excessive reflexes and precision are required (see box for further explanations). UnBound is a truly unique aesthetic title, thanks to its alienating atmosphere, emphasized by splendid music that blends perfectly with the context. Obviously the island is the absolute protagonist, with its beaches lapped by the ocean and the rocky heights painted with a surprising 3D rendering for an Indie game. Although vegetation is completely absent, there are other elements that compensate for the scenographic impact, such as a truly effective day-night cycle, especially in Survival mode. Most striking is the feeling of total solitude, with no enemies or allies, just us, the spheres, the ocean and the earth. Indie reality As you can imagine, Indie productions are often creations made by a single person, in most cases using Microsoft XNA. UnBound was created with this development platform, we personally contacted the author, Monufrak1, regarding the issues of the Challenge mode. He replied that he had received numerous feedback from buyers, and that he was working on a corrective patch for this mode. UnBound is available on the Live Marketplace for 80 Microsoft Points, and can be purchased here", "date": "2011-11-17", "grade": "8.0"}
