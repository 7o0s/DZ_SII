{"name": "Unreal Tournament 2003 - Day Three", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-tournament-2003-day-three.html", "text": "The UT2003 paraphernalia (first part) First of all, it must be said that there are no ~new~ weapons, other than the Assault Rifle and the Ion Painter. All those present in this new version, in fact, are an update of the old Unreal Tournament, and the new ones have replaced the same number of those considered ~obsolete~. Now almost all of them have a ~sci-fi~ look. Starting from the Assault Rifle, which replaces the Enforcer/Double Enforcer (the gun, to be clear), we have the classic basic machine gun, with grenade launcher included. It is the joker weapon, usable up to the medium distance in a more than discreet way. The possibility of having grenades available allows you to create havoc in the ~heaps~, even if the explosion itself produces little damage. A negative note is that it runs dry very easily, and there is no ~buzzer~ that warns us of the depletion of the cartridge. At the climax, in fact, the machine gun ~stops~ shooting and the first few times you are left with the button pressed hoping that the weapon produces the shots by itself! A vain hope, made even more desperate by the lack of extra cartridges scattered throughout the maps. The Machine-Gun has acquired a more aggressive look, with the double fire mode inverted compared to the past (double speed with the first fire mode, and normal speed but more precise, with the second.). In the mechanics it has remained more or less identical to the previous one, but some changes in the acceleration of the fire rating have attracted many complaints from the old fans, who much preferred that of the old UT, more devastating and precise. The Pulse Gun has been replaced by the Link Gun. The substantial difference is that now instead of shooting green ~flares~, energy ~spittles~ are launched, which have decreased in fire rating (about two are released per second), but do more damage than the old energy spheres. The second shooting mode has remained practically unchanged, with a bundle of green energy this time all ~branched~, which can ~cross~ with those of the other ~friendly~ players. The resulting effect is a spectacular ~Ghostbusterata~, which however is very rare to see with bots. The Sniper Gun has been transformed into the Lightning Gun, a portable lightning shooter including an optical zoom, which instantly ~lightning~ the opponent. The rating is low, since you have to wait for each single shot to reload, but the effect is deadly if you hit the head squarely, obtaining the classic ~HeadShot~. Furthermore, the branched energy trail persists in the ether for a few moments, just long enough to understand where the ~sniper~ is stationed. I honestly prefer the Q3A railgun, simpler and more immediate. The Impact Hammer has been upgraded into a Shield Gun, which allows you to create a frontal energy shield from shots raining down on you, but has little effect from side splash damage. The recharge channeled into the barrel emits an annoying noise, but the effect is all the more devastating the more charge we put into the compressor. It is a melee weapon, and is more effective than its predecessor. Furthermore, the barrier allows us to ~cushion~ landings made from exaggerated heights. The UT2003 paraphernalia (second part) The Ion Painter has replaced the Ripper (Lance-Lame), although it has no relation to the latter weapon. In fact the I.P. it is composed of two parts: a sniper rifle, which is used to ~link~ the target to a satellite, which will emit a very powerful energy beam, able to literally disintegrate the loser on duty. To have the target, however, you have to frame it by pressing the fire button long enough to allow the satellite gun to receive the data it needs to emit the deadly beam. Once the coordinates are transmitted, there is no escape for the target! Too bad that the Ion Painter is only present in very few maps and the shot is single for each rifle collected. The Redeemer, has undergone very few changes. The only real difference is that the effect of the explosion of the ~mini-atomic bomb~ has been made even more spectacular and devastating, creating a small earthquake near ~ground-zero~. The other remaining weapons are the Bio Rifle, identical to its predecessor but with a more aggressive look. The Rocket Launcher which fires one slower rocket in the first mode and up to three rockets in the second. The splash damage is less efficient than in the past and the ~target~ easily misses the target. Furthermore, the path followed by the ~targeted~ rocket does not make any ~curve~, following more or less a direct route and with few variations. On closer inspection it is a ~weakened~ version of the old missile launcher, which alone allowed to inflict serious damage to the ~ammucchiate~. Even the Flak-Cannon has undergone a ~downgrade~, making the range of shots more visible and ~direct~, with a ~rambling~ effect almost completely disappeared. The second mode shoots a less lethal shrapnel than the previous one in the splash damage. Finally, the Translocator has been made more user-friendly, with a fast rating but limited to five continuous ~jets~ that reload with a certain latency. This ~utility~ has become, over time, an ~indispensable~ tactical move, which allows you to travel long distances in a few moments and on alternative routes that are impossible to do ~on foot~. With the first mode of fire you launch the disc, while with the second you teleport yourself. If you shoot the disc at a opponent, you can implement a ~teleportation~ frag, even if in practice it is difficult to perform, given the extreme speed of the game. It has also undergone a ~downgrade~, but it was a must, given that the previous version it had no ~limits~. Character models and artificial intelligence. Another substantial change is made by the character models, completely redone and with a tenfold number of polygons compared to that of the old UT. We have several genres, all with their own ~genetic~ characteristics, which basically change both the features and, in the case of computer-managed ~bots~, also the attributes such as the preferred weapon, accuracy, agility, tactics and aggression. The ~Juggernaut~ models are all armored humans with an exoskeleton, making them more massive and violent, especially when wielding devastating weapons (try playing with three machine-gun-wielding Juggernauts firing in unison in front of you and tell me if they don't look like the horsemen of the Apocalypse!). The ~mercenaries~ are very similar, and in the absence of an exoskeleton that weighs them down, they are more agile and snappy. The ~Egyptian~ are inspired and mixed by a mix between the homonymous civilization and the Stargate film, with some changes to avoid possible copyright disputes. They have more or less balanced values, with a certain predilection for tactics. The ~Alien~ race, on the other hand, is very aggressive and excels in almost all attributes. The ~robots~ have greater accuracy brought about by an aiming system similar to the ~Terminator~, while the ~Night~ humans, clearly inspired by Horror, have their strong points in aggressiveness and in ~heavy~ weapons. Obviously each race has its strong and weak characters, but this is only, and we want to emphasize it, in the case of ~bots~ and not in normal games between human players, where the models have leveled attributes in perfect balance. The animations, of course, are excellent from all points of view, if we also add the ~crash dummies~ effect after death. Furthermore, the different ~families~ of models, if on the one hand they increase the variability in the graphics, they also have a negative effect on the progressive consumption of the ram, which must store and manage an enormous amount of data, the more ~different~ models there are in field. In fact, each of them, having its own features, textures, etc..., tend to have a heavy impact on the system, especially if with only 128256 MBytes. Finally the taunts are followed by a series of 'taunt' animations, which are excellently executed in sometimes even 'vulgar' gestures. The intelligence of bots follows the evolution of that of UT. It has been improved a lot, but although it is very close to the ~cunning~ behavior of humans, we always prefer to play with them, since we are... ~unpredictable~ by nature, and we never follow fixed patterns such as those used, well or badly, from the computer. The sound. The quality of the sound effects is unquestionably high, but for the most part one has the distinct impression of having already heard them in some other game, bringing back a feeling of deja-vu to mind. Some maps have almost inaudible musical accompaniment, but which manages to imbue the action with an atmosphere worthy of an action movie. The exclamations of the ~voiceovers~ are all from ~macho-man~, even if for the countdown I preferred the ~aphonic-female~ one of the beta version. The taunts are characteristic for each character, and each of these follows the characteristic line of the ~race~ to which they belong. In the end, however, we tend to deactivate them, so as not to be flooded with audio messages galore (can we define it as audio-spam?). The effects of the weapons are all of a very high level, even if they possess little ~violence~, apart from the ~budda-budda~ of the machine-gun. The other side effects are normal. Final comment. Summing up the two previous partial comments, it almost seems that UT2003 should be rejected. For returnsere the most ~interactive~ final judgement, I ask you three questions: 1) Is the power of your computer such as to run the game without loss of fluidity? 2) Are you satisfied with now ~inflated~ game modes, not to say ~outdated~? 3) Do you accept ~recycled~ paraphernalia from the old version? If you answered YES to these three questions, then UT2003 can suit you right now. If, on the other hand, at least one of these answers is negative, either you ~satisfy~ or brush up on UT and Q3A, which is the best thing you can do. UT2003 is destined to become, over time, the FPS that will supplant Quake III Arena. But not today, with a whole series of bugs, lackluster maps, changes to be made to weapon balancing and above all, with inadequate computers to fully enjoy its potential. It almost seems that Epic has released a beta version instead of the final one. The numerous grumblings of the entire community of fans are a concrete testimony of this Hamletic doubt. A million polygons, dozens of special effects or ultra-detailed models aren't enough to make a game a masterpiece, you also need a bit of imagination and some ~substantial~ novelties to thicken a genre now saturated with products that are all the same, otherwise runs the risk of boring fans before due. This time I don't want to assign the numerical vote, so as not to piss off the most ardent fans (including myself). Having finished the review I can finally uninstall the game. In the near future, after at least a couple of fixes and some bonuspacks are released, I'll decide if it's worth re-installing. Premise In this third and final part of the review, we will primarily deal with the weapons, making a comparison with those of the old UT, and highlighting the positive and negative effects brought about by the new changes. We will also make an overview of the different models / characters created with extreme care by the Epic Games graphics, with a careful examination of the artificial intelligence, which has evolved in this new version. Finally, a brief comment on the sound effects and the inevitable final comment will follow, which will take into account the two ~days~ published previously.", "date": "2002-11-11", "grade": null}
