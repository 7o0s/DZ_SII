In the case of Kumo Lumo, the new free action game developed by Blitz Games, the planet in question is not the Earth, but a small (really small!) corner of paradise where trees grow lush, mountains touch the sky and large whales splash around happily in the sea. The entire ecosystem is based on the ability of a sentient cloud, Kumo Lumo, to bring its ~magic~ rain to small green areas to transform them into forests, to hills to become mountain ranges, to lakes to become oceans, and so on. Street. The same rain will be used by this particular character to defend his home from aliens, who cannot survive contact with water (as in the film ~Alien Nation~, in short...), as well as to repair the damage caused by them, for example the outbreak of fires and the birth of dangerous volcanoes. Space ~ground troops~ are not alone, however, and they have organized their assault together with fearsome black ~clouds~ that invade Kumo Lumo's airspace and can damage it simply by touching it. In short, there will be many opponents and tasks to be completed within the game's full-bodied single player campaign, organized into missions that at first appear as simple tutorials but gradually become more complex, requiring us to eliminate a certain number of enemies, extinguishing certain fires, and so on. An indicator placed in the upper part of the screen takes into account our performance, with particular attention to the number of forests that we manage to give birth to, a factor that will exponentially improve the final evaluation and therefore the achievement of the traditional three stars. How do you control a cloud? The control system adopted by Blitz Games for Kumo Lumo works by default with gestures: dragging a finger on the touch screen scrolls the planet, in the same way it is possible to move the cloud and, finally, ~punching~ it causes rain. This is not a very practical solution, however, because it prevents a fast and dynamic approach, forcing us to perform the actions one at a time, in particular it is not possible to move Kumo Lumo and the scenario at the same time. The tilt alternative already works better, but lacks the precision needed when avoiding dark clouds to avoid taking damage. Fortunately, there is also a traditional option, with an invisible virtual stick in the lower left of the screen and icons on the right to bring down the rain and emit lightning when necessary. In this way it is really possible to move quickly, to eliminate dozens of enemies with a nice wave of drops and to avoid any pitfall. There is only one small problem: the current version of the game (1.1) suffers from heavy slowdowns when the levels fill up with objects and, at the same time, we try to pour rain in profusion. We tried running it on both the iPhone 4S and the new iPad to understand if the defect could depend on one or the other device, but unfortunately the results were the same and we hope that a timely update will solve the problem. Because everything else is there, even very nice and colorful graphics, characterized by a simple but pleasant style.", "date": "2012-10-16", "grade": "8.0"}
