Pierpy always likes Rihanna a lot; Andry goes crazy for that Taylor Swift breakaway; the Tanzy says he appreciates Miley Cyrus for her sobriety; the Umby, who is very refined, prefers Lady Gaga; Matty says he'd gladly give his gingerbread to Rita Ora; the only one who never participates in the discussion is Vincy, because he only listens to heavy metal and electronic music made with Game Boy sounds. Anyway, the writer is a super fan of Katy Perry and her beautiful pops, so when he heard about the release of Katy Perry Pop, he immediately grabbed his iPhone and ran to the bathroom... In Katy Perry Pop, the beautiful singer lays her hands on you... but only to take your wallet Give us the Kardashian Unfortunately we immediately realized that the term ~pop~ of the title is to be understood only as a masculine musical genre: at that point our interest in the game had already plunged into the abyss of oblivion, but we decided to go ahead anyway and try our hand at this new milestone from Glu, already responsible for that armed robbery disguised as an application that was Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Evidently not satisfied with having generated over 40 million dollars in profits with the official mobile game of Kanye West's wife, the software house aims straight to make another trillion dollars with what is in fact the same game but with Katy Perry and pop music instead of Kim Kardashian and... that stuff she does for a living (no one has figured it out yet). The starting points are exactly the same, with the user playing a loser who does a poor job who casually meets the celebrity of the moment who takes him under his protective wing and helps him soar towards the star system. All this translates - again - into a sort of hyper-simplified management in which you have to make your character complete a variety of tasks and objectives to continue the climb to success. In an alternative dimension where watching paint dry on the wall is considered an extreme sport, such premises might even appear interesting, but in the real world Katy Perry Pop is in many ways an even inferior product (God forgive us for what we are to write) to Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. In fact, if Glu's previous hustler-title played a lot on self-irony, explicitly admitting the frivolity and vacuity of a certain type of American star, here everything is taken a little too seriously, with great pippolotti on concepts such as believing in oneself yourself, loving your fans, sending a message to the world, cultivating your artistic vein and blah blah blah. All stuff that would send you into jujube broth if you were a 14-year-old girl who considers Katy Perry as the only bearer of the absolute truth, but you are narrow-minded and materialistic men who are still reading this article because they are glued to the screen by the hand invisible of the brilliant prose of the writer. While we're here, we can nonetheless critically analyze some objective aspects of the product, such as an all in all pleasant audiovisual sector which is however literally submerged by a frankly embarrassing amount of icons, menus and indicators, not to mention a particularly sneaky free to play model and peppered with advertisements and notifications that violate all existing regulations on privacy: things that may even make our skin crawl but which in the end will lead Glu executives to buy their fifteenth Porsche in our face that we stand here saying it's a shame. Assuming that they are right and they are doing everything right, we can simply say in our small way that Katy Perry Pop is a boring and useless game that we would like to forget as soon as possible.", "date": "2015-12-26", "grade": "4.0"}
