In a world of caciaroni open world and online games focused on competition, Uppercut Games has decided to go against the tide again and follow up on Submerged (2015) by taking up its formula to expand and improve it. We are therefore faced with a game completely focused on exploration and contemplation, in which there are no fights or mundane activities to distract from the scenario, and whose gameplay continually invites you to observe and, perhaps, stop, but without ever blocking the player. History Submerged: Hidden Depths tells the story of Miku, already the protagonist of the first episode, who, together with her brother, in this sequel in excellent health and also usable in some sections, decides to stop the Massa, or black plant, a gigantic poisonous creeper for humans who is taking over the ruined city where the adventure takes place. The only one who can do it is the protagonist, endowed with a power that makes her immune to the harmful effects of the plant's ichor and which allows her to transform its evil essence into beautiful flowers. In terms of the game, it all boils down to having to explore the city to go in search of ten seeds, endowed with such power as to destroy the mass. The first few minutes of the game are the only ones to be guided, in the sense that they serve to present the scenario to us and to introduce us to the few mechanics that we will have to consider in order to succeed in the mission. Once the first seed has been found, the place where the second is found will be shown to us, but in fact we will be free to go around wherever we want, perhaps in search of the other seeds or some hidden object. The scenery is completely submerged by water, so exploration takes place most of the time by boat. When the two boys reach a place that can be visited on foot, they must first find the docking point and then moor the boat. Usually it is not difficult to identify where the seeds are, since these are large ruins dominated by the Massa, while to see the places that contain some special objects you need to pay more attention, even if it must be said that they are not essential to finish the game. There is a telescope to help us identify our objectives, but honestly we used it very little, because we never really felt lost. After all, just open the map to see which areas have not yet been explored and therefore have a direction to follow. Gameplay In any case, having got off the boat, Miku or her brother must explore the ruin of the day far and wide. To do this they can run around and cling to ledges and platforms in the manner of a Nathan Drake or a Lara Croft. Everything is managed automatically, so there is no danger of falling below. It's also not possible to launch from the platforms, so there's no fear of leaning too far or making a wrong move by crashing. In this sense Submerged: Hidden Depths is a very friendly title, which does not aim to challenge the player in any way. Not even the small puzzles with which the maps are scattered are never a big problem, since in most cases they require you to bring a certain object to a certain point to unlock a given passage and that's it. In fact, something more could have been done from this point of view, just to increase the variety, but we imagine that the will of the developers was precisely to never stop the player for too long, so as not to break the flow of the adventure. From a narrative point of view Submerged: Hidden Depths tells its story with small interlude sequences and through texts related to hidden objects. The latter are even optional, because there is no obligation to find them, but they somehow enrich the experience and give the player something to do contextually in the game world. If we want, it is the scenario itself that tells us a lot about what happened in the past and gives meaning to our efforts. The observation of the ruins of our civilization is the best part of the experience: Uppercut Games, despite not having unlimited resources, has managed to create some very beautiful views, which alone are worth the trip. In some cases the production limits are all visible, but fortunately they do not spoil the general impression of a conscious and very determined artistic direction, which manages to express the grandiose beauty of a world in which human beings, victims of themselves, can just gaze at the destruction he has created. A separate note deserves the excellent soundtrack, designed to cradleand sensations created by the gameplay, without distracting from exploration. A really great job.", "date": "2020-12-10", "grade": "8.0"}
