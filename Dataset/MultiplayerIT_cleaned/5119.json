{"name": "Earth's Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/177789-earths-dawn-beat-em-up-20.html", "text": "Earth's Dawn is a classic console game (it is absolutely no coincidence that it is made by the very Japanese OneorEight) which in the logic of maximizing profits has found space in the increasingly endless Steam catalog, as well as in the Microsoft and Sony stores. This is not a title capable of climbing to the top floors of wish lists considering that the mechanics, however revised and modernized, are fundamentally based on the solid cornerstones of the beat 'em up genre, to which are added elements from the hack & slash for a potentially interesting result which, however, is not completely convincing. A pity because some ideas could also have turned out to be interesting... Behind a good aesthetic impact hides a repetitive game, but with deep mechanics Aliens again The E.B.E. they are an aggressive alien species who have conquered the world thanks to their practically indestructible genetic makeup; however, the forces of the resistance managed to combine the fabrics with ultra-resistant alloys to create armor capable of putting humans and invaders on the same level. The ANTI forces, of which the player is obviously a part, must lead a counteroffensive to liberate New York and, through Wisconsin, reach Alaska where the villains are based. We don't think we can say that the writers have particularly racked their brains to give birth to such a plot, and attempts to make it interesting through all too cheap cut-scenes that link one mission to another turn out to be clumsy and ineffective. If, despite the premises, the plot still manages to excite, there is also the obstacle of the Japanese language in which the dialogues develop: fortunately there are subtitles (in English). The advice, however, is to rape the start button (use of the keyboard is unthinkable) to skip the useless side dish and get to know our ANTI-Hero after having chosen its features. Earth's Dawn is presented as the most classic of side-scrolling fighting games where some almost lifeless sections alternate with others infested with monsters of various kinds. To send them to the creator you need to use a futuristic sword, if necessary assisted by a machine gun that shoots rubber pellets that are very useful for breaking through the energy barriers against which the white weapon can do nothing. As you progress, you also increase the level of the protagonist, just like in an RPG, so you acquire new skills and better equipment. Base of operation After the warm-up mission, a hub is proposed that allows you to develop the hero by creating and upgrading weapons and armor and deepening the skill tree. The latter represents one of the most unfortunate aspects of OneorEight's production because it is so branched that it is impossible to consult it in its entirety even by applying a zoom level that even hides the skill descriptions. After all, the entire customization system is excessively elaborate: in particular, we don't understand the usefulness of spending resources to upgrade a low-level weapon when with the same one we can create a superior one. In order to proceed with the main story it is necessary to wait for a gigantic counter to reach zero: in the meantime, in addition to dedicating oneself to the character, one can / must face secondary missions that unlock further skills. These are mini levels usually without a final boss where defeat does not force you to start over but results in the reduction of time. However, it is worth trying to fail as little as possible in order to complete as many as possible between one main quest and another. Given the nature of the title and the low interaction with the scenario, not many variations on the theme can be expected: some involve destroying a certain number of enemies in the pre-established time, others collecting objects and so on. Depending on the fighting style adopted, you receive an evaluation: by obtaining the highest values you are rewarded with further skills. Great premise but... Apart from a peculiar super deformed stylistic line, graphically the Japanese game refers to the classics of the Vanillaware compatriots: therefore the concept of sprites is back in vogue, with hand-drawn protagonists and enemies, as well as the backdrops. After a promising first impact, thanks to a refined color palette in which pink and gray marry successfully, and where combos and lighting effects allow you to create postcard screenshots, monotony and repetition soon rise to powertitivity. The scenarios are all very similar and devoid of elements that would have made it possible to fall in love with the atmosphere: for example, the New York setting could have been recalled with some details which instead is limited to smoking rubble and a couple of subway tunnels. Even the monsters suffer from conformity: there are about a dozen unique models, which are then slightly modified, especially in the coloring, along the hundred levels that make up the Earth's Dawn offer. The number is one that guarantees, on paper, a considerable longevity, but as written above it seems that OneorEight has focused more on quantity than on quality. The combat system, which develops as the plot progresses, begins with a somewhat poor set of moves, especially due to the low effectiveness of the rifle. With a few rare exceptions, enemies can be defeated by furiously pressing the primary attack key and the dodge key which allows you to move behind them. Precisely in this regard it is worth pointing out a serious bug that often penalizes the action: in fact, it is not possible to shoot and at the same time change the direction of fire. In practice, this translates into the difficulty of running behind an opponent and weakening his defenses with the rifle, because there is the risk of opening fire before having turned the soldier's gaze. On top of that we experience other annoying technical flaws, such as the soundtrack that pops in and out at will, as well as the force feedback function. If you manage to overcome the obstacle of the first hours, the game begins to be captivating because, by mastering its mechanics with ever greater malice, you can appreciate the upgrades that are gradually unlocked; at the same time the enemies become more difficult and the challenge less trivial than it might have appeared during the first starts. Unfortunately, incredibly enough, there's no way to get help from a friend - a serious shortcoming that probably wouldn't have cost anything and which is confirmation that Earth's Dawn, behind a refined aesthetic, is basically a missed opportunity.", "date": "2016-12-19", "grade": "6.0"}
