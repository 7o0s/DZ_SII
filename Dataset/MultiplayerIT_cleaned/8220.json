{"name": "Hotline Miami", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110430-hotline-miami-una-brutale-festa-in-maschera.html", "text": "Demonized by family associations and viewed with smugness by a picky slice of gamers, critics and developers, the use of violence in video games, especially when gratuitous and extreme, continues to be a hot topic often at the center of controversy. We have gone too far with the celebration of blood, sex and violence. We have to stop, exhorts a controversial Warren Spector, while those of Manhunt 2, Bully and Rule of Rose are just some of the cases in which a witch hunt has been amplified by disinformation in the media and institutional bigotry. With Hotline Miami, the Swedish developers Jonatan Sderstrm and Dennis Wedin wanted to cement the role of violence, building around it an entire action game, frenetic, original and bloody, legitimized by a crazy plot and dehumanized masked characters, but which finds in a unique and in an incessant gameplay its raison d'tre. Home service Set in late 80s Miami, Dennaton's game puts you in the role of a killer whose story slowly emerges through a series of apparent flashbacks. A cryptic phone call introduces the levels, each of which is set in a building full of armed individuals to be beaten, drilled with shots or sliced with a katana. This would be enough to mobilize the Moige or to give birth to yet another bogeyman in the pages of Panorama, but the plot in Hotline Miami, although narrated in a fascinatingly enigmatic way, is only a secondary frame. From crossing a large room full of armed guards to pulling an Uzi from the corpse of a waiter who was shot shortly before, every action in the game is based on a single motivation: to kill first. The Smash TV-style overhead view and floating camera allow you to have a clear idea of what to expect inside each room, and since you're killed with a single hit, planning your moves becomes essential. Added to this is the noise of firearms, which is able to alert enemies in the level and therefore encourages you to use melee attacks in stealth actions. But the stealth moments rarely slow down the pace of the game, and in fact more often than not result in lightning actions, instant kills and rapid movement from room to room. All enriched by a variety of situations unexpected for a top-down shooter. A typical moment sees us enter a bathroom, stun a guard by hitting him with a door, smash his companion's head on the toilet, steal his sawed-off shotgun and finish off the first one, still on the floor, with a sharp blow. As another enemy approaches attracted by the shot we decide to hide in the shower, waiting for the right moment to hit the snoop with a crowbar. Even if there are scenes  la Scarface, in which one can make a massacre by standing in front of a door with a loaded machine gun, it is not always so easy to get away with it, not only due to the general shortage of ammunition or the aggressiveness of the guards, but also due to a whole unfortunate series of bugs related to artificial intelligence and collisions. However, these are problems due more to a hasty launch than to the limitations of GameMaker, Sderstrm's favorite development tool for years. However, Dennaton resorted to remedial measures in record time, publishing a patch that corrects part of the defects, but despite its various problems Hotline Miami remains an extremely satisfying and frenetic action experience, perhaps too biased towards trial-and-error, yet in able to keep you glued to the screen and have fun during the twenty levels that make up the main adventure (in the meantime, a DLC is already planned). Brute violence is the pillar of the entire title, however the feeling you get while playing is not an unjustified sadism, rather the pleasure of a genuine challenge: each room of a building represents a real enigma to be overcome as quickly as possible , and we don't continue for the simple sake of eliminating enemies in the bloodiest ways. The action takes place so quickly and repeats itself so many times that the killings are almost depersonalized, and only once the level is over, when the protagonist has to go back to his car by walking backwards through the entire building, does one finally realize the trail of blood left behind. It is precisely this passage from selfless extermination to becoming aware of one's actions the best-successful narrative device of the game, perhaps the only one that really hits the mark. At the start of each mission, the unnamed protagonist performs a fixed ritual, wearing a maskin the form of an animal. In addition to giving a very special charm to the narrative, its characters and their sporadic dialogues, these disguises have more or less evident effects on the gameplay thanks to some bonuses, ranging from a greater number of bullets to the possibility of moving faster, passing through the ability to see in the dark or silence firearms. Unlocking new weapons and new masks makes it possible to face levels already completed in a different way and with a different approach, while there is no shortage of goodies and references for a few connoisseurs, and the names of the masks and the animals represented are actually tributes to other more or less known independent developers. Yet it is in the artistic style and in the psychedelic alchemy between graphics and music that Sderstrm does not deny himself even this time: the author of Clean Asia! and Mondo Agency still combines pulsating and electronic rhythms with a visual component made of acid colors and retro styles, where a particular mention goes to the excellent soundtrack composed by artists such as M.O.O.N, Perturbator and Jasper Bryne, which gives the right energy in the most adrenaline-pumping and don't even spare a few bars that wink (the ear?) at Drive.", "date": "2012-10-30", "grade": "8.5"}
