Looking at it, it can recall some enigmatic solutions of Monument Valley and Helsing's Fire, the graphic setting of Square Enix's GO and also the perspective illusions of the old Echocrome, but in reality they are only stylistic suggestions or inspirations, because the substance is decidedly different and largely unpublished. A particularly strange thing about the game is its story, which unfolds silently through some skits at the end of the levels and is in some cases strangely dark and violent, resulting even more disturbing for the stark contrast it creates with the minimalist and graphic style relaxing that characterizes it, underlining in another sense that dance of opposites which is the basis of its own game structure, in the relationship between lights and shadows. It is not clear whether the effect is intended, the fact is that it is not easy to understand whether the protagonist, a funny little man named Obe, is actually a positive character in all respects and some moments in the story stage a brutality that leaves a bit dumbfounded. During a peaceful walk in the forest, Obe comes into contact with a mysterious lantern, with which he is able to change the surrounding environment through the alternation of light and shadow. In a short time, the protagonist becomes almost obsessed with the power of the lantern, so much so that he resorts to rather violent methods to defend it from the predators that inhabit the various settings of the game, in turn represented in a childish and grotesque but perhaps even more disturbing for this reason. It must be said that this general strangeness does nothing but give a very particular character to Where darkness rests, which manages in this way to distance itself a bit from the line drawn by other similar productions. Lights and shadows The levels are displayed in most cases in full screen with an isometric shot, so you have a complete view of the scenario, within which Obe moves simply by touching the point where you want him to go. Moving, the protagonist with the lantern projects shadows in the surrounding environment, which move dynamically according to the position of Obe and any elements that stand out within the circle of light: when the shadows pass over some elements of the scenario, these change in prearranged ways and the solution of the puzzles is therefore based on the right way of projecting light and shadow and on the correct sequence of movements to be carried out to reach the exit of the levels. The passage of the shadow, for example, can rebuild a destroyed bridge or reveal passages and open doors to allow continuation. Level after level, the mechanics become more complicated with the addition of new elements: the possibility of moving some objects by touching them directly and thus adding new ways of casting shadows, pressing switches to activate mechanisms, more or less directly controlling other characters on the screen in so as to act on other switches and so on, making the whole course of the game quite stimulating even if it is a bit difficult to understand from time to time what are the elements put on the field in each single level, given that they are inserted or removed without linear logic. The level design is a bit discontinuous and alternates truly brilliant moments with more phoned puzzles or less clean functioning, in any case the progression remains at an excellent pace thanks to the originality of the game structure and also to its strange story, which easily leads to wanting to see where the funny but also creepy Obe goes. It is possible to encounter some glitches that sometimes do not make the solution of the puzzles clear, as well as some uncertainty in the pathfinding of the protagonist in some particular situations but these are really trifles. There is also a notable variety in the design of the environments, all represented with a good dose of atmosphere despite the minimalist graphics, prompting us to discover the new worlds that follow each other every five levels. In this general originality, the clearly derivative elements that stand out in the construction of the scenarios clash, with geometric buildings that even a little too closely resemble Monument Valley and do not do justice to a production that instead seems to arise from decidedly peculiar ideas. On the other hand, the art direction in terms of graphics perhaps still shows some immaturity, aEven if the ability to build evocative atmospheres seems to be already rooted in Game Revenant, as demonstrated by the excellent soundtrack. The game is translated into Italian (there is only a little written text) and consists of about 35 levels divided into 7 different settings: considering that each single level is usually completed in a few minutes, except for the most difficult moments which can take longer to be understood, it follows that longevity is not particularly high.", "date": "2018-09-29", "grade": "8.0"}
