The specialization of the Philadelphia-based team in fact concerns a rather niche genre in the videogame panorama, within which Shenandoah has already published titles such as March to Glory, Battle of the Bulge and Drive on Moscow through Slitherine. The latter is now experiencing a third youth a few years after its first release on the iPad, subsequently accompanied by the arrival of the game on PC. Drive on Moscow has in fact arrived a few days ago on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, for which it undoubtedly belongs to a rather atypical genre: for this very reason we ventured into its PlayStation 4 version with a pinch of additional curiosity, with the aim to understand if the game can also be able to have its say on this type of platform. Let's find out together. Fatal winter Drive on Moscow makes historical accuracy one of its most important points, exploring the offensive of German forces in Russia which began in October 1941 and ended in January 1942. The so-called Operation Typhoon began in the early period of the autumn, during which the Nazis managed to get to the gates of Moscow. However, they were not able to conquer it, as with the arrival of the cold the Russian army rejected Hitler's soldiers, putting in place a counter-offensive that would then give the fate of the Second World War the direction that we have all learned from the books of history. From this point of view, Drive on Moscow follows exactly what happened at the time, starting from Operation Typhoon which is the first of three available scenarios, accompanied by the entire Battle of Moscow. They can be played against the computer or against another human being in hotseat mode: in both cases, before going onto the battlefield the player must choose whether to play a German or Russian general, selecting the level in the case of a single game of difficulty of the opponent controlled by the CPU, between two different alternatives. The game takes place over a pre-established number of rounds, which are in turn divided into what are called impulses: in this phase it is possible to choose the forces present in an area of the map, making them perform the desired movements before moving on to the next phase . Depending on the deployment and the scenario chosen for the game, it is possible to count on several victory conditions: to be successful in Operation Typhoon, for example, one can conquer Moscow or obtain a certain number of victory points by conquering some key territories. Playstation 4 trophies The cold battles of Drive on Moscow are accompanied by twenty-nine Trophies on PlayStation 4. Of these, one is Platinum, five Gold, thirteen Silver and ten Bronze. Like the conquest of Moscow, getting to ~platinize~ the Shenandoah title is a fine strategist's goal, reachable in the various maps and campaign difficulties only after having acquired a certain familiarity with the game dynamics. The die is cast In general, the dynamics of Drive on Moscow are very reminiscent of those of board games, not surprisingly mentioned at the beginning of the review. The two-dimensional map is in fact comparable to that of a classic board, on which we find ourselves moving like RisiKo! the forces that make up our array. Also the latter naturally follow the mechanical and infantry units present during the Second World War, allowing the German forces to count on an impressive use of means while the Russians can make use of additional units such as those on horseback or paratroopers, useful for penetrate behind enemy lines in case of need. Although there is a tutorial that explains the basic functions of Drive on Moscow, mastering all the dynamics requires a lot of patience, confirming that the title is not intended for those who expect immediate success. The difficulties also lie in the historical accuracy that Shenandoah has put into Drive on Moscow: each scenario brings with it a different situation, in which one of the two forces is at a disadvantage compared to the other. Success in a single game, especially if you want to reverse the outcome of the story, requires careful planning: in the event of battle, for example, the presence of vegetation or other elements can be a decisive ally for the victory of whoever is in defence. The areas crossed by the river can instead make movements less simple, not to mention what can happen when the bite of the frost begins to make you feelhis teeth on the troops. To give everything a touch of unpredictability is the way in which the outcomes of the clashes are calculated: while defining a range in the preview of the battle that identifies its possible outcomes, the game engine randomly generates the final result. In this way it is guaranteed that one game can hardly be the same as another, even by applying the same strategies that proved us right in the past. As regards the console version specifically, it cannot be said that the transition from the touch/mouse interface to the gamepad was completely painless: in some phases the operations in fact become a bit too cumbersome, whereas on the iPad and PC a simple tap or click to complete what you wanted.
