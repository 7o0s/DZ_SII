If he is also broke we will see him together, studying the numbers that the Kyoto house will be able to collect month after month in what promises to be a two-faced year: on the one hand the 3DS that grinds successes, on the other WiiU which is facing the challenges recently revealed with little courage. And if the flag to carry is too high for Mario, here comes the funny big brother to support him. In reality, the proclaimed ~year of Louis~ is already drawing to a close; with the return after almost 11 years of absence from the scenes of the Luigi's Mansion brand (reviewed here), the imminent new chapter of the Mario & Luigi franchise and the downloadable content that we are now examining, one can ironically joke about how much the annual arc of Iwata has been composed for not even 6 months. Small things, destined to be washed away by the quality of the offer. And if in the face of what is proposed on a portable one can only make a hat and run to buy a 3DS, the situation changes by analyzing what in the history of Nintendo is, in all respects, the first paid DLC on a fixed console. New Super Luigi U erases any reference to the family from the title, indicating a new exclusive adventure for the green plumber, preparing to show a sort of revisited New Super Mario Bros 2.0 to owners of the Nintendo flagship. The time that doesn't exist Let's get straight to the point: New Super Luigi U fits into the brand's ranks in a somewhat particular way, throwing forward the stone of good ideas but shyly withdrawing his hand. The legacy on his shoulders is not as light as one might think as it aims to maintain a platforming structure, which over the last few years has inevitably faced criticism in its reinterpretation but which continues to grind sales, a sign that the franchise is still strong. Despite the absence of quality peaks that amaze, Nintendo once again manages to formulate a combination in its winning ~small~. A good mix of adrenaline and gameplay, but without daring that extra gear that has been required for too long now. After the December release of the original on WiiU, we therefore once again entered the Mushroom Kingdom to see what a Luigi-branded adventure can offer. Kyoto is not deaf to fan feedback and is committed now more than ever to finding an intelligent balance between development times, marketing and profitable sales, and the task is never easy when it comes to their flagship brand; between the expectations of the future and the stars of the past lies a game that fields a different structure than usual, with different elements on which the gameplay focus is based. It would be unfair to say that New Super Luigi U doesn't contain some nice level design gimmicks; while often not as long-lived as hoped, some sections shine with that Japanese genius that has allowed the brand to embrace any demographic with ease. All this is combined with a context designed to develop in the temporal axis, with a framework based on a completion that focuses more on speed than on exploration. Its downloadable content soul has therefore provided, inevitably, a rapid, immediate level construction, which forces the player to complete the environments in less than a hundred seconds in-game, which correspond to much fewer seconds in reality. Having imposed this limit brings a level design into the womb that makes traveling between the sections adrenaline-pumping without forgetting the collectibles, where the collection of coins is, however, in most cases, a mere prerogative of skill at the controls and not of a 'passionate research within the level. The choice to adopt a concise time factor therefore places the emphasis on the feeling of adrenaline that one feels in engaging the challenge in progress, thus leaving behind the more sophisticated design of the predecessor and sometimes making it a fast binary of reflexes. It is a road that has become necessary to give personality to the title without sacrificing the typical elements; certainly understandable choice, but which fails to give the product that further impetus that one can expect. In fact, it is not uncommon to approach the final flag with fun just to soften the smile and wonder if it's really already all over. Perhaps the little time available to develop more extensive and complex levels or perhaps the desire to emphasize a downloadable content experience have guided this development philosophy; the fact is that out of it it is a pleasant complement to the original, but with sometimes immediate completion that leaves room for the desire to want more. All new, little nuegg Having now reached the fifth iteration of the New brand, there is no doubt that Nintendo must give a refreshing and convincing shock to the gaming system. Hiroyuki Kimura, manager of section n4 of Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) and responsible for the New Super Mario Bros series, carries the banner of simplification aimed at rejuvenating the two dimensions from the first episode for DS. But with a system now well known by fans, Nintendo should not rest on the easy laurels of the sales of its most loved and famous brand. Luigi's adventure certainly has points of pleasure, thanks to the somewhat innovative ideas for the saga, but it will not be easy to convince WiiU buyers to spend  19.90 for the DLC (requires the original) or 39. 90 for the prestigious boxed boxed version in green to be released at the end of July. It is an important price to pay to enjoy the new levels proposed and end-of-the-world bosses, renewed in the pattern but not in the difficulty, still firmly calibrated towards easy use, with a final section that does not differ from the original. In purely control terms, the greater height reached by Luigi's jumps makes it easier to reach high parts as well as easily overcome obstacles obstructing the run, thus resulting in a character attribute that simplifies the situation, despite the inertia deficit from which he suffers . Comparing the value and the defect, the balance leans in favor of the first course: it is true, Luigi has always jumped more than Mario, but being a dedicated DLC it would not have spoiled a level design built to make its use intelligent, satisfying and varied. A condition that is satisfied throughout the adventure, but without constancy, alternating convincing phases with other less so. It is certainly not the technical sector that has remained unchanged to attract displeasure, but the feeling that Nintendo has significantly lowered the claims of its two-dimensional brand. Multiplayer returns to enrich the offer, even if not with the same impact as New Super Mario Bros U: the addition of Ruboniglio, who cannot enjoy boosts but is untouchable by enemies, is a find suitable for newbies, the compromise fairer to offer a way to conclude each level even to those who lack skill at the controls. The most successful part of the December precursor was certainly related to the extremely hardcore challenges inserted alongside the main quest; unfortunately Nintendo has chosen not to add new ones, and let's not hide the fact that it would have been fun to try the different types of control offered by Luigi. Maybe it will be for his next adventure. New Super Luigi U could have been more, but it offers good gimmicks and an unexpected structure", "date": "2013-06-24", "grade": "7.5"}
