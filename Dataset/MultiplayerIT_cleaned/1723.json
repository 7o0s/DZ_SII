Just as it's not a good thing that the words don't even come to continue. Let's make an effort! As in all self-respecting fighting games, and which do not have a large number of years on their shoulders, this XMND offers us a fairly large number of usable characters (24 to be precise) that start from that great piece of Betsy's polygonal model , to get to the horrendous Toad via Cyclope and Magneto, to the great delight of all fans of the series. There are numerous options available even if quite usual, namely Story, Arcade, Versus, Survival, Team and Time Attack of which only the last two deserve a slight deepening. With the ~Team~ you will choose four characters who will fight one after the other, after the death of the previous partner, with as many puppets driven by the CPU, with the Time Attack you will simply see the challenge open with the time necessary to bring down the number greater than opponents. And if up to this point everything is not very original, the combat and control system appears a little more innovative. First of all, the directional cross is used most of the time, which allows you to perform forward, backward and jump movements as well as the various moves (and I would like to add that the criticisms of the inconvenience of the GC pad cross have proved to be partly unfounded). The main analog stick is used (practically never given the uselessness of the act) for moving in depth in the 3D environments, the two types of punches (slightly different from each other) are delegated to the A and B keys while pressing the ~beans~ X and Y command the two types of kicks. L is used for grappling and R for parrying counters. Furthermore, with the C stick, flying characters can take flight, but even here we are faced with a whole series of wasted possibilities. The energy bar is divided into two sections: one green and one red. Immediately one hit the green bar will go down ~uncovering~ the underlying red, but, if you don't take any more hits, the green will slowly go up until it covers the entire remaining red bar (certainly down, but to a lesser extent than the green one). This allows you to recover some energy since only when the green bar is completely finished will the match be concluded regardless of the red one. But the bars are not finished since there is also a second one. This is divided into three sectors which will be recharged by making the various moves (the first two even if the shots are not successful). For each of the three sectors there is one (sometimes even two) super move which, once carried out, will only unload the corresponding sector. There is also a particularly lethal move which, however, discharges the entire bar. These moves are generally spectacular and pleasant to look at (such as that of the aforementioned Betsy who takes the opponent to another psychic dimension and then beats him up, or Wolverine's series of claws or, again, Havok's super lightning ). Interesting, but almost useless, is the possibility of being able to move energy from one sector to another by pressing Z and one of the Pad keys. Let's start making some judgements. Speaking of normal moves, it must be said that despite its mediocrity, the Exakt title offers good availability. All very easy to do by requiring at most a quarter rotation or double tap in one direction of the digital pad. They are quite varied and allow you to use a minimum of tactics in fights which, especially at the beginning, appear all too fast and confusing. Area combos are possible that can be carried out after particular throwing moves (called air seeks), and parries with a return blow (by pressing R and one of the directions depending on whether you want to parry a punch or a kick) which bring several damage, but which are not easy to perform due to a certain incomprehensibility of the right moments in which to put them into practice. Carrying out the super moves is as easy as performing all the others since you just need to press the two punches or the two kicks together, but even here it is never clear when these will not be blocked or will be able to score. The artificial intelligence, in fact, (but only in the more advanced levels given that in the initial ones once you have learned some moves and some tricks you go smoothly and quickly) should remember that every now and then it would be advisable to let the player win too. If for a non-polypoid human it is impossible to use even the stick to move on the third axis, for the CPU it is a normal and automatic fact and considering that most of the moves have a 2D effect It is always normal for the CPU also the possibility that an opponent equal practicemind any move, make a series of impossible combinations or still spend half of his time running away to recharge energy (especially flying characters like Phoenis). Having said all this, however, I warn you that everything can also be fun, especially if you manage to dedicate some time to learning the various moves or you put in a little more effort to make the most of the execution of the supers which, however, are not always effective. The risk of continuing to press buttons just to load the super bars disappears as the difficulty of the game increases. And finally we conclude with the technical realization The various scenarios are sometimes very large and divided into various areas. Some ideas are even good, such as the ~holographic~ room where various settings appear (two... one in a military battlefield and another in a Roman amphitheater complete with chariots) or the large villa which will allow you to launch cardboard the opponent from the living room to the corridor, from the hyper-technological cellars to the garden. I still mention the fight on the street that starts from the skyscraper to fall to the ground floor and finally the jungle with the various floors of the waterfall and the final lake. The possibility of interacting with the scenarios is also discreet, it is possible to throw the enemy against a pole, against a console, into a hole, into a teleporter beam, etc. But nothing more, just throws. What is not convincing is the technical realization of all this. You never go beyond the discreet slipping on poorly defined and detailed textures, simple polygonal models and colors juxtaposed in an awkward way. The animations are also discreet, sometimes awkward and sometimes lacking. Absurd is instead the count of Hits for super moves. When the counter marks 32 you will not have seen more than 5 or 6 What leaves something to be desired instead is the virtual camera. Most of the time following a countermove or in the vicinity of some wall it will end up behind the backdrop offering you a spectacular black screen or the sudden disappearance of very substantial parts of the scenery. The presentation animations are scarce and monotonous. The sound always repeats the same motifs more or less and the sound effects are just enough and necessary. Finally, pointing out the ~plasticity~ of the characters and the scarcity of details that cover them, I move on to the global commentary. Comment This X-Men is placed in the large group of mediocre titles, it's not a great game but not completely throw away either. combat mode also allows good fun if you have a little perseverance in practicing and if you don't sink first into boredom and lack of interest (a risk that is always around the corner). Too bad for some moments of pure frustration, too bad for the too often disappointing technical realization (I imagine the level of spectacularity in the scenario of the pond if only the water had been rendered decently) and too bad for the lack of greater depth in the management of meetings. Pros: Frantic and fast Can have fun with a friend There are the X-Men Cons: A bit superficial Camera flaws too obvious Sufficient technical realization and little more X-Men Next Dimension Sometimes it's hard to start a review. While for some titles various possibilities arise from the imagination, for others, generally the mediocre ones (and here I have already given you an advance of what the global evaluation of the game will be, but keep reading anyway!), instead it is not known just which words to put one after the other to start an accurate analysis. X-Men Next Dimension does not suggest anything to me other than the classic ~It's a beat-beat-beat encounters centered on the adventures of the X-Men~...", "date": "2003-03-16", "grade": null}
