History is full of examples of sequels capable of significantly improving and expanding the formula of the original game, but also of number two that have failed to raise the bar or have even ruined the good things previously built. Darklings Season 2, sequel to the successful 2013 title, unfortunately does not belong to the first category: let's find out why. The less we are the better off we are In terms of pure and simple gameplay, little or nothing has changed in Darklings Season 2 compared to the prequel: the user therefore finds himself once again committed to helping the spirit of light Lum in an attempt to drive away the darklings, guilty of having stolen all the stars of the sky. The plot is all here and only serves as a pretext to offer a series of scenarios in which to face hordes of enemies and some bosses. The play mechanisms are always the same: the protagonist stands still in the center of the screen while the player must trace the symbols printed on the foreheads of the little monsters that approach on the touch screen to make them disappear. The challenge lies mainly in the fact that the opponents are different not only in the complexity of the design to which they are matched, but also in their speed of approaching Lum, who only needs to be touched to succumb and bring the match towards game over . However, there are other elements that contribute to making the experience rather peppery, starting with a countdown that must be fleshed out by collecting the stars that the darklings leave behind after being defeated; moreover, the game encourages the user to carry out combos to maximize the score, an operation possible by destroying enemies in rapid succession without making any mistakes. Despite being extremely immediate in its mechanics, Darklings Season 2 is anything but a trivial experience, offering gameplay capable of pulling its teeth out in terms of difficulty level, especially in boss fights. Compared to the prequel, then, the system of reading the signs that are traced on the touch screen has been slightly softened, thus avoiding the player the hassle of having to make perfect symbols to have them revealed correctly by the software. Few real innovations and an excess of superstructures end up weighing down Darklings Season 2 In addition to some slight refinements here and there, Darklings Season 2 differs from the prequel for some new contents which, however, do not enrich the experience that much: there is a new map with unpublished scenarios, a shop where you can buy various items and upgrades and there is also a slight online component, given that it is possible to take part in group battles by siding with a team and contributing to the victory by accumulating points with your games. All elements that are certainly welcome, but which have a negligible specific weight in the general context of a product that is all too similar to the one released in 2013. The speech - unfortunately - changes radically when instead we go to consider those aspects that have little to do with the gameplay or nothing. We are not referring exclusively to the notorious in-app purchases (however present in much higher doses than in the prequel), as to the exaggerated emphasis placed on collectibles and the like: in Darklings Season 2 stars, diamonds, rosettes, experience points, trophies, goals and so on and so forth, in an absolute and useless exaggeration of numbers and statistics. Also thanks to a very inexhaustive tutorial, everything that happens outside the actual game phases is redundant and confusing, and it is not excluded that less experienced users may find themselves overwhelmed by such a convoluted structure, without being able to understand what you need what you get as a prize following a victory.", "date": "2015-02-20", "grade": "7.2"}
