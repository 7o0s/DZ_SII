Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a single cent. Fresh from the success of the Mortal Kombat reboot, the guys from NetheRealm Studios have directed their attention (and their talent) towards the evergreen DC Comics universe. The world of Batman, Superman, the Lanterns and all the other famous protagonists has been experiencing particular videogame attention in recent years, which almost acts as a counterpart to the cinematographic one reserved for Marvel heroes. With an RPG still well attended on PS3 and PC and with a previous appearance in the world of fighting games, thanks to the discreet crossover Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, inspiration does not seem to be missing. A few days after the main release, the one on PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, Injustice: Gods Among Us therefore appears on iOS terminals giving a sort of rich appetizer, based on fights and... cards. Sci-fi Scopone To tell the peculiarities of Injustice: Gods Among Us in its mobile version, it is necessary for once to subvert the traditional order of points of view, which sees the technical sector relegated to the final gloss. The reason is obvious: for a DC fan, in fact, simply launching the full-bodied app after installation could cause very strong sensations of pleasure, due to the exceptional high-resolution photos of various types of details, taken at random from the suits and from the armor of heroes and villains. That of ~technical fetishism~, so to speak, is a well-known and heavily exploited fixation to the detriment of the purest enthusiasts, those capable of spending hundreds or even thousands of euros for an accessory or statuette with perfect detail. Given the assumptions, it is natural to expect above average performance from a graphic point of view; in fact, the polygonal realization of the characters, the result of the always exceptional Unreal Engine, is amazing, as is the resolution of the textures and the fluidity of the movements. An incredible display of power and quality, such as to leave you speechless for a few seconds. Once recovered from so much splendor, the time comes to actually start playing; the fights, strictly three against three but in ~tag~ mode, almost entirely follow the mechanics already seen in the Infinity Blade series. From a static position and with a partially decentralized view, it is therefore possible to perform weak, strong, combo and super attacks, as well as obviously the parry, all with simple touches and single or chained ~slides~. Combo and super attacks, if performed correctly, can activate a sort of contextual Quick Time Event, useful for amplifying their range and the damage inflicted; the parry is activated instead with a simultaneous double tap. In short, it is clear that, beyond the curiosity to see the special shots of all the famous heroes and ~villains~ present, after having fought a series of enemies in the same identical way, the feeling of repetitiveness inevitably comes to the surface. To try to make sense of these otherwise useless successions of fisticuffs, here finally appears the big element absent so far in this examination, namely the cards. Each team of Injustice: Gods Among Us fighters is in fact defined by their own cards in possession, which can be won after a series of triumphs in battle but above all can be purchased by spending real money; the cards represent the status of the wrestler and after each match the statistics are increased, up to level up. In short, the upgrades of the characters, instead of taking place directly on their virtual alter ego, are manifested on the cards that represent them. In addition to the character cards, essential for playing, there are also support cards, useful for adding powers and improvements to your fighters. With the presence of the traditional generic ~booster packs~, with surprise content, the meager ~paper~ vein of the game is exhausted. The android app Injustice: Gods Among Us does not yet have its official Android version, however there is an app with the same name on the Google Play Store but which is actually a sort of utility, a guide to the upcoming game, full of information and curiosities. It is therefore not the game covered here but, being free, you can easily take a look at this link.", "date": "2013-04-13", "grade": "7.2"}
