{"name": "Command and Conquer 3: L'ira di Kane - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-and-conquer-3-lira-di-kane-recensione.html", "text": "The new campaign Kane's Wrath is made up of two different macro-modules: the first is represented by the classic sequence of missions (also called campaign), which follows the evolution of a plot told through cutscenes, while the other is a mode with sequential missions unrelated to a narrative component. Unlike what normally happens in the main episodes of the series, this expansion does not want to tell a real story, but rather fill the gaps left by its predecessor: this explains the use of Acts, for a total of three, each of which is concerned with following events in three different decades. Based on this particular structure, instead of a sequential progression inscribed in a well-defined period of time, in the 13 missions that make up the campaign, we find ourselves following different stages in the history of the series, with substantial time gaps between one and the other other, obviously all dedicated to the background of the history of NOD. The first scenario takes us back to the events immediately after the defeat of Kane, at the end of the Second Tiberium War (where we have to take charge of the military rebirth of the charismatic NOD leader), in the second act we jump to the events immediately preceding the attack on Philadelphia ( told in C&C3) and in the last decade (the third act) we will find ourselves faced with a pleasant twist, which we will not reveal at the moment. The narrative component is, as usual, very well cared for, with excellent cutscenes with convincing acting (despite the general climate of a science fiction B-movie). The problem is that, in addition to the dispersion inherent in the choice to cover such a large period of time, console users who do not have a past as fans of the series on PC will find themselves completely lost, unable to reconnect events and characters, which they also refer to the other episodes in addition to the third (the only one released on Xbox 360). Something new As in tradition, the game mechanics have remained completely unchanged, always providing for the same cycle: amass Tiberium, build buildings and then units. The gameplay, despite being an exact photocopy of the base game, is slightly enriched by some improvements: firstly, the Artificial Intelligence has undergone a considerable tweak and is much more aggressive, with much more meticulous research patterns of your base and the ability to create quite lethal army combinations. This task is also made easier by the introduction of new highly specialized units, particularly effective against a specific type of enemy: each of the three main factions can deploy, within two different sub-factions, around 10 new units which, taking up the characteristics and some even the design of those of the base game, they differ in power and destructive capacity. In this expansion, however, it is only possible to use those of the NODs within the main campaign, while in Skirmish and multiplayer games all three factions can be used, with their units. Beyond the new units, the real evolution present in this title is that of the interface, which is getting closer and closer to a control system suitable for console joypads. Pressing the right trigger at any time, and depending on the selected unit, opens a sunburst interface, with all possible options visible at once. In this way, access times to selections and sub-menus are considerably reduced, making everything much more dynamic and intuitive: undoubtedly the most convincing structure seen so far to command an RTS on consoles, although there is always a certain distance from the perfection of the mouse (especially when selecting troops). Kane's challenges The sub-factions are therefore the protagonists of this expansion: against them we find ourselves fighting by defending Kane and trying to re-establish his position, from them we obtain new and useful combat units that can be used directly, once assimilated by the opponent. We can directly take control of these sub-factions within the new mode introduced by Kane's Wrath: Kane's Challenge. In this case, we are faced with a series of skirmish battles for each sub-faction present, for a total of about 90 maps to complete. This option is a questionable substitute for the Global Conquest, originally present in the PC version: the latter represents a good innovation in the Command and Conquer universe, introducing a sort of Risk-style mini-game, which brings strategic conquest to a larger scale, through a system ofsimple but fun game. Kane's Challenge, on the other hand, is simply a collection of skirmish missions detached from the plot, and for which frankly it is difficult to find a justification, especially if introduced in place of a convincing mode such as the Global Conquest. The versus mode instead allows you to challenge an opponent online in the typical structures provided by the series (Skirmish Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Capture and Hold, and Siege) and represents, as always, a guarantee of further playability. From an aesthetic point of view, Kane's Wrath does not differ from the excellent standards already achieved by Command and Conquer 3, with well-detailed scenarios and units down to the smallest detail (with some tearing problems, to tell the truth), excellent battle scenes 'intermezzo (taking them with a certain irony) and sound accompaniment up to par. Comment The Wrath of Kane is an expansion of Command and Conquer 3, therefore it cannot be judged as a standalone game. It goes without saying that it is a product suitable for those who have already played (and possibly appreciated) the chapter of the main series to which it refers. The big problem of the plot remains: referring to events that concern the whole series in general, it is unlikely that it can be fully appreciated by Xbox 360 users, who in fact took the first step into the world of C&C with the third chapter. The replacement of the good Global Conquest mode with the unfair Kane's Challenge creates problems, but on the other hand the work done by the development team in building an interface that currently represents the most advanced model for an RTS on consoles is highly appreciable . If you have finished the third chapter and you are looking for a new ~dose~, the purchase is mandatory, otherwise we recommend that you focus again on Command and Conquer 3, waiting in the meantime for a new chapter that takes advantage of the excellent interface of this expansion.Pro Great interface adapted to the controller A new injection of Command & Conquer! Technically very sound Cons Choppy and obscure storyline for non-connoisseurs Global Conquest mode is missing The gap to the mouse has not yet been filled Xbox 360 - Goals Wrath of Kane contains 44 unlockable achievements for the usual total of 1000 gamerpoints. Most of the achievements can be reached by playing online, and obtaining victories or particular results in this mode, using all the different factions available. The objectives richest in points however, although present to a lesser extent, are those related to the campaign, to be faced, in order to obtain the maximum score, in the various difficulties. A challenge suitable for the Command & Conquer enthusiast. Command & Conquer 3: The Wrath of Kane is available for PC and Xbox 360. The version tested is the version for Xbox 360.", "date": "2008-07-09", "grade": null}
