{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-4.html", "text": "Stealth-action restyled Needless to get around it: Splinter Cell PS2 version is considerably less spectacular from a graphic point of view than the original on Xbox. The intrinsic limitations of the Sony hardware have in fact forced the Ubisoft programmers to have to operate numerous tricks to the cosmetics of the game, effectively depriving it of many of the aspects that made it one of the most visually spectacular titles on the Microsoft console. Of course, although indisputably inferior to the Xbox counterpart, the PS2 incarnation of Splinter Cell is graphically a more than well-made title, if we consider the hardware on which it runs. However, the extent of the qualitative gap between the two versions in this area is immediately noticeable from the very first game stage, the one reserved for the tutorial: in addition to a less full-bodied polygonal model by Sam Fisher, the lower definition of the textures, a vaguely more marked aliasing, a much less impressive light effects workmanship and, in general, a drop in the level of detail in certain situations that is truly substantial. It so happens that some very detailed environments of the Xbox version appear on PS2 conspicuously more bare or smaller in size. Indeed, entire locations present in the original incarnation have been literally cut here: whether it is for precise game design choices or for the technical impossibility of transposing them on the Sony console, it is not known. The deprivations to the graphic sector of Splinter Cell, however, were also carried out in the name of the noble aim of guaranteeing a constant frame rate, which in fact occurs and allows optimal use of the Ubisoft stealth-game. And from this point begins the ~revenge~ of the PS2 version of Splinter Cell, which, however cosmetically debased, presents some additions capable of making the visual inferiority compared to the Xbox version soon forget. Time for a little payback First of all, the certainly not unforgettable FMVs of the original Xbox have been replaced with brand new movies, of much higher quality and able to give greater prominence to the storyline: even most of the sequences originally managed by the game's graphics engine have been replaced by most spectacular pieces in computer graphics. Continuing in the series of new entries in this PS2 version of Splinter Cell, some enhancements to the control system are worth mentioning: it is now possible to activate handy binoculars by pressing the R3 button, as well as scroll more easily through the various items in the inventory using the directional cross and, finally, take advantage of the optical cable by selecting it directly from the menu that appears when interacting with any door, rather than always having to extract it from the inventory. Small things, of course, but which contribute to making the gameplay more fluid, which in any case appears slightly more simplified than the original on Xbox. This is for the aspects listed above (to which others must be added, however, such as for example the access codes that appear on the screen during interactions with the various keypads, thus partially nullifying the processing of the data collected on your OPSAT) , both for a precise choice of the developers, and by modifying several passages of the game here and there, they have in fact slightly lowered the level of difficulty. Once again, however, the Ubisoft coders have acted in a decidedly prudent manner. If in fact on Xbox the repetition of the most demanding screens was made decidedly less frustrating thanks to the speed of loading and the perfect save system at the various checkpoints, on PS2 this situation could not have occurred: a series of loading exponentially longer and more frequent and a decidedly questionable save/load function would have in fact prevented even the most patient of players from repeating the same part several times in a row. The beauty of nuclear power Deserves particular mention, in the series of additions of the PS2 version of Splinter Cell, the presence of a completely new level, set inside a nuclear power plant in Russia. In addition of course to adding purely numerical value to a full-bodied gaming experience, this unpublished stage is distinguished by an excellent design, able to easily place it among the best of the entire title. Good for Sony users, therefore, who can enjoy Sam Fisher's adventures for longer. And yes, because we must not forget that, beyond the results - positive or negative - of the conversion process, Splinter Cell remains one of the best titles of recent times. Strong gameplay extrextremely solid and hardly repetitive, given the variety of situations proposed to the player, the Ubisoft product is a top-class stealth-action game, with attention to every aspect, from the complete control system to the exceptional audio sector (which among other things boasts an excellent quality Italian dubbing). In short, one of those titles that everyone should at least try, possibly avoiding expiring in unfounded comparisons with Metal Gear Solid 2, which in fact represents a genre in its own right. Comment Splinter Cell on PS2 is as close as it gets to the definition of ~video game director's cut.~ Beyond the obvious, and honestly, inevitable, technical downsizings - or cuts to the graphics sector and extension of loading times -, in fact, the Ubisoft stealth game presents a substantial series of more or less significant variations and additions compared to the original version Xboxes. From the brand new FMVs to the unedited stage, passing through a whole series of small changes, Splinter Cell boasts various filings on PS2 that evidently the transalpine coders have not had the opportunity to carry out on the first incarnation of the game. This, obviously, to the full advantage of Sony users, who can enjoy a version of Splinter Cell in some ways even better than the original. Pros Excellent gaming system Well-kept audio compartment Several additions compared to the Xbox version Cons Graphically inferior to the original Loading much longer and questionable save system Lasts the life of the secret agent. Sam Fisher, protagonist of Splinter Cell, knows this well, and after having defeated the crazy plans of the Georgian dictator Kombayn Nikoladze on Xbox and PC, he is forced to repeat the work again, this time on PS2. And if the step was short from the original version for the Microsoft box to that for personal computers (for obvious reasons), as regards the transposition on the black Sony monolith, a powerful graphic restyling was necessary, due to the lesser potential of the hardware. Lasts the life of the secret agent when you have less polygons and less detailed textures. Hard, yes, but no less pleasant for this", "date": "2003-04-16", "grade": null}
