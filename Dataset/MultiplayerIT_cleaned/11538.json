{"name": "Affari tuoi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/affari-tuoi.html", "text": "After eight hundred episodes, ~Affari Tuo~ confirms itself as a successful show, also thanks to the charisma of the current presenter, Flavio Insinna. It is a prize game that bases its appeal not so much on how it works, but precisely on the value of the people who from time to time find themselves in the position of being able to choose a package and discard others, with the aim of winning the 500,000 euros up for grabs. The chosen competitor must first choose one of the twenty numbered packs. Once this is done, we proceed to the exclusion of groups of three packages at a time, discovering what is inside them and eliminating both the ~good~ and ~bad~ prizes from the relative board. Every three eliminations there is a call from an imaginary ~doctor~, who offers the competitor a sum of money to end the game. The offer can be accepted or rejected: in the second case, three more parcels are eliminated and so on until one discovers what is inside the box chosen at the beginning. The start screen of the game allows us to try our hand at a quick game or with the challenge mode. The first sees us face a random episode, to become familiar with the mechanisms of the quiz and understand how to behave, while the second represents the more substantial modality, divided into twenty episodes to participate in sequence. To complete each episode we will have to finish the game with a certain amount of money, whether it comes from the package we chose at the beginning or from an offer from the mysterious ~doctor~. Furthermore, at a certain point, to access the episodes we will first have to correctly answer some multiple choice questions. It is clear that the further you go, the more complex things become, with the minimum amount getting higher each time and the risk of ending up with an eraser as a reward. In any case, we soon realize that the structure of the game is very, very simple and the outcome of the matches depends more on luck than on the player's skill: on TV, all this can be ~disguised~ in various ways , first of all from the conductor's ability, but on mobile it's really difficult to get too passionate about it. What is certain is that Gameloft developers have done everything possible to make this video game as faithful to the television broadcast. Insinna's big face is faithfully reproduced on a body that moves very little, unfortunately, against the background that shows a cross-section of the television studio. The packs and the prize pool board are the only alternative graphics, made in a functional way and little more. There is even a projection that graphically represents the progress of our matches, given that it leaves the time it finds due to the randomness of the outcome. The sound sector is also faithful to the transmission, with MIDIs that follow the same music and some sound effects similar to those heard on TV. PRO Faithful to the broadcast Twenty episodes to face Interesting for fans of the show... AGAINST ...much less for the others Technically only fair Limited and repetitive", "date": "2008-03-26", "grade": "S.V."}
