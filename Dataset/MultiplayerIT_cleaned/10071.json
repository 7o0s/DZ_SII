Excellent premises for a video game, so much so that this Ben 10 Alien Force: Vilgax Attacks represents the third foray of the franchise into console territory. So let's see how this action game dedicated to fans of the television series behaves. 10 aliens are enough for me From a narrative point of view, the title developed by Papaya Studios is placed within the second season of the cartoon, and sees the return of the evil Vilgax, intent on conquering the galaxy using a mysterious and extremely powerful secret weapon: Ben, in the company of his cousin Gwen and his friend Kevin, is therefore sent back in time in order to prevent the bad guy on duty from getting his hands on the source of his power. In terms of gameplay, this translates into seven different worlds to explore in a mix of action and platforming spiced up with some puzzle sprinkling. Only Ben is controlled, but he can count on the variety of his ten transformations (Mutant, Goop, Flaming Mud, Chrome Ray, Fin Jet, Chilblain, Homosaurus, Brainy, Chimparagno, Echo-Echo, Alienics and Cannonbolt) each with specific characteristics that often prove indispensable to proceed in certain points of the game. Beyond a use of this type, however, most of the available forms turn out to be accessory in the course of normal action, to the point that it is very easy to complete the adventure by really using only two or three. The control system also raises some perplexities, although it does not make use of the sensors of the remote control except to a minimal extent: the layout of the keys is not optimal and it is not possible to change it, while the management of the video camera is entrusted to an awkward combination between the less than the Remote and the Nunchuk analog stick. Apart from these all in all venal sins, Ben 10 Alien Force: Vilgax Attacks flows away in a quite pleasant way, keeping the user engaged in fisticuffs with enemies, collecting power-ups and jumping from one platform to another: nothing too much original in short, but it is still a valid product especially if you appreciate the original cartoon series. From this point of view, it's a bit sad that Ben's companions play an absolutely marginal role, but that will be for next time. Instead, the title pays duty when it comes to duration, since it is a rather short adventure and deliberately characterized by a low level of difficulty: once the game is completed, there are no particular stimuli that can encourage the user to repeat the experience . All the more reason considering how the various shooter sections on board the spacecraft (placed between one level and another) are so useless that it is possible to skip them without the risk of missing anything. In short, too many ingenuity on the part of Papaya Studios, even if the developers make up for it thanks to a good level audiovisual sector: the graphics succeed well in recreating the feeling of the cartoon - especially as regards the animations - but even the sound performs its task in an orderly manner. In conclusion, Ben 10 Alien Force: Vilgax Attacks will certainly be appreciated by a young audience fond of the television series, while all the others can easily turn their gaze towards slightly more refined action games. Comment True to the cartoon Simple and fun Pleasant graphics Dedicated only to fans of the series Some problems with the controls A little short", "date": "2010-04-15", "grade": null}
