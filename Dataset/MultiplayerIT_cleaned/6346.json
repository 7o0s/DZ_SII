{"name": "Guardiani di cosa?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149650-endless-legend-guardians-guardiani-di-cosa.html", "text": "Endless Legend by Amplitude Studios is a very successful 4x strategy (if you are interested in knowing more, read our review). Therefore, DLC and expansions of all sorts could not be missing to enrich it to keep the players' interest alive. Guardians is the first major DLC to hit the market. It takes its name from its main content: the guardians. Imprisoned by the Endless, the five giants have broken free and, once discovered, can be produced by the player as if they were normal units and upgraded through gems that are obtained in the game. Each Guardian is bound to an elemental sign (apart from Skoros) and has unique abilities. They are: Gios the earth; Neros the water; Fotios the fire; Atmos the air and Skoros, the most powerful, the sand. They're gigantic units, so they can't be used in conjunction with others, but that's no complaints, as they can wipe out entire armies on their own. Obviously they can act simultaneously with other armies or guardians. In addition to the big kids we just talked about, the expansion also adds various other contents: the ten Legendary Deeds, unique missions to be carried out in competition with other empires, in which the first to reach certain objectives wins, yield bonuses of various kinds useful especially in the early stages of the game; Global Events, on the other hand, are random effects that affect the entire planet and involve bonuses or maluses for all races; the new buildings, five legendary, one for each era, and ten unique, one for each race, instead add weight to the constructive side, also creating a competition between players for whoever manages to build them first; finally, other quests have been added, some cooperative, some competitive, which invite players to interact more deeply with each other. We tried Guardians, the new expansion for the 4x strategy game Endless Legend Are we guardians or corporals? We try to clarify beyond any doubt who might be interested in Guardians. As you have read, there are not many new contents. Indeed, let's say that they are very few, also considering the price. The five guardians aren't bad, but they're simply five very powerful units. Perhaps too much, since we end up focusing the whole strategy on them. Instead of making them producible in cities as normal units, it was better to tie them to some questline or some specific prerequisite, perhaps limiting their number further. The solution of not making them combinable with armies is only a stopgap and when they are sought after as if they were normal technology, we tend to use them as much as possible because they are very powerful. The problem is that they are also the largest part of the whole package, which eclipses the rest of the content. For example, the Legendary Deeds are very little, especially in the advanced stages of the game, when the heroes are now very strong and the bonuses obtained become almost irrelevant. Moreover, they are linked to activities often determined more by luck than by the skill of the player. For example, it often happens that we are asked to accumulate a certain number of resources faster than our opponents. Unfortunately, the Endless Legend game system is not dynamic enough to allow rapid changes in the production of territories. Consequently, either we have a resource base to produce, or we have a settler ready with an already discovered territory with the resource we need on it, or we will inevitably be overtaken by those who have been luckier than us. In short, in the long run the Deeds are more of a distraction than a novelty and when you realize that it takes too much effort to win, you automatically tend to put them in the background. The same goes for global events: useful, but not decisive for gameplay. Buildings and ideal player The new buildings are more interesting, one unique for each race, plus one that can be built in each era, with the obligation to make it before the opponents. They give interesting bonuses, they stimulate competition, but as you can well understand they are certainly not a revolutionary feature. They are very reminiscent of the wonders of Civilizations, but are less dynamic, much smaller in number and above all require timeliness in production. In the first two eras, moreover, they are a considerable plague because they block the development of the city in which it is decided to build them for dozens of turns. Only the new quests remain, the cooperative ones and the competitive ones. We've left them at the bottom because they serve to illustrate the only category of Endless Legend players who should consider purchasing Guardians: those who play it in multiplayer. Artificial intelligence unfortunately tends to snub them a bit and to get the most out of it you have to play with other humanswho follow its lead. So let's recap: Guardians will not rekindle the passion for Endless Legend of those who have abandoned it for some time, just as it will not satisfy too much those who play it only in single player, also because some innovations are spectacular, but end up creating too many imbalances. However, those who play it regularly in multiplayer should consider it seriously, because it can get a lot out of it depending on the group with which you share the games.", "date": "2015-05-12", "grade": null}
