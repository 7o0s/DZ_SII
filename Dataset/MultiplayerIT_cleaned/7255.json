Kung Fu Rabbit is quite well known among tablet and mobile phone owners: it now has a couple of springs on its shoulders, when it came out it was quite noticed for its gameplay very similar to that of another indie game, Super Meat Boy, and in the meantime , prior to arriving on Nintendo 3DS, was ported to a large number of platforms. We won't stand here and philosophize about how positive, negative or totally neutral this thing can be for the players and the transfer market, there are other spaces for this reasoning and then - what the hell! - we have a lot of shaolin bunnies to rescue! What can a mobile game say on a console like the Nintendo 3DS? Let's find out with Kung Fu Rabbit! Beat like a rabbit When Universal Evil decides to conquer the world, the first thing it does is imprison all the followers of a Shaolin temple frequented exclusively by rabbits dedicated to martial arts. But, always following the rules, he leaves one free, who then assumes the responsibility of going around sixty levels, plus twenty bonuses, infested with enemies and sticky and deadly residues to save his brothers. Kung Fu Rabbit is a very classic platform game, therefore essentially made up of many classic and ~special~ platforms, and jumps to be calculated to the millimeter. In addition to the normal jump, our bunny martial good Bruce Lee is also equipped with a ~wall~ jump that allows him to climb dizzying heights, and also can eliminate his enemies simply by approaching their weak point, suitably marked. Automatically, without having to press any button, the shot animation is triggered and the little monster is served. There really is nothing else to say about the control system, which therefore makes simplicity its essence; but simplicity is a double-edged sword if not accompanied by the right implementation, and it must be said that the guys at cTools Studio have been able to do it. Fast and precise, equipped with the right, very slight inertia, the rodent lets itself be controlled pleasantly through a series of very short levels and with an almost always convincing design. Nothing very original, mind you, the situations are the canonical ones of any platform since Super Mario Bros., but everything is well done first of all with a view to great portability (short and fast levels for quick games), and then also a difficulty that soon veers, between precipices and enemies placed in the most diabolical points, decidedly upwards. Cantonese rabbit Rightly speaking of rabbits, carrots to be collected in each of the stages are created to create a system for, so to speak, adjust the difficulty during the game, which in the dojo between one level and another can be exchanged for some nice bonuses and/or or boosts. There is something for all tastes: ranging from a bonus that allows you to establish a check point at any point you want (quite useless, given the small size of the worlds), to the classic jump and speed boost, up to the possibility of eliminate all enemies just by touching them. It is a well thought-out system, the use of which however is entirely up to the player's choices and can represent a disincentive to the challenge: for example, eliminating enemies with just a touch will be a boon for those who are frustrated by the excessive difficulty (and every level also has a hard mode to unlock...) but for more experienced platformers it will take away half the fun and therefore the latter would be better advised to spend their carrots on something else, which however the game does not say in any way. All this is presented in an almost identical way to the versions already seen, except for features such as HD on Nintendo Wii U, in a very very nice and fun style, and for the cartoonish drawings and for the (few) animations present, with a colorful representation of some typical settings of the Far East and a touch of those Rabbids made in Ubisoft which are undoubtedly in the cultural baggage of the developers. The graphics are totally in 2D (even the stereoscopic effect is missing, so you don't see the usual dedicated box), as we said colorful and very clean but a bit static due to the few animations and above all that it continuously recycles very few assets for a rather monotonous background effect. It also suffers from this defect in mgreater measure the sound, the most forgettable part of the package: the first time the mock-Chinese jingle also makes you smile, but if it is repeated every ten seconds at a certain point the desire to eliminate it takes over.", "date": "2014-03-12", "grade": "S.V."}
