{"name": "Tokobot", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tokobot.html", "text": "Imprinting and teamwork The story of Tokobot takes place in a world and in a time completely detached from planet earth, in which modern society studies the technological prehistory of the numerous remains and ruins present on the planet. Bolt, the protagonist, is part of the organization led by Dr. Canewood and carries out the work of researcher; during an exploration in a ruin, he finds and activates some Tokobots, robots with a mysterious past who immediately recognize him as the one and only master due to the theory conceived by Lorenz, imprinting. And it is from this point that the adventure begins, through the important help of Ruby - also an employee of the Canewood laboratories - Bolt begins to explore the ruins of the past civilization in search of elements that clarify the origin and true functioning of the Tokobots. Bad luck has it that some personalities are already aware of this secret, and that they will do anything to be able to catch the robots. In the game there is only one mode which is represented by the story mode, this winds through a series of levels interspersed with dialogue sequences that help shed more light on the evolution and folds of the story. Between one level and another, the main character also returns to the Canewood laboratories, where he can complete simple operations such as: checking the progress of the game, saving his progress, consulting the encyclopedia of enemies encountered up to that moment and finally have a word with Ruby and Doctor Canewood regarding the missions to come. The Tokobots are the only key capable of allowing the player to overcome the proposed levels, it is in fact thanks to their teamwork that Bolt will be able to overcome the classic platform obstacles that will follow one another during the levels. Unity is strength As previously mentioned, it is the union and the presence of the Tokobots that will allow the adventure to continue. The robots will be configurable according to three different formations, each of which will bring certain powers and abilities capable of overcoming obstacles. The first formation is in a circle, in this mode the Tokobots arrange themselves around Bolt and by pressing the backbone R - holding hands - they allow the protagonist to be transported so as not to touch the ground; this particular type of formation is useful for overcoming particularly narrow and winding paths, and for pressing special switches positioned on the ground. The second formation is the one in line, by pressing R the Tokobots and Bolt unite to form a single horizontal block, a human and robotic wall capable of hitting enemies by rotation; in the same way this formation will be able, rotating like a propeller, to glide between one platform and another in order to make its jump longer. The triptych of transformations is completed by the vertical formation module: the tokobots line up behind Bolt and he can use them as a whip by hitting enemies from a distance; this type of training also allows you to create Tokobot bridges and ladders, so that you can overcome chasms or climb platforms that would otherwise be unreachable. During the game, continuing the exploration, the powers linked to the three Tokobot formations will increase thanks to the discovery of special artifacts which, while not bringing changes to the proposed modules (there are always and only three for the entire course of the game), increase the possibilities related to the uses of the same: the horizontal formation will allow you to glide by spinning, the vertical one will become useful for swinging and clinging to particular electrified poles and so on. Unity is strength In parallel with the skills related to the formations, during the levels it will be possible to recover special objects useful for completing transformations (also unlocked through the discovery of artifacts) in which the Tokobots will unite to create another machine useful for beating enemies or more simply overcome particular areas of the level (these transformations range from the grenade launcher, to the robotic samurai, up to the train and so on...). The levels offer a good degree of difficulty which, however, unfortunately integrates badly with the control system, not always responsive to the player's commands and above all made even more complex by the imprecise management of the camera. And precisely in this perspective, Tokobots meets the player making him lose a single heart for each time he falls from a platform (the energy bar is taken verbatim from Zelda) and allowing him to start over from the previous room without further increasing the sense of frustration (save points are also cleverly placed after each obstacleor which creates a discrete difficulty). A poor characterization between one setting and another is added to the not perfectly calibrated control system: non-detailed textures and washed-out colors combine to create a product that closely resembles the poverty of psx textures. However, the aesthetic care behind the character design remains of excellent workmanship, especially relating to enemies and tokobots. The music does not experience particular moments of glory, a series of not very memorable songs follow the player's deeds in the course of the levels, and it's a shame if we think of the strong connotation between platform and 'catchy' music, of those that remain in the ear even after you stop playing. Tokobot is, after all, a good platformer, one of those that engage the player more in competitions of skill than intelligence. The certain thing is that, despite some minor control and camera management problems, the experiment was certainly successful and one can only be satisfied with the final product. Tokobot is undoubtedly a game with a nice graphic design and with some original game mechanics. Recommended for lovers of the genre, less for those who can't see any more platformers. Pros: Definitely original. The mechanics related to formations are really well studied. One of the best platformers on PSP. Cons: The settings are - on balance - very few. The controls are sometimes too difficult also because of the camera. Sometimes frustrating, sometimes too simple. Discontinuous. One of the things that the PSP has suffered the most from the days of its release until now, is undoubtedly the effective lack of a strong and new franchise, a game capable of bringing a breath of fresh air to what risks becoming the laptop of the remakes in a workmanlike manner. And it is precisely in this overall vision that the brand new Tecmo product, Tokobot, fits in, a bizarre platform based on the teamwork of tireless little robots ready to do anything to help Bolt, their friend, father and master. The PSP is experiencing its golden moment in the platform genre in recent months and, after Daxter, it's time to put the analog stick back and get ready to immerse yourself in a world made up of mechanical enemies, self-propelled platforms and rolling stones.", "date": "2006-04-19", "grade": null}
