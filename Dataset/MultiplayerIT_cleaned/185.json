{"name": "Star Trek Encounters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-trek-encounters.html", "text": "In command of the Enterprise Star Trek Encounter is basically a very simple arcade shooter, where all you have to do is complete the missions assigned to you. The game view is in the third person pseudo-isometric, our spaceship is located in the center of the screen and we will be able to guide it on the two main axes using the analog lever. The basic movement is therefore in two dimensions, with the consequent movement of the ship forward, backward, right and left, but it is also possible to move slightly in the third dimension (i.e. up and down, to increase or decrease altitude) by the use of the L1 and L2 back buttons. The main game mode is divided into episodes, each of which corresponds to one of the five fundamental series of Star Trek: we start from Star Trek Enterprise, then move on to the classic series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and finally c 'is the episode Sovereign in reference to the sovereign class introduced in the movie First Contact. Each episode is characterized by the presence of the original spaceships, races and settings of the television series, this allows us, for example, to drive the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-E against the fearsome Borg in the Sovereign chapter. Each episode is in turn divided into missions that must necessarily be completed to move on to the next era; unfortunately there is no hint of a plot to support the missions, and S.T.Encounters is reduced to the simple completion of the game objectives. Also note the total absence of characters or information sheets on the world of Star Trek, there is only to drive a ship and nothing else. As you progress in the single player missions, new spaceships and maps will be unlocked that can be used in the second game mode, namely the Skirmish. This mode is divided into three parts: Head to Head which allows spaceship fights 1vs1 against the cpu or against a friend, Battlefest, similar to the first, but with the possibility of using more than one spaceship, and finally Onslaught, in which alone or with a friend you will have to defeat waves of enemy ships to get as many points as possible. In command of the Enterprise While it's really fascinating to be able to pilot each of the starships that have made Star Trek history, the poor realization of S.T. Encounters does not allow you to fully enjoy them. The factors that make STEncounters a mediocre game are many: it starts from a difficult control system and ends with a level and mission design with a soporific effect, passing through a technical realization bordering on decent. The problem underlying the bad playability of Encounters is the aiming system combined with the simultaneous use of almost all the keys on the pad: as already mentioned, the movement of the spaceship takes place via the analog stick and the two left backbones, with the X and Either switch between primary and secondary weapons, R1 to fire, R2 to lock on targets, and right analog stick to move the line of sight around the ship (i.e. a limited triangular light beam around the ship which indicates the direction in which weapons will be fired and the area in which enemies can be locked on). To aim therefore, it is not enough just to move your ship, but you have to coordinate to use the right lever at the same time; let's consider that we find ourselves among many enemy ships that shoot at us mercilessly, we have to move to dodge the shots, rotate the viewfinder (which also allows us to shoot only forward and behind our ship, but not to the sides of it), lock on and shoot, cycle weapons with the X and O keys, and above all follow the enemy fighters on the Z axis using the L1 and L2 keys. It's easy to imagine how having to do all this in a very frenetic situation can be really difficult and frustrating, as well as painful for the hands The arsenal to be used against enemy ships is quite large, and includes basic weapons (lasers and missiles) in combination with secondary weapons (mines, towing beam, scanners, etc.), and in addition it is possible to balance the power of weapons and shields, or of the scanner and engines, in such a way as to give more energy to what we need most in that moment (for example in a dangerous situation we can give more power to the shields by lowering that of the weapons). The missions are based almost exclusively on the firefight between the spaceships, but in addition there are alternative objectives such as following through the scanner the trail left by the movement of an enemy cruiser, towing an enemy ship to its base or escorting a ship of civilians . Most of the objectives are very boring to accomplish, some of themthey force us to carry out a long journey in open space without a minimum of action, and this can tire easily. Ultimately moving for long stretches in an environment where there are only stars and a few asteroids is certainly not the best of fun, plus you have to add a complex control system that doesn't allow you to get pleasure even from the most frenetic phase of the game... therefore we find ourselves wanting to abandon it after 3 or 4 missions. A journey into infinite space... ST Encounters is certainly not the type of game that tends to capture the gamer through a strong visual impact, considering the fact that there are neither breathtaking cinematics nor ultra-realistic graphic quality. The graphic interface of the menus is rather sparse, with dull and not very expressive colors, but all in all it recreates the atmosphere of Star Trek sufficiently well, furthermore the space has been represented in a realistic way, with a good realization of the starry background, of the planets , asteroids, gaseous masses and everything one expects to find in it. One of the problems affecting the graphic aspect of Encounters lies in the size of the models: the spaceships and starbases are very small, perhaps too small, and the typical sense of majesty of Star Trek ships goes down the drain. As a consequence of this problem we will have thin models, devoid of details and with a quality of the polygons and textures that leaves much to be desired; only the light effects of the weapons and the explosions can be considered of sufficient level. The sound effects and music that accompany the game action are of excellent workmanship. The effects are in fact recreated faithfully to those of the film series, while the soundtrack performs the task of adapting to the various situations well, from the most frenetic to the calmest, with the only flaw of being monotonous and boring at times. As a little gem, the developers have decided to use the voice of William Shatner (English voice of Captain Kirk) to narrate the events and objectives of the game. Comment Star Trek Encounters is a title full of flaws and no merits. The problems deriving from the bad control system are such that it is extremely frustrating, and if we add in addition a series of boring missions and a disappointing graphic quality, we realize that the situation is far from rosy. But what leaves me perplexed is the price at which it is sold in Italy, in reality STEncounters was born as a budget game (in the United States it is sold for no more than 30 dollars), while here in Italy it is sold at full price. Certainly a lower price would not make it a masterpiece, but perhaps a little more worthy of the purchase, considering that the game has not been translated into Italian and is not very long-lived. In conclusion, therefore, it is with great regret that we advise against the purchase of this title, unless you are an inveterate fan of the Star Trek world and want to own all the games that use this license. Pros: Atmospheric soundtrack Cons: Below-average graphics Real-time badass control system Little incentive to play Star Trek certainly needs no introduction, it is probably one of the most famous and acclaimed film franchises in the world, but unfortunately also one of the worst in terms of videogame productions. There are several video games that exploit the Star Trek license, and very few of them are able to sufficiently satisfy the ~needs~ of us hardened gamers. Star Trek Encounters continues the tradition of failuredespite being the first game in this franchise to be developed by 4J Studios and produced by Bethesda Softworks (also makers of Star Trek Tactical Assault for PSP and DS, and Star Trek Legacy for PC and Xbox 360), it is not free from serious flaws in gameplay and structure of the missions. These defects, combined with the lack of interesting ideas and a not excellent technical realization, make STEncounters a mediocre title, poorly playable and not very fun ... Star Trek fans who were hoping for a game worthy of the name will be unpleasantly disappointed.", "date": "2007-01-04", "grade": null}
