Funded with the promise of an old-fashioned platformer to be released on PC and Wii U, Super Ubi Land soon had to change its name to Super Ubie Land at Ubisoft's request. In August 2013 the game was then published on the Google Chrome app store, but it soon began to be understood that the awaited Wii U version would be slow to see the light. Meanwhile, Ubisoft had requested a new name change for the console version, leading to adding two more letters to the title: Super Ubie Island. Forced to work on an extremely limited budget and plagued by several compatibility issues between Construct 2 (HTML5/Javascript) and Wii U, the team has been trying to find partners to rewrite the game with Unity but so far it seems that they have not had great success. So, after making some changes to music, levels and balancing, the developers have decided to change their approach: in order to finally complete the port, it will be necessary to sell enough copies of the game on Steam. That is Super Ubie Island REMIX. Two years after its launch on Chrome, Super Ubie Island REMIX also lands on Steam: let's find out together From the stars to the star island Set on a star-shaped island called Climate Island, Super Ubie Island REMIX tells the story of a little green alien named Ubie. Forced to earth due to the attack of the evil Dr. Terrestrial, the little creature is in fact trying to recover the pieces of her spaceship, essential to resume her intergalactic journey. The narration takes place only through images, but the artworks are still detailed enough to contextualize the events and give a coherent frame to the adventure, even if some elements are not always entirely clear. The game island is divided into five sections, but only three of these host real levels. The first is in fact the ~landing~ area where Ubie keeps what remains of his spacecraft. Here it is also possible to interact with a stereo, which allows you to listen to the music purchased with the coins earned during the game. This is an exclusive novelty of the Steam version, which allows you to quickly access even the new songs not present in the original. Through the other areas, characterized by a specific landscape (forest, desert, tundra), you can instead access the levels proper: there are eighteen in total, plus three boss battles, equally divided between the three main areas. In each area there are also shops where you can buy new colored skins for Ubie and songs to listen to on the stereo; there are also rooms dedicated to small secondary missions, such as the search for some lost bees, seaweed for a sushi chef or four precious crystals well hidden on the island. However, the rewards for completing these sub-quests are a bit disappointing, given that they are always and only alternative colors for the little extraterrestrial and some extra coins. In any case, the search for crystals is really challenging and can keep the player busy for several hours after completing the game. Among other things, in the REMIX version each of the rooms that holds a gem also includes a code to be entered on the initial screen: one of these, for example, allows you to unlock all the levels, while another gives access to the ending even without defeating the evil doctor. Finally, the fourth and last area offers only three levels, but they are all dedicated to battles against as many bosses and are all quite challenging. Old school The level design of Super Ubie Island REMIX is strongly inspired by the two-dimensional platformers released between the eighties and nineties of the last century: Ubie must move within levels with a marked tendency towards vertical development, relying exclusively on his ability to run and jump. The jumping abilities of the little alien are however enhanced by his inseparable red balloon, which he uses to glide and to perform, together with the timely use of the double jump and overweight animals on which to bounce, numerous evolutions that they also allow access to secret areas. Although the difficulty curve is not always perfectly balanced, the absence of Game Over allows you to master these mechanics in complete calm: thus already in the second half of the adventure, you can jump between one enemy and another through TNT crates it no longer seems like an impossible feat. One type of operation doesttible also thanks to the good response to Ubie's commands which, whether you play with the keyboard or prefer to use a traditional controller (the Xbox One pad was mainly used during the test), is almost always flawless and makes really satisfying to overcome the most difficult challenges. The almost, however, is a must because the game still has some glitches, almost always fatal: then it can happen that Ubie doesn't jump exactly as it should or that it freezes in the middle of a boss fight after having collected a healing seaweed. There is also an annoying bug in closing the application, which forces you to use the activity management tool to force it to stop. Overall, however, Super Ubie Island REMIX performs quite well, showing good fluidity even on less performing systems, such as a Pentium laptop with HD Graphics. The graphic style of the hand-drawn artwork is also very nice and colorful: we are not at the level of titles like Yoshi's Island, but the result is really very pleasant to look at and goes well with the excellent soundtrack composed by Calum Bowen. Finally, replayability has also been taken into consideration with the introduction of the Time Attack mode, with which you can easily time the speed with which you complete the entire game or just one of the areas that make it up.", "date": "2016-01-27", "grade": "7.7"}
