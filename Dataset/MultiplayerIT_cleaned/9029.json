Ace Combat can count on a good base of enthusiasts but when one thinks of the title, in most cases, the typical ~hunting for the red dot~ game experience is associated with it which often condemns this type of game to an not exactly memorable, a poorly defined hybrid of shooter and flight simulator. Yet Namco has not given up on the evolution of the series and after a sixth chapter (according to the numbering of titles for home consoles) which carried on the game above all from a technological point of view, Project Aces has managed to make Ace Combat make substantial progress also as regards the gameplay, offering a genuinely next-gen interpretation of the historic series. Far from wanting to be another paradigm of the well-known Japanese videogame immobility, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon introduces a series of innovations that push forward the play structure hand in hand with the technical sector, varying its gameplay and trying to eliminate some historical weaknesses that seemed now chronically linked to the same basic concept. The result was a game that illustrates air warfare in a choral manner, following various points of view within different specializations of air combat, maintaining the typical fictional style of Namco production - in this markedly different from Tom Clancy's HAWX series, more linked to a solid fanta-political system - but proposing a plot that intertwines the fate of various characters. Assault Horizon still can't shake off certain inherent problems of the genre, but it certainly goes out of its way to free itself from a dangerously stale structure. Exporters of Democracy Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is one of the few titles in the series set in the real world and not in the alternative version of the Earth that usually characterizes Japanese production. This leads to a greater basic realism as regards the plot, which while remaining firmly anchored in the typical fictional style, deals in more depth with a history of conspiracies and international riots complete with twists and turns. Nothing transcendental in any case: a squadron of the United Nations/NATO finds itself following the unfolding of the war events from the African continent to Europe up to Asia, complete with the exhumation of the red threat with the pseudo-Russians still ugly and bad like once. However, these are details of secondary importance, because there is so much gameplay in this game and once you find yourself flying into the heart of battle ~there is no time to think~, as the wise Maverick said, and the substratum narrative becomes background noise. So the story unfolds through a good amount of missions (about twenty, depending on the subdivision you want to give) composite, broken down into different sub-sections, which generally offer a good variety of situations between hunting, ground attacks, escort missions, raids and so on but are sometimes a bit too stretched and pulled by the hair. The other fundamental innovation to the level design, connected with the new choral narration, is the presence of different specializations for the pilots who are the protagonists of the story, who take us on board different vehicles and engaged in different roles. Colonel William Bishop takes us aboard various fighter or ground attack aircraft, representing the traditional section of the game, while Captain Doug Robinson of the helicopter squadron will make us drive an Apache for the first time in the series. Occasionally we will find ourselves in the role of gunner on board a Black Hawk or controlling different types of weapons as a gunner on a high altitude bomber, situations that determine substantial changes in the basic gameplay. question of dynamics A large part of the campaign is set according to the classic structure of the series: driving the planes the structure remains faithful to the historical one, a blatantly arcade shooter with some simulation influence, although some variations included in this chapter are fundamental for enlivening the game mechanics. It is possible to choose between two different aircraft ~driving~ models, one more simulative than the other by modifying the execution of the turn, but both in any case purely brought to an arcade approach. To avoid the ~fire at a red dot~ syndrome, the developers tried to vary as much as possiblessible level design and enhanced dogfight through the use of ~dynamic mode~, an option that can be triggered by getting close to the target. In MD the enemy is displayed in a close-up giving the possibility of keeping him in the center of the hud for a sufficient amount of time to ensure that the missile hits, or strafing him with greater precision thanks to the activated zoom, while in attack missions at land the MD focuses on the targets to hit allowing for more precise and sequential attacks. In dynamic mode, the flight appears partially assisted in order to guarantee prolonged and hard-fought pursuits, unrealistic but undoubtedly spectacular. The dogfight is also enriched by the introduction of evasive maneuvers to be carried out with the right timing to shake the enemies off our tails, which creates the possibility of overturning the outcome of aerial duels and makes one-on-one confrontation more stimulating, both in story than in multiplayer. Before each mission it is possible to choose your favorite aircraft from a series of proposals - which increase as the game progresses - suitable for the type of mission (fighter or fighter-bomber), and the special secondary weapon, which partially customizes the player's flying style. Means of distraction A good job has been done by Project Aces to ensure a certain variety to the single player gameplay, with the game structure that changes substantially from one mission to another, changing vehicle and role. With the helicopter in particular a new rather convincing flight model is proposed: driving the Apache we have to learn a completely different command setting and the same mechanics of the missions undergoes a decisive change, more focused on the attack of ground targets and on infantry support missions, managing to provide a valid alternative to the normal dynamics of flying with an aircraft, albeit less structured and perfected than the normal routine on board the aircraft. Much less convincing are the sections as machine gunner and gunner who essentially propose a simple rather caciarone target shooting, but work properly as simple detachment interludes between one mission in flight and another, as well as contributing to that multiplicity of points of view on the war that characterizes the narrative of this chapter. Other support for the amount of playful solutions is given by the multiplayer, which is presented here in 4 different modes, namely Conquer the Capital, Deathmatch, Domination and Co-Op. The first, in teams, requires the killing of enemy targets on the ground, in this case the headquarters of the opposing team, the second is the classic free-for-all multiplayer, the third sees us conquer and control certain areas of war and the fourth offers the possibility of playing single missions in cooperative multiplayer. Although the distributed build did not allow for a very thorough multiplayer test, the varied offer of modes still ensures a good supply of additional hours of gameplay, even if the heart of the Ace Combat: Assault Horizon game experience certainly remains the epic single player campaign. Xbox 360 goals 50 objectives for a total of 1000 points is the loot up for grabs within Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. The achievements are distributed for the most part within the Campaign, linked to particular events that distinguish the various missions but in many cases they are achieved through particular performances. A number are devoted to multiplayer modes, but they are a minority. Going through the entire Campaign unlocks a good number of points but in general a certain dedication is required to complete the collection. Between heaven and earth The glance in Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is spectacular, just as the genre has now accustomed us between the previous chapter and the two Ubisoft HAWX. The sky, with all its lighting effects and particles, is made in an excellent way as well as the background on the ground from a certain distance, also in this case the use of satellite maps guarantees an excellent level of realism. The chronic problem of flight simulators also persists in this case: as you approach the ground, flaws appear between faded and poorly defined textures spread out on the background which contrast with the elements in relief on which the attention of the graphics was concentrated, such as the skyscrapers of the metropolitan missions. They are trifles, mind you, but in ground attack missions it is easy to notice the detachment between the glories of the point of view at a height of thousands of meters and the trudging of the polygons a few centimeters above the ground.The helicopter sections stand out a little, which being designed to be experienced at low altitudes present more solid scenarios on the ground, not having to present an enormous extension. The ~shooting~ sections as machine gunner and gunner are decidedly elementary, also from this point of view, which confirm the moments of qualitative decline of the entire production, unconvincing gaps between the ~serious~ missions . Remarkable in general are the models of the planes and helicopters on which the Project Aces graphics are confirmed to be quite well versed, just as the general sensation of spectacularity that emanates from the aerial missions is remarkable, thanks to a skilful harmony of epic direction, extreme situations, movement of the camera and pressing soundtrack. As far as the audio accompaniment is concerned, however, we must mention the excellent localization work in Italian carried out by Namco Bandai, with a good level of dubbing both during the interlude scenes and - above all - in the excited battle phases in the heat of the missions.", "date": "2011-10-11", "grade": "8.3"}
