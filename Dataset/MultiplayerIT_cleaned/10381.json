In this new episode there are not many new features: the structure is practically the same and the team has mostly been concerned with improving the technical aspects and less successful details in the first outing. Like the previous chapter World Trip can be played with Balance Board and with the Wiimote (also supported by MotionPlus) and the two experiences are very different. With feet The most inviting aspect of the game is undoubtedly the control via Balance Board. Everything is done with our weight, the remote control that we hold in our hands is only used for the A and B buttons, which allow you to make grabs and further evolutions during jumps. As for the first chapter, the options allow both to calibrate the device based on our center of gravity, and to choose between three levels of sensitivity. The lowest requires more decisive (and more tiring) movements, the highest on the contrary detects every smallest variation. Played with the Balance Board therefore, Shaun White is practically another game, as well as a very immersive experience. On the other hand, things don't always go the right way, and this is not because the Nintendo peripheral is not precise enough; the problems actually arise from the weight distribution. Once you put your feet on the platform, you will notice that your center of gravity has shifted, and although the software adjusts itself to this data, the impression that something is wrong, and that turning one way is easier than turning the other, will last for good. part of the game leaving us in doubt that maybe we are doing something wrong. Without taking into account the fact that coordinating on Balance is much more rewarding but also difficult than doing it with the pad in hand, and that each character has different speed and carving characteristics. With the hands With the Wiimote Shaun White presents himself in a much more classic way, the ~magic~ part and the desire to experiment that the game reserves for us with the Balance are lost, and everything will seem more familiar and acquired. Tilt the remote to turn, flick up to jump. In the same way, tricks are performed by tilting the remote control and pressing buttons A and B. Note that if the control system is different, the structure of the tricks remains identical. Everything that can be done with the remote control by tilting, can be done with the Balance Board by shifting the weight on the four sectors of the peripheral. The difference in the control system is also reflected in the game; some tests that seem at the limit of the possible with the feet on the platform, instead become more feasible with the Wiimote in hand. Going forward with the career and the harder the game gets, the stronger the temptation to switch from one system to another, and using the remote control will become the only choice when you want to complete all the additional challenges that each tracked. In short, the Balance Board to experience the thrill of a descent on a snowboard, and the Wiimote for when things get more serious. Less serious even if pleasant is the graphic style adopted, undoubtedly studied for a young target, both for design and for the skits and the language used. During the game, however, the graphics engine does what it should and there are no major improvements compared to the previous chapter. Number one, but effortlessly As we anticipated, the game structure remained very similar. It is a series of events distributed in tracks scattered around the world and which gradually become more demanding. Compared to the previous chapter based mainly on stunts, here we have opted for a mix of speed, tricks and pipes. There are some races where it will be necessary to score as many points as possible thanks to the tricks and their multiplier, there are those in which it will be necessary to arrive first by passing each checkpoint within the required position, and those in which it will be necessary to score many points by reaching the end of the descent within the time limit. The career is divided into levels, the aim is to access the professional level and become number one. If the limit of events allowed to access a category is exceeded, others will be assigned without further penalties. Despite the career mode, however, each descent feels like a thing in itself. Failing a test means only repeating it, which can sometimes be nice too. Of limited leagues composed of three or five runs, it would have made it possible to add a little tension to a game which in this way gives the impression of being conbefore in ~Free Run~ mode, even if characters and tracks are unlocked as you progress. Career (like versus) can also be tackled in multiplayer, up to 4 players (but only one can use the Balance Board due to technical limitations independent of the game), while the WiiMotion Plus support is practically an accessory since it only serves to replace the predefined tricks with others created by moving the remote at will, which arouses more curiosity than real impact on gameplay. Let's close by noting that the licensed soundtrack features such numbers as Blondie's ~I was made for loving you~ and ~Call me,~ along with a handful of others. The choices are appreciable, but the pieces inserted are too few and are repeated almost immediately. Finally, the Wi-Fi Connection is supported only for sending one's own records.", "date": "2009-11-17", "grade": "7.5"}
