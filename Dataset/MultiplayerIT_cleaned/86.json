{"name": "The OC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-oc.html", "text": "The underlying engine is roughly the same already seen in Miami Nights: Singles in the City (but without the passages of effusions) so at the Sims, you choose your paladin or heroine and you move from one corner of Newport to another doing favors to those freeloaders of your friends in the form of missions in line with the leitmotif of the episode trying to balance the values of Beauty, Maturity, Intelligence and Style (not to mention Money) on which your worthy gang, composed of Marissa, will judge you , Summer, Seth, Kirsten, Sandy, Julie, all well known to their fans and therefore I won't dwell on reintroducing them individually. The above favors will end up noted in your diary with the date, place, dude involved on duty and object of the help, it is very clear that they will be useful for the purpose of completing the game but well distinct from the Objectives, marked separately and indispensable for the continuation towards the grand finale, in this jumble of tasks the possibility of tracking your companions via mobile phone is in your favor to find out where they are at that given moment, last but this time really least is the inventory function where you will store the items you will buy from Julie (I finished the game and didn't even need half of it, waste of money!). As in many other Gameloft productions, there are mini-games, on this occasion of above-average quality to which we were accustomed, among other things individually selectable from the main menu and replayable separately: Driving (Spy Hunter and Monaco GP clone), Talking (slalom between the smileys, easier to see than to explain), Cooking (collecting the right ingredients that fall from above) Comet Command! (dignified faithful adaptation of Asteroids), Punching Bag (memorizes number sequences), Karaoke (punch some green notes!). The driving section and above all the remake of Asteroids are particularly well done and worthy of being replayed separately. PRO Sarcasm from all pores Minigames inspired by Asteroids and Spy Hunter are an added value AGAINST Not too innovative", "date": "2007-02-17", "grade": "S.V."}
