It really seemed a shame to abandon the game to such a dramatic fate, and so PopReach acquired the production rights to be able to proceed with a relaunch of the title on iOS and Android. The problem is that practically nothing has changed compared to the version of four years ago: we talk about it in the review of Payday: Crime War. Contents and structure Payday: Crime War, the progression of the character Payday: Crime War basically stands as a direct transposition of Payday 2: the missions are the same, the characters too, but to frame it all we find in this case a free-to-play structure with its inevitable microtransactions and prize boxes , which we can use to speed up the progression and therefore unlock the upgrades necessary to make our robber more effective and resistant. This specific aspect of the experience actually does not weigh much, given the cooperative nature of the experience: accompanied by three bots or from three users (but the servers turned out to be frighteningly empty during our tests, in truth), our goal will be to access each assignment and take home the loaf, i.e. empty the coffers of shops, banks and/or businesses trade and escape with the loot before the police neutralize us. If you have played Payday 2 (or its recent clone, see the Crime Boss: Rockay City review), you know perfectly well how these situations are regulated by even relatively complex mechanisms, with planning and strategies to be implemented to try to complete the shots in the correct way cleanest and quietest possible, avoiding collateral damage and getting the most out of every shipment. In the case of Crime War the contents are unlocked as we level up, but as mentioned the missions are the same as for Payday 2 and the structure at the moment is still rather immature, with lots of contents marked as ~coming soon~ which limit a quite a bit the variety of an experience that in itself is already widely seen and gutted. Gameplay and technique Payday: Crime War, the graphics aren't the best and it runs lousy even on the iPhone 14 Pro However, the big problem of this mobile reduction is the mix of gameplay and technical realization, which are intertwined with a series of quite sensational shortcomings for a mobile shooter launched in 2023. We know in fact how the entire genre has made significant progress on iOS and Android, optimizing controls and activation systems (autofire be praised) to give us the most dynamic and immediate action possible. Well, from this point of view Payday: Crime War has remained decidedly behind: although with the relaunch it has been introduced support for Bluetooth controllers, touch controls leave a lot to be desired for precision and responsiveness, as well as for the very arrangement of the icons on the screen, which leaves too little room for the maneuverability of the virtual sticks. Payday: Crime War, another round another drill in action The result of such a hasty and approximate implementation is the inability to effectively control the character, which makes the whole experience very cumbersome but not punishing. How come? It's simple: having discovered the problems of the controls, the developers seem to have lowered the general difficulty and consequently the reactivity of the policemen, who really behave like zombies devoid of even the slightest intelligence. However, we said that the question also concerns the technical implementation, and in fact the game is optimized badly, so as to have difficulty running at maximum quality on an iPhone 14 Pro, which until proven otherwise is still the top of the range from Apple, overheating the device when 60 fps is selected (but c 'is also an option at 90 Hz) and the best textures, and thus forcing to lower a visual quality in itself anything but exciting.", "date": "2023-06-19", "grade": "5.0"}
