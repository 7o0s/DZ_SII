{"name": "Il ritorno della vecchia scuola", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101786-tribes-ascend-il-ritorno-della-vecchia-scuola.html", "text": "Tribes: Ascend is undoubtedly similar to the first Tribes. It is as atmospheres, with a little more technology and design to enrich the formula, and it is also in terms of gameplay mechanics. The class structure, articulated by specializations and perks, obviously increases variety and customization, but the fulcrum of the title does not change. The extreme ballistics and the infantry's ability to cross the map at high speed, combining slide and jetpack, are the main ingredients of a recipe that differs from the past almost exclusively in terms of timing and calibration. Even the new possibilities granted to the attacker, namely invisibility and the throwing knife, do not clash with the experience and, on the contrary, make it deeper. The physics then, the central element of the gameplay, is excellent. In fact, each weapon produces an impact, so much so that even the machine gun can be used to increase the speed of our character or to climb hills. Obviously the above is not enough to guarantee the title a bright future. The formula of the series is in fact complex and as we will see shortly it is also vulnerable from the point of view of balance. Between the FPS and the flight simulator As we anticipated, Tribes: Ascend is undoubtedly similar to the original formula of the series but there are some important differences. Apparently these are small details, perhaps dictated by the need to make the title more attractive to everyone, but they are elements that gave Tribes 1 and 2 a precise rhythm and in doing so they enhanced the skill and game possibilities. In fact, the speed, even making the most of the movement possibilities guaranteed by the combination of slide and jetpack, is slightly lower. It is now easier to rotate the view and also hit with ballistic weapons, but the relative slowness of some classes (which in turn enhances the speed of the Pathfinder ed.) affects the general rhythm of the games. Furthermore, explosions, compared to the past, have a lower impact on the players' bodies and this regardless of the size of the relative class. In this way, not only does being hit by an explosive disc produce less discomfort, but the effectiveness of disc jumping is reduced, which could be used to quickly get out of a thorny situation or to reduce the leaps necessary to cross the map. The reload of the jetpack's energy is also quite slow, at least by the standards of the series. It is a choice that adds something in terms of tactics, given that the player has to save gas, but which at the same time inexorably slows down the gameplay. In fact, in Tribes even a millimeter mistake in a jump can result in the loss of a flag and being cut off from the action too often can be frustrating. However, this is a minor defect and something that can be easily fixed in the event of negative feedback from users. It is no coincidence that the developers have removed the speed cap that further limited the movement of the characters in one of the initial versions of the beta. Basically, the engine is great, the game is fun and the Hi-Rez support guarantees ample room for improvement. Among other things, it is said that the choices of the developers must necessarily be seen in a negative light. In fact, the title is liked and it is possible that it will find its own individual balance. Furthermore, the continuous support of Hi-Rez, based on feedback, should guarantee a constant improvement of the mechanics related to the player's skill, provided that, which does not seem plausible, the title does not become a mass phenomenon. Built for capture the flag The chances of capturing a flag while speeding at 200 per hour and throwing it in flight make Capture the Flag the mode of choice in Tribes: Ascend. Unfortunately it is also the mode that makes vehicles less useful, less maneuverable and faster than infantry. In any case, the heavy tank, thanks to the splash damage, can be used effectively to defend a position, but the turrets remain more effective, cost nothing, and leave the Technician free to act. Obviously the extreme skillshots, with the bullets that can almost always hit at extreme distances, are not lacking in any mode, but the freedom of action of the deathmatch crowds out the defensive classes and reduces the usefulness of the title's extreme movement. Of course, there's a way to take advantage of a heavy class or infiltrator's invisibility, but oftentimes, with dozens of players darting randomly across the map, it's best to just jump into the fray. The ranked matchmaking will be activated in the next few days, with all the related baggage of official rankings and so on,so we didn't get a chance to try it. In any case, finding a game is certainly not a problem with hundreds of thousands of active players even before the official launch. Obviously, the hope, as far as ranked matches are concerned, is that the title will be able to better match the connections of the players in order to avoid unpleasant encounters with American teams on fiber. In fact, the extreme precision of the action of Tribes: Ascend, which during the beta abandoned hitscan weapons to give physicality to all projectiles, makes the connection quite relevant. In any case the netcode looks pretty good with few errors in collisions and bullet impacts. Free to play but non-commercial Tribes: Ascend is a free to play title focused on earning, or buying, experience points that can be used to unlock classes and upgrades. Each element, excluding the aesthetic skins, can be unlocked without shelling out money and there do not seem to be any power-ups or characters capable of significantly unbalancing the gameplay. The FPS has come to this formula gradually, between cuts to the classes and changes to the system of talents, according to feedback from the community. Obviously, the actual gratuity corresponds to a rather high price for the experience point packages, but the team must also earn somewhere and to do so it has certainly not chosen a simple or commercial formula. The engine then, despite its free nature, is lean, pleasant to look at, and is capable of reproducing that dancing harmony typical of the most successful chapters of the series. Excellent textures, spectacular weapons, slightly subdued explosions. But overall the aesthetic result is decidedly valid and satisfying thanks also to the gigantic spaceships floating in the sky, the convincing water, the choice of colors that mix science fiction and nature in a credible way and above all thanks to an evocative and excellent lighting quality.", "date": "2012-04-12", "grade": "8.5"}
