{"name": "Death Stranding", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/death-stranding-recensione.html", "text": "Collecting the responsibility and emotion of writing the review of Death Stranding, one of the most talked about video games in the history of this medium, is the most ~scary~ and thrilling thing that can happen in this work. Whether you are part of the adorers or detractors of Hideo Kojima and his work, there is however no doubt that the uncovered release of Death Stranding on PS4 represents an important event, which must be read as honestly as possible. Death Stranding is not a perfect product, nor is it an experience suitable for everyone. On the contrary, it requires the player to immerse himself in a series of simulation mechanics often dedicated to a very specific target and far from the crowd. In the light of the lack of inclusiveness that derives from it, the vote you find at the bottom can fully respond to your taste, or instead require an adjustment, be it by excess or by default. We have played, lived, analyzed and reasoned on this judgment for a long time and the time has come for us to justify it to you. The hope is that we have managed to convey all our considerations to you. How we reviewed it In light of the importance of the title and its strong desire to connect, this review is not only the result of the work of those who sign it, but also of the infinite lucubrations, analyses, exchanges and comparisons that took place within the editorial staff of Multiplayer.it and not only. On the other hand, the legacy that the work has always wanted to drag along is that of connection, and if we were to rely solely and solely on its ability to forge interpersonal relationships, we could safely say that Death Stranding has hit the mark. The direct and sometimes even heartfelt confrontation with Pierpaolo Greco and Francesco Serino, the other companions on this 70-hour long journey, helped, shaped and gave those nuances in the points of view, for which heartfelt thanks are needed. Our story: the Death Stranding Normally we would already do it with any title, but it is even more natural to start judging a new video game by master Kojima starting from the plot set up by the author of the Metal Gear Solid saga, taking care not to reveal even a single detail that could I jeopardize the taste of discovery for each of you. What is useful to understand about the incredible imagery that forms the backdrop to the work, is that the game's fairly long communication campaign, made up of crazily made cinematic trailers, has deliberately made the plot more difficult than it is. The great merit of the Death Stranding plot is precisely that of speaking to everyone, with great simplicity and equal skill, without however ever lowering the bar of narrative research, language and direction. It is prophetic not because it catapults us into something never seen or told - on the contrary, it presents several points of contact with a work distant in time and disconnected from the video game, which for obvious reasons we will not mention - but because it deals with current and researched issues with a attitude and a totalizing imaginary. The beach, the Bridge Babies, the stranded creatures, the protagonists of the story and the gloomy atmosphere that has always been breathed in these three years of speculation, represent only the tip of a very deep iceberg that tries to speak to all of us, desperately to reach a glimmer of positivity and hope in a dark future, dark and black as the tar that draws furrows across the land of Death Stranding. However, nothing would find its balance without the very concept of the passage of time, made tangible in terms of narrative and in terms of gameplay thanks to the rain that falls incessantly on the ground, accelerating the wear and tear of things and people. It's such a strong message that in an instant it turns into the feeling that it's ~raining time~: a poetic image is heartbreaking, hand in glove with extraordinary characters like Fragile. The protagonist Sam, played by Norman Reedus, is a lonely man who feels alone and lives alone, carrying on his work as a courier around what remains of the American continent. Something makes him different from the others, in his gaze and attitude, as well as in the imprints he bears on his skin, the result of a disease that prevents him from contact. And it is precisely this infinitesimal detail that gives an even greater meaning to the goal of his journey: to reconnect America and thus, ideally, to reconnect the human race. The burden that he reluctantly finds on his shoulders represents the only hope for a humanity divided between the world of the living and that of the dead, perpetually suspended on an ephemeral border of no return. The bonds that the player will intertwine during the adventureture will bear the faces of the characters written by Kojima and his team, as well as the nicknames and actions performed by tens, hundreds and thousands of other people connected to our own network. The concept of network is in fact as important as it is articulated, based on a new material, contaminant but very powerful, called Chiralium. The appearance of the beaches and the connection with the world of the dead is a key vehicle for the loss of any type of previously existing infrastructural connection. However, if this substance destroys, it is also able to create and connect, allowing a society subsidized by what remains of a government now without jurisdiction, to attempt the impossible for the second time: a journey from the east coast to the west of the United States, so as to exploit the chiral network and its connections to rebuild what remains of the continent, founding the new UCA (United Cities of America). We have no intention of saying anything else about a plot that will accompany you at times in a pressing and persistent way, at others keeping to one side to leave you the pleasure of discovery, only to then reappear with more force and vehemence than ever, canceling all your will to detach yourself from a narrative that reaches unexplored heights. With the help of a mature and finally cinematographic direction and supported by an exceptional cast, the over ten hours of footage will be able to captivate emotions and give you joys and sorrows, tears and smiles, aided by a sumptuous and masterfully spot-on soundtrack . And if exactly twelve months ago we praised a mammoth but difficult production like Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2, today we are faced with another video game milestone, profoundly imperfect as only art can be, but not for this less important. This is on balance the only true common denominator: Death Stranding is the hymn to the most extreme authorship, creative freedom and the search for a superior status not for Kojima, but for the whole video game, turning into a work in an instant seminal. It is on this awareness that the duty to reward him arises in us. Death Stranding is therefore slow, cadenced, excruciating; yet splendid, exciting and all-encompassing. Its greatest value is to make the player progress, with exactly the same awareness with which the adventure experiences a crescendo, moving the bar of doubt towards the intoxicating sensation of completeness, albeit in this way sacrificing inclusiveness and shifting its target towards a specific audience, savvy and attentive to detail. That same type of audience capable of letting itself be carried away, rather than wanting to be its master. Gameplay: It's really a courier simulator Let's get our teeth out right now - yes, Death Stranding is exactly what it's been laughed at and taunted online for the past eighteen months, which is a courier simulator. It is so much so that we choose to assign you an evaluation for each single load delivered to its destination, which turns into a specific number of likes and a growth in connection made with one of the dozens and dozens of ~customers~ we will meet on our way. The evaluation and the likes obtained are useful for rising even in a hypothetical ranking of the best couriers in America, with an overall level that is achieved by adding up the growth in each of the main transport categories. Aware of these basic elements, it is important to understand that each of the hundreds of deliveries specially written by the development team has the characteristic of taking you on a journey that must be balanced and thought out, both from the point of view of the load chosen, and then also of the route you want to take to get to your destination. From the first iconic moment of the game, which comes following a sequence of images that are technically superb and stylistically close to what we recently saw in cinemas with Blade Runner 2049, what remains impressed is the physicality of Sam. Taking control of it means hearing feedback from the controls returned as it has rarely happened in the past. The minimal on-screen interface only reminds us to keep our balance on steep slopes or when we lose our balance following a rash movement. If it is then possible to use the classic X to jump or the circle to duck, what leaves its mark is the discovery of the independence of the individual arms, each delegated to the respective trigger. This element, as simple as it is functional, allows the pace of the game to always settle on that simulative perception of human effort and fatigue, which is also a metaphor for the journey that we, together with Sam, are called to make. Furthermore, since the first deliverya of intelligent drugs carried out in the first but not the most extensive of the macro areas that act as a reproduction of the American continent, musical accompaniment also appears to collaborate in the discovery of the desolate and uncontaminated lands of a world that has now returned to its primordial state. These are elements that accompany the gait of the protagonist and that cannot, for any reason in the world, be extrapolated from the experience reducing it to a mere ~walking in thin air~. It makes you smile to think that Hideo Kojima is always and only remembered for his combination of cinema and non-interactive storytelling, almost sacrificing any other element for this. In the light of historical facts, some of the gameplay concepts created in the past thirty years have forever marked the history of the medium. A certain type of rhythmic action, the most famous stealth mechanics ever and some of the most iconic bosses see his signature, suggesting that the truth is very far from the rumors. Death Stranding, on the other hand, is less inclusive where its latest game, Metal Gear Solid V, had convinced even its greatest detractors. Death Stranding is such an intimate and personal authorial work, so independent of the laws of the market and of the large publishers, that it has led Kojima Production itself to disregard any instinct linked to the idea of triple inclusive production. From the first to the last moment he tries to drive away anyone who lacks patience, anyone who doesn't know how to come to terms with slowness and reflexivity, vehemently declaring the will not to be the son of any specific productive fashion. Death Stranding is therefore characterized by hours and hours of long walks through a series of almost totally empty biomes, on which extraordinary horizons stand out and some of the most beautiful atmospheric agents ever seen. Only the encounter with the Stranded Creatures and the few other groups of humans present stand between Sam and the target, otherwise hindered only by routes and equipment needs. The latter is a key element of a progression that starts under the track, but which once understood and mastered, allows you to experience a different journey every time, even crossing the same routes or the equally important highways. Social Strand Game Is Death Stranding therefore really the starting point for a new genre, or a clever gimmick to bring the most curious closer? On closer inspection, the truth, as often happens, lies somewhere in between. The first game from the newborn Kojima Production doesn't limit itself to playing with a series of recognizable elements, but tries to raise the idea of asynchronous multiplayer. It would be superfluous to say that even this component, however highly playful, is grafted onto the imagination that acts as the backbone of the entire project. After all, nothing that happens in Death Stranding is random, every little detail can find its coherence and definition in the general ecosystem, whether it is a characterizing element of the gameplay, or a mechanic now taken for granted such as fast travel. sense of connection becomes the main demonstration in the multiplayer sector, even managed through a series of freely stipulable and not necessarily biunique contracts, which allow us to ideally ~get closer~ to some players around the globe. The connection with the rest of the world is totally entrusted to the unlocking of the regions, more or less large portions of those same maps that we mentioned previously. All the interactive action will take place on strips of territory that ideally represent specific areas of the North American continent. For those who are still wondering, Death Stranding is not a real open world but, on the contrary, it closely resembles the structure by which the portions of territory in The Phantom Pain were divided. Not all of them extend over the same size and are equipped with different biomes and an absolutely satisfactory number of ~customers~. Reconnecting all these areas is not mandatory but it proves to be useful for progressing in unlocking research, in the manufacture of new objects and, last but not least, in increasing the connection with each type of non-player character. On this aspect, the concept of ~inclusiveness~ that we have previously examined must be taken into account. In a market where by now the search for quality passes, by its very definition, from the variety and characterization of each single secondary activity, Death Stranding draws a line and transforms everything that is accessory into a new and different concept, which automatically risks being perceived as empty, dull and sketchy.
