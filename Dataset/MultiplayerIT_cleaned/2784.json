{"name": "Godfall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/godfall-recensione-ps5.html", "text": "We cannot deny how clever and cunning the guys at Counterplay Games were with the publishing of Gearbox to link Godfall's communication and marketing with perfect timing to the first announcements and then to the launch of PS5. This gimmick has undoubtedly paid off since many players have observed the videos and the deeds of this new project with enormous interest, strongly stimulated by the idea of an exclusive next-gen flashy from an aesthetic point of view and able to offer a recognizable gameplay and, apparently, immediately fun. In reality, not everything went the right way and, while acknowledging the developer and publisher's ability to keep attention high on their game, there is no doubt that Godfall is not exactly the title we've all been waiting for and, if you've already glimpsed our vote, you're probably wondering what went wrong in this title: a project that, in reality, already showed numerous gaps since its announcement trailer. Follow us in the following lines because we will explain to you in this review of Godfall what are the strengths and weaknesses of a video game which, apart from immediate fun and a certain ease of involvement, unfortunately fails from (almost) all parts. History We could easily liquidate this paragraph in a couple of lines but, as usual, we like to try to detail the reasons underlying our judgment to a minimum. The story of Godfall is incredibly linear and devoid of any detail. Two brothers, Orin and Macros, find themselves fighting for reasons that no one knows and that, in the end, we will never really find out. The outcome of this battle, clearly visible in the opening trailer also distributed a few weeks ago, will bring Orin , our protagonist and the ~good~ brother, to fall into the lowest realms of the world being left for dead. Macros, the ~bad~ brother will instead remain firm on the throne, in his golden palace and ready to activate the ascension: a process capable of making him a god, but which also has the important contraindication of destroying the known universe. Clearly our goal will be to get up, fill ourselves with equipment, upgrade ourselves, climb the 3 realms that make up the world and face Macros again to defeat him once and for all. On our journey we will meet a handful of supporting characters, all small specks that we will forget in an instant apart from a couple of (partial) exceptions: a construct that will guide us through the choice and continuation of the missions and a sort of renegade blacksmith who will explain how to upgrade our equipment. The whole narrative takes place through a very small handful of interlude sequences, some really basic dialogues with the two figures mentioned above and various texts to be collected around the levels to delve into the lore of a universe outlined in an extremely superficial way and uninteresting. An element which, to be honest, has generated us a lot of displeasure given that the foundations of high fantasy seem to be adequately respected but really poorly characterized. omitting or cutting many elements of Godfall in order to get it out as soon as possible, simultaneously with PS5 and, wherever you stop to analyze the project, you notice shortcomings or truncated elements. This feeling went through all the 13 hours it took us to complete the main campaign and to face some pieces of the endgame. The gameplay The gameplay of Godfall makes it belong perfectly to the genre of looter shooters with a third person view: those action games where the player's focus is all in collecting ever better equipment with the aim of enhancing his avatar and thus being able to face challenges of increasing level to collect further loot in a gameplay loop that, theoretically, never ends. Godfall in particular seems to be a sort of ideal mix between Warframe, from which it borrows some exploratory elements and the concept of armor, Destiny for what mainly concerns inventory management and Anthem for some artificial blocks imposed in the progression so as to force the player to spend several hours in the practice of grinding. On a structural level we will therefore find ourselves having to face three different realms, of increasing difficulty and, within each one, we will have access to some single player missions, supported by a couple of secondary activities: the hunts, which are nothing more than encounters with mini-bosses,and the free exploration of the environment to carry out bonus tasks which consist, in the vast majority of cases, of activating some signal beacons, collecting specific loot and killing a huge amount of enemies by respecting some prerequisites and styles of fighting. But it is precisely in this gameplay loop that some of Godfall's problems lurk that almost conflict with its concept of a looter shooter. The desire to explore the realms with the aim of collecting reagents and finding chests filled with equipment runs out very quickly, both for a tendency of the game to throw tons of loot in your face which very quickly invalidates everything collected a few minutes before, both for a problematic design of game maps. you practically never need to adapt your configuration to the challenges ahead, especially if you play on the normal difficulty level of the three selectable ones. When you die, you start again near the enemies who killed you and most of the bosses don't even have their energy reset in case of our departure, so it all boils down to trying the fights countless times without worrying too much about how the own character because the game never poses ~thematic~ challenges and in any case never conveys the need to invest time in creating builds. There are just a couple of more difficult fights towards the end of the adventure, mostly for the clever desire of the developer to place two different types of bosses in front of the player at the same time, and it is possible that in a future endgame that is more defined and full of content, configuring the avatar in the best way has an effective utility. But for the first 32 out of the 50 level cap levels we reached during our test session, we never felt this need. Then there is the question of the maps and here too it seems to be faced with a partial, incomplete design. The game areas mix corridors, crossroads, detours, elevated areas to be reached with short teleporters, ruins and vegetation, all mixed seamlessly and, in our opinion, without real level design skills. The total lack of reference points, outlined routes and above all the absence of a map of the area, make free exploration practically impossible: too often we find ourselves losing our bearings or retracing the same routes over and over again without you can never feel a sense of completion or real mastery of the realm. After a very few hours from the start of the game the only stimulus will remain to activate a hunt from the Seventh Sanctum, the main hub, start running towards the goal ignoring all the mobs in the path and face the mini-boss as quickly as possible to collect his loot, possibly the seals necessary to unlock the encounter with the main boss of the realm, return to the free zone and repeat the whole thing n times. The fight And we come to the other crux of Godfall: its combat system. Also in this respect the title of Counterplay Games shows many gaps or in any case a real lack of direction. And it's a great shame because, basically, playing Godfall is fun, generates satisfaction and keeps you glued to the screen while the enemies explode in a thousand lights, the loot flies in the air and, after a short setup of the character useful for equipping the just collected pieces, we feel the desire to launch ourselves into a new hunt or try the boss to move on to the next realm. The combat is the classic third-person action one: light, heavy, dodge, parry. There's no adrenaline system to keep player movement at bay so you can go heavy on spam attacks and button mashing. The game offers five different types of weapon and the style of attack changes according to the offensive tool used: it will be more or less slow and able to strike at variable distances. Furthermore, it is always possible to switch between two equipped weapons on the fly with the press of a button.Obviously there is everything we can expect from such a game: combos, the need to study the attack patterns of the bosses or evaluate I fly the composition of the enemies we face to give priority to support opponents or to those who can hit us from a distance; you have to run, there is a stone of healthte with three charges that can be used to recover some energy in a short amount of time and of course elemental and splash damage to contend with. Since Counterplay Games seems to have done their homework, so where are the problems? First in the responsiveness of this fight. The animations in Godfall cannot be stopped and, especially with heavy weapons, are devastatingly slow, leaving us very often at the mercy of our opponents when in reality we would like our avatar to be snappy and respond to our inputs instantly. In addition, the game seems to ignore the command queue, outside of the combos with light and heavy attacks. If, for example, we want to parry at the end of a sequence of shots we will necessarily have to wait for the end of all the animations to be able to press the left backbone used for parrying: by pushing the button while our character is still performing his attacks, it won't simply register input to the game with all that goes with it in terms of combat handling and timing. Then there's a design element that negatively affects combat: its absolutely gratuitous complexity. The player can perform the basic actions that we have described above but, quite early in the game, a whole series of activities are unlocked that create layer upon layer of further mechanics that only weigh down the fluidity of the system. For example, there is the dynamic of the soul crusher which allows you to accumulate damage as you attack an opponent with a light blow and then assign all this damage when you hit him with a heavy attack. But at the same time the game stimulates you to spam only heavy blows due to the breach, or the possibility of stunning opponents and leaving them prone if you fill up a special bar positioned immediately below the energy bar. Then there are the weak points which, during the fight, are highlighted and, if hit with the right timing, generate shock waves, while you must always keep in mind that each weapon has two special attacks that charge over time and which must be activated by combining the left trigger with the two buttons used for attacks. But, at the same time, while fighting, the polarity of the unused weapon charges up and, when it is at its maximum, we can release a shock wave and access a damage bonus by changing the offensive tool. absolutely everything because in this enormous mix of variables the shield comes into play which should not only be used to parry at the right moment, but also to throw it or to perform a stunning area shot and then there is the fury of the archon, a sort of ultimate linked to the worn armor that is charged while fighting. And we want to make it clear that we haven't yet exhausted all the variables that make up the combat system. For example, we could talk at length about the talent system made up of 25 skills each with 5 levels of enhancement and many of which enable the aforementioned mechanics. The problem is that everything is really unclear and above all it seems that each element is unrelated to the others: the feeling is that the development team wanted to insert as many mechanics as possible without worrying about basic coherence or without concentrating too much on offering the player that feeling of mastery of the gameplay that is the basis of any looter shooter. Indeed the basis of any truly stimulating action. The endgame Upon completing the campaign, the player will gain access to a fourth realm, the Dreamstones, which represents the endgame of Godfall. Inside we will find a series of challenges to unlock one after the other which will require us to face a series of mini-bosses before being able to access the final boss. The enemies are those already encountered previously but, compared to the usual, these clashes will have a series of active random modifiers that we will only discover at the beginning of the challenge and will give access to some divine powers which are nothing more than active bonuses that we will have to choose at the end of each match to have an advantage in the next one. The reward is clearly loot and a specific reagent that is used to create one of the 12 valorplates. The evidence tower also remains active: a sort of horde mode with waves of enemies of increasing difficulty that will allow us to access equipment of gradually higher value depending on the number of battles we will be able to complete. The graphics There is one element of the game that immediately surprised us positively: its graphics. The technical sector of Godfall is a nice pleasure for the eyes; maybe p", "date": "2020-11-17", "grade": "6.0"}
