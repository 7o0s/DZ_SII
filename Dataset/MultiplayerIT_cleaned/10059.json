This method, obviously used to increase revenues, also serves to discourage the resale of the game as used and thus lengthen its life and attractiveness. Where this content is released immediately upon release of the game it is appropriate to use a method like the one just seen in Battlefield Bad Company 2 (a free code inserted in the box), while if new levels or maps appear after months and months, as in case of Modern Warfare 2, it is right and understandable to repay the work and dedication of the developers. With 1200 Microsoft Points (about 14 euros) we can download and use five new maps in multiplayer. New so to speak, given that there are three unreleased tracks and two (welcome) returns. Activision, publisher of the game, is easy and automatic to reckon with in your pocket, but what we recommend is simply thinking: ~am I a huge fan of Modern Warfare 2?~; if the answer is yes, well, there is no doubt that regardless of the expensive price, the additional content is absolutely to be unlocked. As for the old maps, ~High Vegetation~ and ~Crash~, more commonly defined as ~that of the helicopter~, are back by popular demand. The first, known to all fans of the series, is an excellent map for medium-long distance combat and returns almost unchanged in its graphic cosmetics (at least a remix of the weather conditions, or of the vegetation, would have been welcome). High Vegetation is a sort of sniper's paradise: the rural setting and the horizontal and deep design make it easy to ambush from very long range. The central river and the numerous structures present make it one of the most played and loved maps of the first chapter. The new bonus skills and weapons present in Modern Warfare 2 still reshape the gameplay and playability is always fresh and fun, albeit with strong sensations of deja-vu. In Crash, however, close encounters with assault weapons, shotguns and grenades are preferred. The inclusion of these two settings recycled from the first chapter has a double value of the classic two-sided coin: a surplus for new players, but two maps that the ~old~ ones know by heart by now. Curiosity Despite the hefty price tag, the Modern Warfare 2 add-on map pack was downloaded by a million people in just the first 24 hours of release. The Infinity Ward game, however, achieved another decidedly more enviable record, namely that of the highest collection in the history of the entire entertainment universe with a good 550 million dollars in the first 5 days of marketing, outclassing the Harry Potter books (the sixth earned $394 million), Batman the Dark Knight ($203 million) and GTA IV ($500 million). On launch day, 2.2 million unique users played it live, with 5.2 million hours in the first 24 hours alone. Between old and new The new maps are called Salvage, Storm and Bailout. The latter is set in a middle-class residential neighborhood full of houses, stairways, alleys and a large disused central swimming pool. Thanks to the wealth of terraces, flower beds and internal spaces, this map is well suited to melee and medium-range surprise attacks. The map is not huge at all and the players find themselves engaged in face-to-face (or hit from behind) battles most of the time. The Storm map, as the name easily suggests, is instead drawn around an industrial complex during a fierce storm made of incessant rain, lightning and thunder. The poor visibility of the game horizon favors a more stealth approach to the action. Exploring the map better, however, one realizes how it has also been designed to find easy points from which to check the global situation: although the weather conditions do not favor the use of the optical sight by snipers, the best ones will still have fun finding bread for their teeth. Its dual nature perhaps makes Storm the most interesting location of this Stimulus Pack. The last new combat location in this expansion, Salvage, revolves around a disused junkyard that makes life particularly difficult for everyone. The low walls and the small size of the game mean that you can never feel safe in any corner. The car wrecks stacked in the center do not constitute a safe haven where you can stay for a long time, forcing all players to move continuouslyalong the (short) perimeter of Salvage. A natural habitat for all claymore and ambush lovers. Infinity Ward has included two new modes to make the most of the new locations available, these are ~Stimulus~ and ~Stimulus Veteran~, characterized by a forced rotation of game modes across the five new maps. If you are not particularly a fan of Search and Destroy or Demolition probably the best solution is to create ad hoc ranked games and invite your friends, as the two modes force a mandatory rotation of all modes. ~Stimulus Veteran~ differs, just like in the normal version, in that the Ricochet option is always active, and thanks to this, friendly fire kills us and not our helpless comrades. Ultimately what does this update offer aside from three new maps and two recycled from the previous Modern Warfare 2? Unfortunately absolutely nothing. No new weapons, emblems, options, bonuses or accessories. Where the choice of not wanting to unbalance the gameplay between who has or doesn't have this DLC is understandable, the inclusion of some absolutely irrelevant customization element at a game level would still have been appreciable. It is specified that in a game room with playlists (map rotation), players without DLC who will be in a game set on one of the new maps are automatically separated from the group and ~marginalized~. The matchmaking and connection problems faced by many just after the release day one of the Stimulus Pack have however been definitively resolved.", "date": "2010-04-21", "grade": "6.5"}
