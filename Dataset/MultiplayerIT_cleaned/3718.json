{"name": "Weedcraft Inc.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/weedcraft-inc-recensione.html", "text": "After the beta test, it's time to go back to talking about Weedcraft Inc., a unique management system focused on the production and distribution of marijuana. The title created by Vile Monarch is predictably making itself heard precisely by virtue of the delicate topics represented in it. In fact, we are faced with a work that indirectly aims to highlight the distortions that afflict the legislation on soft drugs, especially in a vast and diverse territory such as that of the United States of America. The main contradiction arises from the fact that in some US states, such as California or Colorado, marijuana can be used legally for recreational purposes, while in other areas of the country its use as a medical device is permitted. The situation changes radically at the federal level, where on the contrary the product is still generally identified as illegal. In light of these considerations, YouTube has preferred to demonetize the videos dedicated to Weedcraft Inc. at the instigation of some sponsors, effectively discouraging streamers and content creators from showing the game to their audience of viewers. The provision has not failed to cause reactions from the top management of the publisher Devolver Digital, according to whom the work would make specific reference to the legal marijuana market and would aim to make the user reflect on the inconsistencies of an entire legal system. But can Weedcraft Inc. therefore be considered a controversial and highly problematic game? Read on for our review if you are interested in finding out. Two protagonists, two scenarios but a single purpose: to create a stable business As a good manager Weedcraft Inc. deals with the issue of marijuana by representing the production and sale of the product on the market. During the beta phase we had already had the opportunity to test the basic scenario called ~Growing Up~. In this first context you take on the role of John Woodson, an economics student who has returned to live in the family home following the death of his father. In the charming town of Flint, our young hopeful is reunited with his brother Clyde, who convinces him to go into business to start a new traffic of ganja in a dilapidated building that serves as a laboratory. In this context, the progression turns out to be rather staid to give the player time and opportunity to become familiar with the numerous nuances of the gameplay. The production of the raw material and the management of the points of sale, passing through the care of relations with the police forces and the close competition with the other competitors represent only a portion of a dense network of actions, investments, decisions and strategies that can make the difference in decreeing the success or failure of one's business based on the traffic of the famous five-pointed plant. In this case, the presence of scarce resources makes the growth of the company slower, but gives the user the opportunity to understand step by step all the mechanisms up to the most complex, allowing him to master the most advanced tools including the activity of research on new types of seeds, management of perks and care of the business on multiple cities at the same time. In the definitive version, however, you also have access to the advanced scenario ~Hight and Laws~, where you experience the story of a middle-aged black man who has already ended up behind bars for a decade precisely because of the production and drug dealing. After his release, the man promised himself that he would stay out of trouble, but finally realizes that the only way to get his life back is to contact his old partner Matty, who manages still some business related to the legal production of marijuana. This time we are transported to the city of Denver, but again it will only be a matter of time before we set foot in other realities of the American landscape. By accessing this second storyline, you have immediate access to a budget of 50,000 dollars and a high value already activated in the field of research. Thanks to this tool it is therefore possible to immediately embark on experiments to understand the optimal environmental values to be adopted in one's own laboratory. By accessing the PlantMaster section it is also possible to interact with a machine capable of hosting at least two types of seeds, while the Mutation item offers new opportunities to identify unprecedented effects for each final product generated by the aforementioned tests. In short, in this second story the inconvenience of slowness and dead times that characterize the basic scenario is avoided, nevertheless it is essential to have already properly assimilated all theand nuances of the game in order not to bring the company into the red in zero time, forcing you to sign loans with interest rates bordering on usury in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. It is therefore in this area that the full potential of the game is expressed, but precisely for this reason it is necessary to act with order and planning, avoiding squandering resources on non-fundamental investments and at the same time trying not to get overwhelmed by debts or attentions unwanted by the cops. Gameplay: Attention to detail is key As specified by Devolver Digital, Weedcraft Inc. does more than just put us in the shoes of unscrupulous individuals engaged in illegal activities. In fact, the game allows you to choose at any time between illegal distribution and that intended for mere medical or recreational purposes. Choosing the fastest route - i.e. the submerged one - helps to save the player large sums of money deriving from the absence of licenses to buy, but on the other hand will increase the incidence of collateral problems such as those caused by police raids and the inevitable blackmail that these dynamics could trigger in certain situations. Conversely, by opting for a more peaceful situation, it will be necessary to take into account the need to shell out larger sums to guarantee adequate spaces, but there will also be the need to produce higher quality raw materials to meet the demands of the public. And it is precisely in this area that Weedcraft Inc. becomes more stimulating, based on the need not only to optimize production, but also to balance it on the basis of experimentation to kill the competition through quality. Alternatively, it is still possible to compromise trying as much as possible to oil the right gears, obtaining favors of a political nature thanks to a network of influence created with bribes and blackmail. Contrary to other management software, Weedcraft Inc. does not limit itself to relying on the care of resources and strategic planning, but offers a multiple choice dialogue system a plethora of characters that can be supportive or vice versa hindering the activity of the player. Not everyone is tolerant, so in conversations it will be necessary to find a way to touch the right buttons, trying to curry favor with the interlocutor on duty. To do this, it is possible to follow the path of friendship, bribes, or in the worst case scenario, rely on real dossier-taking activities. The idea is interesting and lends itself to stimulating implications, however a basic problem remains linked to the unattractiveness of the subjects with whom one happens to interact, combined with the repetitiveness with which specific situations occur randomly. This is especially true in relations with the police and with competitors, where in all honesty, better could have been done to differentiate the approaches and give a little more variety to the system. A speech that substantially also applies to the nature of the tasks: the division of the objectives into individual missions to be completed is a good way to keep the player's attention alive, however the objectives are not always clear in their purposes and in some cases they prove to be uninspiring to implement. On the other hand, the articulated system of skills with which to improve the protagonist's skills in varied fields such as production activity, product distribution and interaction with individuals is certainly interesting. Instead, we find that an extra effort could have been made to make the soundtrack that serves as the background to the long sessions of cultivation, sales and planning of one's improbable entrepreneurial activity more varied.", "date": "2019-04-16", "grade": "7.0"}
