{"name": "Einstein Games: Reazione a Catena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/einstein-games-reazione-a-catena.html", "text": "Albert Einstein is certainly one of the best known scientists in the world, it is no coincidence that his name has now become a trademark that is licensed for various types of production. Born in Germany, Einstein lived during the first half of the twentieth century and distinguished himself at the age of twenty-six for his revolutionary theories on the corpuscular nature of light quanta, Brownian motion and the concept of relativity. His character is automatically associated with applications that require an intellectual commitment, which goes very well with the ~brain trainer~ trend that has been raging on consoles (portable and otherwise) and mobile phones for some years now. Einstein Games: Chain Reaction, however, is not a Brain Training clone: we won't have to answer mathematical questions, nor will our brain be evaluated numerically. No, it's actually a ~logical~ puzzle game, very similar to a product made some time ago by THQ Wireless, namely The Incredible Machine: each stage represents a problem to be solved, and to find the solution we will have to use the objects granted (in limited numbers) in the right way. The game is structured in such a way as to make the stages available only in limited numbers, i.e. we will have to solve as many as possible to unlock the others. At our disposal we will basically have three things: a pointer (controllable via the d-pad), an inventory full of different objects depending on the case and suggestions from Einstein himself, who in case of difficulty will give us advice on how to position the elements to solve the problem. The ~physical~ context of the puzzles very often implies the evaluation of gravity and of the various motions: if we place a ball on a roller that slides to the right, it will move more or less quickly in that direction depending on its initial position, and will eventually fall down when the platform it's on runs out. For example, many internships simply ask us to drop a ball in a bucket, and how we do it is up to us. In the inventory, however, we will only find a limited number of objects: two rollers and two springs. It is therefore clear that we will have to position these objects in the best way: the rollers to move the ball in the desired direction, the springs to make it bounce just enough to reach the bucket. Since it will be difficult to accurately predict the movements of the ball, very often we will find ourselves starting the ~experiments~ with the sole purpose of taking the measurements, to then modify the position of the elements. The objects we will have to deal with are quite numerous, as well as the objectives that we will have to achieve from time to time. Puzzle games generally don't focus much on technical realization, and in this case Einsten Games: Chain Reaction is presented in a rather poor way both from the point of view of graphics and from the point of view of sound. The stages all share the same background image (a blurry tree-lined avenue...), but the design style of the various elements and of the interface itself leaves much to be desired, giving a strong feeling of ~roughness~. The music has a certain variety on its side (it is possible to select the soundtrack according to our needs: relaxed, lively, etc.), but they soon end up being repetitive and lacking in bite. PRO A large number of internships Challenging and tantalizing Physical context well done AGAINST Technically really mediocre Ugly interface Limited and repetitive sound", "date": "2008-12-19", "grade": "S.V."}
