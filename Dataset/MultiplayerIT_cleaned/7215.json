The 80s are far away, but there is no doubt that for video games, like the sixties for rock, they are still the most iconic ones, the pillars that support the floors built above. Unlike Super Mario, Pac-Man hasn't been able to renew his mythos over time; despite this, his image has remained alive thanks to the power of the first historic episode. Evidently The Monstrous Adventures has nothing to do, other than the visual aspect, with the shining past of Pac-Man. Namco Bandai has tried to relaunch the image of its symbolic character, through this video game but also and above all thanks to the TV series from which it is based, in the arduous undertaking of making him a star in the eyes of children. This is because, it should be remembered, Pac-Man is now a legend for thirty and forty-year-olds, esteemed and known by twenty-year-olds, substantially ignored by teenagers and infants of the new millennium: trying to relaunch it precisely for this audience is a sensible move. An old-fashioned 3D platformer, i.e.  la Nintendo 64. With Pac-Man. Fetishists like that, do you need anything else? Platforming in the time of FPS We immediately announce that Pac-Man and the Monstrous Adventures is not a masterpiece, and it doesn't even touch this qualification. With equal candor, however, we admit that the way in which it has been treated so far by critics is close to levels of persistence so high as to suspect some personal idiosyncrasy with the genre. The genre is that of 3D platformers, standard-bearers of the polygonal revolution in the second half of the 90s, which slowly fell into oblivion in the following decade. The reasons for this decline are many, from the change (to put it mildly) of Rare to the overbearing return of two-dimensional platformers; what is certain, unfortunately, is that from an essential genre it has become a niche within a generation and a half of consoles. And now it only gets the limelight through masterpieces, which are so rare and so uniquely Nintendo that if Mario ceased to exist, the genre would probably die with it. Although the plumber is still in excellent health, there is no doubt that there is an abyss, quality aside, between Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 3D World: one focused on exploration, the other on reaching the final flag. Le Avventure Monstroose is halfway between the two experiences, trying to make us breathe again that typically 90s grandeur smell. Certainly not succeeding, but bringing back to mind many beautiful experiences and many other simply, only discreet products released at the time, as interesting for fans as they are important for the proliferation of the genre. Ghosts everywhere This is what it is about, a dear old discreet product, belonging to a genre that is no longer in fashion and having as its protagonist - in this case it is bad, indeed, almost blasphemous - one of the most important icons in the world of video games. There are five environments divided into various levels, evidently inspired by Super Mario Galaxy: not that gravity has anything to do with it, rather the pace of the game. More or less complex and more or less exploratory platform sections (never totally exploratory, however) alternate with larger areas in which a task must be fulfilled, which in Monstrous Adventures is often synonymous with killing and exterminating all the ghosts on the screen . Content extrapolated from the primitive cosmogony of Pac-Man, reiterated here with different connotations, but still dear to the eyes of fans. Precisely these long-term situations are repetitive and uninspired: the lock-on on ghosts is automatic, and the bite of the protagonist is too guided. The action is never boring, but it doesn't rise above mediocrity either. Mediocrity that is rarely touched instead by the platform sections, usually well thought out, sometimes even brilliant, also thanks to the remarkable power-ups: from the Pac Fuoco and Ghiaccio we go to the less obvious Pac Pallina, Pac Sfera and Pac Ramarro, the latter very ~yoshian~ in the use of the language, both as a tool of attack and suspension. Needless to make a detailed list of the effects of the individual powers, what we can assure you is that many of them, as happened in the best Rare games, generate variety and give rise to surprising situations. Looking for a cameraman Even the development of the difficulty is well managed, so much so that the numerous criticisms on the exclusively infantile target of the game appeared to us out of place; had it been so there would be nothing wrong, it is not the ideal audience to give value to a video game,what we contest rather is the truthfulness of the information. In fact, as the adventure progresses, things get very complicated, and although the contents remain (obviously) playful, it seems to us that this Pac-Man is a ~game for everyone~ as much as any three-dimensional Mario. Moreover, it is not easy to collect new lives, and you often fall into game over, an eventuality that forces you to start over from the beginning of the level. Not that the Namco Bandai work consists only of merits, on the contrary: as we said at the beginning, it has many limits. First of all the control system, reactive but shallow, both in the graduation of the jumps and in the gait: in a platform, it is no small constraint. The field in which Pac-Man gets really dirty with mud is the management of the camera, really bad: with the analog stick you can adjust it at will, but its automatic movements are (literally) nauseating. A more static shot would have been preferable, and a button to place it behind the character would have been welcome. The worst is reached in the interiors, fortunately rare, where everything borders on the threshold of unplayability. For the rest it is a video game with sufficient production and nothing more, with questionable sound for both music and dubbing, and slightly above average graphics both for lighting and for the quality of the animations. Finally, the multiplayer is totally negligible, although it originated from a commendable idea, namely that of impersonating ghosts in a polygonal, classic Pac-Man room: both because it is not very fun and because it is resistant to the asymmetrical gameplay encouraged by the Wii U, which could have bring light where there was none.", "date": "2014-04-04", "grade": "6.5"}
