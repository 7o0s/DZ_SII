Once upon a time it wasn't like this, once the video game was simply a media, an interactive pastime alien to many. The paradox, despite the high diffusion of some types of game was already a reality, concerned the target which coincided with specific users, passionate and closed in a world distant from reality. Let's leave aside the PC which, sometimes flanked by the Amiga, followed an elitist path, first approaching thematic dates but hiding them under an aura of mystery and electronic disavowal. At the time, the first means of advertising videogames was the arcade, and everything that massively came out of the ambit of millions of bedrooms was here accessible to non-experts who, often ranting, filled the newspapers with negative comments or enthusiastic, revealing very little of the videogame reality and its intrinsic possibilities. Ironically, the so-called scandals were the first means of disseminating the video game outside its specific sphere, generating media discussions of global proportions. Mortal Kombat is probably the first true representative of the playful revolution of the nineties, and although it was not the first violent video game, its diffusion and the intrinsic humor of the second chapter made it a real weapon capable of bringing the video game topic beyond its own territory, through the news, until reaching the heart of the debates on the media ostentation of explicit violence. The journey of Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat was probably the true bulwark of digitized graphics, beyond the Amiga, beyond the graphic adventures, portentous at the time, it came to represent violence in a realistic albeit exaggerated way, seasoned with a thousand femurs and typical gestures and sounds of the movies of Hong Kong martial arts. Mortal Kombat was a mix of computer recolored home costumes, dry punches, powerful, roaring and enthralling kicks enhanced by swollen sounds alternating with ridiculous screams and abysmal and demonic voices. The conclusion of a Mortal Kombat fight is today, in all probability, the best-known element in the entire history of video games: the fatality, the final move, the annihilation of the enemy which concentrates all the violence and all the irony of the saga. The second Mortal Kombat not only improved the visual aspect, but introduced into the saga a good dose of technique, albeit spartan, without combos, which still had to be expressed in other titles, and without a concrete difference between the fighting styles of the characters . However, this last factor was balanced by a fair number of particular moves capable of unbalancing, blocking, freezing, stunning and throwing the opponent. Mortal Kombat II probably represented the maximum expression of the saga and proved to be able to capture and enhance the ironic spirit of the first chapter, both thanks to the even more caricatured realization of the fights and with the introduction of dozens of moves endings including double fatalities, screen fatalities and taunting, mocking or simply comical moves, not forgetting a fair number of secrets. The third chapter however, against all odds, lost much of the feeling of the saga by introducing poor and unbalanced characters, uninspired moves and fatalities so exaggerated as to lose both the violent and the ironic charm. From here Mortal Kombat has continued its journey in the three dimensions with a poor and distorted chapter from the limits of the three dimensions and with an interesting fifth title, a title that has nevertheless managed to introduce a valid combat system characterized by the use of weapons and enriched by the presence of different fighting styles thus embodying a sort of coarse fusion between the latest generations of three-dimensional fighting games. Deception We are therefore in the presence of Deception which, without too much shame, closely follows in the footsteps of its predecessor: Deadly Alliance. We therefore find the weapons, which can be sheathed at will, and the three fighting styles that guarantee a certain amount of strategy during the excited fights. Fortunately, even if in a limited way, some moves have undergone an overhaul that diminishes the game's balance flaws, but, predictably, the removal of the lunges and the new calibration are not enough to make Mortal Kombat a truly balanced game. Mortal Kombat Deception therefore remains a fighting game in its own right, characterized by ultra-fast combos, long-distance skirmishes and decisive moves capable of rendering the opponent helpless, moves that vary from special blows to armed slashing andwhich in many cases turn out to be far too powerful. Fans of the saga will note, with pleasure, the return of the exaggerated and theatrical uppercut that represented the real dominant move in the first two chapters of the saga, but even this addition is unable to bring any variation to the gameplay. Ultimately, excluding multiplayer, there are only two concrete differences between Deception and Deadly Alliance: one is undoubtedly the combo breaker, or a move capable of breaking the opponent's combinations of blows, and the second is represented by the death traps or areas to avoid unless you want an atrocious death. Ultimately, excluding multiplayer, there are only two concrete differences between Deception and Deadly Alliance Not just Mortal Kombat To balance the intrinsic deficiencies in the game system, Deception deploys a good number of variants compared to the classic fighting game, two of which can also be played in multiplayer. Chess Combat is nothing more than a chess spin-off where slaps and punches will decide the possession of a square on the chessboard, while Puzzle Combat is a version of Puzzle Fighter dressed as Mortal Kombat where the clashes are decided by battling Tetris. Finally, the single player variant remains, or the Konquest where we will acquire money to buy secrets, characters and extras and where we will be able to practice combat. The Konquest is not limited to this, but it reinserts us into the Mortal Kombat universe by making us meet characters, environments and stories from the saga. Ultimately the mode boils down to a few repetitive quests and exploration of the Mortal Kombat universes but, like Tobal on PSX, it's not to be thrown away and it's certainly an original way to access the game's extras. Technique and atmosphere From an aesthetic point of view, Deception doesn't make you cry out for a miracle, but it doesn't even make you turn up your nose; ultimately it improves significantly compared to Deadly Alliance and gives more life to both the environments and the characters. The fighters are more refined and more recognizable and the first element to take advantage of this change is the atmosphere. Even the animations seem improved allowing a better view of the game action and the whole returns to have the scent of old martial arts films again; this is how Deception, almost unchanged in gameplay, proves to be more attractive and stimulating than its predecessor. The arenas are larger and decidedly more detailed and the ability to break through walls and objects significantly increases the spectacularity of the fights. The Konquest mode, on the other hand, looks lousy both in the design, which is coarse and neglected, and in the graphics, which are decidedly poor. The sound is rich, absurd and very faithful to the spirit of Mortal Kombat, where two words are much more important than any other string of dialogue and these two words can only be: FINISH HIM! ultimately it improves significantly compared to Deadly Alliance and gives more life to both the environments and the characters Comment Deception is not an epochal game, probably not even a great fighting game, but on the other hand it manages to evoke, at least in part, the atmospheres of Mortal Kombat and presents itself as a rich even if not extremely well-finished title. The multiplayer is an addition to be reckoned with, the net code is solid and lag-free, and the minigames are incredibly more fun when played against a human opponent. If the fatalities have brought you closer to the world of fighting games you will probably like the scent of this new chapter of MK, which could instead prove to be a resounding disappointment for a purist of the genre. Pros: a little more ~Mortal Kombat~ than its predecessor decidedly full of extras and minigames the first 3D fighting game with dedicated multiplayer via the internet Cons: overbearingly aimed at fans of the saga the combat system is still not very refined Cross-platform GameCube, PS2 and XBox review", "date": "2004-11-30", "grade": null}
