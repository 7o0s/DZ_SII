The programmers have always stood out for their firm will to exploit the hardware of the new platforms, marking a decisive line of demarcation with the previous generation. Since the eight long years that separate us from NBA 2K6, history has repeated itself, the 2K14 edition raises the bar of graphic quality doing justice to the muscles of Xbox One and Playstation 4, at the same time however it presents several changes and, strangely, shortcomings. In spite of the unchanged cover, LeBron James is no longer the focal point of a production that seems to want to take another path, delving into ways that have never been fully expressed. The result is therefore a version only partially related to the current-gen one, as we had already deduced from our review. Let's see how. Fact and fiction Unsurprisingly, the old introduction has also disappeared, replaced by a more eloquent roundup of spectacular game replays accompanied by the music of Ennio Morricone. A small touch of class that highlights a breathtaking technical realization, but we will talk about that in depth later. The revolutionary approach of the new consoles is immediately felt with the instant ability to start a game, all while the machine is busy installing the game on the hard drive. The gigantic amount of data (over 40 Gb) prevents us from being able to exploit the splendid commentary and a large part of the options in this phase, on the other hand we are not forced to observe tedious screens. Once with all the pieces in place, NBA 2K14 comes in full glory with a completely new graphical layout. The menus that can be called up with the right stick (long criticized) are a distant memory, replaced by more practical horizontally developed screens representing the various modes. In quick play we find not only the obvious possibility of launching into quick friendlies, but also that of managing squads and enjoying an even more exciting integration with the authentic championship through NBA Today. This feature has been present in Visual Concepts basketball for years, but such levels of complexity have never been reached, with the highlights of the authentic matches displayed in parallel with the tons of information displayed to the viewer. Practically a paradise for enthusiasts where reality and simulation merge into an exhilarating blend. Arrivals and departures Our attention immediately fell on the new My Player and My GM modes. The first has been a pebble in the shoe of programmers for years, a real career in which we interpret the rise to success of a player we have created ourselves, starting from freshmen up to the glories of the American championship. If we exclude the scanty skits in the locker room, it was essentially a long roundup of meetings with a somewhat approximate and not very engaging outline structure. This new version represents a turning point from the past, turning into a kind of film complete with opening credits and full of animated scenes, interactive dialogues and moments with a high emotional load. The idea of a career with a strong narrative structure is not very original, drawing both from the underrated Fight Night Champion, but above all from an old Sony title that has unfortunately faded, NBA 09: The Inside. Despite this, the programmers have managed to give a very personal stamp to the surrounding elements, while in the game the structure remains substantially unchanged, with the emphasis placed completely on our player, including the indecorously spent time on the bench. My GM, on the other hand, is the mode designed for those who want to take advantage of the managerial aspect at the highest levels, therefore it is an extremely technical part and characterized by an abundance of information and statistics, remaining exclusive to the most profound connoisseurs of this sport. The downside is the elimination of the Playoffs and the All Star Weekend minigames, defections that prevent the less dedicated player from approaching the game in a more evasive way, focusing on the mere game. The mode entirely dedicated to King James and his Miami Heat has also disappeared. On the other hand, the VC Points are back, a virtual currency that can be accumulated both by playing and through internal microtransactions, which allows you to significantly enhance player statistics. A ghost that we hoped to have left behind and that threatens to unbalance the balance of online games. The Blacktop mode also returns, where we can play street basketball matches with up to ten players, choosing themfrom the teams official roster. Unfortunately, the superstars must be purchased through VC Points, a really weird idea that takes away precious points needed in other ways, or even worse forcing you to buy them online. Like a real match The biggest surprise obviously comes from the graphics side, significantly improved thanks to a series of concomitant factors. First of all, raising the resolution to 1080p allows you to enjoy, at least on dedicated televisions, unprecedented sharpness in the console panorama. But Visual Concepts didn't limit itself to this advantage to give new life to its franchise, rewriting the engine in order to obtain faces ever closer to photo realism. The result is simply a feast for the eyes and a source of amazement for those who follow this sport. Players like Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, James Harden and LeBron James himself are definitely impressive, and it's just one aspect of the obsessive attention paid to detail, from the sophisticated sweating routines to the uniforms (where you can even distinguish the seams), to the public beautifully varied that reacts dynamically to matches, as well as the various faithfully reproduced arenas. Last but not least, the Eco-Motion engine gives animations even more fluid and similar to reality, while the system called Real Voices introduces a myriad of interviews with both coaches and players during the intervals, for what can be considered as the most as close as possible to a real game. Also this edition benefits from the Euroleague teams, unfortunately with the same limitations as the one for current-gen, their use is in fact limited to friendlies only. NBA 2K14 raises the bar in graphics quality, setting a new standard in the industry Xbox One goals NBA 2K14 features 50 goals for a total of 1000 player points. Let's get excited by conquering five immediately by activating any quick scheme in the game, for the others there will be a lot of sweat. Try to conquer something very particular from King James in the career mode, what you will have to find out for yourself. Good luck and get on with those hoops! The art of sanding Playability is the least flashy element of this next-gen edition, mind you, the legacy is that of the best basketball simulation around, but those looking for real innovations in this sector risk being disappointed. NBA 2K14 is played exactly like its younger brother, which in turn is strongly linked to the previous year's edition. The new animations and some slightly revised dynamics lead to a more physical game than in the past, where it is easier to lose the ball or see a pass intercepted by the opposing team. Blocks and rebounds are more accessible and easier to implement, while a less rigid artificial intelligence allows you to play games where irrecoverable gaps are not accumulated in the score, although obviously it depends on the teams and players involved. The quick patterns are still performed through the commands of the directional cross, in the same way the double control system that allows you to alternate shooting and feints by pressing the right stick remains unchanged. In short, everything is undoubtedly softer and more harmonious, but not drastically different from the past, a sign that also in this case it was preferred to choose the path of refinement. On the other hand, we repeat, the base is already really excellent, there will be other opportunities to introduce more substantial innovations. The menus are completely redesigned, with a more sober, mature style and scrupulously aimed at high resolution. Although without official broadcast licenses, Visual Concepts gets along very well in reproducing the feeling of a sports broadcast, and it is a relief to ascertain the almost total disappearance of the stylistic quirks achieved by the edition produced by Jay-Z, quite redundant in such a context . We are however less happy with the return of the moody soundtrack, totally unchanged, so we will continue to hear Coldplay arm in arm with Daft Punk, Puff Daddy and Kanye West. With the increase in the social features of the new consoles, an adequate online sector could not be missing, NBA 2K14 also presents novelties in this sector. Alongside My Team, the equivalent of EA Sports' Fufa Ultimate Team comes The Park, a mode that takes its cue from the aforementioned Blacktop to involve up to one hundred players created with My Player in a curious hub that obviously recalls street basketball courts . Up to ten players can compete online in up to five-on-five matches to relax between careers and games.other, a really good idea that makes us experience the most adrenaline and fun side of this sport.", "date": "2013-11-27", "grade": "9.0"}
