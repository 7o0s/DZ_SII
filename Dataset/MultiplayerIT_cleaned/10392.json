What are they right, you will rightly ask yourself with a Molise accent. Nothing, but if we put one of the greatest footballers in history, the legendary Pel, in the middle, it starts to make sense. No? Well, that's right, actually not... All together passionately Let's clarify a bit: in the alternative world created by Ubisoft, our Pel has decided to put his absolute experience and his unparalleled talent at the disposal of young footballers from all over the world by creating the Brightfield Academy, a football school of excellence however, structured more like Harry Potter's Hogwarts than a normal nursery for a football team. Starting from the headquarters, a medieval manor complete with coats of arms and flags, up to the very functioning of the academy, which sees the members reside in the rooms of the castle sharing not only training sessions, but also adventures, gossip, in short, their whole life. Brightfield also has a bitter rival, the Scythemore Academy, led by an extremely filthy and suspicious character and where the enrolled boys are all big, bad, arrogant and with a sinister gaze. Even the presentation of the story, in the introductory film, is so reminiscent of Rowling's atmospheres, with the protagonist you play, whose gender you can decide, who receives the longed-for letter of admission to Brightfield only to then discover, once in front of the champion Brazilian, that it is a fake manufactured by Scythemore. However, impressed by our talent and determination, Pele admits it rightfully: thus begins the climb to glory, together with an adventure that has a real plot that will lead you to discover, in the end, together with your inseparable friends and teammates, why the evil Scythemore has masterminded all this The hard life of the Champion To be essentially a game for children, Academy of Champions: Football puts a lot of irons on the fire. The adventure is faced day by day, each of which is divided in turn into three time slots, each of which corresponds to an activity. These are of the most varied types, and range from training mini-games to questions about various aspects of the game, from hiring new players for the team to popping into the shop to buy power-up items, from the session where you assign yourself to various players the experience points earned in mini-games and matches in order to improve performance up to the actual matches, five-on-five challenges that vaguely recall SEGA's Soccer Slam. The action takes place in ~fantastic~ and dynamic fields, framed from your team's half-field and is obviously extremely simple, without any simulation pretense, so much so that the ball cannot even leave the field... However, the presence of two elements that make the matches a little more lively: first of all the talent-moves, special shots that differ from player to player (an attacker will have an unstoppable shot, a defender will knock down the opponents only by touching them and so on) which are carried out after filling the 'special bar, and secondly the duels, or rather the ~quick time events~ that replace the classic dribbling, won which you have the road paved towards the opponent's goal. That's not enough, because in addition to the training matches, useful for collecting money and experience but in any case not mandatory, like all the rest of the phases, there are also meetings with the various Scythemore teams, i.e. the won events which the story progresses and that they are the only ones you can't skip. Each Scythemore team you face is stronger than the previous one, and in addition presents a particular characteristic, from the ability to prevent you from using items to the hiring of special characters, caricatures of the most famous Ubisoft protagonists, each of them with superior talent average and very dangerous movements. Everything is in the name of absolute simplicity, and fortunately also of immediacy, but if you have a Wii Motion Plus, you can perform some ~precision~ movements that make the game a little more varied and rich. Soccer? Drink more milk! Once the adventure is completed, and if you decide not to avoid any of theand trials it won't take you very little time, you can still continue to indulge yourself with mini-games and one-time matches to play even with a friend: you also have access to an exclusive mini-game for Balance Board owners, well implemented in the so-called Freestyle which in any case is a bit 'little to be able to push the buyers of the game to purchase the peripheral, and vice versa. To move on to the technical part, we are truly in the capital of the kingdom of things without infamy and without praise: all in the most absolute average of products intended for the same range, with substantially GameCube graphics which, however, run smoothly without missing a beat and which are still pleasant to the eye, and music and effects as cute as they are insignificant. The style is something else, it does not go unnoticed and for the aforementioned references to the Harry Potter saga, and above all for the choice made in favor of a certain ~childish-chick~ atmosphere, the same as many cartoons of the very latest generation , which is extremely irritating for those who were children some time ago but who, who knows, maybe manage to make a real impression on today's children...", "date": "2009-11-11", "grade": "6.7"}
