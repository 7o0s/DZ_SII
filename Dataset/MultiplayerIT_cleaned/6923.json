In any case, she lives in Chicago, she is broke, but this cannot distract her from her great passion: playing online. While she is about to try out a new title, however, she is contacted by her artist friend Dana, who reminds her of a very important appointment with a famous gallery owner. Reluctantly Milda leaves the computer, but before leaving the house she receives a letter informing her that she has inherited a property in Lithuania from her grandfather Rokas Kovas, whom she hasn't seen for years. Or, at least, he will inherit it if he goes to sign the acceptance of the will within two weeks. Unfortunately, she doesn't have enough money to go to Europe, so she asks Dana for advice, who proposes to lend her part of the advance that the gallery owner will give her if he buys her paintings. After quite a few vicissitudes we managed to solve the first of many problems that the girl will have to face on her travels, also because otherwise we would not have been able to write the review of Crowns and Pawns Kingdom of Deceit. Gabriel Sword Some sceneries are very beautiful The first impression one gets when starting the title of Tag of Joy is that of a production with a modern flavor, between the possibility of customizing Milda's clothing and that, already mentioned, of choosing her profession. However, it soon turns out that the purpose of these choices is not simple exhibitionism (also because it is a completely offline game), but that of varying part of the puzzles and dialogues in accordance with them. Playing a little, you then realize that you are faced with a pure point-and-click adventure, with very strong references in particular to the Broken Sword series, but also to the Gabriel Knights and the early Syberias. Soon what seemed to be a simple family affair, almost insignificant, becomes a journey through old Europe to discover the secret of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, that is why he never became king. Among ancient houses, libraries full of mysterious documents to study, fascinating places (including Italy), bizarre characters and unexpected dangers, Crowns and Pawns Kingdom of Deceit is a beautiful and unexpected reinterpretation of an all too underrated genre. The gameplay itself is truly classic, that is, you have to search for and take objects, combine them or use them directly with other objects in the inventory or in the scenario, using the extremely agile game interface, decidedly modern in its conception, which integrates many of the features most appreciated by enthusiasts like viewing hot spots. In reality, there are some special touches, such as characters that can optionally be used as diaries, i.e. remind Milda of the next step to take each time (if you deactivate them, so to speak, you have to remember everything in your mind) , and the aforementioned variations in the resolution of some puzzles, which make the adventure replayable. It took us about eight hours to finish it the first time and we can't say it wasn't worth it, between well-written dialogues, good voice acting, especially from the actresses of Milda and Dana, and often really clever puzzles, which only in some cases we found it a bit tricky. For example, a puzzle with audio clues put us in serious difficulty... but after all, don't like the genre for this too? That is, for the pressing request to the player to rack his brains to get out of trouble? The dialogue system of its own is in line with everything else, that is, it exploits the classic mechanics of multiple selection of jokes to guarantee interesting conversations. Simple but effective. Some problems We also travel to Italy While very beautiful, Crowns and Pawns Kingdom of Deceit is not a perfect adventure. Indeed, he has more than a few problems, fortunately not disabling. In particular, the ending leaves a little perplexed, because it runs a bit too much, almost as if the developers were in a lack of oxygen (read: they had run out of money). To function it works, but the impact is less than what it could have had if it had been given a little more breathing room. Some technical deficiencies are less problematic, such as not exactly exceptional animations and some subdued backdrops, which are only indicative of the production level. In general, from a graphic point of view, we have little to complain about, given that the developers have fully succeeded in giving their work an ancient and never really forgotten flavor, albeit with a graphic style that is not exactly very original, which gives the best of itself in the representation of some architectures.", "date": "2022-07-10", "grade": "8.0"}
