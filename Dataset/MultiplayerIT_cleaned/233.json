{"name": "EverQuest 2: Echoes of Faydwer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everquest-2-echoes-of-faydwer-recensione.html", "text": "It starts well EverQuest 2 has depopulated for several years, before the world market was overwhelmed by the Horde of World of WarCraft and Lineage 2: passed a bit on the sly, this new expansion seeks not only to bring the series back to the glories of the past, as we will still see excellent, but also to bring some new neophytes of the genre closer. That's right: as soon as you start your game, creating a new character or using your old one, you will have the option to enter and visit the Lands of the previous expansions, with the beauty of 500 years having passed on them. So if you had left the main city of the world, Kaladim, in striking splendor, with humans, elves and other characters in quivering activity, now you will find it completely infested with evil creatures; undoubtedly the developers' choice to provide a valid point of contact and integration with the previous titles is positive: those who have already ventured into the world of EverQuest 2 will have some pleasant dejav, while newcomers will simply find themselves immersed in a fantastic world . Heidi, goats make you... The setting envisaged by this new expansion is in a purely bucolic style: if with Kingdom of Sky (the previous expansion) we had visited large hills thanks to mighty dragons, now we will find ourselves wandering through a large, immense forest, technically excellent and very variegated, along the lines of the entire brand: you will therefore come across giant mushrooms, sequoias used as condominium homes and exotic moss caves, all created with the splendid graphics engine of the original title. the sylvan setting fits perfectly with all the possibilities offered and seeing your elf wizard cast a spell by projecting realistic shadows around himself will undoubtedly repay you (morally speaking) for the money invested in your gaming machine Heidi, goats make you... Speaking of the quality of the engine, the developers must certainly be applauded for their ability in having created such a highly scalable engine: by setting your settings on the ~Maximum Performance~ option, you will sacrifice a good part of the most amazing effects, but you will still find yourself in front of a more than decent quality, all in favor of your latency; if instead, hardware specifications permitting, you can afford to enable the ~Maximum Quality~ option, you will have before you a title that has nothing to envy to products like Half-Life 2 and the like, with models rich in detail, very high quality textures and very valid shadows (you can even get to the shadow cast by a hood on a face!). The sylvan setting goes perfectly with all the possibilities offered and seeing your elf wizard cast a spell by projecting realistic shadows around him will undoubtedly repay you (morally speaking) for the money invested in your gaming machine. We want more! Coldly analyzing this new expansion, one can only be satisfied: to the classic new objects and weapons, among which the interesting Clockwork Copter stands out (essentially an ecological helicopter), Echoes of Faydwer also adds the possibility of impersonating a new minted race fresh, namely the Fae. These cute creatures, although they are much smaller and much less powerful than the other races, will be a real blessing when you find yourself spending hours in the woods around Kelethin: their main feature is the ability to jump and run with a remarkable agility, as well as being able to fall from incredible heights without any damage; if, at first glance, it may seem useless, you will immediately have to contradict yourself as soon as you set foot in a wooded area of EverQuest 2, since this skill will allow you to leave behind the slower and less agile pursuers. Also interesting is the possibility of transforming yourself, with the simple pressure of a key, into a wooded entity, similar to a fairy, very weak in combat, but an excellent alternative to the classic Scout. The question naturally arises whether it is worth abandoning your level 70 paladin in favor of a new character; the answer is, surely, positive: this new race is very fun to play and offers some interesting features (which we let you discover!), representing an excellent alternative to the classic game style of Slaughter Paladin or Cowardly Mage, despite being completely discouraged to those who prefer a very aggressive and poorly reasoned style of play. Go with the traditions Echoes of Faydwer represents a breath of fresh air in a world that is now too stagnant: a breath, however, which does not involve the basic structure of EverQuest 2; you will therefore have to, aonce a character is created, follow an exhaustive tutorial and carry out tons of quests available, perfectly in line with the vast majority of MMORPGs. If leveling up, at least initially, will be quite simple, as your experience accumulates it will become increasingly necessary to make contacts with other human players, so as to be able to face riskier quests, more dangerous monsters and obtain much better rewards, both gold and dropped items. The structure of the game and that of the fights therefore remains unchanged and, in our opinion, represents a bit of a missed opportunity: Sony, thanks to the solid base of subscribed users, could certainly have embarked on the publication of a truly innovative expansion, stimulating even the strongest players to embark on a new character with the race available, thus trying to gnaw away from the market all those undecided followers of World of WarCraft. Missed opportunity then, but this does not mean that Echoes of Faydwer is not a valid expansion, offering us everything one can expect from a pack for an MMORPG, namely hundreds of quests, new weapons, new items and even a new race playable. And down to downloads Probably, at this point, the undecided will be wondering whether to embrace the EverQuest 2 faith, or to launch into something newer and more widespread, such as World of WarCraft for example: the answer, unfortunately, is not the easiest, considering that the Evaluation of an MMORPG is decidedly subjective. We can tell you that we didn't like the lack of Italians on the game servers of EQ2, which precludes the choice of this title to all those who are not familiar with the Albion language; still, being the Sony title one of those that requires a subscription, not everyone will be willing to shell out 15 dollars a month (equal to 12.40) when there are equally valid titles on the market without a monthly subscription (such as, for example, Guild Wars). Finally, a small clarification: although the package states, as a minimum requirement, a 56k modem, in reality it will be absolutely impossible for you to even try to create a character: this is because, even before starting the game, you will have to download several hundred MB of updates, and even if you have the patience to leave your computer on for days, the latency offered by an analog modem will not allow you to play fluidly: we therefore recommend that you obtain either a flat rate ISDN line, or bet decisively on fiber or ADSL. Conclusions Here is the fateful moment of the conclusion paragraph, where the quality of the title in question is definitively decreed: is the new expansion of EverQuest 2 a worthy purchase? The answer is, indisputably, yes if you are a veteran of the series and continue to play the Sony title even now: this new expansion will allow you to roam and dominate in new quests and against new enemies, while newbies would do better to prefer other MMORPGs , perhaps with a greater presence of Italians (World of WarCraft or Lineage 2) or free (Guild Wars ). Among other things, we remind you that the expansion is sold in Italy in a tasty and rich package complete with EverQuest 2, the two expansions already released in the past and the new Echoes of Faydwer at a very interesting price.

New Weapons! New NPCs!) has always made us want to buy it, with great joy for our ego, but acute despair for finances. So, seeing the brand new Echoes of Faydwer expansion from our trusted videogame pusher, could we not let ourselves be carried away by returning to the splendid world of EverQuest?", "date": "2006-12-06", "grade": null}
