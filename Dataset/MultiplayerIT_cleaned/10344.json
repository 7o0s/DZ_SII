Of course, that was the bravado arrogance, but Sam had something more, that is, he pushed the formula of Doom and company to excess, reaching peaks of frenzy that no other first person shooter has managed to reproduce, Second Encounter apart. Serious Sam 2, while trying to stay on the tracks of the first, but with a renewed graphics engine (the Serious Engine 2), was only a pale imitation of the original formula; what he lacked was the excess, both in the breadth of the spaces where the firefights took place, and in the number of enemies to be faced at the same time, far too limited by the standards of the series. The years have passed, the return of the Duke has been buried under the lawsuits (still ongoing) due to the poor management of the project by the developers, while Sam expects a third episode that hopefully sets aside the filings of the second and returns on the straight path of delirium. In the meantime, however, Croteam has decided to put Serious Sam: The First Encounter back on the market by adding an HD at the bottom. What does it mean? Simply that the graphics engine is no longer the original one, but has been replaced by Serious Engine 3, which is the heart of the future third episode. This translates into a massive graphical update with more defined textures and completely remodeled enemies. Otherwise it's the exact same game. Why is Sam Serious? Sam is the hero you don't expect, with his explosive muscles, always ready joke, happy trigger and a bravado that makes him face the most difficult situations with a commendable nonchalance ... or at least that was before the HD cure . Hopefully the artworks lie, the image of the new Sam seems more poised and brooding. No guys, we don't play jokes. Fortunately, the Sam in the game is always the same and in the cooperative mode it is possible to use all his crazy costumes. The plot tells of aliens sighted in the skies of ancient Egypt with ours having to wipe them out with any weapon he comes across. The first levels are difficult but not impossible. In front of Sam men with saw heads appear (it's not an offense, they really have a sort of rotating blade instead of a head!), others without heads but with two bombs in their hands, strange fleshy masses with a big eye on the chest, skeletal horses (Kleer) difficult to hit and always ready to charge and so on. In the advanced levels, other creatures will appear, much bigger and more powerful, which will give our hero a hard time. In reality, these are enemies who taken individually do not give much thought; unfortunately they have a nasty habit of attacking en masse in groups of tens or even hundreds at a time. How can we forget the assault of the Kleers on the streets of the suburban level? But, above all, how to forget the spit blood to overcome them? How can we fail to mention the final level, the race towards the pyramid, with the gigantic boss at your back and dozens of enemies attacking from all sides? In fact, the game is really difficult and already at a normal level it requires considerable skill to be tamed. Let's not talk about the next levels, of which the last one, renamed Mental, is pure madness (precisely). The Alternatives Among the most recent releases there is Dreamkiller which could give you some satisfaction, while Painkiller: Resurrection is better left alone (it is advisable to recover the first episode with its expansion). Going back in time a bit, you can jump into Serious Sam 2, even if it falls short of the first! Restyling work As we said, the innovations introduced in this version mainly concern the technical part. The original Serious Sam impressed above all for the breadth of the spaces in which the fights took place and for the grandiose buildings that served as a backdrop for the massacre. The effect produced by the graphics is not what it used to be, despite the higher resolution of the textures, but it is striking that despite the years, you can still feel the ~sense of wonder~ caused by entering an area from boundless boundaries. The same goes for the titanic bosses who, even if imitated and surpassed by the competition, still have their reason.", "date": "2009-12-02", "grade": "7.5"}
