The Gravity Queen is pretty much one of the coolest fictional characters the video game world has churned out in recent years. She's a superhero, but she doesn't live in large buildings or prestigious villas: she's penniless and has to go out of her way to bring home the bread. She doesn't wear a mask, yet hardly anyone ever recognizes her even though she saved the world. In the first episode she had lost her memory, but she didn't withdraw into herself and didn't get an alternative haircut: she shrugged and started living again. Kat is always upbeat and never gives up. It is the kind of heroine that we need and that we will probably never see again, since Gravity Rush 2 has already had a really hard time coming out. The first episode was born as an experiment to flex the muscles of PlayStation Vita, but the low sales of the handheld, combined with limited advertising, have alienated the interest of the players. Last E3, Sony didn't even deign to show a trailer during the conference: according to them, ten minutes and more of zombies were better. Yet Gravity Rush 2 is the sequel that fans of the first chapter will love because it's bigger, better looking and longer lasting. Too bad he also brought with him the same problems as three years ago. It's been three years, but Kat is finally back to save the world in Gravity Rush 2 The storm is served The beginning of Gravity Rush 2 is unsettling. We follow the exploits of a team of miners intent on extracting precious jewels from the depths of a strange atoll suspended in the void. Two of them risk their lives and are saved by the skin of their teeth: they are Kat and Syd. Through a comic flashback we discover how a sudden gravitational storm sucked up Kat, Syd and Raven, spitting them back into a dimension where no one has ever heard of Hekseville, the steampunk city where the first Gravity Rush took place. Meanwhile, Kat has lost not only Raven's tracks, but also those of her ~cat~ Dusty and, with him, her shifter powers. Luckily, Kat and Syd were rescued by the Banga, a clan of miners led by the headstrong Lisa who gave them shelter. Fortunately, within a few missions, Kat finds Dusty and regains her superpowers, earning the esteem of the inhabitants of Jirga Para Lhao, an archipelago of floating islands divided into floors that separate the social classes: the rich live at the top, in the center there they are above all the merchants and the workers, below the poor among the hovels and bandits. Further down, in the darkness, an intricate labyrinth of ancient ruins unfolds where the fuel that drives commerce is mined. Gravity Rush 2 ventures a sort of social criticism, recounting the abuses of the rich protected by the militia in the pay of a regent council that has established itself in the city after having driven out the clans that had founded it, but it is a subplot that intertwines with the ups and downs of Kat, heroine with a heart of gold willing to protect everything and everyone just because it's right, without looking into anyone's pocket. In an attempt to pay off her debts and help the inhabitants of Jirga Para Lhao, Kat will have to contend with heavily armed soldiers and gigantic mechs, but also with the Nevi who are trying to invade this world too, and civil war will be the least of his problems. The story unfolds through about twenty main missions which are flanked by a myriad of absolutely optional side missions that serve to improve Kat's stats or, more simply, to reward us with animations, costumes and accessories useful for customizing the photos we can take as soon as we get our hands on Syd's camera. This is a much more interesting feature than it seems, because it is closely linked with the gameplay in several respects. We can take photos simply for the fun of it and share them on the web, where other players will be able to rate them, allowing us to earn Dusty tokens with which it is possible to unlock further rewards. Furthermore, we can take photos of the scenario at the end of a treasure hunt to suggest to other players where to find the current chest, in a sort of asynchronous cooperative mode. And the main and side quests also often make use of photographs. Sometimes we will have to take them, perhaps hidden from enemies, and other times we will have to show them to passers-by to locate the place or the citizen we are looking for. Gravity Rush 2 expertly mixes each element of the gameplay to offer a slew of missions much more complex than in the past. It may happen that you start a simple reconnaissance mission and then have to stealthily infiltrate the enemy garrison and fight aplatoon of soldiers, as well as a giant boss who shoots missiles and laser cannons. There is no shortage of variety, but sometimes it would have been better if Japan Studio had dosed the individual components better, since it often happens that a mission hits the nail a little too much on a certain mechanic, ending up lengthening the broth and making the experience more repetitive than necessary. Everyone is crazy about Kat Kat's gravitational powers are once again the core of the gameplay and fans of the first Gravity Rush will immediately feel at home as soon as they find Dusty. The control system is further improved from the already excellent revision proposed last year in Gravity Rush Remastered. For the uninitiated, Kat's super power essentially allows her to levitate in mid-air and alter gravitational pull. Put simply, you can decide to walk on walls rather than on the floor: obviously, you will find yourself ~falling~ upwards or in another direction, but since you can stop in mid-air it will be a bit like flying. And that's how Kat moves mainly through the huge neighborhoods that make up Jirga Para Lhao.... and Hekseville. It is a small preview that we must do, if we want you to understand the scope of Gravity Rush 2: at a certain point, in fact, you will return to the city of the prequel and you will not only find it changed, but also full of unpublished missions. In the meantime you will also have acquired two new ~forms~ that confer significantly different abilities: the lunar and the Jovian one. The first makes Kat light as a feather, allowing her to make impressive leaps even without altering gravity and to fall more slowly, attacking enemies with a kick that almost teleports her. Exploring the scenarios becomes a joy, thanks also to the ability to use every surface as a springboard. The power of Jovian gravity impressed us less, mostly because it makes Kat extremely slow and heavy in her movements, while exponentially increasing her destructive powers: gravitational kicks trigger gigantic explosions and the gravitational slide becomes unstoppable. With a little practice, however, you learn to switch between the three different powers instantly to take advantage of their combined peculiarities, perhaps projecting yourself towards a lunar gravity destination and then switching to the Jovian one in order to accelerate the fall towards the surface . In this sense, the exploration of each scenario stimulates the player's creativity, but unfortunately it remains an end in itself even in this episode: the cities are a great coming and going of inhabitants who barely interact with Kat and the scenarios, however intricate, they offer no secrets or collectibles to seek out. At most, every corner is combed through to collect the crystals necessary to enhance Kat's individual skills, but exploring only to look for gems soon becomes monotonous. From this point of view, we appreciated the way the Japanese developer integrated the multiplayer component. For example, players can challenge other users' ~ghosts~ in timed missions and take advantage of the talisman system to customize their Kats. Talismans are found by defeating Nevi and destroying deposits in underground mines, but the bonuses they grant are completely random. The missions in question are designed to extend the already excellent longevity of Gravity Rush 2: the idea is that players can search for the talismans and then combine or recycle them into even better versions. Hitting harder or running faster won't be enough to break other players' high scores, but it will still be a start and will inspire die-hard fans of the blonde superhero to squeeze every drop of Gravity Rush 2. As it should have been? Essentially the problems in Gravity Rush 2 are the same as in the prequel. We have a more varied structure, yes, but ultimately the missions all revolve around a series of ~gimmicks~ such as the stasis field to throw objects and transport people or the ability to move upside down to avoid patrolled streets, repeating the same objectives a little too often. In some ways, Gravity Rush 2 makes better use of Kat's gravitational powers, but enhancing them is only relatively useful (also because it takes an exorbitant amount of crystals) and enemies don't put up much resistance. Although Japan Studio has filed every smudging, Gravity Rush 2 is still a game that is not easy to master on the spot and which risks alienating less patient players. Mid-air combat is still a succession of gravity kicks, hard stops and realignmentsthat break the rhythm of the action. In these situations it is easy to lose control and get confused, especially since the camera continues to throw tantrums like it did three years ago. The fault is also a somewhat immature collision system, especially when fighting since there is no grappling system that allows you to follow one enemy at a time. In closed environments, then, it is delirium. The main mission in which the Jovian power is obtained is set in the bowels of a city made up of narrow corridors where gravity must be constantly altered. In these cases Gravity Rush 2 let us down a bit: it becomes too chaotic and the presence of numerous enemies, added to the graphic effects of the explosions, causes a visible drop in the frame rate. At the release of the demo, a few weeks ago, we had encountered the problem in the Jirga Para Lhao market area: director Keiichiro Toyama had guaranteed that it was an old build and that the team had worked to stabilize the already reduced frame rate from 60 frames of Gravity Rush Remastered to only 30. The good news is that Toyama had told the truth, since in those circumstances Gravity Rush 2 no longer trudges: now you can slide happily between the market stalls, overturning them and frightening the inhabitants, but the game remains pegged at 30 frames. Yes, 30 frames per second. Let's not make a drama out of it. In the most chaotic fights, however, the capricious camera and any slowdowns make you turn up your nose. The fact is that Gravity Rush 2 gets used to it well, also thanks to the extraordinary artistic direction which, once again, strikes the player with a truly incredible style and choice of colors. In the past Toyama had admitted that he was inspired by the works of the immortal Mbius: it is clear that the computing power of PlayStation 4 has given the team the freedom to design even more intricate and labyrinthine structures. As futile as it may be to explore from top to bottom, doing so is still a blast just for the disproportionate amount of visual detail. The varied tonality of the scenarios and the different melodies of the exceptional Kohei Tanaka express an environmental diversity that projects the illusion of an even larger world. In short, from an exquisitely stylistic point of view, Gravity Rush 2 is a real masterpiece, and it is a pity that the Japanese team has not managed to materialize every idea even on the purely technical side.", "date": "2017-01-10", "grade": "8.0"}
