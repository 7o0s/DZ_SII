{"name": "WipeOut Fusion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wipeout-fusion_a.html", "text": "Side effects The new title from Studio Liverpool can be defined as a racing game (racing game, for Anglophobes) with several elements which, however, deviate from the standards of normal car games. Forget traditional engines, four wheels under your butt and super-stoves of all kinds. Herein lies the peculiarity of the title in question. Your cars hurtle at supersonic speeds without touching the ground below, plus the ability to literally fry your opponents with homing missiles, proton cannons and so on. However, don't think that the warrior component dominates the racing one, as to get among the top positions it is essential to adopt a high-level driving style. If you then have the opportunity to drop a ~gravity bomb~ on the unfortunate opponent on duty, so be it. In short, WipeOut Fusion mixes elements of a shooter with those of a technical racing game in a balanced way. But the idea does not appeal to you? Another element to be noted necessarily is the very high speed and frenzy of the action. In fact, each race is lived with great attention and concentration alternating with phases of pure adrenaline pleasure. Suffice it to say that the slowest vehicle reaches a speed of about 2700 Kmh. Try to immerse yourself in the crazy anti-gravity rides of the game for a few hours and you will notice, after turning off the console, how slow the flow of real life is. And what do you want, these are the side effects of WipeOut Fusion. Man warned How to fly an A-G vehicle The title distributed by Sony, although remarkably fast and frantic, does not reach the absurd levels of titles such as Extreme G 3. The most comforting thing is the fact that, after all, the vehicles are perfectly controlled. The programmers have left the behavioral routine of the racing cars of the old chapters unchanged and, in my opinion, they have done very well. The difficulty is set to medium levels and a learning curve of about half an hour is required in order to win the first tournament. It is very important or even fundamental to learn the tracks by heart, so as to tackle the bends following the best trajectories in order to gain precious seconds. The layout of the keys on the joypad is excellent and very intuitive. With the X key you accelerate while the brakes are operated with the secondary back keys (L2 and R2). With R1 it is possible to exploit the power-ups collected along the way, instead with the triangle the preferred view is selected. However all the keys can be set to your liking in the game options (as well as the adjust screen, an option that is always welcome). The available armament consists of: autopilot, flamethrower, gravity bomb, gravstinger (which brakes the victim), grenades, mines, homing missile, plasma rocket, proton machine gun, earthquake (a great comeback), triple missiles, shield and turbo. What about all these weapons? What could trigger the third world war? It should also be emphasized that there are eight teams of vehicles available (each with two drivers to choose from) with just as many different driving styles. In fact there are slender and agile spacecrafts but with a rather poor shield energy, in contrast to the heavier and faster more massive but less maneuverable ones. It will then be up to the player to choose the one that best suits his driving (and blasting) style. It should also be noted that the artificial intelligence of the enemies stands at very high levels. In fact, it is not uncommon to be targeted by the enemies behind you who bomb us until we perish or to notice the opponents in front of our eyes who break into pieces. More beautiful and colorful The game opens with a presentation of dubious workmanship but which recalls the techno atmosphere of the saga very well. In the race, on the other hand, the cosmetic apparatus of the title convinces from many points of view. In fact we find well-defined and colored textures that accompany a fluidity of action that is updated 50 times per second (with some very small smudges in the most excited phases). Another positive note is dedicated to the general graphic cleanliness that invests each screen. The definition is quite high and the light and shadow effects are really well done. Every missile, explosion, flash, etc. it is accompanied by a graphic effect dedicated to it. The color palette is masterfully used and suits the futuristic spirit of the game. Even the means in the race are very realized, with all damage taken becoming easily visible. Too bad only for the usual small / big aliasing defect, even if it doesn't bother too much. In general, the cosmetic sector of WipeOut Fusion is set at medium-high levels, thanks above all to excellent fluidity and cleanliness of the image. What is certain is that we are never satisfied The eight circuits available together with a high number of options should ensure a fairly prolonged enjoyment over time. If you then add the opportunity to compete in any competition even with a friend, the level of longevity rises further. The comment on the audio system of the game is undoubtedly very positive, which releases adrenaline from all pores. Suffice it to say that the music was created for the occasion by very famous hard-rock techno groups such as Underworld, Fluke, just to name a few. The sound effects are nice enough, although I would have preferred them a tad nastier. Ultimately this WipeOut is a beautiful but not exceptional game, practically a 2097 WipeOut with better graphics and a ton of more options and weapons. In practice, a title that aficionados cannot pass up, while a good product for all others who could easily consider its purchase. Pros: Beautiful and adrenaline Funny and bad Cons: Difficult for newbies. Not too innovative. Finally he has arrived Wipeout Fusion is one of those games that keep you waiting. There's nothing to say. The cause? Simple. When the first episode was released on PSone it caused a sensation but not only. In fact he managed to hit the mark and win the hearts of the public and critics. The programmers of the time (the French of Psygnosis), enthusiastic about the success achieved, proposed a second version, called ~Wipeout 2097~, even more beautiful and fun than the first. The saga continued to win the hearts of young and old and so a third chapter came out which was criticized due to a too marked recurrence of the contents. In short, not very innovative. The fact is that by now in the known world there are hundreds of thousands of fans of the anti-gravity series. For this Studio Liverpool, taking the opportunity, launches a simple yet clear statement: ~show must go on~. And in fact this new WipeOut Fusion aims to collect everything that was good in the old chapters and to improve it, raising it to the nth degree. But is this enough for you?", "date": "2002-02-11", "grade": null}
