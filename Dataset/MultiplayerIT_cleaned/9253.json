{"name": "Strider moderno?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87952-moon-diver-strider-moderno.html", "text": "The game is available for download via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Tested version: PlayStation 3 How many of you remember the legendary Strider, the video game produced by Capcom in 1989 for a bar cabinet and subsequently converted into numerous formats, including home game platforms? For those unfamiliar with it, it was a side-scrolling platformer with combat phases set in a future where 80% of living creatures on Earth had been eliminated. Strider was conceived by Kouichi Yotsui, the same mind behind the title that we are going to analyze in this review. Moon Diver, in fact, a temporary exclusive for PlayStation Network, has been labeled in recent weeks as ~Strider of 2011~ not only for some stylistic or gameplay similarity with that product, but above all for the presence in the project of the aforementioned developer, who has trigger in the minds of most such assonances. In reality, the mechanics of this Square Enix production appear very close to those of at least another dozen games, from Assassin for Team 17's Commodore Amiga to the various scrolling hack'n'slash, up to Castlevania due to some RPG elements . Moon Diver has only one basic mode, and that is the one called Story. Yes, because despite the type of game, there is a plot. Sketched the bare minimum, but it's there. And it has to do with a certain Faust, a young man who wants to annihilate humanity and make the world his personal amusement park. Only four heroes, futuristic ninjas, are left to try to put a spoke in his works. Slice, shoot, combo To start playing, just select the character you want to play among the four available: Seyfert, Hitori, Tolby and Ourion. Each of them is distinguished not only by different colors but also by different skills and parameters. In terms of gameplay this translates into level ups, controls and special moves that are very distinct from each other. After that you can start tackling the first of the twelve levels (and three areas) into which the story mode is divided. The title obviously takes up the traditional game scheme of the 80s - 90s platform action and that is the one that foresees the movements of the character in two-dimensional areas from left to right on the screen, slicing and hitting everything that comes in front. The whole game consists of just this: massacring enemies in sequence, collecting items and points up to the usual boss at the end of the stage. In Moon Diver there is again the camera that zooms from time to time on the scene, but nothing more than the various, old exponents of the genre. The controls are pretty intuitive and easy to master. The left stick moves the character, the square is for the simple attack and the X key is for jumping. Then there are various types of offensive moves related to some factors and status of the hero. In general, the difference between a normal attack and one of those called Charge consists in the fact that the former damages the enemy by removing some energy, earning more experience points, while the latter is more powerful and able to inflict greater damage with one shot. However, at the price of fewer experience points obtained from killed opponents. The circle button is instead used for special attacks called MoonSault Combinations (MC). These can be equipped in special slots, four, each corresponding to a part of the directional cross of the pad, through which in fact they are called into battle. And they require a certain amount of MP to use. For example Thor's Arc (a fire blast) requires the expenditure of five MPs to use. These skills can also be used in multiplayer games in a sort of combo series. They are recovered, among others, also in battle, by breaking elements of the scenario, etc. Playstation 3 trophies Moon Diver rewards players with twelve trophies. The latter are divided as follows: eight in bronze, three in silver and one in gold. Rewards are earned by progressing through the game in both single and multiplayer. These range from requiring you to complete the first four levels of the game or performing a kill streak of 100 or more for the minor rewards. To collecting fifty MC techniques or raising the average level of the characters to fifty for the most important ones. The multiplayer At the end of each level you then get points to use to upgrade the character (HP, MP and Power) and you can equip what you collected during the fight in the scenario you just completed. Like many of the old titles of the genre, and for the reasons described above, this Moon Diver too becomes repetitive over time and, at times, even quite frustrating, considering the fact that every time you die you have to start the whole session from the beginning. Paradoxically, we believe these elements will not displease older gamers, accustomed in the past to challenges such as those proposed in this product (whoever writes this review still has clear memories of Alex Kidd's unnerving levels in Miracle World for SEGA Master System or those of Yoshi's Island on Super Nintendo), but which could literally enrage the younger and possibly less patient users. Things definitely change playing multiplayer. In fact, the title provides this option for four players simultaneously both offline and online. Playing with friends isn't just fun, but it almost becomes a necessity considering the high level of difficulty we were talking about earlier, which the game reaches especially towards the end. Furthermore, only in this way, that is, by combining the different styles of the fighters, their unique skills and the logic of the users who control them, can you fully enjoy a fair dose of strategy that the product is able to offer beyond mere button mashing. Especially with the bosses. Not to mention that the allies can revive the downed companion, which is quite convenient. We conclude by talking about graphics and audio. The visual sector of the game is excellent and has very nice and clean 2D graphics. The characters seem to be taken from an anime, and while not very large in size, they are well defined. Ditto scenarios and effects, always keeping in mind the type of product. The sound in turn presents good samples and a very 90s soundtrack, as if to underline a sense of belonging to a genre, as repeated several times throughout this article, which was very popular in that period.", "date": "2011-05-30", "grade": "7.5"}
