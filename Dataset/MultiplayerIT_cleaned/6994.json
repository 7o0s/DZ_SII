It is a tie-in that at its debut caused a lot of talk precisely due to the unprecedented juxtaposition between the Musou mechanics and the anime created by Yoshiyuki Tomino, very dear to Italian fans not only because of its themes, exceptionally modern for the times, but also and above all for the controversies that accompanied its first (and, for decades, only) broadcast in Italy, in the 80s. Commanding the most famous Mobile Suits belonging to the Universal Century, our goal in the game was very simple: to eliminate hordes of enemies with a view to missions based on territory control, in this case the liberation of specific areas of the map from the presence of units hostile. An operation that we had to perform by alternating the not so many combos at our disposal to mow down the Zaku, the Dom and their variants, activating devastating super moves as soon as possible to speed up the process. A formula perfectly identical to that of the traditional Dynasty Warriors, and which we found practically unchanged even in the second and third episode of the series, the latter however strengthened by a small technical revolution (the use of cel shading for graphics, definitely spot on) and a campaign that was narratively based on a sort of alternate reality, a courageous choice but of little appeal to purists. Three years later, when the developers of Omega Force seemed to have said it all and explored every facet of the combination between Mobile Suit and Musou, here is Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn, made exclusively for PlayStation 3, attempting a difficult relaunch . It was supposed to be the rebirth episode, instead Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn is a step backwards Nobody makes it In terms of content there is very little to complain about, given that the two single player campaigns (but also playable in local co-op with a friend) of Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn offer particularly long-lasting entertainment and designed expressly for fans of the white Mobile Suit. From the start screen it is in fact possible to access the Official Mode, which includes six different storylines based on the events of ~Mobile Suit Gundam~, ~Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam~, ~Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack~, ~Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn~ , ~Mobile Suit Gundam Seed~ and ~Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny~, each with the most important characters and events, unfortunately narrated through static sequences that have not been translated into Italian (the dialogues are in Japanese, the texts in English ) and which are relatively heavy to follow in the long run. The missions included in these packages therefore follow the plot of the related souls and put us at the controls of different Mobile Suits depending on the case, with the possibility of collecting a series of ~projects~ on the battlefield that can be used to improve the characteristics of the robots belonging to our stable, albeit in terms of a not exactly intuitive interface, which dwells uselessly on selections and confirmations instead of providing us with a clear and simple picture of the upgrade on duty and how it affects the functioning of the robot. Also from the start screen it is also possible to try your hand at the Ultimate Mode, an alternative mode that mixes characters and plots to offer us a sequence of internships that is different from the usual, with specific objectives to be achieved without however putting in place substantial changes compared to what is the basic structure. Playstation 3 trophies The thirty-two Trophies contained in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn are obviously based on numbers. Beyond those obtainable by completing the various sagas, most of the achievements are obtained by eliminating a certain amount of opponents, obtaining a percentage of the blueprints for the Mobile Suits and, for really patient players, by completing the Ultimate Mode five, ten and twenty times. Something old and something old Those who expected from Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn the introduction of some novelties from the point of view of gameplay will unfortunately be disappointed: the formula is always the same, which means that in each level you have to eliminate all enemies and clean up certain areas of the map , possibly paying attention to the energy of our companions if their survival is placed as a decisive factor for the completion of the mission. So if you were already used to approaching groups of hostile robots, alternate two or three combo and run the specials as soon as possible, and then move on to the next opponents, you will immediately feel at home, with all the pros but above all the cons of a gameplay that appears immutable and which in many years has not gone beyond the addition of a pair of maneuvers; in this specific case the charged fire, capable of eliminating some enemies with a single rifle shot, and the ~focus~, which amplifies our maneuvers for a certain period of time and can be combined in a devastating way with the special move, giving rise to a ~pair~ attack with the partner. You can move quickly on the map thanks to the boost (whose functioning is regulated by the appropriate bar) and this makes it less frustrating having to alternate your action from one end of the scenario to the other, but the repetitiveness of this system is far too evident and the philosophy behind the Musou productions, which prefers hordes of almost completely passive opponents to more essential and meaningful clashes, does not help in order to make the experience fun for a long time. Which means that once again Koei Tecmo has addressed itself only to the avid Gundam fans, those willing to turn a blind eye (or maybe both) to the inability to renew a series which, with this new episode, is practically scoring steps backwards instead of forwards. The speech is particularly true for the technical sector, which abandons the excellent cel shading solution seen in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 to return to the style of the first two chapters, with a large number of Mobile Suits on the screen, as per tradition, but dull, desolate, anonymous settings, devoid of detail and interactivity.", "date": "2014-07-22", "grade": "5.0"}
