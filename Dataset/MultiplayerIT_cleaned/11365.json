{"name": "Terror's Seed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terrors-seed.html", "text": "Even if this is not its ideal terrain, the horror genre already boasts several exponents in the mobile arena. We have in fact seen adventures with a strong text component (the conversion of Silent Hill, for example) as well as titles characterized by an exceptional visual rendering, developed exclusively for smartphones (7 Days: Salvation). Terror's Seed, given the strong action connotation, differs from what we have been able to try so far, presenting itself with a structure halfway between an adventure and a shoot'em-up, with a top view that allows us to move the character in four directions and to shoot at the enemies that are in our line of fire. The story on which everything is based is practically not told, except in the few lines that can be read during loading between one stage and another. But the incipit is clear. As anticipated, it is a question of completing eight stages, set in eight different areas of a huge house populated by zombies and monsters of all kinds. The development of the action is extremely simple: every time we face an opponent, we have to kill him using the equipped weapon, preferably with shots from afar. This is because the creatures of Terror's Seed are equipped with an artificial intelligence that leaves something to be desired, and they snap (chasing us quickly) only when they see us close. A problem that is not insignificant, if we think that our energy bar is affected in a very limited way by the attacks of the creatures: the end result is that you can explore the house without too many problems, and even in the presence of numerous enemies it is enough have a cautious approach to get through any area unscathed. You can pick up different and more powerful weapons, in this case with limited ammo, to make your life even easier. Finally, very often we will have to look for keys capable of opening certain doors, essential for continuing in the stage: finding them is not at all complicated, after all they stand out in the background. The control system is very well organized, with the joystick used for character movement and the 5 key for shooting. An immediate configuration, which however has to deal with a response to inputs that is not always precise: in some cases, even the controls ~freeze~ for a few moments. Beyond the usual musical accompaniment that leaves its time, Terror's Seed has a respectable graphic sector, characterized by excellent quality especially as regards scrolling, which is rather fluid. The protagonist and all the monsters are well designed and have a discreet animation, moreover the colors used make the gloomy atmospheres necessary to paint the house as the gloomy and dark place that was the intention of the developers. A note of merit also for the locations, which share the same starting point but sometimes manage to differentiate themselves clearly, to the full advantage of the visual variety. We have already mentioned the control system: it is simple and immediate, but suffers from an imprecise response to inputs as well as some mysterious blocks. PRO Technically well done Good atmosphere Simple game mechanics AGAINST Too linear Too easy Some problems with the controls", "date": "2008-06-13", "grade": "S.V."}
