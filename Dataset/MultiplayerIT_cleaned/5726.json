This third chapter can be considered a mix of what has been seen in the previous ones, given that from a stylistic point of view it takes up the red tones that we observed in the first (with interlude scenes inspired by communist propaganda posters which are perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of the game), but treasures a certain degree of variety from the second, even if unfortunately it also retains some of its flaws. After China and India, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia closes the trilogy. Will it be an ending with a bang? Runaway In Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia we take on the role of Nikolai Orelov, an expert assassin to whom the order entrusts one last mission before granting him a well-deserved retirement: to steal an object that fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks after the attack on the Tsar's palace. In carrying out his mission, Orelov becomes an involuntary witness of the extermination of the Romanov family, but he also becomes the protagonist of the legend concerning Anastasia, the princess who, according to many, did not die with her family. Orelov takes her under his wing, discovering that she has surprising qualities, partly influenced by the artifact recovered during the first mission. The whole game therefore focuses on the hasty escape of the two through Russian territory, perpetually hunted by the soldiers of the Red Army, who want at all costs to finish the job and eliminate the last heir to the throne of the Tsar, obviously guided by the hand of the templars. Given the particularly gloomy atmosphere, the game makes great use of black and white, using red to highlight the handholds and hooks to which we can attach our grappling hook, which can be used to pull objects or launch the shocks that disable traps . The other weapons at our disposal are a three-shot rifle, smoke bombs and the inevitable whistle, as well as obviously our assassin skills. However, there will also be times when we need to control Anastasia. In that case we will not be able to fight hand to hand, but only perform stealth eliminations and use a grappling hook that will allow us to hook ourselves to the ceiling. Anastasia, however, can also count on the power of the Helix, which will allow her to hide even in front of the guards and quickly switch between hiding places, using a sort of teleportation. Obviously both of these actions consume the Helix bar, which can be filled by collecting certain icons around the maps. The change of perspective with Anastasia is an interesting variation, forcing you to move almost exclusively in stealth mode, but all in all the philosophy of the game does not vary that much. Xbox One goals Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia offers 17 trophies, almost all of which are bronze and four are silver. In addition to those that can be obtained simply by completing the game once, there are some dedicated to the evaluation at the end of the missions and the way we kill enemies. Given the difficulty level of the game getting them all can be quite difficult, it will probably take you a couple of steps to do it. The killer's routine Obviously the gameplay does not differ much from what we have already been able to appreciate in the previous chapters, with 2.5D levels that become increasingly intricate and difficult, alternating more classic phases with moments in which we will only have to flee or use a rifle ~Enemy at the Gates~ style sniper rifle. In some cases we will also be forced to eliminate a certain objective before it reaches its destination, so as to pickpocket it to steal its secret plans or the key that allows us to pass the level. As for the enemies, they range from the basic soldier to the armored, passing through those equipped with gas masks who are invulnerable to smoke bombs but, incredibly, have no limitation on the field of vision. Being discovered in 90% of cases means death and where to restart in checkpoints that are not always well positioned. To make things more complex, there is also a control system that does not always do what we would like and in some cases, especially when timing is everything, it can lead us to yet another death and consequent curses. If we add the low reactivity of the system to a level design that in some cases requires perfect timing in the movements, the result is that the game can be really frustrating in some moments, especially when logic is triggeredthan ~trial & error~ that are beyond personal skill. To counterbalance all this there is sometimes an artificial intelligence that does not prove particularly brilliant, but follows the assigned patterns with even comical results, such as when the soldiers activate the traps that they themselves have placed, committing suicide. Once we got to the end, the average difficulty level of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia seemed a bit fluctuating. There are moments that have required many attempts to be completed and others that, surprisingly, have spun smooth as oil. Often it's just a matter of finding the right key to move forward or a little luck. Basically the game is nothing more than a continuous sequence of puzzles interrupted here and there by slightly more excited moments that break the rhythm without distorting the essence too much. To complete it without unlocking all collectibles and without the best ratings, it will probably take you five or six hours. Undoubtedly excellent value for money.", "date": "2016-02-08", "grade": "7.5"}
