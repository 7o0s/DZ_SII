{"name": "Full Spectrum Warrior", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/full-spectrum-warrior-2.html", "text": "The life of soldiers is always difficult The interface and the control method are well done, becoming aware of the various possibilities that the game offers could have been a significant obstacle, but Pandemic Studios have managed to find effective and intuitive solutions. For example, by moving the right stick, an indicator with yellow circles appears, which symbolize the positions that the members of our team will take once the positioning command has been assigned and, obviously, the positions will change based on the characteristics of the environment. The team leader will always be at the head of the group and all the components will arrange themselves in the best way according to where he indicates. By positioning the cursor near a corner, our men will arrange themselves in single file, and initially they will be flattened against the wall, directing them behind a vehicle, or towards any other object that can function as protection, we will see our men move and settle down already on your knees to expose yourself as little as possible to enemy fire. Another example of the icon system is the representation through a shield on the head of our men, or on that of the enemies, which appears when this is in a covered or safe area. The main campaign mode lasts between 10 and 15 hours depending on the difficulty level chosen, in this regard it must be said that easy and difficult are not calibrated in the best way, presenting too simple solutions or quite challenging passages. The save system offers automatic save points, the frequency of which depends on the level of difficulty. The development of the levels is linear, in some, moreover, there are areas of the city that are perfectly visible, but inaccessible by our soldiers, probably to limit the playing field and to focus the player's attention on the paths to take, but with a loss in terms of the credibility of the setting. As previously mentioned, it will not be possible to aim and shoot directly, but our men from this point of view will be totally autonomous. During the missions, however, it will be possible to choose and use grenades, small objects that will be essential for overcoming some passages. If you find ammunition supplies during the levels, you will not find new grenades, nor gas grenades, which are very useful for blocking enemies' view, and carry out sorties, nor fragmentation ones with more destructive functions. Regarding the damage factor, one of the most appreciable features during the game is precisely the possibility of damaging several structures: see the cars falling piece by piece under the shots of the machine gun, offering less and less cover to our team or enemies, or destroy them totally with a rocket launcher shot, further increases the realism of the game and its spectacularity. Nobody's perfect The THQ title, as fun as it proves, is not perfect and has some shortcomings and small flaws. With regard to the latter, during the development of the missions, and above all while repeating them, one realizes the quantity of scripts used for enemy management. Unfortunately, the bad guys on duty are always in the same positions and always act in the same way, in repeating a mission rather than expecting surprises, we focus on optimizing the tactics to be used to complete the journey in the best possible way. Even the Artificial Intelligence of the enemies does not represent the state of the art, in certain situations their reactions are not particularly intelligent, such as for example in the presence of grenades on the ground, or when their hiding place is destroyed. In this regard it must be emphasized that these considerations do not apply to our soldiers, their reactions and their behavior on the battlefield are much better and more efficient. We were talking about shortcomings, these are not so much the fault of the programmers, but on the contrary thanks to their work. Full Spectrum Warrior proves to be decidedly satisfying and when you are faced with a game that entertains and satisfies like the Pandemic Studios title, every user asks for something more. For example, one wonders why it is not possible to enter buildings too, perhaps those where the enemies were located, to completely reclaim the area, or perhaps to use the structures to obtain strategic advantages. Or wondering why the action takes place all on the ground, when a team could go up to a roof to better control an area, or maybe why our military can't use some of the vehicles featured in the levels. During the missions in FSW one could in fact forget that the meccgame anica was born exclusively as a simulator of tactics in hostile territory for two military teams of soldiers and, therefore, the inclusion of all the other factors, listed above, could have deviated from the main objective. Technically speaking On the technical side, Pandemic Studios have done a great job. Graphically, FSW is a game of considerable impact, one of its strengths is undoubtedly the lighting system combined with the design of the levels. The atmosphere that is proposed in the game is among the most evocative of the genre, the level design is very successful, full of small details that increase the realism of the areas. The particle management system is also certainly valid, which becomes fundamental in one of the missions in the game set during a sandstorm, as well as the high-resolution textures that cover the various environments and models. Full Spectrum Warrior uses the Havok Engine in the management of in-game physics and exploits its characteristics in particular as regards the damage to the playing area. Many objects on the scene can be destroyed, such as crates or vehicles, others can only be damaged and eventually lose part or all of their character protection function, such as some walls. Finally, a note of merit goes to the animations of our teams, which perfectly reproduce the movements and gait of real soldiers in the various combat situations. Even the audio sector is not neglected, the music is very similar to that heard in certain Hollywood films, such as Black Hawk Down, and change the intensity or rhythm based on the progress of the mission. The most accurate part, on the other hand, is undoubtedly that of the sound effects, which, thanks to the full Dolby Digital support, transports us directly into the middle of the battlefield. The same goes for all the dubbing work in the voices of our soldiers, not only of excellent quality, but also numerous and different from each other. The Italian version has subtitles, but fortunately it leaves the English voices of the soldiers unchanged, which certainly make the guerrilla atmosphere that awaits us in Full Spectrum Warrior better. Multiplayer, replays and bonuses The multiplayer mode in Full Spectrum Warrior is divided into two parts: one allows the exchange of our best replays, the other is the real game, which offers, via Xbox Live, the possibility of playing in cooperatives, with our dude, all levels of single player mode. There are two supported players and intuitively everyone has control of a team. Unfortunately no different modes were offered. Unfortunately, because the management of the cooperative proves to be particularly successful, combining the teamwork of two ~virtual commanders~ with different tactics and strategies. As mentioned before, we have the possibility of saving Replay, which in the most classic way possible, reproposes our missions from start to finish. Another interesting feature is the ~Army Version~ mode that can be unlocked using a particular code, which allows you to advance in the missions with a set of rules and a different difficulty level from those selectable in the normal game. Comment Full Spectrum Warrior is a title that currently has no direct competitor, whose main flaw is that the single-player campaign is a bit too short, especially when compared to all the other qualities expressed by the game. The Pandemic Studios game is probably only the first chapter of a new series, which not only lays excellent foundations for the future, but at the same time is one of the most fun and rewarding products of recent months. Pros: Excellent graphics. Rich gameplay. Unparalleled in the genre. Cons: Scripted enemy behavior. Poor enemy AI. A little too short The Full Spectrum Warrior project was born as a training simulation commissioned by the American military forces, with the aim of being able to teach basic strategies to their light infantry corps. Over time, Pandemic Studios and THQ have decided to re-propose it in the form of a video game. One of the most difficult things when reviewing is trying to correctly describe the genre to which the game in question belongs. The latest Pandemic creation does not have a well-defined identity, it takes some parts from third-person action games, others from strategy titles, others from military simulations, merging everything into a game with a unique setting at the moment. First thing to clarify, those who expect a third-person shooter will not be satisfied with FSW, in fact, throwing grenades aside, it is not possible to take control of ano between characters and shoot or aim independently. The player's task in FSW is to command and guide two squads of soldiers on the battlefield, each made up of four elements, but without direct control of them. The game starts with a training mission, this particular level is a must, and is probably good for all players. The training proves to be really well made, it lasts about an hour, and rest assured that once this formality is finished, you will know all the techniques and all the strategies to adopt during the game. Subsequently, through the interlude and presentation films, all always very accurate, we will learn about the identity of the components of the various teams, in fact in FSW nothing is left to chance, and we will not have to simply command soldier A or B, but each member of the our teams, has a background, its own history that will allow us to identify ourselves more with our men.", "date": "2004-07-09", "grade": null}
