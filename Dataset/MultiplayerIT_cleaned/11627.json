{"name": "Fish Tycoon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fish-tycoon.html", "text": "Of the so-called ~virtual pets~ we now know life, death and miracles. Born from the ashes of the first Tamagotchi, video games in which you have to raise a puppy had to go through a certain ~technical~ path before literally exploding with the various Nintendogs, Petz and so on. We have reached the point where taking care of a small animal and playing with it, in a completely ~virtual~ way, represents an attraction even for the most savvy players, those who never, ever thought they could have fun without shooting, fighting or destroying something. Fish Tycoon fits into this discourse in an at least anomalous way, given that it is to all intents and purposes an ~aquarium simulator~, in which we will therefore have to raise fish... People stay for long minutes watching simple screensavers that reproduce fish life in an aquarium, so why not make this experience more entertaining? It must have been this question that gave the input for the development of the new Oberon Games product, a company that already boasts a truly ~alternative~ catalog and which therefore has the advantage of experimenting with new ways of applying for mobile gaming. Fish Tycoon, in this case, sees us manage an aquarium and raise fish of different species, with the ultimate goal of finding seven ~magical~ species. A simple tutorial introduces us to the game structure, which starts with the release of eggs and continues with the nutrition of the fish until they become adults. At that point each specimen can be analyzed to see which species it belongs to and determine its market value, then moved to the ~showcase~ tank for sale or placed in a small isolation tank to allow it to reproduce. With the money obtained from the sale of fish, you can go to the shop and buy a large number of items, ranging from simple food to medicines, from normal eggs to rare ones, passing through improvements and expansions of the aquarium. Every time we discover that we have one of the ~magic~ specimens, one of the related boxes is filled and we have the opportunity to use the fish in question to improve the situation of the others, depending on their peculiar abilities. For the technical realization of the game, the developers were clearly inspired by the various PC screensavers, and the goal was achieved with regard to the quality of the backdrops. The fish boast a sometimes good, sometimes less, but unfortunately they move in a rather ~woody~ way, sometimes following unnatural trajectories. The surrounding elements, made up of purchasable objects and the ~people~ who have to buy our specimens, unfortunately have an approximate design. As far as the sound is concerned, we can freely select one of the four available musical themes: they are all very beautiful, only they do not loop in a ~transparent~ way and are almost always completely unsuitable for the atmosphere of the game. The control system is quite simple: with the joystick you move between the various options, which are activated by pressing FIRE (or 5 on the numeric pad), while the function keys are used to recall the fish and analyze their characteristics, or to open the pause screen.
