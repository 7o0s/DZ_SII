{"name": "L'ora della riscossa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155034-battlestation-harbinger-lora-della-riscossa.html", "text": "Although the Battlestation series started from mobile, it aims high: the ultimate goal of BugByte Games is to launch Battlestation: Humanity's Last Hope as soon as possible, which represents the most ambitious project of the small team. In order to develop this title, the developers turned to the Kickstarter audience for the second time after having already tried the crowdfunding route, without success, in 2014. The failure, fortunately, has not demoralized the developers who have decided to build the future of their sci-fi series piece by piece. The current triptych of titles belonging to the Battlestation series, an appetizer designed to introduce the game universe and introduce the development team, started from a base to manage and defend, went from a free-to- play and arrived at the title at the center of this review that expands the boundaries of the game universe and puts us in the role of a commander determined to fight back and exterminate the aliens. In Harbinger the Battlestations are there and can be attacked but they are footholds and no longer represent the center of the action. The protagonist is our ship that can wander through different systems with the aim of preparing for the final mission which involves a fight that is initially impossible to face. At the core of the experience, essentially, are ship evolution, acquiring allied ships, and obtaining new spaceships. The interface is functional and decidedly non-invasive: simple icons on the screen allow us to access the upgrade menu, that of the two hireable wingmen and the star map that shows us the viable routes that separate us from the final goal. Furthermore, pointing the finger on an object activates the relative menu which in the case of combat allows us to decide which systems to turn against the larger spaceships. In this way we can aim a weapon enhanced to damage the shields more on a ship that sports them at full power and opt for a weapon that only damages the hull, such as missiles in the case of a vessel without energy protections. Harbinger represents another step forward for the Battlestation space series Let's go and reap the alien The visual sector features a bird's eye view, strictly two-dimensional graphics and simple models but the feeling of being in space is there. A few planets in the background, the marked inertia of the spaceships and the slowness of the movements create a rather effective illusion which however costs more than anything in terms of immediacy and reactivity of the action. But on the other hand, the control of the ship passes through the point and click in a title that recreates the slow approach maneuvers of a credible space battle and Bugbyte Games itself presents Habringer as a strategic space game so there is little wonder if dodging the blows of the opponents is far from easy. There is a problem, however, in all of this. Movements are slow and even just approaching a space base for repairs takes several seconds. Furthermore, escaping is very difficult even if in various situations hyperspace, which generally reactivates after a few seconds of arrival in a system, also works in the middle of the action. Nonetheless, things gradually get complicated, some ships chase us system after system and we happen to underestimate the volume of fire which, especially with the initial ship, can eliminate us from the equation in no time. To deal with these situations the only possible solution is to upgrade the ship and to buy systems, drones, allied ships you need money while upgrades pass through green energy cubes. In both cases, the resources come from the destruction of the alien ships that infest the systems that separate us from the final objective. There are numerous possible ways to reach the target system and they can activate events that also include escort missions that are not always easy to complete. Furthermore, the enemies can count on reinforcements and these move from system to system, preventing us from creating a safe route. Some areas are full of enemies but when they are small in size it's all the better since there is the possibility of obtaining several loots without taking damage or almost. Over time, however, the presence of large ships and more dangerous enemies increases, which can also directly hit our hull, making the shield useless. In these sectors the level of risk is quite high and it is good to think twice before risking the ship since losing it ends the game unless you have acquired an escape pod. As anticipatedBattlestation includes weapon and system upgrades but the upgrades also have some disadvantages that force us to think about the actual convenience of improving a given cannon that could inflict more damage but also shoot too slowly. Furthermore, the costs of all upgrades are high and this, as in the case of movement, significantly slows down the pace of the game. However, things speed up with the purchase of repair bots which, if nothing else, save us a slow and painful commute from the base. The problem is that the interventions of the bots, already paid dearly, cost a lot and are not available on all ships, often making it attractive, especially in times of lean, to laboriously return to a Battlestation to beg for a repair. The ultimate goal Battlestation: Harbinger is not the most complex of space strategy games: the narrative sector is to say the least slender and the title doesn't even show off an impeccable balance between systems that are all too easy to deal with and suddenly difficult situations which, although revealing themselves in the early stages of the game, they require a more responsive and firepowered ship. In the Bugbyte title it is possible to face a scenario without even looking at the screen and after a few jumps in hyperspace it can happen to get stuck between systems populated by powerful ships or suffer sudden attacks just when the resources and health of the ship are scarce. There is, in essence, a strong random component but this in a space title makes sense given that it gives the player the illusion of a living universe and the unpredictability of tomorrow. And it must be said that despite some decidedly risky situations, the difficulty of an FTL is not reached which, although called into question by the developers, approaches Harbinger more for the atmosphere and spirit than for the setting or level of challenge. Let me be clear, already at an average level Harbinger is difficult while raising the difficulty to the maximum makes the initial stages decidedly challenging and increases the risk of leaving us penniless but in the Bugbyte title it is often possible to escape, among the purchases there is the escape capsule at avoid a sudden end and it is possible to proceed calmly, stay close to the base and start farming. The safest strategy is to attack systems populated by less dangerous enemies without ever daring too much by taking advantage of the option that allows you to advance time to move enemies whose movements, and this is a subtlety, can be seen on the map travel provided you are within sensor range. In this way, even if things take a long time, the difficulty is reduced while remaining extremely variable, especially at higher difficulty levels. Ultimately, the result is a title that gives great importance to evolution, difficult but characterized by the possibility of proceeding with caution which avoids excessive frustration and allows you to enjoy the atmosphere of the title calmly while maintaining an adequate challenge. Finally, everything is topped off with a final scoring system that allows you to make sense of the game even when it ends badly. If, in essence, the situations are not balanced to the millimeter, the overall experience is in the sign of the mix between a quiet space simulation, the evolution of one's ship and permanent death. A title, among other things, that runs on a large number of devices even if in the iOS field it is optimized to run best on the iPhone 5 and higher models. Probably the addition of a lighting system, even in the form of simple flashes, would have cut out some old smartphones or tablets but it would have certainly given that extra touch of magic to the tons of missiles, shots and laser beams that cross the screen during the more heated fights.", "date": "2015-08-24", "grade": "8.0"}
