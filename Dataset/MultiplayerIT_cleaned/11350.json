{"name": "The Bourne Conspiracy - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bourne-conspiracy-recensione.html", "text": "Who is Jason? The game tells us the story of the assassin betrayed by the bosses of Treadstone, of the struggle to regain his identity, to understand why everything that passes through his hands becomes a deadly weapon. A series of flashbacks lets us know Jason well before the events narrated at the beginning of the first film, well before the ~lucky catch~ off the Mediterranean. This is why the title begins not at the port of Naples, but with the dark handsome man on a mission to kill the African dictator Wombosi. From here the game immediately confuses our ideas, going back again and running forward following for good stretches the events narrated in the first film of the series. The guys from High Moon Studios have packaged a product that can be easily defined as an action-adventure, with sections on board the aforementioned Mini Cooper to break up the rhythm of the shootings/fights. If the parts with firearms are rather conventional, it is when the hands are thrown that the game shows its peculiarities. The action abandons the style of a classic third-person shooter to become a sort of fighting game. The transition from pistols to punches is handled much like in a Japanese-style RPG with random combat: when you get too close to shoot, Jason abandons the gun and starts fighting with his bare hands. It is obviously not possible to kill all the enemies from a distance, given that the latter prefer close combat with the protagonist, but also and above all given that the game, in some situations, provides for small scripted sequences that lead us directly to show off all the our ability, as the Americans say, in close quarter combat. Apparently the control method is not very complex, you only use three keys: one for the quick strike, one for the heavy strike and one for the parry. This means that without having to learn complex sequences to memorize, simply vary between the two types of shots, creating up to 8 different combos. The game doesn't reward hitting the attack buttons at random as the enemies are quite reactive, always parrying the usual sequences, but also because timing is the perfect key to knocking them down. How I'll break all your bones Parrying blows and striking immediately after, paying attention to the exact moment in which the opponents end their fast 1-2; not cashing in and carrying out the normal attacks is the fastest way to access the main feature of the title, or the sequences of brutal and very violent (automatic) shots that made the fortune of the films with Matt Damon. A bar slowly fills up every time the opponent is hit, when it exceeds the first level, it is possible to carry out a special attack against a single enemy; on the second level we can knock out two enemies, on the third three, by pushing the attack keys when required. The spectacular nature of these attacks, which knock out the supporters immediately, but not the end-of-level bosses, is expanded by the good repertoire of moves that Jason can make. The $30 million weapon in these situations becomes an almost perfect killing machine: not just kicks and punches, but also a series of grabs and throws that all invariably end with the terrifying crack of bones. As if that weren't enough, if these sorts of fatalities occur near objects or specific parts of the environment (metal doors, glass, shelves and many others), we will see the victim squash against them: everything falls apart very realistically, with the excellent work on the sounds to amplify the violence of the impact. Even the enemies can in turn perform final blows, which if obviously they cannot kill the protagonist instantly, can halve his energy bar in the blink of an eye. In this case, as in the much reviled quick time events, just press a key in time to dodge with the following devastating counter move. This system also works with firearms: in the same way, as seen in the recent Stranglehold, it is possible to automatically kill up to three opponents with one shot. Not very useful, in fact it is preferable to use special attacks for long fights with bare hands, but definitely choreographic and spectacular. The watering can syndrome The part relating to the firefights is the one that suffers the most in the total economy of the game. Not that it's badly implemented and tedious like in Kane & Linch, but it suffers from some critical issues that make you turn up your nose. The first thing you notice is that long-range weapons are decidedly inaccurate, with rivers of lead used to kill enemies hidden a few meters away.distance. Secondly, also the automatic lock on system, through the use of the Bourne instinct, does not work very well, as the low precision of the rifles and pistols makes us forget the benefits of the automatic lock. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is rather fluctuating, it is not infrequently seen that the enemies act in concert and rationally throw themselves into cover; however, they usually use the technique of placing themselves in the open field shelling shots towards Jason, with the only result of being shot from behind a wall rather easily. The two different types of gameplay are then interrupted by a few moments aboard Marie's Mini, which in terms of impact resistance and heaviness on the road has more to do with a tank than with the agile little BMW. These automotive sections don't give any added value to the game, but they manage to break the repetitiveness of the action which, despite a good combat system, reveals itself rather quickly. The bare-handed fights, although choreographically satisfying, have the defect of being all too much the same: the choice to block the shot on the characters involved, not being able to allow evasive maneuvers, nor to explore the area in search of cover , forces the player to long boxing sessions in which he waits for the end of the opponent's blows and then returns them immediately after, waiting for the special blow to load. In short, the dynamics of the clashes are rather mechanical and not very varied. Not that the game should have the same depth as a fighting game for encounters, but in some situations one gets the impression that there is not much difference between the various attacks and combos. And after the bones I'll break your furniture too! From a technical point of view, the title of High Moon Studios is appreciated for an excellent level design, for very large and detailed models and a partial destructibility of the environments, which far from being merely a facade, has serious repercussions on the game dynamics. The areas are quite vast, varied (airports, stations, libraries, ports and many others) well done, full of furnishings and furnishings, which fall apart after Jason Bourne's fatality. The covers, a crucial point in the firefights, are affected by the shots taken, leaving Jason and the enemies in the open, consequently a wait-and-see and prudent game tactic is not the best way to complete the game. The Unreal Engine also flexes its muscles in many situations with special effects lavished with both hands, but above all during the fisticuffs, with large polygonal models, perfectly animated and quite detailed. Here too it is possible to find some flaws, which fortunately for us do not seriously affect the use of the title. The first thing you notice is the insistence with which cases of interpenetration between polygons occur, with legs coming out of closed doors or enemies slamming into invisible walls. The aforementioned fixed camera on the clashes crashes many times, hiding the models, leaving the player at the mercy of the disorientation and fury of the enemy ~boxer~. After a few moments everything returns to its place, but the effect is frankly tiring and annoying. If from a graphic point of view The Bourne Conspiracy complains of some small critical issues, from the sound point of view it borders on excellence, with atmospheric music to underline the climaxes of the action and a really wide and immersive sample of sound effects. Comment Among many strengths and some defects, The Bourne Conspiracy lets itself be played with pleasure, about ten hours of gameplay, extremely adrenaline-pumping, fast and which, very importantly, manage to perfectly capture the spirit of Robert Ludlum's books and films. The combat system, immediate and easy to use, penalizes the depth of the clashes, which, although very well staged, are rather boring and repetitive in the long run. The same thing can be said for the long shootings, partially deficient when compared with other productions with a similar setting, but which still benefit from an excellent level design and a good destructible cover system. So what's left of the High Moon Studios title? A good shooter, fun, equipped with a combat system full of good ideas, not always well implemented however, and a respectable technical sector, which in some situations touches peaks of excellence. Ultimately a game that overturns the sad trend of the usual, bad tie-ins, offering largely innovative mechanics and a solid graphics sector that fans of the saga will surely appreciate. Pros Not the usual tie-in Good technical sector The combat system Cons A bit ripetitive Some interpenetration problems Level linearity Xbox 360 - Goals The game features 49 achievements for a total of 1000 points, all of which can be reached quite easily, as they are linked to objectives that can be obtained without particular worries, related to the number of enemies killed with special shots, the level of difficulty chosen and how good we are at destroying Paris aboard the Mini. The only relatively difficult one is the one that binds us to the collection of all the passports scattered throughout the level, which on the one hand rewards us with only 30 points, on the other it unlocks the possibility of being able to face all the bosses at the end of the game's level .", "date": "2008-06-19", "grade": null}
