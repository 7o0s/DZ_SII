{"name": "Brain Shock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brain-shock.html", "text": "Brain Shock is one of those games born in the wake of Tetris, only in this case we won't have to rotate the pieces that fall from above but we'll have to move, shake and turn the screen to fit them using gravity. The purpose of Brain Shock is in fact to eliminate the blocks present in each level, to destroy them we will have to align three or more adjacent boulders of the same type. The novelty, as we said, is that the blocks themselves will not rotate but we will be able to move the game board. As soon as we combine three or more boulders they will form a shock chain and start charging before disappearing, during the charge we will be able to move them and connect them to a chain of the same type. To create the combinations of chains we will have to be very fast, but if we succeed in the action we will earn extra points which will increase our score. The game features two distinct modes, Puzzle and Arcade. In the first we will have to make a clean sweep of all the pieces on the screen with the right moves and without time limits, in the second one an inflexible stopwatch will judge our performance. In Puzzle mode the number of moves allowed is limited, as the levels progress, our game variants also increase, proportionally following the variation in difficulty. In the second mode the number of moves is free but in this case time will put a stop to our attempts. The developers have included various bonuses within the Arcade mode to make the 41 levels more captivating, here we will meet explosive blocks, heavy boulders capable of crushing others, clock blocks that earn precious seconds and star blocks capable, if activated by the right chain shock, to eliminate all those of the same color. The difficulty of the Vivendi game is sometimes too high but you certainly won't be discouraged by a challenge full of possibilities. Technically Brain Shock has no obvious defects, the schemes are very colorful and we must admit that the control system also works properly.
