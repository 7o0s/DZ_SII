{"name": "L'ascesa di Lara Croft", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158820-rise-of-the-tomb-raider-lascesa-di-lara-croft.html", "text": "The videogame universe is characterized by ups and downs, appearances and disappearances of brands that have marked an era and have managed to create a critical mass of fans, a solid base capable of handing down their exploits in the years to come even in the absence of valid exponents. We like to call them immortal, capable of surviving generations of gamers up to perhaps reinventing themselves, to survive the trends and changing tastes that no longer have a reason to exist. Tomb Raider can easily fall within this category: it defined a genre, captivated by its exploratory dynamics and created a heroine, Lara Croft, who has transcended the videogame medium to embrace the cinematic one and beyond; just think of the cosplays that are still very popular at trade fairs today. In the meantime, many stars were born within the action-adventure panorama, some of which, such as Uncharted, shone to the point of imposing new visual and playful rules then taken up by the productions that arrived later. The one born in March 2013 concerns us closely: the rebirth of Tomb Raider and of the beautiful archaeologist protagonist of the series, the narration of how from a frightened young woman she became a heroine capable of facing any danger. A title clearly inspired by the production of Naughty Dog, but which in our view, beyond similarities if only due to the same genre of belonging and the dictates mentioned above, has its own charisma and a different approach , if we want even more accentuated by its inevitable sequel. Rise of the Tomb Raider is in the pipeline and only Microsoft users will be lucky enough to play the new adventures of Lara Croft for some time; a weighty exclusive, a strong brand and one of the most popular types of game in this period. The good work done by Crystal Dynamic with the reboot, even in the final version, was the basis for this chapter; we will talk about the result in the next lines. Judgment on Rise of the Tomb Raider, available as a time exclusive for Microsoft consoles Xbox One goals Rise of the Tomb Raider offers 66 objectives, of which a handful are secrets and the most substantial one, worth 125 points, dedicated to completing the main adventure at any level of difficulty. Most of the remaining ones offer from 5 to 15 points, and are linked to a certain number of kills, even multiple, at the completion of the chapters, upgrading of all accessories and weapons. Still others are unlocked by collecting 150 and then 300 cards, completing the tombs, 75% of the narrative elements, and finally the game at 100%. To get the 1000 points it will take some time but the difficulty will never be prohibitive. Following in the footsteps of Lord Croft Where in the first chapter we saw the (re)forming of a new heroine, in Rise of the Tomb Raider the developers decided to delve into Lara Croft's relationship with her father, Lord Richard, and the latter's past in search of the Source divine; a goal that has created many headaches for him, including the constant media fight waged by some journalists to discredit his research. Determined to erase these rumors, Lara Croft begins to travel between Siberia and Syria to retrace her father's studies, while a series of dangers represented by the local fauna and by an organization called Trinity stand in her way, together with the inevitable shots of scene that gradually follow one another during the adventure. The structure of the game is a close relative of that of the original title: in fact, we are dealing with a third-person adventure with a clear exploratory inclination, during which Miss Croft makes extensive use of her bow, ice axes to climb walls and of a handful of firearms in the form of pistols, shotguns and machine guns. If necessary, the protagonist can stop at a Base Camp connected to the previous ones via fast travel, where she can upgrade her skills and equipment. Each kill, discovery and collection of artifacts brings experience points as a gift, which in turn contribute to earning those skills to be spent within three different branches: combat, hunting and survival. This unlocks more complex combos, quick energy recovery, stealthy executions, fall control and much more; with R3 the protagonist instead uses her Survival Instinct, which highlights holds, collectibles and the point to reach. With the View key you access the map, and in addition to the main objective it is possible to ~mark~ a second point to be reached with a blue beam, usually represented by secondary missions, crypts and tombs; Notinstead, it is possible to insert a free indicator, which would have been very useful during the exploration phase. The concept of survival and evolution of the protagonist also returns strongly in this sequel, because Lara Croft can collect many types of materials, in order to upgrade the equipment or make the ammunition for her own bow, the undisputed protagonist among the weapons. Pressing RT allows you to create new standard arrows ~on the fly~, RB instead those that have additional lethal characteristics such as explosions or poison; finally, with LB it is possible to blindfold yourself even in combat. Rise of the Tomb Raider has a classic but not trivial structure, ~masking~ the linear progression, the cutscenes and the classic clashes with sections in which the map literally opens up to offer a multitude of side activities. Trivially you can continue to the next point indicated on the map, but it would be a mortal sin because the Crystal Dynamics game has among its greatest advantages that of offering sections in which you can spend hours to delve into the story and navigate the map, collecting materials , artifacts and exploring crypts and caves, perhaps with animals as a garrison. The part dedicated to hunting is less sketchy than its predecessor but still not entirely satisfactory and represents the only way to increase, for example, the capacity of weapons or acquire materials necessary for the rarest upgrades. The presence of some allies also makes available a series of more or less successful secondary missions including hunting trips, representing a further way to explore the large spaces offered by settings such as the Siberian Lands or the Soviet Base. The collectibles are therefore wasted, also in the form of audio recordings, coins to spend on upgrades, mini-maps that reveal the remaining objects and monoliths that require linguistic knowledge from Lara Croft, increased precisely by finding the artifacts. The exploration and research phase within Rise of the Tomb Raider is never particularly difficult, but it is always a good excuse to digress and has the positive effect of causing that ~loot syndrome~ typical of titles belonging to different genres . It is so immediate and fun that it often leads the player to deviate from the main story to devote himself to collecting: we ourselves have completed the title at 82% of the total, testifying to the goodness of this system. Questions and answers How many difficulty levels are there? Four: Adventure, Exploration, Brutal Exploration and Survival. The first three can be selected at any time and the description can be found in the review. Is it possible to continue playing after completing the story? Yes, just reload the last save to watch another cutscene, and then dedicate yourself to 100% completion. How many Ancient Tombs are there in the game? Nine in total, of different size and duration depending on the case. In how many hours is it possible to complete the game? It took us about 17 hours, at 82% of the total activities available. Is it possible to select voice acting and subtitles independently? Yes, the game is also completely dubbed in Italian. Does the protagonist make sounds and suffer like in the first chapter? Absolutely, with our powerful means we have calculated an average of 5.4 emissions every minute of play. Greed has no boundaries For most of the time, even during the unfolding of the main story, the player has to do with exploration and rather airy platform sections, during which the athletic characteristics of the protagonist are exploited to move between the holds, use ice axes to climb, grappling hook and other gadgets as you acquire them. In the meantime, you can enjoy the shot offered by the camera, which performs well even when you have to escape from the most agitated situations represented by catastrophic landslides and helicopter chases. The control system always reacts perfectly to the inputs of the pad, the bow is undoubtedly the most popular and successful weapon, marrying perfectly with the character of the protagonist and with the multitude of events proposed, even when the arrival of machine guns and rifles would suggest a privileged use of the latter. Most of the encounters with the henchmen of the Trinity can be tackled in stealth mode, perhaps by attacking from the bushes or landing a nice arrow at the base of the head; opponents have a rather predictable range of vision and which ~activates~ or not their companions based on thetheir location, indicated by a specific color in Survival Instinct mode. When we move on to direct clashes, some shortcomings of artificial intelligence emerge, with opponents who, while not skimping on throwing grenades or constant movement, are clumsy and leave some weak points uncovered. Even the management of the combat system of the protagonist could have been better: you cannot shoot blindly from cover or even on the move, you must necessarily aim with LT and the clashes are not particularly engaging or difficult, except in rare cases in which it is enough to use molotov cocktail or the advanced characteristics of your bow to defeat the most numerous enemies. Within the options it is possible to select at any time three of the four difficulty levels present, namely Adventure, Exploration and Brutal Exploration; we have always played with the latter, without particular problems despite the fact that compared to the first level there is no aim assist, and compared to the second the enemies are more tough and energy does not regenerate during fights. The Survival level remains, which must be selected immediately and eliminates energy regeneration, reduces available resources and increases the strength of enemies, representing the option to recommend for the most hardcore lovers of the adventure / third-person shooter genre. For narrative needs, the clashes become more numerous in the final bars of the adventure, but as mentioned, the Crystal Dynamics title performs better in all the other aspects we have listed. The flagship is undoubtedly represented by the Ancient Tombs, which are to be found within the map. The reason is obvious: they offer interesting platform sections and ingenious physics-based puzzles, have their own visual language and are definitely fun to deal with, giving new skills to the main protagonist when you complete them. In some you have to blow up passages or move carts, in others activate gears in sequence, in still others ~play~ with the water level to unlock the passage; they are custodians of the best puzzles of the game together with a couple of other passages present in the main adventure, which, as mentioned, gives its best in the platform and exploration phases. If we were to compare Rise of the Tomb Raider with its predecessor, we would have to say that the feeling is very similar, but with improvements in level design, exploration and also in the plot twists of the story: the ending on the one hand closes the circle , on the other hand it opens up new adventures for Lara Croft. There is therefore no decisive evolution in the formula, but this does not necessarily represent a defect, given the very good starting point; the Shipping method - which we talk about in a specific paragraph - also increases the quality of the overall package. From a technological point of view it is possible to find several steps forward compared to the previous chapter, but also some elements that betray the nature between generations of the graphics engine. In rainy settings or with elements such as caves, snow-covered and rocky passages, the stroke is soft, pleasant and enhanced by the lighting system, which offers memorable glimpses and adds complexity to the surfaces. When dealing with forests and other ~jagged~ objects, the level of detail becomes less impressive and the image dirtier, together with less defined textures than one would expect. The overall impact is in any case adequate, Lara Croft is masterfully made in the features, in the face and in the clothing, with details such as the hair that follows the direction of the wind and rests on the shoulders; the animations are also convincing, except in cases where they are accelerated by choice in order not to sacrifice response to commands. Collisions between objects have received particular attention, the image flows smoothly at 1080p and thirty frames per second, with dips in the presence of full-bodied particle effects or when you are in water; water, among other things, made in a way that is far from flawless. The interlude sequences enjoy an additional detail that does justice to the most spectacular situations, the transition is almost always imperceptible except in the night sequences, during which the filter change ~betrays~ this passage. Ultimately, Rise of the Tomb Raider is rightfully part of the productions that offer remarkable visual care and high production values, while signaling how some elements denote a graphics engine that has not yet completely freed itself from solutions adopted in the past generation of consoles.
