The game put us at the controls of a nice little robot, B.U.D., sent to an alien planet to analyze its vegetation and make the gigantic Star Plants flourish, vines capable of reaching thousands of meters and thus allowing us to reach the satellites gravitate around the world and discover its secrets. The experimental nature of the product was in fact the limit, given the complete lack of accompanying narrative elements, the brevity of the experience and a series of technical flaws also due to the procedural system that managed the animations of the protagonist. For this second chapter, Grow Up, the franchise is therefore in the position of having to grow, adding a solid structure to the original mechanisms, some variations on the theme and perhaps a technical upgrade. Was it really like that? Grow Up enriches the Grow Home formula with new elements, but some aspects remain opaque The Beanstalk In Grow Up we find practically all the peculiarities of Grow Home, but with an extra gear. This time there is even a minimum of plot, because the sentient ship M.O.M., on which the robot travels through space, ran into a shower of asteroids and ended up in pieces on an unknown planet. Our goal, having ended up on the surface of this new world, will therefore not simply be to analyze the vegetation, develop the Star Plants and collect some crystals, but also and above all to find the pieces of M.O.M. to ensure that they go to rejoin the main structure, which is located on the moon, and then reach it ourselves. We were saying, there are things that have not changed since the first episode of the series, for example B.U.D. he still moves with the agility of a drunk with two pats of butter for feet. Did the developers want to simulate the gravity of the alien planet in this way? Does the robot protagonist of the game really have a problem with alcohol? It is not known, but the game's ultra-inertial system can cause quite a few headaches in both old and new users, making even absolutely trivial maneuvers complicated and generating powerful episodes of frustration when a simple step too many leads us to fall from over a thousand meters high, forcing us to repeat the strenuous climbing procedure all over again. The latter also remained unchanged, with the hands of B.U.D. activated by the two backbones of the controller (or by the two triggers, if desired), which in turn adhere to the surfaces and allow you to perform admirable sessions of extreme climbing. You have a thousand weapons To buffer the limits of the protagonist in terms of movement and speed up the exploration of the scenario, the developers have fortunately replenished the repertoire of special abilities that B.U.D. can unlock throughout the adventure. In addition to the initial weak jetpack, in fact, the android can obtain a parachute with which to avoid game over in impacts from great heights and perform precision landings, a glider that allows him to glide for miles and miles, as well as the ability to roll up and become a sort of sphere, so as to move much faster. The combination of all these powers and the possibility of reproducing the various plants found on the planet, often able to make us ~bounce~, project us up or simply provide us with something to climb on, makes things much simpler than in Grow Home, so much so that in the final stages moving for very long distances or reaching incredible heights becomes a trivial operation. Was it therefore a bit exaggerated in the simplification of certain mechanisms? Perhaps yes, but everything must be placed in the perspective of a product that works well even in this way, is pleasant and lasts a handful of hours (three or four, depending on how shrewd you are). For the more demanding, however, there is the whole part of collecting crystals, which enhance the protagonist's abilities, as well as a set of challenges that will often see us fluttering between the traditional circles in the air within a time limit. Playstation 4 trophies The seventeen Trophies of Grow Up are obtained by exploring the length and breadth of the setting, discovering its secrets and points of interest, but also by unlocking all skills, collecting all crystals and completing all skill challenges. There are of course specific actions that lead to the unlocking of specific achievements, such as gliding a certain distance or falling froma certain height. Two steps forward, one step back In addition to what has already been said about the powers and capabilities of B.U.D., the Grow Up experience is also improved in terms of navigation thanks to the introduction of P.O.D., a sentient drone that flies over the scenario and allows us, at any time, to visualize the planet from above to locate points of interest, teleporters, devices for challenges and the lost components of M.O.M., even if the latter only become visible if we have explored the area firsthand. The technical sector, on the other hand, is a bit disappointing, too similar to what was already seen in the first episode, but above all spoiled by the same problems: the procedural animation of the robot is ugly and strong to look at, the camera sometimes goes crazy, there are many episodes of polygonal interpenetration and a rather evident pop-up effect when we approach the various areas of the setting in flight. Of course, once again there are numerous breathtaking views to admire, the sense of vertigo is not indifferent when you climb very high, you notice an excellent choice of colors and the graphic style is original and recognizable, which probably matters most of all the rest. The sound, on the other hand, remains relegated to the role of an extra, too essential to leave a mark.", "date": "2016-08-15", "grade": "7.0"}
