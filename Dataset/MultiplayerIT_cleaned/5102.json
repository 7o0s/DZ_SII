{"name": "Silence", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/178299-silence-tra-la-vita-e-la-morte.html", "text": "Attention advances: Speaking of Silence we will make some reference to the plot of the game and, above all, we will explicitly talk about that of The Whispered World, the previous chapter, including the final. If you don't want to have advances, don't read on. Silence tells the story of Noah, the little boy who in The Whispered World wakes up at the end of the adventure after destroying the world of Silence as the clown Sadwick, and his sister Renie, a lively little girl fascinated by the tales of that dreamland , which exists only between life and death, in which his brother was imprisoned. At the beginning of the adventure, the two are forced to hole up in a bunker due to the bombings caused by a war of which we are told nothing. The main characters immortalized all together Noah tries to cheer and distract the little girl in every way, telling her the stories he loves, but when a bomb hits the bunker, the two find themselves scattered and divided in the world of Silence. Here they meet an old friend: Spot, Sadwick's shape-shifting caterpillar, capable of flattening and inflating as needed. Unfortunately it seems that something is not going right on Silence: a false queen has scattered dark creatures called seekers across the kingdom, who kill anyone they find in their way. The only ones to oppose it are the members of the resistance, who want at all costs to put an end to its reign of terror. Will Noah and Renie be able to reach the throne room and destroy the mirror to return to reality, as Sadwick did in his time? Don't be fooled by the fact that we're talking about the sequel to The Whispered World, because Silence is much closer to a Telltale adventure than its predecessor. There is therefore no recallable inventory, although characters can collect items, and the solutions to the puzzles are all quite straightforward. In fact, just find the hotspots and click. Only in some situations is it required to solve puzzles that require a minimum of observation and use of intelligence. However don't worry, because in case you can't pass them you can skip them. The game system also offers a button which, when pressed, shows all the interactive points of a scenario and gives advice on what to do. In short, getting stuck is really impossible, even when solving the puzzles requires the use of Spot and his powers. Of course, there are sequences that are more difficult than others, but we are talking about situations that a graphic adventure enthusiast can overcome in a few moments, as well as a non-enthusiast. We have finally reviewed Silence, the sequel to The Whispered World: find out what it's like What Silence does well Silence is a fascinating world. It was in The Whispered World and it is even more so in its sequel, made as it is of ancient palaces, timeless ruins, dark woods full of dangers, inaccessible peaks on which mythological creatures live and many more dream places. Spot returns Some sceneries are just beautiful It's worth playing even just to admire the beauty of the settings, which shock you with their richness of detail. In particular, in the final part of the game there are sequences that offer some of the most beautiful scenarios visited in recent video games. In short, Renie and Noah are catapulted into a wonderful world, made up of large spaces and fantastic creatures, in contrast to the brutal and deadly reality that is told in the introduction. It's not for nothing that the relationship between reality and fantasy is the central theme of the entire game, which will find its maximum expression in a tragic and inspired ending, which represents the pinnacle of the whole experience. At the writing level, the authors have focused in particular on the relationship between brother and sister, making it evolve in relation to the unveiling of the nature of the new Silence. Narratively it is the fulcrum of the whole story, to which all the other themes are largely sacrificed. Fortunately it works and is managed very well in terms of writing, although there is some ingenuity in the texts which in some cases dampens the atmosphere a bit. The environments in which you play are small, often contained on a single screen. The game world, however, is drawn in an excellent 3D, as demonstrated by the numerous narrative sequences. Excellent above all from a stylistic point of view, characterized as it is by a Nordic fantasy taste that gives Silence a peculiar aspect. If we mix everything, also adding an excellent soundtrack that accompanies the actions of the characters without ever overriding them, we get an exciting adventure, in which we get attachedna very much to the main characters; adventure that never gets sentimental or, worse, cloying. This ability to keep the writing on natural tones, despite the drama of what is being told, is especially noticeable in the ending, where it would have been very easy to lose one's course and drown the plot in pathetic tones. Instead, despite a phoned-in final twist, Silence's story works and hits hard. What Silence doesn't do well The script of Silence does not handle the presence of multiple characters. Some of them from a certain moment in history get lost along the way, completely leaving the orbit of Renie, Noah and the player. The authors wanted and had to play with their cards exposed, i.e. without the surprise of having to reveal what Silence is: also because we already know it from the end of The Whispered World, and some characters, Noah/Sadwick in particular, keep repeating it throughout the adventure, also clarifying the role of Renie. The best puzzles come at the end of the game; pity they are few Some characters needed to be developed better The result is that the story of the false queen who is in the inaccessible throne room is quite clear from the first sequences in which she is mentioned, while all the more ~political~ part of the plot, i.e. the presence of the rebellion that wants to stop her, it ends up being far-fetched and never deepened, with three characters who are in fact relegated to the role of background extras, when initially they seemed to be able to have more central roles. It must also be said that in some situations the haste in closing the game is distinctly perceived, probably for economic reasons. Making it must have been a considerable effort for a publisher / developer certainly not gigantic like Daedalic, and perhaps an attempt to embrace the Telltale style for the first time, with the continuation of the title that made him famous among lovers of graphic adventures, it has created more than a few problems and slowdowns. These uncertainties are also evident in the game system, which on the one hand offers very easy and guided puzzles, complete with mini-games, and on the other tries to conceal a certain complexity by distributing the solutions over several scenarios. From this point of view, the best sequence is found in the middle of the third chapter and asks to cross the actions of Noah and Renie several times. Too bad it's an isolated moment that will never happen again, since it leads directly to the conclusion. The latter highlights another problem of Silence: the futility of the choices that are made during the adventure. While playing, from time to time we will be asked to choose between two possible actions. For example, in one juncture we will be able to scold Renie for grabbing a dangerous object, or we will be able to defend her. Situations like this happen several times and, in the player's head, they should lead to such variations in the plot as to influence the ending. Unfortunately this is not the case. Silence has two different endings, accessible regardless of the choices made. Simply in the last sequence we are asked to select one, with the possibility, after the end credits, to reload the last save and try the other one too. Someone will appreciate, but in fact a similar simplification sterilizes every possible sense in having introduced a system of choices, which is an end in itself. Too bad, because it ends up weakening a narrative construction which, as already underlined in the previous paragraph, is excellent and inspired in many ways.", "date": "2017-01-03", "grade": "7.5"}
