{"name": "The Turing Test", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173042-the-turing-test-anima-di-silicio.html", "text": "The famous test created by Alan Turing is an evaluation criterion, an evolution of the imitation game which aims to determine if a machine is able to think independently. In continuous evolution, the Turing test is, of course, the fulcrum of the Bulkhead title which takes its name to lead us in the middle of a satellite of Jupiter, among the ice of Europa, inside a installation sabotaged by the same crew in charge of managing it. Before disappearing, once loyal employees of the International Space Agency created a series of puzzles that according to Tom, the artificial intelligence that guides us, reveals to us, can only be solved by a human being. We are that human being, the engineer Ava Turing, drawn into an adventure inspired by the great science fiction dedicated to artificial intelligence and does not try to hide its debt to masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The subtext focuses on the line that divides man from machine that initially takes shape through the dissertations of artificial intelligence on the debate between man-made machines and self-sufficient machines. But the discourse is destined to evolve room after room, discovery after discovery in a continuum of considerations on the Turing test and on the presumed limits of machines, intrinsic and imposed by man. In all of this, the missing crew has every appearance of wanting to hide from the artificial intelligence we carry with us, but why should we doubt a tool created specifically to help human beings? The puzzles of The Turing Test lead us to explore the border between man and sentient machine The human factor Switches, energy sources and generators represent the core of the gameplay of The Turing Test, a first-person action puzzle child, like countless other titles of this genre, of the unforgettable Portal. Some switches can be activated by both generators and energy sources, but the latter can be retrieved from a distance, thanks to a gun capable of forfeiting three different energy cores. The latter is a factor to keep in mind when meeting the first articulated tests, when the gameplay takes shape by combining with time switches, robots, cable networks, cameras, pressure platforms, unstable energy sources, plasma flows in mid-air, elevators, self-propelled magnets and increasingly complex rooms that guarantee a fair variety of situations. The potential is immediately evident and the satisfactions are not lacking but the degree of challenge is lacking for most of the game. Sometimes a pinch of action is needed but reflexes are rarely tested while some components of the puzzles are repeated several times and even the most complex puzzles become a piece of cake once you understand the key. The aim of the developers is to avoid frustration while still rewarding the player's intuition, but enthusiasm fades when the solution to a room is immediately apparent and getting to the end is just a matter of mere labour. Furthermore, every time the gameplay is enriched with a new element we are faced with too many rooms placed as a filler, too simple training sections to deal with that end up occupying a good chunk of the experience. Because of these naiveties, the overall challenge level wobbles and at the same time several good ideas are wasted that could have given life to decidedly more complex puzzles. Fortunately, as we have already said, the mechanics are constantly evolving, avoiding boredom while the potential of the gameplay grows up to the final bars even if it is rarely exploited in a continuous ups and downs that often leaves us displaced, and not in a good way. Overall, however, the experience holds up and the partial disappointment dictated by the excessive banality of some rooms is bearable, unless you are looking for the ultimate challenge. Some puzzles are quite inspired and in the final phase reflections and gray matter grow in importance while at the same time the fluidity of the experience benefits a narrative dimension that is anything but trivial, at least in relation to the genre. Cogito ergo sum The first twist is telephoned, at least partially, but hides intriguing facets that explore implications and shadows of the confrontation between man and machine, guiding us towards a hyperbolic and concise but intense ending that does not waste, on the wave of a real twist and of a dramatic choice, a well-orchestrated narrative dimension, perhaps not unforgettable but which involves us thanks to the effective combination of disquiet, butmelancholy and suggestion. The texts are of excellent workmanship and encourage us to delve into the depths of the station, from revelation to revelation, while a third protagonist appears on the scene, further complicating things. Furthermore, unlike what happens in other similar games, the puzzle dimension opens up to short but well-finished exploration sessions that lead us to discover clues, information and details about the missing crew members. Obviously, both The Turing Test does not force us to listen to audio recordings or examine every single object of the scenario and allows us to go straight thinking only about the puzzles, but neglecting the narrative dimension might not be a good idea. The fluctuating quality of the gameplay, in fact, risks compromising the magic that often remains standing thanks to a plot that survives even without secondary information but draws strength from the background of the missing crew, becoming more and more intense as the final approaches . To get there we faced seventy levels, accessible at will from the main menu once passed, which kept us busy for about ten hours during which we explored every nook and cranny, listened to all the audio recordings and tackled some extra tests that allowed us to reach special clues. In doing so we were rarely distracted by the cosmetics of a title that does not shine with polygonal mass and relies on a rather anonymous style, similar to that of a thousand other science fiction titles. Yet from a technical point of view The Turing Test gets by and does so thanks to decent textures, accommodation full of details, reflections in real time, very simple but all in all acceptable lights and surfaces. On the other hand, the bugs are not acceptable, one of which allowed us to pass a room without having to face any puzzle. The disappointment was bitter but we withstood the blow thanks to the strength of the atmosphere of a title that features excellent dubbing, unfortunately limited to English only like the subtitles, made up of convincing voices that give substance to an otherwise anonymous heroine and give shape to the artificial intelligence that accompanies us, as calm as it is disturbing. Obviously all wrapped up in the soundtrack that effectively evokes the atmosphere of seventies science fiction to suddenly soar with short rock parentheses that underline twists and revelations.", "date": "2016-08-25", "grade": "7.5"}
