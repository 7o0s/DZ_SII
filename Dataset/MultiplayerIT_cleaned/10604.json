Compared to the last meeting, however, let's change the decade and take a step back to 1989, when the then Lucasfilm Games published Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, a graphic adventure based on the film of the same name. What happened so dramatic in the film that you want to make a game out of it? It's simple: the Nazis have kidnapped Jones' father, hoping to obtain valuable information on the location of the Grail. Poor fools, they hadn't studied Leonardo da Vinci's canvas carefully. In fact, not even Indy knew anything about it at the time, and he immediately sets out to find his father, unaware of everything. With this adventure, we move far away from contemporary video games; languages therefore change, but above all the interfaces and interaction models. Here, for example, we can experience SCUUM in one of its first applications. In fact, it was developed in 1987, during the making of Maniac Mansion, another successful adventure by Lucasfim Games. This shouldn't put anyone off, but a different approach is needed, because the mentality of the player was different. Let's see how. Take care of yourself, Jones Indiana Jones does not hold back when it comes to fighting and, consequently, even the playful version of the hero abounds in fights. The combat system is limited by technical means and it happens to rail against the numeric keypad, used to move, strike and parry during fist fights. Some comparisons are avoidable, but only with Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis will this system be thoroughly refined. Having said that, the obstacle of puzzles remains. Let's start with the good news: many can be resolved in different ways, and some even change from game to game. We doubt you'll play the adventure twice or three times, but it's surprising to taste so much freedom in such an old title. Instead, the rust was formed on the mental associations required: the objects in the inventory are indicated only verbatim, and you will have to think about the meaning, rather than its representation. Also, some elements of the background appear as ~blobs~ of pixels, compared to the three-dimensional models we are used to. It's not a criticism: it goes without saying that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade achieved class results for that year. But we must consider that it can become very frustrating, without a little training, to stay looking at the screen when nothing and no one offers the player a clue. If these words don't frighten or horrify you, then the most is done; you can play with satisfaction an adventure full of irony and enjoyable until the end. It is an experience to be had, even just once, because it represents a piece of an important legacy, which helps to understand and appreciate today's titles. Titles that would not exist without a pioneering and at times heroic past, made up of people, ideas and the courage necessary to implement them. LucasArts has decided to make its past glories available on Steam, giving everyone the opportunity to play again, or for the first time, several video games that have made history. Multiplayer.it has chosen the best for you, and now closes the series of reviews with Indiana Jones and the last crusade.", "date": "2009-07-27", "grade": "9.0"}
