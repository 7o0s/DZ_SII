Animator Dean Dodrill's career began after his Dream win. builds. Play of 2009, a project based on characters designed by himself and inspired by the classic action platform RPGs of the nineties, so as to be cataloged in the ~Metroidvania~ genre. After three years Dust: An Elysian Tail is finally downloadable under the Microsoft effigy, triumphantly concluding the cycle of Summer Of Arcade titles. What we are about to review is therefore a product conceived and created by two hands, but with a quality comparable to that of millionaire teams. Possible? My name is Dust The story tells a classic plot of sin and redemption by putting us in the shoes of the fox Dust, an amnesiac warrior in search of his past through the lands of Falana, aided by the trusty talking sword Ahrah, a mysterious entity who seems to know him very well. Soon the duo is joined by the funny Fidget, a being halfway between a bat and a squirrel who becomes our faithful companion throughout the adventure. Her role is far from marginal, the young lady is able to issue elemental bullets that are not very incisive by themselves, but lethal in combination with a special Dust move that can be activated by holding down the B key. In this way we kick off a mortal tornado created by the sword, capable of exponentially amplifying the number of bullets, with devastating results on the screen. Continuing the adventure, Fidget is capable of acquiring different types of attack, selectable at will and fundamental not only in an offensive perspective, but also for solving environmental puzzles. Dust: An Elysian Tail is therefore basically a not particularly technical hack 'n slash, but very spectacular, enjoyable and equipped with a progression system capable of not disfiguring in the face of the cornerstone of the genre, Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night, in addition to integrate very welcome free roaming elements. A world to explore From the Konami masterpiece, Dust: An Elysian Tail also draws on other ideas such as backtracking, functional for the discovery of secrets and treasures and the acquisition of new abilities, such as double jump and sliding, capable of taking the character to previously inaccessible places . The game features a dozen freely explorable maps (once unlocked) through a series of interconnected portals, which allow both saving the game and free movement between areas, at the price, however, of an initially rather expensive gem, a intelligent that forces you to move with a certain caution and guarantees the fluidity of the adventure for most of its duration. The amount of extra content included in the product is particularly surprising: a ten-hour campaign is joined by various additional missions that can be unlocked only after talking to the villagers (often through interactive dialogues), special scoring tests and a breathtaking amount of secrets capable of doubling the duration of the game. The presence of RPG elements is appreciable, from the leveling of the character to the buying and selling of the various items, up to the possibility of building armor by oneself. Exhilarating the ability to unleash several Indie and Live Arcade icons, including The Maw, Super Meat Boy, Fez, Bastion, The Dishwasher and many more, often with tasty visual references to the titles they belong to. The story manages to excite thanks to the details on Dust's past that are gradually revealed, animated sequences and a final climax that will certainly delight fans of Japanese RPGs. Fidget especially is able to steal the show thanks to his peppery temper, once the adventure is over you will miss him. Xbox 360 goals Dust: An Elysian Tail features 30 achievements for a total of 400 player points, which is the new standard set by Microsoft. By finishing the basic adventure, only half are obtained, for the others it is necessary to complete all the numerous additional quests, discover secrets and perform certain actions. Animated dreams One of the most impressive aspects of Dust: An Elysian Tail is its excellent graphic realization, especially considering that it is the brainchild of a single person, the result is one of the closest things to a cartoon ever seen. The title has a two-dimensional look, with gigantic sprites drawn entirely by hand and beautifully animated. Dust moves through scenarios equipped with various levels of parallax, zoom and effects of all kinds. The settings range from lush forests, caverns and ghostly mansions, culminating in a simply memorable snowy landscape. Everything flows smoothly in the gloria of sixty frames per second. The orchestral music is functional but well done, while the numerous dialogues recorded for the characters are to be commended, unfortunately in English but subtitled in Italian. Numerous quotations and pungent irony, from Samurai Warrior Usagi Yojimbo to Turrican, Astal, Strider and Metroid, Dean Dodrill's anthropomorphic animals represent a feast for all nostalgics, almost a summa of the genre, outlining the nature of a product created with unusual passion, even if not perfect. The boss fights feel strangely bland, certain passages like the final area are forced and chaotic, and the combat system leans too much on Dust's special move and parrying, even if they are never flaws that can tarnish the beauty blinding of this title. Online support is limited to player rankings, which are also present in special events scattered across the game map.", "date": "2012-09-06", "grade": "9.0"}
