Guerrilla with Killzone has always managed to amaze from the point of view of graphic impact - even cleverly through some technical subterfuge - and at the same time to create a fascinating world, with two constantly fighting factions and many important characters to decide its fate. This world is not always told in the best way, but there is no doubt that the Killzone saga has managed to create a certain personality both in terms of narrative and actual gameplay, physical as few shooters manage to be on consoles. The story of Shadow Fall sees the planet Vekta divided into two parts and home to New Helghan, a colony granted to Helghast refugees after the terricide carried out by the ISA on their home planet. It is easy to imagine how within this coexistence both sides harbor resentment, with the Helghast wanting to invade Vekta, and the Vektan having badly digested the concession of such a large living space. Judge of these events is Lucas Kellan, who lived in New Helghan as a child and at the age of thirteen began his training as a Shadow Marshall within the VSA, the Vektan special forces. Predictably, it won't be all black and white: the main protagonist will find himself involved in difficult decisions that will lead him to ~visit~ both colonies, space and even the ruined planet Helghan, for a far from obvious ending. We've tried the most anticipated exclusive launch title for PlayStation 4, here's our verdict! Playstation 4 trophies Killzone: Shadow Fall offers 33 trophies, of which six are gold and eight are silver. Completing the campaign once only gets you 20%, a good part, almost half, is related to unlocked challenges and points earned in multiplayer, another to completing specific actions during the single player campaign like killing four enemies in simultaneously with a grenade, finding all collectibles and more along the same lines. A millennial clash The possibility offered by such a large clash has allowed the developers to indulge themselves somewhat in terms of visual impact and creation of the maps: compared to the previous chapters, there is a wider extension of the same, with multiple objectives that can be tackled in the preferred order in larger spaces, probably thanks to the transition to PlayStation 4. In the forest that has been seen several times in the game's movies, for example, the aim is to infiltrate New Helghan to destroy the huge statue dedicated to Scolar Visari: this chapter can be tackled in the most disparate ways, reaching structures placed at points far from each other until the final firefight before extraction. In other situations, this majesty of the scenario is more piloted, but in general Shadow Fall manages to reproduce the grandeur of the clash between the two factions in a more credible way. The gameplay of Shadow Fall basically resembles that of the previous Killzones: like the third chapter, the character's movements have been made ~lighter~, but when you shoot the physicality of the clashes is clearly noticeable. Depending on the type of weapon, in fact, it is difficult to aim for a prolonged time and there is no type of aim assist, so you have to be good enough with the DualShock 4 unless you play at the lowest difficulty levels. We spend a few words on the new Sony joypad, which finally has digital sticks and rear triggers worthy of the name: the precision when moving and shooting is certainly superior to the DualShock 3 and finally the latter can be used without hesitation for zoom and shoot it. Note of ~color~, the audio recordings that are collected during the adventure can be listened to directly with the speaker placed on the pad. With a view to making the action even more airy and varied than in the past, Guerrilla Games has decided to take advantage of the touchpad thanks to the introduction of a flying drone that accompanies the main protagonist - codenamed Owl - whose four abilities can be selected using the ~slide~ towards the four sides and activated by pressing L1. Owl can attack in the indicated direction, generate a magnetic pulse that stuns enemies, create a defensive shield and finally use the grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible positions. The initial use of the touchpad is quite cumbersome but we must say that over time we have managed to get a good compbroken in terms of speed even in the most agitated actions; in general, the presence of Owl offers more offensive and defensive solutions and helps to create variety by going beyond the classic canons of the genre. On the other hand, it is not always balanced and we have rarely found ourselves using the shield and the grappling hook, except in the chapters where the developers explicitly ~suggest~ it. Obviously Owl's skills are most appreciated at the highest difficulty level among the three available, in this case going to Garibaldi means certain death. In fact, although the enemies are not hyper-reactive if they are ~caught~ face to face, in full tradition of the saga they move constantly to get around their position, they do not disdain the use of grenades and those equipped with a shield are invincible unless do not use pulse grenades or Owl's specific ability. At the medium difficulty level, the game becomes more permissive in this sense, but in the same way, however, in the event of assaults or large firefights, it is necessary to use a minimum of brain matter so as not to have to start the section all over again. On the digital cross of the DualShock 4 we have four additional abilities, namely the ability to view the position to reach, release a magnetic field to locate enemies even through walls (its prolonged use alerts them, however), activate the secondary fire mode for the selected weapon and finally adrenaline, which allows you to slow down time or revive yourself when dying: be careful though, it is not possible to carry more than two weapons and bags of adrenaline. The multiplayer As always happens in these cases we were unable to extensively test the multiplayer of Killzone: Shadow Fall in its final form and we will return to it later. During the course of the numerous sessions in recent months and thanks to the possibility of being able to play offline with the bots (up to a maximum of eleven) we can at least give you a preliminary opinion. There are ample customization options including friendly fire, there are ten maps available and they resume single player sessions, their extension is quite good and also graphically they hold up well especially with regard to external views. The classes available are Reconnaissance, Assault and Support, each of which has specific skills associated with the digital cross of the pad such as fast running, concealment, ability to identify opponents within a certain range, supplies, shield and more. The modes featured range from team deathmatch to classic conquer and defend and search and destroy. There are other derivatives such as beacon recovery, beacon theft, conquer and advance, conquer and connect, which are self-explanatory. As always, there is the possibility of linking these modes within the same game, and therefore you have to constantly change the type of game and position to cover in order to get the better of the opposing teams. We repeat that it is still too early to give a definitive judgment without having tried it at full capacity, but the impressions are that it could be similar to that of the third chapter, with not too frenetic action and a good chance of learning to play even if you are not a peak with first-person shooters, provided of course that you coordinate well with your team. It's not all black or white All this good things guarantees sections within which enemies are faced en masse, others for defense, others still hit and run with a minimum of stealth; on the other hand, however, the quality is not always high and there is a certain fraying between the chapters together with the forcing of other elements: the narrative background is always clear but a few more interlude sequences would have done better as glue, some missions also tend towards boring and serve as a filler (like the one where you have to escort a space container, inside which you float in the air and constantly shoot waves of enemy ships) to the more fun and interesting ones from a gameplay point of view. A component that, on the other hand, always remains at the top for the entire duration of the adventure is the technical sector: during the previous tests we weren't so impressed, but after seeing the final result with all the effects activated and optimizations of any kind, we can say that Killzone: Shadow Fall is clearly a title that would be impossible to run on the current PlayStation 3. This is due to a multitude of factors, starting from a native 1080p resolution and a frame rate anchored to thirty frames per second, which always seem stable thanks to a motion blur used to perfection. The impact is sumptuous,the line is soft and clean, the glance often surprises and the visual depth is both detailed and boundless, Killzone: Shadow Fall is really massive from this point of view. Guerrilla then had fun managing the lights and made use of different sources in real time with the most disparate colors, which in the darkest sections, such as the New Helghan prison, seem to come from Blade Runner, in others, such as the bright Vekta , the sun shines through grates, buildings and plants, with vivid but ~dull~ colors at the same time. The style compared to the previous Killzones is therefore less uniform, always sci-fi and gloomy in the Helghast part, cleaner and closer to a Star Trek as regards the rest. Decadent Helghan is simply stunning, with all the crumbling buildings in the distance, the sky wrapped in clouds twisting between them and a constant sense of desolation. New Helghan proposes reddish colors and is full expression of the state in which the Helghast find themselves, in a continuous struggle against death. Lastly, the space boasts a great use of lighting and a detail that is lost in sight. Even on the battlefield the situation is quite rosy, between flying objects, volumetric smoke in abundance, light sources that reflect on puddles, blood and various elements of the scenario. In short, if you haven't understood it, we liked Killzone: Shadow Fall a lot both from a purely technical point of view - where Guerrila was good at masking the low interaction with the environment and some collateral flaws - and from the point of stylistic view. The game is dubbed completely in Italian with discrete results but without memorable peaks, the sound does its job well even if the audio mixing with speech is not always perfect. On the other hand, the sound effects during shootings and explosions are excellent: if you have a good stereo system, perhaps one that supports multi-channel audio, involvement is guaranteed. We completed Killzone: Shadow Fall in about nine hours and thirty minutes across the ten chapters present. The ending satisfied us, it is not obvious and as expected it closes only a small part of the events between Vektan and Helghast, leaving the rest for future chapters. Among the available options, it is possible to choose zoom and decrease by holding down the appropriate button or activating/deactivating them, remove any information on the screen and change the type of control between the new one we have mentioned and the old system with the upper backbones for shooting . Dulcis in fundo, the collectibles to collect range from newspapers that delve into the history of Vekta, through audio recordings, dossiers and comics, for a hard disk space of 41 GB.", "date": "2013-11-13", "grade": "8.7"}
