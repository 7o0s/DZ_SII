The first thought of some old gamer could automatically go to Deep Fear, a good game released on Saturn by SEGA more than a decade ago now, given that there are not many adventures (with survival elements) set in the sea that make water the main element through which the entire structure of the gameplay rotates. The graphics engine created by the British Dark Energy Digital, developed in three years, is the first to deal with fluids in a dynamic way, modeling them without scripts and interfacing them with the graphics engine and the Havok physics engine. Save the world, kill yourself The first adventure created by the English team after numerous minor experiences on PC and consoles of previous generations is a sort of survival-action set on a large cruise ship in the near future in which international terrorism is a constant threat. The background against which the events take place, bizarre in itself, is new enough to attract most of our attention and curiosity by itself. Also because on the ship, called Queen of the World, there are numerous events and damages that lead it in a short time to take on water on board, being prey to fire, flames and explosions that will keep us busy enough. Hydrophobia, the title of the adventure of the protagonist Kate Wilson, was not in fact chosen by chance. Kate is an engineer who is on board the ship at the very moment of the terrorist attack by the Malthusians, a formation that shouts ~Save the world, kill yourself~, preaches the excessive overpopulation of the Earth and the condemnation of NanoCell. Fundamental resources for the survival of mankind are scarce. The most powerful men on Earth then decide to build the huge Queen of the World ship, where the NanoCell group is tasked with researching new water purification systems. After almost ten years the population is divided between the Cornucopiani, who still place hope in scientific research and the Malthusian extremists, convinced that only the elimination of a part of humanity can help save mankind. On the tenth anniversary of the ship's inauguration, they detonate a device that will soon condemn her to sinking, taking on more and more water during Kate's adventure. The story, well narrated and full of details and a decidedly detailed background, however, is not supported by a varied and heterogeneous gameplay: the game grows and develops in a decidedly unfair way, remaining anchored to its most important gameplay element, survival in the water and under water, practically never evolving. Only a few elements will change during the 5/6 hours of this first chapter (yes, it's a serialized game): from action it sometimes turns into a sort of survival-horror, as Kate is affected, precisely, by a phobia since the age of 13, when he saw his sister drown. And the evolution of paraphernalia that will go from stun bullets to rare trigger bombs. No hand-to-hand combat, unfortunately, occasionally creates some problems in the most complicated passages full of enemies to defeat. Even the lack of a clear and readable hud on the screen does not make us realize exactly how much air we have available underwater, or the vital energy left before dying, often creating some embarrassment. Xbox 360 goals Like any Live Arcade title, Hydrophobia also makes the canonical 200 points available to the player, to be unlocked through 12 objectives. By completing this first part of the adventure you will get practically all the loot with ease, as the objectives are linked to killing enemies and conquering collectibles. To be continued... The developers, while keeping the game firmly on aquatic tracks, have also tried to give Hydrophobia a minimum of variety: there are vaguely platform sections, some fairly simple puzzles, locations to be decrypted manually and elements to find and collect throughout the adventure . The protagonist of the game is also equipped with a technological viewer called M.A.V.I. (in perfect Batman Arkam Asylum style) which allows her to find hidden elements, look for the way, activate remote doors and mechanisms and so on. All decidedly secondary elements, however, which do not contribute to making the gaming experience decisively varied, relegating the heart of the gameplay to a mix of action and survival already seen and revised in many games. However, the graphic sector is pleasant, although it does not make people cry out for a miracle and is perfect for a digital delivery title. The dynamics of polygon fluidsnals, for many, could be worth the price of admission alone. It is in fact a middleware that interfaces with the graphics and physics engine and that could be inserted in any title, and we are sure that many will do it given its extreme goodness. The water moves, moves, rises carrying away objects otherwise stationary on the ground, it creates waves and ripples with a disarming naturalness and an absolutely new and convincing visual effect. The rest of the game is fairly monotonous though - the setting is gloomy and claustrophobic, perfect for the purpose, but varies from flooded corridors to uninspired control rooms. The character design is a bit anonymous, and while she appreciates the fact of controlling a sexy young heroine (is she?) Kate doesn't have the right qualities to remain etched in the collective gaming memory for a long time. Some uncertainty also in the controls and in the camera, often a little too dancers and jerky, will make us die a few too many times against our will. Fortunately, however, the game saves constantly and therefore it is not a frustrating problem. Rather embarrassing, however, the fact that in the end there is no real ending, but ends with a ~to be continued~: by not reading between the small lines, someone may perhaps escape that it is only a chapter of the trilogy, and not of the full game (which, apparently, will also be released packaged in stores one day). Hydrophobia, if it weren't for the extremely convincing and innovative use of water, would be a fairly mediocre title and would perhaps go unnoticed by the general public.", "date": "2010-10-12", "grade": "6.8"}
