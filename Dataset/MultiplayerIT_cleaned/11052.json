{"name": "Naruto: Ninja Council 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ninja-council-2-recensione.html", "text": "We like to think that by now everyone knows Naruto, considering the pounding commercials on television and the endless animated series now regularly proposed on Italian schedules. But in case you've been living in Antarctica for the last three years, it's worth explaining that Naruto is the protagonist of a Japanese comic drawn by Masashi Kishimoto, which enjoys stratospheric success in Japan and is one of the most widely read children's comics ever. It is essentially an action manga, where numerous characters, generally well characterized, give each other a thrashing based on the canonical challenge between good and evil: a rather traditional concept with a very original starting point, given that the protagonists are all ninjas. In recent years there have been so many video games inspired by the series that it has become difficult to count them, much easier to forget them given the generally embarrassing quality, with rare exceptions. Here, this Naruto: Ninja Council 2 is not one of those exceptions ... Ultimate Ninja Storm & The Broken Bond: that way -> Certainly one could not expect a product as technically valid as the two titles that will be released this month for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, considering the difference between the consoles. But the Nintendo DS has given us the splendid graphics of the two fighting games inspired by Bleach (another popular Japanese comic series) and therefore there was no reason for Tomy to propose such an old and approximate technical realization. Pass the animations of the various characters, very accurate, and the reproduction of the most famous fighting techniques of the series - the so-called Jutsu - whose activation triggers extremely spectacular small cutscenes, but the rest is really mediocre. The detail of the settings, to name one, is really poor: sometimes monochromatic backgrounds and graphic elements that repeat themselves in an attempt to form simply repetitive stages such as mountains and caves. The level-design is also really bad, extremely trivial and based on simple horizontal or vertical passages with sometimes mobile platforms on which to jump with a minimum of synchronization, thrown upside down by the slow and imprecise control system. The internships in view of the fights between the protagonists could be tolerated if the music were at least catchy, instead the proposed melodies are obvious and repetitive, as much as the generic enemies who will attack us repeatedly, only sometimes varying in the color palette. Ah, isn't it a platformer? With the amount of platforms to jump on and the level-design focused on passing stages so composed, one might get the impression that Naruto: Ninja Council 2 is simply a platformer, in reality the heart of the game is the clash with enemies , especially with the various main characters of the series, who enjoy their own animations and related sets of Jutsu. The problem is, the whole combat system is awful. Despite the availability of special attacks, which are also very spectacular, we tend to take advantage of simple kicks and punches to make our way through the enemies, given their immediacy and the ease with which the opponents are exterminated. The idea of the game is to accept missions, secondary and main, which make up the story - which is badly told - in turn based on a narrative arc of the manga: these missions will sometimes make us collide with characters who, moreover, can add to the list of those selectable in the other game modes. But the gist of the speech does not change: not only are the reaction times to inputs slow, but also the control system leaves something to be desired, and this goes for all the characters, who turn out to be clones of each other, only diversified in the Jutsu department. These are probably the only intriguing aspect of the game, since to be accomplished they sometimes require particular activities such as blowing into the microphone to allow Sasuke Uchiha to use his sigh of fire or tapping the touch-screen to press the chakra points of the victim during one of Neji Hyuga's Jutsu. But given the lack of propensity to use them, they really can't save the fate of repetitive, short-lived and tendentially boring gameplay. Comment Naruto: Ninja Council 2 is yet another failed opportunity for Naruto to shine on the Nintendo DS. The previous episode already showed numerous flaws, and this sequel has not only re-proposed them, but in certain moments even exacerbated them. Technically speaking, we are talking about a mediocre product in which only the animations of the protagonists and their secret shots prove to be more than pleasant, while everything else is simply poorly cared for, from the music to the level-design, passing through the control systemthe fake to the trivial and boring game modes. A hole in the water, only lovers of Kishimoto's manga will be able to appreciate its fan-service. Pros Good animations of sprites and special techniques Details faithful to the original work Cons Technically mediocre Poor control and combat system Boring levels and uninteresting game modes", "date": "2008-11-17", "grade": null}
