These are heavy names, capable of laying foundations that are impossible to ignore for everything that came after, and so iconic that they are easily recognizable even for those who have no knowledge of this field. On the other hand, even a total gaming novice must have at least once heard of Street Fighter somewhere, especially if we consider that the Capcom saga is still active and highly played all over the world. And yet, when we move from 2D to three-dimensional fighting games, the same thing cannot be said for an equally significant series, which even disappeared as far back as 2010... We are obviously talking about Virtua Fighter, about whose fate rumors have been circulating for years like, now fleshed out as a revival of the acclaimed Virtua Fighter 5. In fact, SEGA has not yet dared to try an official sequel, but convinced (rightly) of the goodness of the fifth episode, it has decided to put it back on sale in a version with renewed graphics called Ultimate Showdown. Only that here it is not a question of reproposing all the contents of the Final Showdown dating back to 11 years ago, but a game designed almost exclusively for online competition, temporarily offered on Playstation Plus and with any other extra reduced to the bone. Was it a brilliant move, or is it a step forward taken too timidly and too late? Let's find out in our review of Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown. The importance of fundamentals Let's start with the basics: Virtua Fighter 5 is an exceptional fighting game and not just for the name it bears. Among those in 3D it is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most technical and difficult to master titles, but at the same time also among the most satisfying ones if you dedicate the time necessary to learn the mechanics properly. Featuring an incredibly diverse roster, which makes use of martial arts largely based on real-life counterparts, SEGA's work forces you to adapt to different styles to emerge victorious from matches, to perfectly manage positioning and movement - rounds can come losing to being thrown out of the ring and being walled in some arenas means taking devastating combinations - and carefully selecting your fighters due to their peculiarities (some are extremely unsuitable for beginners and require near-perfect execution). Virtua Fighter 5: Akira Yuki is always a beast in the right hands All this has not predictably changed in this version, and a game of Virtua Fighter 5 remains a pleasure at every level, both at the higher ones where the challenges are a riot of perfect lateral dodges and readings of the opposing tactics, and at the lower ones where there often just repeating the fastest (and safest) middle and low shots in the hope that they will land. Only that there is practically nothing here for those who want to fight against artificial intelligence. In Ultimate Showdown, in fact, you will only have the tutorial, the training mode - if nothing else very complete, complete with frame data for the moves and several useful options - and a boneless arcade mode suitable only for getting some practice before jumping onto the net. SEGA has, in a nutshell, focused 100% on online, with an elaborate lobby system that allows you to face other players in multiple ways, and the inevitable ranked matches (whose matchmaking is conveniently managed during training) .To enrich the package, in short, there are only the customizations (moreover to be purchased separately if you get the title thanks to Playstation Plus): a good list of options that allow you to make your online alter ego quite unique, but add little other. A punch straight into the netcode The problem of SEGA's diabolical plan therefore lies only in one element. The netcode. In practice, the factor that regulates the effective online stability of a fighting game, which unfortunately has not been modernized by embracing that rollback which today is acclaimed by a large part of the ~fighting~ community. The netcode of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown is therefore still delay based, and if on the one hand this is understandable for a team that hasn't produced fighting games for a lifetime, on the other hand re-face a similar product after getting used to Mortal Kombat 11 or Guilty Gear -Strive- can be traumatic, especially in Europe. Virtua Fighter 5: Never underestimate a sumo wrestler With exceptional connections, after all, the delay can still offer valid matches without too much command latency, but the same cannot be said when your lineea isn't blazing fast, and the new version of Virtua Fighter doesn't even seem to be among the best games in this unfortunate subset. Said as delicately as possible: at least 50% of your games will be plagued by a slow response of the commands, if not by unjustified clicks or real disconnections and completely forget that you can play worthy with someone who is overseas. How can you well understand, a similar situation cuts off the legs from the start of a title that makes the online experience its fulcrum and the complexity of the Virtua Fighter 5 combat system - with all its subtleties and sudden reactions to enemy attacks - does not which further amplify this flaw. A real pity, because such a ~noble~ game deserved a little more effort in this aspect, and the shortcomings of the netcode risk limiting its diffusion and popularity in a few months, despite the initial push of the Plus. Virtua Fighter 5: Sarah Bryant Appreciable, if nothing else, SEGA's desire not to offer a lazy remaster, but at least a version based on the Dragon Engine (that of the last Yakuza, to understand), more modern and pleasant to see. For heaven's sake, this is not an exceptional work capable of placing Ultimate Showdown on a par with other modern fighting games, but they have not noticed problems with fluidity, many characters remain iconic and various arenas still make their dirty impression.", "date": "2021-06-05", "grade": "7.5"}
