Generations is very simple: completely abolish the control system and thus make the products of the series usable by anyone through careful exploitation of the Nintendo DS touch screen. This has translated into a series of wide-ranging titles, including puzzles (Tetris DS, Sudoku Master), experimental games (Electroplankton), graphic adventures (Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) and even educational software (Brain Training). Just in the wake of this last category, English Training now arrives, or rather the English course at your fingertips I don't speak inglisc As explained by the game introduction itself, English Training is based on the belief - apparently supported by scientific studies - that dictation represents the most effective way to learn a language, especially with regard to handwriting and word pronunciation. For this reason, substantially every aspect of the title is based on the mechanisms of listening and subsequent writing, albeit with some slight variations. The title shares more than a couple of aspects with Brain Training, as well as a substantially identical visual sector: in particular, the approach to the software is the same, and therefore requires a daily (or at least constant) commitment from the player in sessions of rather short, roughly between ten minutes and half an hour. Unlike Brain Training, however, there are no real limits to the will of the user, who technically could also try all the learning stages in a single session: it is therefore up to everyone to decide how much time to dedicate to their language training . English Training opens with a test - again based on the dictation - useful for establishing the quality of the user's English, which is finally given an evaluation: afterwards the test remains available in the main menu, so that it can be selected for keep track of your progress. Once this is done, you move on to the training phase, the real heart of the product: English Training offers no less than six learning levels (each divided into three steps) with increasing difficulty, as well as three stages dedicated to warming up, as many dedicated to locutions and two sections reserved for prepositions and compliments. Each block contains between fifty and eighty words, usually grouped into small semantic spheres to facilitate understanding. The procedure is very simple: the term is pronounced by a clear English voice (the audio can be listened to at will), and the user just has to write it letter by letter on the touchscreen. Then a sentence is proposed which contains the word in its correct usage, and the matter repeats itself. If everything is done correctly, a screen appears indicating the type of word (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) as well as its translation into Italian. It is still possible to ask for help by pressing the appropriate button, or move on to the next question in case of difficulty: by doing so, however, you get a school red sign ... Wonderful! As the various learning steps are completed, new sub-games are made available within the Exercises mode that can be selected from the main menu. Still centered on the mechanics of dictation, these optional stages range from small challenges especially useful for confronting other players (as in Brain Training, here too it is possible to use up to a maximum of four profiles for as many users) to various skill tests which they can reinforce the knowledge acquired in the course of training. An example in this sense is constituted by the nice Crossword mode, in which the words pronounced by the usual voice are inserted in the scheme; exercises such as Marathon, in which it is necessary to write the terms as quickly as possible to make the athlete run on the screen, or Stop the Mouse! where the same action must be performed to prevent the rodent from escaping with a piece of cheese. However, within this section there are interesting modes such as Review, essential for identifying errors and trying to remedy them, or Listening, which offers a succession of words spoken by the voice of the game and which can also be used with the Nintendo DS closed. English Training then proposes some ~surprise~ events, which appear randomly when the console is switched on: it may happen that you have to draw a picture in relation to the word that is provided, or measure yourself in the correct pronunciation of a sentence. The playful offer of the title also includes a multiplayer mode: up to a maximum of eight players can compete by choosing between Challenge Parole and Sfida Dittato, in a formula that is quite convincing considering the purely didactic nature of the product. Comment English Training is a more than appreciable attempt to make learning the English language dynamic and as fun as possible. A successful experiment, therefore, which obviously should be taken as a complement and not a substitute for classical teaching. Being able to count on a simple structure, a precise writing system and absolutely clear English voices, English Training should however be considered exclusively as a means of enriching one's English vocabulary. Mini-games, graphics and some multiplayer features complete a well-built product, but probably with a very limited catchment area. Pros Lots of exercises Impeccable writing and speech system Useful for expanding your English vocabulary Cons a little less for really learning the language Inevitably repetitive", "date": "2006-10-26", "grade": null}
