{"name": "Shadow Warrior 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-warrior-3-recensione.html", "text": "Progress and evolution are fundamental concepts for the Shadow Warrior franchise: the reboot series born in 2013 at the hands of the talented Flying Wild Hog team, which someone probably still remembers for the remarkable Hard Reset eleven years ago, has gradually taken on different connotations, reinventing the protagonist and the mechanics to find an alternative and very interesting formula with the second chapter. As you are about to read in the review of Shadow Warrior 3, however, for Lo Wang's new adventure it was decided to return to the original formula, with a linear progression which in many ways belittles gameplay and structure, substantially renouncing compared to what was done previously, while some of the more scenic aspects of the game have taken important steps forward. History Shadow Warrior 3, Lo Wang and Orochi Zilla Good old Lo Wang survived the daring finale of Shadow Warrior 2, but being defeated by a huge dragon put his self-esteem to the test and in fact we find him in his underwear, literally, feeling sorry for himself while he is holed up in a shelter which is constantly lapped by the giant flying creature. Is there a way to shoot down the monster that he himself has awakened? According to Orochi Zilla, Wang's former employer, yes: in league with the witch Motoko, the man's idea is to use the power of the Hoji mask to unleash an energy so strong as to kill the dragon. There's only one problem: something is still tied to the mask and Lo Wang wants to find out what it is. Interpreted in this case by Mike Moh, who replaces Jason Liebrecht after the first two episodes, the protagonist of Shadow Warrior 3 shows off for the first time flowing hair and clothing that confirms once and for all his closeness to Deadpool, Marvel's ~mouthy mercenary~. And Lo Wang is absolutely chatty, so much so that he never stops talking. The dialogues of the game, dubbed in English and localized in any language of the known universe except in Italian, are hilarious and in particular the exchanges with a certain character will not fail to make you laugh, however absurd and foul-mouthed they are. The plot isn't anything terribly sophisticated, but it serves its purpose and that's it. Gameplay Shadow Warrior 3, the rifle gives satisfaction from short range In terms of gameplay, as mentioned at the beginning, Shadow Warrior 3 renounces the non-linear action and the depth that this approach entailed in favor of a traditional shooter experience, which mimics DOOM Eternal without however boasting the same personality and improvisation platform sections (one of which is particularly problematic due to a broken script, in the penultimate stage) which however are not explored in depth. The Wang can slide, double jump and dash forward, as well as use the Chi to push enemies away and maybe skewer them on a wall full of spikes, a la Bulletstorm, but above all he can use his spiritual energy to score very violent finishers that give him powerful momentary tools obtained from the limbs of his opponents. The repertoire is undoubtedly complete, but the fact that it is made available to us immediately leaves little room for character upgrades, which in fact end up taking on a marginal role. Shadow Warrior 3, one of the many ~arenas~ of the campaign full of even huge enemies The matter relating to weapons is different: there are eight of them in all, therefore much less than in Shadow Warrior 2, but the idea of enhancing the single instrument finds us in agreement and in this context the upgrades perform their task discreetly. What we didn't like are the very short magazines and the failure to memorize the preferences between the two main weapons, which leads to having to open the wheel every time to make the selections again. The Dragontail sword, this time only single and never double, can be used by the protagonist in the context of a now well-tested combat system that alternates between bullets and blades, but which in the case of melee attacks is quite approximate, slippery and unable to return an adequate sensation of impact. Shadow Warrior 3, the spinning blade launcher in action on an enemy The guns (pistol, rifle, machine guns, grenade launcher, cannon, and rotating blade launcher) are much better, able to offer a great variety which, however, is often and willingly imposed: it is impossible to fossilize on the tools we prefer because of the aforementioned magazines courts, we will find ourselves constantly alternating weapons according to the dynamics of an automatic selection system which, however, tends toalways prefer the same combinations. The enemies are practically all new, operate within well-defined patterns and boast rather peculiar designs: from Japanese spirits to trolls, from masks that shoot laser beams to drill-headed monsters, from flying opponents to demons with an ~accordion~ body, from samurai to aberrations, passing through the bosses (very few, unfortunately), the bestiary of Shadow Warrior 3 is varied and after the first few levels it gives life to truly frenetic sequences, of pure run & gun, where threats multiply and whoever stops is lost. Shadow Warrior 3, Lo Wang with his inseparable sword As we said, there is also room for generally harmless platform sections, in which we will be able to use Lo Wang's double jump, sprint and grappling hook to overcome increasingly complex paths, which often and willingly ask to destroy barriers on the fly to be able to continue. In this case, the focus is solely on reflections, in a mild way, but not on puzzle solving: a missed opportunity. However, it is the great linearity of the campaign that makes one turn up one's nose, given that it was reasonable to expect an evolution of what was seen in the second chapter and instead we find ourselves faced with a weakened product, with fewer possibilities, devoid of the cooperative and characterized by a set of solutions that basically work but always seem to have already been seen. Contents Shadow Warrior 3, Lo Wang uses the grappling hook in a platforming section Flying Wild Hog had joked that it takes 500 hours to complete Shadow Warrior 3 sixty times, but in fact he exaggerated a little: the duration of the game's campaign is about seven and a half hours, where you don't die too much (but at the level of normal difficulty the challenge is not who knows how important), and the structure in this case does not include secondary missions or secrets to discover, also an evident downgrade. Beyond the Wang-Cave of the initial phase, there are eight levels that aesthetically to the Japanese feudal era and progressively push us towards more mystical atmospheres: a path that culminates with a last stage in which the dragon itself acts as a backdrop, but we don't want to reveal too much. An achievement system unlocks further orbs for upgrading the protagonist and his arsenal, but you have to remember to check it between sessions. Graphics and sound Shadow Warrior 3, one of the glimpses of a scenario In our view, on a purely aesthetic level, Shadow Warrior 3 represents a step forward compared to the previous episodes, although as regards the design of the enemies it is possible to find some solutions that are a little too generic. Certainly the characterization of Lo Wang has improved, although perhaps not in the direction of greater originality, and some glimpses of the scenarios are undoubtedly suggestive. Unfortunately, the fundamentally old-gen nature of the project pays tribute in a general lack of cleanliness of the graphics, which makes use of evidently low definition assets and textures, giving a feeling of chaos and approximation. Shadow Warrior 3, Lo Wang talks to the Hoji mask On PC we were unable to activate DLSS and Super Resolution, while supported, and to get the stable 60fps (apart from a heavy stutter that occurs at the beginning of each cutscene) we had to use the scaler to lower the 4K resolution down to '80%, while leaving all the settings at maximum. Finally, as regards the audio sector, the soundtrack frankly does not stand out that much, the effects are within the norm and the undisputed protagonists are the aforementioned dialogues, with Lo Wang he never stops talking, even though he can often do nothing but address himself.", "date": "2022-02-28", "grade": "7.0"}
