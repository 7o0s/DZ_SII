As veterans of billiards will well know, there are numerous types of game, where the assignment of points varies according to the rules of the mode used. Let's see what types of challenges you can select: Snooker: in this mode there are mostly red balls plus some colored ones. Players must first attempt to pocket a red ball, which is worth one point. When one of the participants hits a shot with a red ball, he can try to hit one of the colored balls, which have a different point value depending on their colour. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points wins. 8 ball: here there are fifteen bowls numbered from 1 to 15. One player must pocket all the balls ranging from 1 to 7 (solid), while the other the group that includes the object balls from 9 to 15 (striped). Whoever scores all the balls of the chosen series first and then the 8 wins the game. 9 ball: the competitors must pocket the bowls starting from the lowest number (they are usually numbered from 1 to 9). Another available option is the Bonus Games, created for multiplayer, where you can challenge a friend in a match with some particular variations: for example, you can enter a countdown for each round, or set a precise duration for a match and similar things. This is certainly a good way to break the monotony. However, if all the options listed so far are not enough for you, the Codemasters title includes a career mode, in which you will have the opportunity to challenge the greatest pool players, earning fame and money. The latter can be spent in a shop that offers secret options, new tables, videos and other bonuses. Good news for fans of the big network: softco has entered the online game to challenge users from all over the world! The control system is quite smooth and easy to master, and after about ten minutes you can perform many types of shots quite easily, including the more refined ones such as banks or carambola The Olympus of champions World Championship Snooker 2004 features some of the greatest professional players in existence, so you'll find the likes of David Gray, Mark Williams, Peter Ebdon, Ronnie O' Sullivan, Stephen Endry and many more familiar faces. But that's not all: in fact, thanks to the option called Classic games, you have the opportunity to relive the greatest finals in the history of billiards, where your goal is to emulate the deeds of past champions. As you may have noticed, Codemaster's product contains enough options and modes to satisfy the snooker enthusiast. This is certainly a point in favor of the product, which from this point of view can boast a certain realism. However, I have to make a note regarding the lack of translation into our language: certainly the spoken language has never been fundamental in sports, but a user who is not very expert in the discipline and who does not know English well could have difficulty understanding the rules . Start the game! Finally we get to the heart of the game, i.e. the actual game. First of all, there is a view system that can be modified with the arrow keys and the triangle button, in order to have a complete overview of the situation. When you are about to hit a ball, two lines appear on it, one white and one yellow: the first outlines the path that the white ball will follow, while the second that of the bowl to be hit. To start the shot, press the X key, and once this is done, a bar will appear on the left of the screen where you can adjust the power of your shot. However, if you want, you can further perfect your shot by giving the effect with the square button, which will make an icon of the white ball appear to select the precise point to hit. Finally, with the circle key it is possible to adjust the height of the cue. It goes without saying that factors such as power and effect will play a fundamental role in the success of a shot: in fact, it will not be enough for you to direct the yellow cursor towards a hole, but you will have to measure the strength of the shot as well as the effect in order to not seeing the white ball go happily into the hole with the target or maybe somewhere else! In any case, the control system is rather smooth and easy to master, and after about ten minutes you can perform various shots quite easily, including the more refined ones such as banks or carambola. All this happens without affecting the realism of the game, which indeed remains high thanks to a well thought-out CPU AI: I assure you that your opponents rarely make mistakesre damn! World Championship Snooker 2004 features some of the greatest professional players in existence, so you'll find the likes of David Gray, Mark Williams, Peter Ebdon, Ronnie O' Sullivan, Stephen Endry and many more familiar faces. Technically speaking.... Unfortunately the graphics sector is the less brilliant side of the Codemasters title. The polygons used by the engine are not many, and despite this the frame-rate is rather low. Furthermore, the odious aliasing is clearly visible on the edges of the table and on the cues, denoting a care for the superficial graphics. The situation improves a bit with the textures of the characters, which, despite not being a screamer, appear at least clean and quite detailed. On the other hand, the absolutely realistic physics of the balls should be commended: when they are hit they can assume any conceivable position, including stopping a millimeter from the hole! Typical pool game situations, don't you think? As far as the audio department is concerned, there are some very convincing and realistic fxes to report, while the soundtracks are almost completely absent except for an anonymous piece of music that accompanies the initial menu. Comment All in all, World Championshisp Snooker 2004 presents itself as a title suitable for satisfying the needs of billiard lovers, thanks to its realism expressed both in the game modes offered and in the actual gameplay. Too bad for the not exciting technical realization, where something more could certainly have been done, but despite this the playful experience is pleasant and engaging. In short, if you have been looking for a billiard simulator for a long time, the Codemastes product is right for you. Pros Very realistic Simple and immediate Good number of modes Cons Graphically not excellent The Italian translation is missing World Championship Snooker 2004 is the third episode of the saga that has come to the black monolith. The two previous chapters (the 2002 and 2003 versions) received good reviews from critics, thanks above all to the high degree of realism they offered. So let's see if the guys from Codemasters have done a good job this year as well or not.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
