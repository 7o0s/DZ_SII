In fact, in the long single player campaign of the game there are all the storylines that made the Knights of the Zodiac famous: from the saga of the Twelve Houses to that of Asgard, from the clash with Neptune to the one in the underworld with Hades. It goes without saying that the roster put together by Bandai Namco for the occasion has dozens and dozens of more or less famous characters, starting from the Bronze Knights to get to the Golden ones and the various deities. Of course, since the initial plot of the Galactic Clash has not been covered, the Bronze Saints who do not appear among the five protagonists (Seiya, Shiryu, Hyoga, Shun and Ikki - Pegasus, Sirius, Crystal, Andromeda and Phoenix respectively) and those of Silver, but the endowment still appears quite rich and fans of both the manga and the anime will undoubtedly be able to relive some good times. Without ravines, in this case. Gameplay and structure Saint Seiya Shining Soldiers is a strategic RPG as there are many by now, although in this case the gacha component seems less valued than usual. There are obviously the summons and you pay for them quite dearly (earning credits by playing or putting your hand in your wallet), but this aspect of the experience in the first few hours appears frankly accessory and later on, when the time inevitably comes to do some grinding , you can get away with it even without summons. The problem is another: the fights do not take place with the teams lined up, as in Saint Seiya Awakening, but with only two contenders at the center of the action and the possibility of replacing them at any time (using a shift, however) with their companions, perhaps because they are distinguished by a ~superior~ color compared to that of the opponent, a factor that has a very substantial impact on the ability to inflict damage and not suffer from it. Here, this solo approach inevitably ends up diminishing the strategic depth of the game, which therefore goes to enhance the statistics for their own sake more than our ability to direct attacks. It's a pity, because the repertoire of the various Knights faithfully reflects the moves we have seen performed in the cartoon, in all their spectacularity and with applications that extend from pure offensive maneuvers to momentary blocking of the enemy (perhaps in a slab of ice, if you use Hyoga or Camus of the Aquarius). There are also visual effects that recall the manga and short sequences taken from the anime as further confirmation of how much the work carried out by Bandai Namco was moved by passion towards the wonderful lore created by Masami Kurumada. After that there is the aspect without the most well-kept doubt of all the production, the technical sector. The graphics show off polygonal models that are sometimes a bit simple and angular, but covered with excellent cel shading and capable of showing off splendid armor, as well as featuring spectacular animations especially for the cutscenes of the special moves. Everything is accompanied by original voices and music, including the entire opening with the iconic song Pegasus Fantasy. Too bad for the strict requirements relating to the always active connection: the game connects to the internet for any small operation, slowing down navigation through the menus and generating annoying problems as soon as the signal shows signs of subsidence.", "date": "2020-03-03", "grade": "6.8"}
