{"name": "Digimon World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/digimon-world.html", "text": "Digimon or Tamagotchi? In the game, however, we will not take part in the events of the group of boys but, we will find ourselves thrown into the aforementioned fantasy world in the role of a slender child, with a much more peaceful purpose: after a period of peace, the Digital World - or more precisely, File City - has in fact lost the harmony that distinguished it and, thanks to the help of the wise Jijimon and a few faithful ones, you will have to make the city prosper again, bringing the scattered Digimon back to their usual tasks, now so out of control that they even lost the use of spoken language and making use only of brute force. As you can well guess, however, the help you will receive will not be given only through advice and for the duration of the adventure, you will have your personal digital monster at your side in the role of ~indispensable~ helper; the flame-breathing dinosaur Agumon is in fact the first being that you will find yourself raising, treating him almost as if he were a Tamagotchi. Although this last sentence seems a bit risky, you will soon understand that the key to the game lies (at least initially) in this and, for a good part of your wanderings you will have to worry, like real ~owners/breeders~, about the needs of a little monster too weak to fight with heavyweights and too young and weak to evolve to the next stage, also trying to cure him without spoiling him too much, feeding him and taking into account his needs (try to find a bathroom immediately when he asks you , or the legacy of his ~bundle~ on the street could make him ill) and finally training him in the nearby Green Gym, which includes among the main workouts a special lesson taught by your alter ego to raise the intelligence of the creature. Digi-evolution Although the real results are obtained with tests in the gym, Agumon will be able to undertake more serious fights in his wanderings, against his fellow rebels and very altered Digimon of undoubted power, but despite everything you will be able to glimpse a variant in the game system only by continuing, up to the latest ~digi-evolution~, capable of transforming an already lethal pupil into a real armored and highly armed monster of which I already spoke at the beginning of the article. Technically, leaving DA's structure aside for a moment, we can judge it as a product without infamy and without praise, with sufficient sound thanks to nice effects and fairly accurate music, mostly taking up the theme of the TV series, and with a average graphics, which not aiming to exploit the power of the 32-bit Sony machine due to the target of the product, unfortunately sometimes fall short in quality; with too little detail of the characters and computer graphics movies which, in all honesty, could have been done better. Without infamy and without praise Ultimately therefore, we are faced with a game without infamy and without praise which, despite having some easily overlooked technical problems, suffers from the bad flaw mentioned above, with a tendency to bore the player in some cases, immediately leading him to new and more interesting game situations, with the downside, however, of the ever-present risk of boring too soon any type of target, represented both by the shrewd user who tries to detoxify from the latest Final Fantasy, and by the kid who ~immediately wants cartoon monsters; cartoon that in my opinion, is light years away from the Pokemon. Recommended, especially to those who had also appreciated Tecmo's Monster Rancher. Pros: Fun For fans of the series Cons: Technically not great For fans of the series Down with Pokemon! 1 Born in America and branded almost immediately with the infamous brand of ~anti-Pokemon~ phenomenon, by now even the Italian public has known the advance of the Digimon and, after having invaded television and the market with two series of cartoons, a film animation company, as well as with a business made up of gadgets and toys, the ~renowned~ Bandai (as it has always done for years, with all the more or less famous TV series and series inside and outside Japan) has decided to transport the adventures nice little digital monsters on a revived Playstation. Contrary to the hated Pokemon, however, the cartoon followed the adventures of a group of kids fighting against evil, landed in a fantastic and semi-virtual world (the Digital World to be precise), moreover helped only by dethe little monsters, able to follow an evolutionary ladder until they become real bio-mechanical giants.", "date": "2001-04-17", "grade": null}
