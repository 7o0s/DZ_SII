Working well does not necessarily mean obtaining great recognition, and this sad rule often leads to the extinction of the creative spark or the simple desire to do many poor people who bend over backwards to be valid members of society. An extremely competitive market should smooth out this monstrosity of reality, because in a sea of products it is usually only the excellent ones that make their way. Yet even in the turbulent world of video games the law described above applies: great titles are sometimes beautifully ignored by the public, where various ~homework~ manage to achieve extraordinary success dictated by unpredictable factors even for a haruspex. It happens that today's piece concerns a software house that has had to do much more than necessary with this curse, the Gunfire Games; and if their name doesn't tell you anything, it's only because they are the current reincarnation of those Vigil Games to whom we owe the Darksiders series. In short, we are talking about a team distinguished by two evident characteristics: an impressive talent in the fusion of genres, and an ~immeasurable bad luck~ which has led its members to be tossed here and there, first due to the bankruptcy of THQ - which if it is brought along despite two high-quality productions - and then due to the closure of Crytek in Texas, where most of the original developers had taken refuge. Gunfire Games is therefore not a simple meeting place for programmers with a passion for the apocalypse, but a real free zone where the old Vigils gathered, looked into each other's eyes, and said ~let's finish this blessed series~, becoming bravely mock their cruel past. The key to reaching this conclusion is predictably called Darksiders 3. Less ambition, more precision Let's be clear, the third Darksiders is not a video game with the ambitions and funding of its predecessor. The developers ~surviving~ the Vigil massacre are veterans who have all had prestigious roles in the creation of the other chapters, but their number has significantly decreased, and the resources available are less than half of those spent in the beginning. What has remained, however, is the talent, and it has been used to closely follow the philosophy of the other two episodes, creating a chapter that is perhaps less impressive, but extremely respectful of its foundations. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, in fact, the Darksiders are children of the team's ability to mix genres and mechanics within a minestrone with a unique flavor, supported by a base that refers dryly to the three-dimensional The Legend of Zelda. Darksiders 3 therefore detaches itself from the second episode as much as this one moved away from the first, and if the epic of War was a fusion between Zelda and an action hack 'n' slash, and that of Death a mix between the great work of Nintendo , loot based RPGs, and Prince of Persia 3D, the new baby decides to further mix up the cards by combining metroidvania and souls-like, in line with the times. This is a very sensible choice, given that the story of Furia is another prequel of sorts, which takes place in the middle of the first chapter (immediately after the capture of the more ~massive~ brother, to be exact) and is limited to clarify some factors of the underlying narrative, without distorting the events of the other games. Eschewing an overly dispersed structure in favor of an interconnected map temporarily limited by metroidvania elements is a perfectly adequate choice for such a piece of the puzzle; however, the nature of the game does not mean that it lacks a fairly interesting underlying plot: Furia is perhaps the most ~human~ of the knights, and the whole adventure is a sort of ~character arc~ that sees her overcome a initial tendency to megalomania and unwarranted anger. It is certainly not an extraordinary campaign from a narrative point of view, we would like to clarify it, yet it is pleasant to observe the development of an imperfect protagonist to the point of being hateful during the first lines, and to try to understand every secret regarding the complex background on upon which the title rests. The witch It's not just the characterization of the protagonist that is tantalizing, however. In fact, the game director explained to us that he had conceptualized each individual knight within ~roles~ similar to those of a Dungeons & Dragons game: if War was the leader, therefore, all armor and physical strength, and Death the agile killer,Furia wears the clothes of the sorceress, and therefore is initially the most disadvantaged character who, as she advances, however obtains the most powerful and varied skills within the team of adventurers. In Darksiders 3 you practically have an initially very limited fighter on your hands, armed only with a whip and simplistic combinations, who gradually acquires extremely interesting powers, capable of greatly varying the gameplay. These abilities are called Hollow, elemental powers that once acquired allow her to use dedicated secondary weapons, spells that exploit a special Bar of Wrath (rechargeable by dint of broadsides in the face of enemies) and navigation skills directly linked to the metroidvania element above described, without which it is not possible to roam freely around the extensive world map. Furia's ability to change elements is not the fulcrum of the fight, because if you go to analyze its list of skills in detail, you discover an overall more limited system than the more markedly action one of the predecessors. What makes the battles of Darksiders III noticeably superior to those seen in the past is a clear surge in the difficulty curve, which has led every enemy - from the most insignificant of mobs to the most vicious of infernal beasts - to attack the protagonist without restraint as soon as this comes within its range. The variety of opponents found in the game is after all impressive, as is their agility and the number of attacks with which they can take you by surprise. The From school has therefore profoundly influenced the development, and the damage inflicted by the opponents is important enough to make sudden deaths an eventuality that cannot be underestimated. Don't think you can simply overwhelm hordes of opponents with your unusual power: dodging, counterattacking and carefully memorizing the patterns is a must so as not to instantly turn into a stain on the floor. Professor Miyazaki's Map Course To at least partially mitigate the difficulty, Furia can still power up properly between one zone and another. Vulgrim - inevitable merchant demon present throughout the trilogy - in Darksiders III will be the one to whom you will have to deliver the souls obtained from eliminations, or to buy useful items and upgrades to your instruments of death (which can also be improved by another old acquaintance... ) or simply to increase one of three stats, which will significantly affect your style of play. Lovers of perfect dodges and counterattacks will therefore dramatically increase the arcane, which enhances the powers of Wrath and this kind of assault, while the more ~classic~ players will divide the points between vitality and strength, to launch gradually more and more powerful broadsides and maintain some healthy resistance to blows. It is a very basic development, we know, but it remains well thought out, and as mentioned its accessibility works thanks to the more than worthy level of general challenge. If, in the meantime, you are muttering ~dj vu~ under your moustache, know that the mechanics borrowed from the dear old Souls do not end here: with each death your basic cure is recharged as for the Estus Flask, the lost souls remain in the form of spectrum in the death zone, the interface of the usable objects exploits the same system linked to the arrow keys, and Vulgrim also offers an interesting ~Serpentine Gates~ service which is none other than the fast travel between the various check points on the map. The best lesson, however, the Gunfires learned during the fictional ~map morphology class~ taught by the esteemed Professor Miyazaki, because if ever there was a college exam like this our heroes would pass it with a nice 28 followed by friendly pat on the back. The game world of Darksiders III demonstrates the team's experience more than any other aspect, and is the greatest strength of the entire production, with its commendable diversification and the brilliant placement of bosses, items necessary for upgrades, and opponents . Of course, we are not at Japanese levels of perfectionism, but it is difficult to get lost or not understand where to go in this adventure, despite the freedom left to the player and the possibility of eliminating the Seven Deadly Sins - powerful demons, whose capture is the goal final of the Furia mission - in no particular order (although a couple of them require obligatorily obtaining a large part of the Hollows to be reached, and the first and last are fixed). In the arduous Jenga game of development, in other words, the Gunfire Games managed to remove most of the most useless pieces, and to obtain a wooden towerfar more stable than we would have expected, especially after the less than impressive initial presentation trailers. The last Darksiders flows like a beauty, entertains, and manages to place itself with dignity alongside its brothers: a feat to be applauded if one considers the downsizing of the workforce and the separation from that Madureira that many considered the soul of the brand name. That said, we are not in front of an impeccable title anyway  The shortcomings of a fury This project, we repeat, relies on fewer resources than its predecessors, and given the rather limited timescales and market needs, it is unable to exploit the individual elements that make it up with the same scope as those who preceded it. The emphasis on the souls-like element has in fact given a due boost to the level of challenge - a well-known drawback of the saga - but at the same time has dampened the Zeldian soul of the game, affecting the quality and number of puzzles in favor of a more refined map and more adrenaline-pumping battles. Not that the puzzles are missing, for heaven's sake, but their solution is more often than not immediately evident, and the more bizarre puzzles seem to have disappeared to favor the general pace of progress. We don't entirely agree with the choice, and the presence of environmental puzzles in the advanced stages, where we found ourselves more than once having to use the various Hollows obtained in series to continue, is a pleasant sop but unable to counterbalance owe the thing. The bosses then went through a similar treatment and almost totally lack specific mechanics that facilitate their elimination by roundabout routes, except for a couple of interesting cases. Finally, the precision required to advance in certain areas made the platforming element of the game a bit wooden, as well as irritating at times. On this last factor, however, we understand the team's needs: if Fury's jumps had been less calculated, it would have been easy to bypass entire locations with a little cunning. The flaws above do not spoil a commendable experience, but they are felt in particular in the final phase of the campaign, which could potentially be the most varied and amusing of the game, and instead it seemed to us the most rushed and yielding. A real shame, because considering the intelligence shown by the Gunfires, this Darksiders could have even surpassed the first and second chapters with some more prudent choices and some extra time and money. However, we believe it is appropriate to close the list of defects here, to break a spear in favor of those who worked on the artistic direction of the game. The absence of a sacred monster like Madureira is felt, true, yet the work done is very close to his imagination, and he defends himself well thanks to characters full of charisma and settings often able to amaze for composition and choice of colors. Graphically Darksiders III is certainly not the most advanced title of the year; it is its precise identity that overshadows certain limitations and some minor bugs (during our entire test we encountered a couple of annoying crashes, but no other serious problems). The game is also very scalable, and despite having played it on a respectable configuration, we believe it can run without too many problems even on mid-range PCs.", "date": "2018-11-26", "grade": "8.5"}
