After twelve years, various episodes and spin-offs and 16 million copies sold, with a view to a relaunch after the recent disasters (see Driv3r) Ubisoft brings the saga to the new Nintendo portable, without giving up at all - indeed, as we will see by taking it to the extreme - to the violent and ~trash~ component, and by making a certain simplification in the contents and gameplay. Was it the right choice? John Tanner's Long Night After a life spent as an undercover agent in the New York Police, John Tanner, protagonist of most of the previous episodes, now lost faith in the regulation (not that he showed much faith before...), decides to leave the body and act as a ~maverick~, on the hunt for the city's biggest criminals, this time only following his own rules. He is helped in his crusade by his former colleagues, some exponents of the criminal underworld with whom he had had to deal with in his previous life, a former prostitute, whom he redeemed, who will end up falling in love with him and none other than a senator, Andrew Ballard , who sees in him the ideal means to implement his project of zero tolerance against crime without personally getting his hands dirty. Spectacular chases, violence, foul language and beautiful scantily clad women pit Tanner and the player against five evil crime bosses, each engaged in the most perverted activities the human mind can imagine, from dealing badly cut drugs to the illegal trade in organs. It looks like the plot of a C-series action movie, and in fact it's exactly what the development team wanted to do: but it's not so much in the simple and trivial story that we place our first reservation towards the game, as in the way which it is told. In fact, between one mission and another in the Story Mode, we witness some films that are also stylistically beautiful, halfway between a comic and a cartoon, but which show off dialogues that are very poor in construct (and instead rich in vulgarity and violence which seem frankly exaggerated, surrounded as they are by nothing) and tell the story of Tanner's adventure without delving into any aspect, with the ex-cop happily passing from one criminal to another without difficulty, as if they were anything but the evil crime bosses that they are. One of the most beautiful things about Hollywood action movies, in all their simplicity, is the identification that always arises towards the protagonist, and the hatred that one ends up feeling for the villain of the moment; all of this is absolutely missing in the narrative of Driver Renegade 3D, which is also explicitly inspired by that genre. The 3D effect Definitely shot upwards: you will notice it right from the menu screens, with the various objects present in Tanner's garage which will tend to double rather than re-enter the depth of the screen, and it will be annoying during the game, especially when your vehicle or those you pursue fall prey to smoke and flame. But just push the appropriate lever down a little and the 3D effect will give its valid, not exceptional, contribution to the spectacular action; the ~excess~ 3D calibration seems to be a bit of a constant of all Ubisoft games released on 3DS so far. Now you made me angry! This plot popo unfolds, in the aforementioned Story Mode, along 20 missions that each have different objectives (follow a certain vehicle without losing sight of it or eliminate another certain vehicle with doors, escape from enemies or shoot down a precise number, or even go looking for some commercial activities that are actually the site of illegal trafficking and destroying them) but which in the end all result in driving at breakneck speed through the streets of a New York City certainly not reproduced with the utmost precision, but with considerable dimensions and especially with the ~poetic licenses~ that the programmers have allowed themselves exploited in favor of the gameplay, with ramps, killer curves, works in progress and hidden alleys that probably don't exist in reality butin play they work very well. And the control of the car also works well, very simple (accelerator, brake, handbrake and the backbones used for counters) and different from vehicle to vehicle: there are 50 to unlock, distinguished by 4 parameters, acceleration, speed, road and armouring. Obviously accidents are the order of the day, they are in fact necessary to win, and sooner or later in each mission you will have to take advantage of one of the garages scattered in strategic points of the playing area; last factor to take into consideration, the ~Rage~ bar, which is none other than the very classic turbo and which fills up - with consequent hilarious belligerent phrases from Tanner - with every spectacular braking and with every element of the destroyed landscape. Of course, the opponents do not enjoy a Nobel Prize AI, the difficulty is not constant and after a mission to be repeated 4 or 5 times, perhaps one arrives that can be resolved in thirty seconds, and the map/navigator on the second screen is obviously uncomfortable, forcing us to look away from the action and making us run into very avoidable fronts with some buildings; the fact is that the game system itself works very well: it's fun, frenetic, enthralling, in certain moments even exhilarating, managing to induce the adrenaline of the best car chases in cinema. The gameplay with the hole around What Ubi Reflections seems to have forgotten to do is add a game around a core of simple but well done gameplay. The Story Mode, which is not exciting narratively due to the problems mentioned above, ends for an average experience player within three hours (and we are talking about the higher difficulty level of the two proposed); then you can move on to Career Mode: seven different types of challenge (basically they are the same objectives as in the Story) each with 12 trials of increasing difficulty with lots of objectives and cars to unlock, but in practice, you want for a never all satisfactory, you want because in the end they are all things already seen in history but this time without the bite of a weak plot to keep them together, most likely the monotony will hit you before finishing everything. At this point the inclusion of some multiplayer mode would have greatly helped, to which the game system lends itself very well, but sadly there is not the slightest trace of it, unless you want to consider StreetPass as a multiplayer that is not very practicable it does nothing but compare your records with those of the players you meet on the street; in our opinion, this is an unforgivable defect, as nowadays a gameplay of this type, fun but arcade in all respects, must be accompanied by a strong push for replayability, which Driver Renegade 3D simply does not offer . All this takes on even more the flavor of a big missed opportunity in the light of a graphic sector that sacrifices pedestrians and other cars (there are, but few for such a large playing area) and shows a remarkable pop up of the buildings on the background, but which does its duty especially as regards speed and fluidity, absolutely impeccable as befits the type of game, and an audio component that stands out for its beautiful English dubbing, superior to the Italian one which however can count on a effect ~vulgarity~ that will not fail to arouse a few laughs.", "date": "2011-09-13", "grade": "5.8"}
