Which hurts even more since Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is here, concrete, still splendid despite the years, an example and model that, who knows why, no one seems to have the strength to follow. The 3D Classics line for Nintendo 3DS is enriched with a new gem: Sonic The Hedgehog 2! Run like a porcupine! In an era in which Super Mario World had set new standards in the platform genre (standards never surpassed again, according to some, but that's another story), the answer of the historical rival SEGA was a weird, but absolutely cool, porcupine blue that made speed its trump card. But Sonic The Hedgehog, however impressive at first glance for how it ran, for spectacular touches of class such as the loops of the loop, for the graphics that were incredible at the time, was a much deeper game than it appeared, equipped with a level complex design that left a lot of room for exploration with its crossroads, its alternative routes and its Emeralds to be collected to earn the complete ending. In Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Yuji Naka and his Sonic Team pushed even more the ~double soul~ of the saga: the frenetic stages made up of combinations of loops, dizzying loops, bumpers, jumps, rings to collect and enemies to be eliminated in a path to learn by heart and which gives great exaltation, alternate with delightful more reflective but equally satisfying phases, in which to choose the path to take, go and find secrets and hidden recesses, deal with obstacles, platforms mobile and enemies whose handling requires more thought than quick reflexes. Every fan of Sonic 2D has his favorite episode, this second one is still at the top of the ranking in the hearts of many precisely because he managed to combine his two souls in a very balanced way, and although perhaps even more peaks have been reached in Sonic CD high, the discourse remains unassailable to this day. Of course, even at the time there were defects: an artificially increased difficulty through, for example, elements inserted on purpose - ~cheap~ as English speakers would say - in the quick stages to make you lose 99% of all the hard-won rings, or some stages clearly not up to the others, and in general the whole final part of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 seems less studied than the first half. And again, the big news of the second episode, the introduction of Miles ~Tails~ Prower as a second character controlled by the CPU or by another player, both in cooperative and competitive modes, although very brave it was certainly not the main attraction . But ultimately in the 90s the whole saga, and this episode in particular, was a fantastic alternative to Super Mario, even superior in some aspects. The 3D effect As we say in the body of the piece, there are two ways of exploiting the 3D effect: one that moves the backdrops in depth, another that creates that effect whereby the elements in the foreground almost seem to ~leave the screen~. In both cases, stereoscopy is excellently implemented, and enhances the many levels of parallax which at the time, together with the speed, made the game incredible to see, without affecting frame rates and gameplay at all. Rogue nostalgia Sonic The Hedgehog 2 has aged decidedly well, but it cannot be said to be among those, indeed very few, titles that do not feel the weight of age at all. The limits mentioned above, the artificially fed difficulty and some less inspired levels, stand out even more in light of what has happened in these 23 years. One aspect that probably betrays our memories is the bonus stages in fake 3D, which can be accessed by arriving at checkpoints with at least fifty rings. At the time they made a sensation for their graphic impact and gameplay, today, with true 3D dominating the scene, they are little more than boring and imperfect intervals. A fortiori therefore shines the work, as usual particularly complete, of conversion operated by M2. Particularly complete above all for all the usual series of goodies intended to better revive the experience: two different types of stereoscopic 3Dpico, the possibility of simulating the effect of the old CRT televisions, that of choosing between the Japanese and the international version, and also of enhancing the wonderful soundtrack by Masato Nakamura (one of the most refined aspects of the old Sonic), so such as the effects, emulating the audio chip of the Mega Drive 2, the second version of the 16-bit SEGA which, in addition to a more captivating design, showed off its greater sound potential. But also on the gameplay front, some notable additions have been made that express the team's full understanding of the limits of the game. Fully configurable controls, the ability to choose which level to play right away, a mode that starts you with ten rings at each stage and takes away only half of them with each hit, the option to get the invulnerable Super Sonic without going through the bonus stages, they are all very sensible and welcome changes, as the 3D Classics have accustomed us by now. A small lack in this sense is only the impossibility of eliminating the split screen in competitive multiplayer, to take advantage of which you will still need two consoles and two virtual copies of the product. An excellent work, which enhances a historical and very valid game. And that mercilessly lays bare even more the misery into which a franchise that made history has fallen. Worry that, let us be granted one last controversial note, it doesn't just lurk in the gameplay: here is Sonic, simple, in all its essence, a character from 25 years ago who still remains undeniably cool and fascinating. Why it has recently been decided to change its design and ~lore~ by adding scarves and creating characters and stories bordering on the ridiculous, remains a sad mystery.", "date": "2015-10-26", "grade": "8.5"}
