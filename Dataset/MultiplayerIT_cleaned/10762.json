The hexagonal grid differs from the classic square one that we can find in turn-based strategy games of far different fame (Civilization or Advance Wars, just to give two examples) above all for one reason, namely that the distance between the center of a box and the six is always the same, while with squares this does not happen: this allows a somewhat more realistic rationalization of the territory, and in fact the hexagonal model is also exploited in much more serious fields than video games, which is better suited to those very sectoral simulations which , precisely by virtue of their high specificity, they aim to recreate all the aspects of a given situation with rigorous accuracy. Irrevocable decisions Europe at War does just that: it simulates only the purely warlike aspects of the Second World War, in an area that includes, in addition to Europe, also the Near East, North Africa, the North Atlantic and the eastern part of the United States. The developers, assisted in the DS version by the very Italian Impressionware, propose six scenarios which are actually six starting points of the only major campaign present: for example, you can choose to start from the invasion of Poland or from the entry into the war of the USA, and in any case, the starting situation will reflect the historically known one. Obviously, first of all, the alignment must be chosen, the Axis (Germany and Italy) or the Allies (USA, United Kingdom, France and USSR) but, while at a strategic level you always command all the nations of a given alignment, at a tactical level, it is say in the field, you will only take possession of a country's troops when it has actually entered the war. To give an example, if you start from 1939 in command of the Axis, you immediately have the German troops engaged on the Polish front at your disposal, but to command the Italian troops you will have to wait for the famous hour of irrevocable decisions, which strikes in June of 1939. 40. Not so when it comes to establishing the direction and resources of scientific research, obviously also exclusively for war purposes: in addition to technology, the only other aspects that require abandoning the tactical map for a while are the purchase of new units, conditioned by industrial resources and technology itself (there are also the officers, historically real, who add parameters to the troops). The units are differentiated according to their type (land, sea and air) and then for each type there are three or four choices: a tank is definitely more powerful than a normal infantry body, but requires much more resources and time of construction. The various boxes also differ in defense capacity, movement cost and so on, and then there are the special boxes such as cities, which give you the industrial and oil resources necessary to conduct the war, and ports for all naval operations , boxes that must be defended as a priority. The ultimate goal is, for each faction, to conquer the largest number of capitals of the opposing faction, and this can happen either by ending the game strictly in 1945, or by leaving the ending ~open~, and continuing after that year, or maybe finish first. Save DS Soldier From all this you can deduce how much, in reality, HTBS are similar to all the other TBSs which on DS are always quite successful, except for their great sector nature and historical rigorousness, and how much more approachable they are than what one might think first sight. Indeed, a merit that Slitherine credits itself and not without reason is that of having created a game that is easy to learn and difficult to master. It's really true, as the interface is very simple and linear, in this one enhanced by the touch screen, and in a few turns you'll find your way around the various screens with dexterity; even the fact of having limited the types of troops and the directions of research, if on the one hand takes away a bit of depth, on the other it allows us to know first and more deeply what we have available, which is absolutely necessary to win the various battles. However, this does not turn into a trivial and easy challenge, because the AI is far from stupid and will take advantage of both the resources at its disposal (which increase from turn to turn with the increase in the war effort, exactly like the yours) than of your slightest mistake to kill yourself,and then because very soon, as actually happened, you will be engaged on numerous fronts and the means available will always seem too few. In short, as a representative of its genre, EaW behaves more than discreetly, and indeed takes an important step towards an unlikely, but nevertheless to be appreciated, revaluation among the less hardcore public: the limits are all within the limits of the genre itself, which by vocation it is very far from the concept of variety, managing to excite only those who are truly interested in the specific subject. This ~vocation~ also affects the technical aspect: we are amazed by the introduction entrusted even to a piece of vintage newsreel, but then it's all two-dimensional graphics that aim for essentiality and legibility, tons of text (in excellent Italian !) and a single piece of music that is sufficiently warlike and inspiring but, indeed, unique. The multiplayer, which would have extended the longevity all in all not incredibly high, is unfortunately not present.", "date": "2009-04-13", "grade": "7.3"}
