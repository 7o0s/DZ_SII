U2 - Vertigo Zucchero - Diamond Whitney Houston - The Greatest Love Of All Zucchero - With Hands Singing with the stars Speaking of a new episode of Singstar, it is natural to dwell almost exclusively on the characteristics of the musical selection, seen and considered how -again- there is no structural novelty to differentiate it from the previous ones. Legends therefore always allows you to try your hand at single karaoke, duets or even group cantatas through the usual Pass the Mic, Duet and Battle modes. As usual incredibly sparse, the single player mode is completely negligible, unless you want to practice on the songs or aim to knock down the various high scores. In terms of gameplay, Singstar Legends retains the strengths and weaknesses of the franchise: the game evaluates only the height of one's singing, without caring in the least about the intonation or the correct pronunciation of the lyrics (in fact it is possible to obtain excellent scores even muttering words a case), but the system is still sufficiently precise and calibrated. The classic three levels of difficulty also remain, which affect the level of tolerance granted to the height of the notes sung by the user. Structurally identical to the various prequels, Singstar Legends obviously stands out for the tracklist, as we said more wide-ranging than the latest editions. Therefore, authentic timeless classics such as Blue Suede Shoes by Elvis Presley or Imagine by John Lennon find space alongside more recent songs such as Vertigo by U2 or Smells Like Teen Spirits by Nirvana, without forgetting the inevitable pop digressions (Papa Don't Preach by Madonna) and the peculiar additions of the Italian version: not exactly happy to tell the truth, with some chilling songs like Una Canzone D'amore by 883 and A Che Ora E' La Fine Del Mondo by Ligabue, which have very little legendary . Although quite balanced, the Singstar Legends tracklist is inevitably oriented towards a mature audience, and possibly endowed with good singing skills: following the vocals of Barry White, Sting or Aretha Franklin is certainly not for everyone... Comment Yet another data disk for Singstar doesn't change in the slightest what has already been said about the previous releases: that is, the more the tracklist meets one's tastes and personal knowledge, the more enjoyable the product will be and suitable for nice group cantatas. . Even this Legends, in fact, does not provide the user with great incentives to launch into solitary performances, revealing itself to be a substantially multiplayer-only product. Despite some really prohibitive tracks, Singstar Legends is still a pleasant compilation for the best karaoke game available today. Pros Quite varied tracklist Winning play structure Always a lot of fun in groups Cons Zero innovations compared to the previous ones Some questionable musical choices Several songs that are too difficult With Swiss precision, here comes a new episode of Singstar, the singing franchise of SCEE that just can't seem to help but put the vocal cords of PlayStation 2 users to the test. After a couple of musically more sectoral releases (Singstar 80's and Singstar Rocks!), the Sony product goes back to its origins offering a tracklist free from constraints regarding genre and tempo and offering the possibility of a duet with some legends...or presumed legends.
