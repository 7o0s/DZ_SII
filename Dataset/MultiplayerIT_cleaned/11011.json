Aesthetically it looks like an animated film, there are even cute little creatures that draw attention by themselves and make you want to try it (we anticipate that they are really tender as they appear) but the doubt that may arise is: together with the shape Will there also be substance? After all, Ember Lab is at its first project and there could be a thousand factors why a game betrays the public's expectations - which are sometimes excessive but nevertheless exist. We understood it as soon as we started the game, however, that Kena had so much to say: not just a story but a real experience, which blends narration and gameplay very well, does not go beyond its ambitions, embracing them without distorting them, and keeps a steady pace from start to finish, leaving satisfied to see the end credits. There was no shortage of smudges but they are really minimal and of a technical nature, many of which will be eliminated at launch; however, none of these was disabling, confirming the care taken by Ember Labs in its work and the need for those postponements that made people turn up their noses so much. The game presented to us is refined, fun, captivating, clean in its simplicity and has accompanied us on a journey that we will not forget easily - and indeed, which could pave the way for new adventures for Kena. Even if we would prefer it to remain unique. Let's find out about Kena: Bridge of Spirits in our PS5 review. A journey in search of yourself Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Kena's journey will take her farther than she anticipated Kena: Bridge of Spirits puts us in the role of a young Spiritual Guide: these figures have the difficult task of accompanying the souls of those who refuse the passage to the afterlife, having not yet accomplished what they had to in life. They are hardly peaceful creatures since what keeps them in the world of the living ends up corrupting them. Kena is on a journey to better understand his role as a Guide and, in doing so, he will find himself having to understand what happened to a ruined village and its inhabitants, retracing history through the pain of those who have not accepted their death. The story that is proposed to us has nothing to envy to animated films, in particular for the aesthetics but also for the story itself, which deals with the death and regret (but not only) of the spirits in a very delicate and at the same time at the same time powerful and effective. You meet a few characters during the adventure, each duly outlined. From beginning to end, Kena: Bridge of Spirits proves to be an experience perfectly aligned with one's ambitions: we will see it above all in the gameplay but also from the story we understand how the developers have not let themselves be caught up in the desire to create the masterpiece of life, opting for a clean and linear structure both in the story and in the game. We arrive at the credits satisfied, knowing that we have left nothing behind and that everything has found its perfect conclusion: bittersweet, as is any story that deals with death, remorse and the need to accept the cyclical nature of life, yet charming in its own small way. Enhanced even more, as we have mentioned, by films and a staging that truly have the flavor of an animated film. Not even the slight smudges due to an absence of antialiasing get in the way, because while you notice them especially on the hair of the characters (evil incarnate when modeling), they don't deprive the game of its charm. Simple and clean gameplay Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the threats that Kena will have to face will be varied and challenging especially on high difficulties Smooth and clean. We can't find better words to define the gameplay of Kena: Bridge of Spirits. It's one of those games that finally makes you breathe a sigh of relief because it doesn't stuff itself ad nauseum with content with the aim either of pleasing everyone, or of going as long as possible. Just like in the case of the story, he knows what he wants and how to make it available to the player. Few powers but all perfectly embedded in the experience. Kena can fight hand to hand using his stick, in a limited series of combos, but it is together with the Rot that he releases his full potential. The Rot are small (and very tender) forest spirits that we will have to look for in the various areas of the extensive game map: we are not required to do this, and some will be given to us by default at the end of the boss fights, however their number is directly proportional to our power. Or rather: once certain limits are reached, Kena will ~level up~ and the Rot themselves will be able to perform one more action in combat, a possibility that as the adventure progresses will prove essential especially at advanced difficulty levels - by the way, we played it at the highest one available, stripping the user interface, and it knows how to be ruthless when it wants. Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the Rot are our precious and tender travel companions Since the Rot are peaceful creatures, they need courage to perform actions in battle and it's up to us to give it to them. Based on the difficulty with which we decide to face the game, the variables for the accumulation of courage change making everything more reasoned and complex: once accumulated enough, and based on the skills learned up to that moment, the Rot will unleash their power at our command. They can block the enemy and make him vulnerable, transform themselves into a magical arrow far more devastating than ours, even create a time bubble within which monsters are slowed down to the point of practically standing still. The design of the monsters is once again proof that the developers wanted to create a blended experience in all respects: they are not too many and are designed, especially when put together, to push us to take advantage of Kena's every ability. From flying ones to golems , from sorcerers to explosive ones, plus others that we will not reveal to you, each enemy is enough to push us to think and make better use of even the small but combative Rot. These spirits are also the only way we have to heal ourselves during battles and only where healing flowers are present. By consuming an action, we can tell the Rot to heal us. Everything therefore revolves around them and the actions that can be performed, which, as already mentioned, increase based on how many we have collected: it goes without saying therefore that exploration is almost inextricably linked to combat also due to the fact that skills are acquired with karma points, which can be accumulated both during the story and above all by completing the various secondary objectives. Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the game world is littered with secrets and environmental puzzles to solve Despite what one might think, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a game that takes away its ten or more hours, without being 100% completed. The map is extended and divided into different sections that contain numerous collectibles or objects related to secondary missions; few but there are. Furthermore, there is no indication to find what we want, if not good eyes and occasionally the mask of the spirit who is helping: by wearing it we can see beyond and possibly identify the footprints of the Rot, if we are close enough. In that case we just need to follow them to recover one of the many missing sprites. Exploration is satisfying and so are the various challenges that are placed on our way: from the puzzles to the platform phases, each requires the pinch of ingenuity sufficient to keep us busy and satisfy us achieved the goal, thanks to a level design once again well placed in that fluid cohesion that symbolizes the heart of the whole experience. Verticality is enhanced but there are also phases underground, so as to also guarantee excellent changes of scenery. From endless plains to sprawling caverns, Kena's journey is filled with fascination and danger, but the hidden secrets are totally worth the effort. Technical and artistic sector Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the game boasts breathtaking sceneries Kena: Bridge of Spirits features two game modes: Performance, for 60fps and upscaled 4K, and Loyalty which locks the frame rate at 30fps in exchange for native 4K. We tried both, eventually opting for smoother gameplay as the aesthetics remain equally good and the game often gets hectic enough to prefer 60fps. Net of this, by now you will have understood, we are facing a game that for being the debut title of the development team is incredible: cohesive in everything and with animated film clips, despite the very small smudges dictated by the lack of antialiasing which, however, could be fixed at launch together with other confirmed adjustments including the presence of the Photo Mode. We have not always been convinced by the dubbing but even in this case these are sporadic occasions, overall it is more than enjoyable. Nothing to say instead from the point of view of the soundtrack, as usual perfectly inserted in the context. In over ten hours of play we only encountered one bug that forced us to reload the game but the presence of frequent automatic saves (together with manual ones) did not make it a problem. As for the DualSense, the use is not very implemented but we appreciated the slight pulsation that is felt when there is a hidden Roti'm.", "date": "2021-09-21", "grade": "8.8"}
