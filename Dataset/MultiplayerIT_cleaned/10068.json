Not many, just enough to go to the cinema in a city hall, strictly alone, feed your addiction to smoking for a couple of days or buy the new downloadable content created by Bioware for Mass Effect 2. Unfortunately, although the quality level of Kasumi - Stolen Memory is not as low as that experienced in other dlcs of Electronic Arts' role-playing rib - above all Return to Ostagar - the last option remains the worst of the three proposed above and this review is intends to investigate the reasons. Having paid the amount requested for the download and having downloaded the file, the methods of acquiring the quest are the usual, with a message delivered directly to the Normandy's on-board computer and a new indicator that from the galactic map points in the direction of the Citadel... Tuxedo snack The addition follows what has already been done for Zaeed, a character released at the launch to inaugurate the Cerberus Network, asking to complete a single mission that plays the double role of recruiting and guaranteeing the trust of the character who will become part of the crew of the Commander Shepard's starship. In short, what for regular companions takes place through two missions is reduced here to about an hour of play to be enjoyed in one breath. In short, Kasumi is a thief as expert as she is mysterious, famous for her infallibility and surrounded by an aura of mystery that protects her personal data. What could ever push her to reveal herself, asking for the player's help? Simple, a neural storage module containing some sensitive data both from a strategic and sentimental point of view: the precious object fell into the hands of a certain Donovan Hock, a tycoon of no one knows what empire and trafficker of the highest level, one of those characters who seem to have come out of some James Bond film, who must be visited in his villa on the planet Bekenstein during a reception, waiting for the situation, as if inevitable, to precipitate until the final showdown. The most suggestive ideas are all concentrated in the first part of this mini adventure, where a Shepard in evening dress, but during the day, will have to mix with the other guests to collect all the elements necessary to evade the security systems of the armored door that prevents the 'access to the vault: not a new but interesting idea, which is mortified by an execution that simply has the user search for pre-set hotspots, without any real challenge related to sneaking into the rooms of the villa and investigating undercover. The second half of this additional content is more traditional, all fighting and skill management, with only Kasumi composing the two-piece party that must be brought up to face-to-face with Hock. All in all returning to the Mass Effect 2 battlefield is still fun and Kasumi: Lost Memory offers some good shooting in that regard; pity therefore that there are no new enemies and the only new weapon is rather trivial. The graphic work on the unpublished environments is decent but far from the best glimpses offered by the original title, while the value of being able to play alongside Kasumi even after the end of this dlc, enlisted among its ranks, is only marginalized by the already vast choice of possible mates.", "date": "2010-04-16", "grade": "6.0"}
