{"name": "Miitopia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/miitopia-recensione.html", "text": "A few days after its release on Nintendo Switch, here we are with our review of Miitopia: it is, to be brief, a deluxe edition - although it does not bear the wording - of the curious RPG released on Nintendo 3DS at the beginning of 2017 (or late 2016, in Japan), adapted for the occasion by Grezzo, a team that has already authored various remakes in the past, including that of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The original work, on the other hand, was developed by internal group number four (EPD 4), the one notoriously dedicated to projects for a casual audience: it was directed by Yuchiro Ito, former author - both as programmer and as lead designer - of some Brain Age . Before talking about the work itself, it makes sense to start from the qualities that distinguish it from the original and that can be of interest to both those who played it in their time and those approaching it for the first time. The differences with the 3DS version are not minimal, starting from the visual aspect. The generational leap, in this case, is practically double: not only is the game now in high resolution, but all the textures have been adapted to render adequately in the new graphic context. Miitopia: a typical party, four characters and a horse. But it is also and above all from the point of view of the contents that various improvements have been made. First of all the Mii editor which, as we will see shortly, is a fundamental part of the experience: on Switch there are many more customization possibilities, dozens and dozens of colors and variations and tricks absent on 3DS, for such a powerful editor to unleash the imagination of enthusiasts. In this new version the horses, as well as accompanying the adventurers, can also lead them on horseback into battle, increasing the damage of the attacks, while the sentimental relationships (not necessarily romantic, indeed, more often friendly) between the protagonists, can be increased through of surreal activities. Surreal for the narrative context - purely fantastic - of Miitopia, we mean: the characters can have a coffee together, go to the cinema, go fishing, have fun in the park. But for those who have never played it, what is Miitopia? An RPG with Miis Said in the most concise way possible, Miitopia is a Japanese RPG dried out of every frill: linear, simplified, and having as protagonists - as can be seen from the title - the Miis. It is a work evidently aimed at a very young audience or occasional gamers, which allows even the less experienced, and in general those who want to make little effort, to enjoy a pleasant adventure in a fantasy world (Miitopia precisely, which is the land where the events of the story take place). Miitopia: Duke of Evil against a group of heroes. Once the protagonist has been created, the name has been chosen and his appearance has been carefully arranged, it is necessary to select his character (confident, relaxed, dreamy, etc...) and, subsequently, his class. Some of them are very traditional, typical of classic role-playing games: magician, warrior, thief, priest, but to these are added that of the ~singer~ (the equivalent of the bard) and that of the cook; continuing the adventure, others will appear, decidedly more absurd (~cat~, for example), and the game will do everything possible, without making too many spoilers, to push you to try them. This routine is repeated for each character, and we can't tell you how fundamental it is - we'll come back to this topic shortly - to take care of these details well: they are the ones who make Miitopia a unique experience, however simple. The enemy who besieges this pleasant land is the Duke of Evil, a terrifying being (more or less) who steals the faces of the inhabitants of Miitopia, transplanting them on the faces of the monsters who populate this land: by defeating the mephitic beasts, you will return the faces to their rightful owners. The adventure develops on various settings, terrestrial and non-terrestrial, and has a rather long duration, let's say between twenty and forty hours: as we said, Nintendo has done everything possible, despite the simplicity of the mechanics, to let anyone try the RPG experience. Cities, trails and fights The structure of the game is simple and repetitive. First of all there is a map of the world, clear and sparse, from which you can access the various points of interest; the latter are divided into cities (or palaces, or castles) and transitional paths, where monsters and treasures are encountered. Cities are the only places you can move your character with the control stick; not that there is much to explore, they are small territories with an essential conformation. Usually in these places - which, apart from exceptions, do not have enemies - the ~problem~ to be solved in the surrounding area is encountered: often it is, as anticipated,to find the faces stolen from the inhabitants. The most action-packed part of the game takes place in the paths: the protagonists (up to four at the same time) automatically move along the linear route. What varies is the setting, which defines the visual context of the adventure, not the design dynamics. You can accelerate progress by pressing B (the characters will start running), and occasionally you will encounter crossroads; not being able to go back, to see every area, and find every treasure, it will however be necessary to go back several times on the same paths. Miitopia: the shot while exploring the paths. Your journey will often be interrupted by random encounters with enemies; as in classic Japanese role-playing games and in these situations you are transported to a separate area, used only for fighting. The latter are turn-based, and the player will only be able to control the protagonist of the group: you can choose whether to attack, perform magic or use tools, but you can never decide what your allies will do. On the contrary, you can also automate the choices of the protagonist. For the clashes, the aforementioned sentimental relationships of the characters are very important: if they love each other, they will help each other both in the defensive and offensive phases. Conversely, a major disagreement could lead them to antagonize each other (a rather rare eventuality, by the way), where these relations, as well as so many other matters relating to equipment, are managed and increased in the inns, which are met at the end of each path. Inns, relationships and character development In the inns the nature of the game becomes almost managerial. It is in these situations, even too frequent, that we need to improve the equipment, and the sentimental relationships, of the characters. First of all you have to arrange them inside the rooms: needless to say that, as a consequence, there will be an increase in the bond between the roommates. Miitopia: two characters inside a room, in an inn. Tickets have also been included in the Switch edition to maximize the relationships between the protagonists: they will be gradually donated by the inhabitants of the saved villages, and you can use them for impromptu, and absurd, recreational activities (such as going to the cinema, or having a coffee ). These activities - like rooms - are open to only two elements, not the whole party. For this reason, you will have to decide whether to maximize the bond between some couples, or to balance the relationships a bit between the whole group: it's a fun aspect of the game. You will have to be careful to create empathy even between new elements or elements that do not particularly interest you, so as not to generate enmity. An extremely strong bond, in addition to giving unpredictable sentimental developments (however just mentioned), will give you greater efficiency and collaboration in combat. Small curiosity: the possibility of forging strong relationships even between people of the same sex has caused the absurd 18+ rating in Russia. In the inns it is also possible to participate in games, mainly ~rock-paper-scissors~ and ~roulette~ , so you can get additional coins and prizes. Of the money that, always in this phase, you can use to improve the equipment of your characters. They will themselves signal to you the desire for a new weapon, and you will have no other option than to satisfy their desires or not (basically, if a warrior in that inn wants a sword, you will not be able to buy him armor). Miitopia: a party together at the table. Finally, of course, in the inn you sleep (recovering your energy) and eat. In particular, excluding some first fruits given away by certain inhabitants, war residues are gobbled up: to give you an example, goblin meat. Each character will have their own culinary tastes, and each dish will only increase some of the characteristics (strength, magic, speed, defense, health points, magic points): from time to time you will have to be careful to balance the character's taste and development needs. Miitopia is a very simple and guided RPG. As we said, his intent is to make a similar experience live even for those who are not experts, or who don't want to commit themselves too much; for this the possibilities of evolution are guided and essential. By eating, sleeping and buying the required items, for which the available money is often sufficient, you will hardly have problems in the fights. Mii to the nth degree Finally we come to the most important aspect of the entire production, the Miis. It seems clear that Miitopia's whole raison d'tre is based completely on Miis, and by spending time having a party with the right characters in the right places, the adventure can turn into an extremely enjoyable experience.Miitopia: many Miis in the main illustration of the game. The Miis must be created by the canonical editor inserted in the console: appearance, size and position of the nose and eyes, name, favorite colour... the usual connotations we have known since the days of the Wii. Once this is done, you can further customize them with Miitopia's makeup and wigs: eye shadows, lipsticks, dimples on the face, fringes, tufts, a large palette of hair colors and tips. This allows for a freedom alien to the basic editor and, as we've already seen, can generate extremely detailed Mii characters: however, be careful not to overdo it. A Mii can be attractive from the icon, but not be functional in Miitopia: this can happen by inserting elements out of position. For example, like in a Darth Vader that we downloaded from the online archive and created with a mustache on his forehead. A mustache that perhaps looks like a credible helmet when seen in a static portrait, but which will continue to curl, even if positioned on the forehead, once the character gets angry. We write it again: it is absolutely essential, to enjoy Miitopia, to use Miis that you like, or are related to. Those of a friend, a boyfriend, a celebrity or an imaginary character that you like: it will be them, immersed in an alien and fantastic context, that will make the adventure memorable. Their personalities and their dialogues, their relationships. You can see your girlfriend talking to Voldemort, or your brother confabulating with Darth Vader. You can put David Bowie's face on the Duke of Evil. Miitopia: what face will you give to the Duke of Evil? It is precisely the emotional bond with the Mii that makes this game special, together with the dynamics that the adventure manages to generate. At one point we had to choose the Miis to attribute to a king (obese, you will soon understand why we specify it), to his daughter (the princess), and to the two men who compete for her, a rich aristocrat and an impoverished nobleman. Well, we've selected Obelix for the king, Zelda for the daughter, Wario for the greedy and ambitious aristocrat, Link for the poor nobleman. Some hilarious situations have arisen and this is just a nerd example; think about what could happen through a child's imagination. Miis can be created from scratch, downloaded from a friend who has made them available on Miitopia, or from an online archive displaying the most popular ones.", "date": "2021-05-26", "grade": "7.5"}
