A challenge, honestly, on which few would have bet. Adapting the baroque visual complexity of the series to the small screen of the Sony handheld, while preserving the mechanics tested for years? The folks over at Project Soul have really gone all out and basically Soul Calibur has arrived on PSP in one piece. Almost. The devs who made the feat Let's start immediately with a clear and precise statement: graphically Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny is really impressive. PSP has already shown that it can offer excellent 3D with titles such as God of War, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core, Soul Calibur is further confirmation of the quality of this portable hardware. The twenty-eight characters that make up the roster of Soul Calibur IV have been transported to Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny with meticulous attention to detail, faithfully reproducing their costumes, weapons and animations. All except the Star Wars fighters, in fact the much talked about (and criticized!) Yoda, Darth Vader and the Apprentice give way to two new entries: Dampierre, a funny middle-aged fighter with an unpredictable style, and the acclaimed Kratos, protagonist of the God of War series. It goes without saying that these characters fit much more gracefully into the medieval universe of Soul Calibur, despite his supernatural powers Kratos is a perfect addition, and the unique weapons and abilities shown in the original games are cleverly reproduced in his vast array of attacks and combos. The fluidity of the fights is excellent, with very few and microscopic slowdowns, perceptible in the most convulsive moments; the arenas come directly from Soul Calibur IV and are reproduced faithfully, visually complex and gaudy, surrounding the action in an excellent way together with the canonical orchestral soundtrack with epic and pressing tones. A tale of forgotten modes... On the gameplay side, Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny leaves rather perplexing. Mind you, the mechanics have remained those of Soul Calibur IV, unchanged and perfectly faithful to the basic idea of the series, which is a very simple combat system to use but much more complex than it seems, full of depth and technicalities. For example, the final attacks called Soul Crash are back, which can be activated when the opponent excessively parries our blows and his armor falls apart, and all that myriad of additional skills and techniques to be perfected to become real experts. Still, the excellent gameplay is penalized by the paucity of the modes proposed in this edition. The canonical Arcade Mode, for example, does not exist, replaced by a fake system of challenges based on main objectives such as defending oneself, counter-attacking or surviving multiple clashes. The Story mode, which has always been the flagship of each episode, is revived in a bizarre and decidedly unofficial variant, which adds nothing to the complicated backbone of the saga: made up of dozens of challenges lasting a few seconds, it is more a tutorial that explains how to play and improve, throwing into the fray short dialogue skits in which some aspects of the various decidedly bizarre characters are expressed. To be seen as a sort of ~parallel story~, this mode is more frustrating than fun. The main objective, however, is always to make enough points to buy new clothes with which to customize the various characters or the fighter we created from scratch: this mode, already appreciated in Soul Calibur IV, loses a bit of sense here because of the absence of statistics that change our performance based on the equipment, and it becomes more of an entertainment and nothing more. In short, Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny offers the best in multiplayer, playing ad hoc locally with a human opponent: whether you challenge default or customized wrestlers, in these moments the excellent heart of Soul Calibur beats more than ever, too bad don't do it online.", "date": "2009-09-17", "grade": "7.5"}
