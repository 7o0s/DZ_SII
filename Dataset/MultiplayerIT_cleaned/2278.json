{"name": "Atlantis: L'impero perduto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atlantis-limpero-perduto.html", "text": "Game structure All we have to do is guide this daring explorer in the most remote places to allow the fulfillment of his difficult and ambitious mission. Of course, nothing goes smoothly and so to continue the adventure you have to solve puzzles, combine objects and listen carefully to the dialogues with the other characters. The game as a structure reminds me a bit of Tomb Raider in fact we will have to move objects and solve puzzles which however have a truly ridiculous level of difficulty. During your adventure you will have to change characters to solve some particular puzzles and all this will happen thanks to a radio located in various places. To give an example: you have to repair the armaments of a submarine but you command the scout. What to do? You go to the radio and choose the mechanic. To hear it this way it seems like a good idea and basically it is, but everything is ruined by the banality of these puzzles. Just press triangle every time an exclamation point appears above the protagonist's head and the riddle will practically solve itself, leaving our brains rested and without the slightest trace of fatigue. In other puzzles you have to use objects instead but this does not make them more difficult than the previous ones. Watch a fire! I have a fire extinguisher in my inventory. What do I do? This was to give you an idea. In short, nothing to do with the puzzles of Broken Sword or Tomb Raider but basically the target is low and therefore we can ~fly over~. Controls, graphics and sound. These strangers! Controls are another downside. They are really imprecise at times and you will find yourself falling off a cliff despite timed button presses. This becomes very frustrating in the long run. Then let's not talk about the answers on the screen! Sometimes the character will appear to be skating on the ground as if unable to walk. The graphics are just enough but you can definitely find better. The sound is quite good, effects and dubbing are well done, especially the latter completely in our mother tongue. Longevity The game is long enough as long as you manage to get to the end. Excellent movies that represent scenes taken from the film and inserted at the right time. To increase longevity a little, there are some fun sub-games and secret movies that can be unlocked after finding all the letters that form the word ~Atlantis~. In general, the game is not bad but if you are over 14 I advise you to leave this title alone and embark on something else, perhaps more challenging and satisfying. Pros: Beautiful movies Completely in Italian Cons: Difficult controls Ridiculous puzzles Very low target A mistery... Atlantis One of the many mysteries of humanity. How could Disney not dedicate a film to him? And in fact it has just been released in theaters and precise as a Swiss watch here is the videogame transposition on the usual platforms. The adventure, as you may have guessed, took place in the depths of the famous Atlantis. The game is completely in the third person and you'll find yourself controlling various characters trying to solve the most diverse puzzles. The protagonist is Milo Thach whose goal is to continue his grandfather's work, namely to discover the mystery of Atlantis.", "date": "2002-01-12", "grade": null}
