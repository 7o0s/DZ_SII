All the elements have obviously been reinterpreted in a video game key, with the fights linked to the classic MMO mechanics, but the title still tries to keep faith with the name it bears thanks to instances full of traps, puzzles and secret passages complete with dice rolls tied to the character's abilities. Until now the title has been supported constantly with new adventure packs that are the backbone of the title, but the thirteenth update, the most important ever, adds three different areas, all with their own storyline, and also introduces encounters random. It is a classic mechanic of the paper version of D&D that sees the party taken by surprise by a series of monsters or faced with a die roll, obviously virtual, relating to a specific skill. In addition to this Menace of the Underdark raises the level cap and introduces a new race, new monsters and, of course, new bosses. New powers and new responsibilities To try the first expansion of Dungeons & Dragons Online we went into the Underdark with a level 24 Druid, to face the terrible spider queen, Lolth, who hides in the depths of her dark kingdom. Actually his home is the Demonweb, a dimension connected to all worlds, but to reach it it is still necessary to cross a part of the underground realm of the Forgotten Realms paving tons of dark elves, half spiders, matrons and so on. Before facing the evil deity, however, we had to go through the Forest of the King and the city of Eveningstar, two completely new areas, the first of which is a huge wilderness area to explore freely. It is a much larger area than the open areas available in Dungeons & Dragons Online so far and, as we guessed at the first encounter, characterized by a greater difficulty and richer mechanics. For example the presence of bear traps, now available to the thief, indicates herds of wild beasts, and some creatures of the dark do not mind a walk outdoors even if they keep away from the Eveningstar. But the central village of the area, which serves as the hub for the Menace of the Underdark quests, has nevertheless been overwhelmed by the armies of Lolth who emerge from the depths a few steps from the inhabited center. An uncomfortable position to say the least but, thanks to the thousands of heroes who already populate the area to search for quests and resupply, the citizens of Eveningstar can rest easier. Especially since there's a new character in town and that's the druid. The main peculiarity of the druid is that of being able to transform assuming elemental and feral forms that allow access to specific sets of skills. In aquatic form, the character is a powerful spellcaster, who can specialize in healing and casting powerful magic, while as a wolf, he is a quick attacker, capable of slowing down opponents and biting them. The bear on the other hand is slower, also in terms of movement, but is predictably sturdier and can become a defensive element for the party. In any case, all classes benefit from changes and novelties thanks to the introduction of epic destinies. Also inspired by paper D&D, epic destinies guarantee new skills by effectively raising the level cap up to the twenty-fifth level. Once a destiny is chosen, which is unlocked upon reaching the twentieth level, the character earns special experience points necessary to unlock the 50 points available for each epic specialization. In short, a lot of skills, which, in addition to the plot, give a reason to continue playing even to those who have long since reached the top. As icing on the cake, the characters, when they are in the depths of the Forgotten Realms, have at their disposal a special viewer that amplifies the light allowing us, among other things, to see the hidden creatures. A fundamental tool to survive given the high difficulty of the expansion which was obviously designed with epic-level characters in mind. Journey to the Lost Realms One of the most obvious novelties of Menace of the Underdark is the presence of large monsters. Beyond the normal drow and wild bears that swarm in the new zones, almost all of the unreleased creatures are generously sized. It starts with purple worms, invertebrates as tall as buildings that emerge from the ground shaking their heads and launching bites in all directions, and we arrive at the titanic Lolth, which is about a hundred meters high and acts as a boss for the Capstone Raid which represents the grand finale of the expansion. Also the dragghi, predictably, show off decidedly generous dimensions and tower over the party puffing their inevitable and very painful breath. Less large, but still generous in size and really well done, the Resilith, a spider that welcomes us right at the entrance to the Underdark. The first one we meet is fortunately defeated by Elminster, the magician symbol of the Forgotten Realms, who is not by chance involved in the events of the expansion. In fact, Lolth seeks the power of Mystra, the goddess of magic and companion of Elminster, through a mysterious object that will have to be recovered by the players themselves in the final quest. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the thirteenth update, and the first real expansion of the MMO, adds support for DirectX 10 and 11 with vegetation and water that visibly improve. The polygonal mass obviously does not change, and the global visual experience does not make transcendental leaps. But between the visual effects of the druid, the new large monsters and the new music tracks, the development team has undoubtedly done a big job. The settings are also very large with some glimpses into the depths of the Underdark which, between almost vertical descents and rock bridges suspended in the void, allow us to study the area hundreds of meters away. A full blown expansion Menace of the Underdark is an expansion rich in content that takes us to one of the most famous and dangerous places in the entire imaginary linked to Dungeons & Dragons. There are several aesthetic improvements and, although the engine inevitably begins to age, the work done on models and settings is not bad. Furthermore, some fundamental mechanics of the paper RPG have finally been implemented, such as the new monsters capable of controlling swarms of inferior creatures and such as the random encounters which increase the thickness of the exploratory phase. On the other hand, the latter is a very important element of the expansion thanks to the introduction of a huge open area. A wild area which, among other things, enhances the versatility and independence of the druid capable of moving quickly, healing himself, casting spells and resisting the toughest attacks. And the additions continue both in narrative terms, with the implementation of an important slice of the Forgotten Realms, and in relation to the epic destinies that add depth to the characters and gameplay and, moreover, return to the title that sense of growth necessary to keep I keep the interest in the players.", "date": "2012-07-20", "grade": null}
