Attention has grown dramatically recently especially after the alarming rumors circulating on the web about the longevity of the product which would be limited to only four actual hours, unleashing a thousand doubts and questions around the net. Questions to which, we already anticipate, we will give an answer in this article. But let's proceed in order. The plot of Vanquish places more or less current political situations in a science fiction context: in a not very distant future where world overpopulation has pushed nations to war against each other to grab the last available energy resources, the United States has launched a space station orbiting in space, the SC-01 Providence, in order to absorb and recycle solar energy. Meanwhile, however, a coup in Russia brings to power the ultra-nationalists called the Order of the Russian Star led by the mad Victor Zaitsev. His men occupy the US space station and its colony, diverting the sun's rays converted into microwaves against the city of San Francisco causing hundreds of thousands of victims. The Russian fanatics then give the Americans an eight-hour ultimatum: either they accept an unconditional surrender or the next city to be hit will be New York. The American President Elizabeth Winters, whose facial features are more or less reminiscent of Hilary Clinton, refuses to bow to the will of the enemies and therefore relies on the command of marines led by veteran Colonel Robert Burns to try to reconquer the orbiting station. Threat from the sky To them is also added Sam Gideon, the protagonist of the game, a researcher of DARPA, a government agency that deals with the creation of prototypes for the defense, who wears a new suit ARS (Augmented Reaction Suit) fully equipped and rich of accessories such as jet boosters, weapons and an experimental function called BLADE that is able to scan any rifle or pistol and replicate them perfectly. But Sam also has another secret assignment, to rescue a scientist named Francois Candide. As can be seen from what has just been described, the story behind Vanquish, although not original, is not even the banal one of many similar products, that is, created ad hoc only to serve as a pretext to justify certain actions. Indeed, it reveals from the beginning what the stylistic code of the game is, confirming the desire of Shinji Mikami and his group to tell a story in their own way. The video game belongs to the genre of scripted third-person shooters, i.e. those that leave little room for the player's freedom of movement, channeling him into a predefined path, and which draws inspiration from many other products of the genre and not, such as Gears of War for the cover system and for some exciting shootings, Devil May Cry 4 for the frenzy, pace and quality of the scenarios, Metal Gear Solid for certain situations and finally Zone of the Enders and Halo for the suit. The latter is the key element around which all the playability of the product revolves. Built with particular resistant but extremely light materials that act in symbiosis with the sympathetic nervous system of the subjects who wear it, this real armor allows you to do practically everything on a battlefield. First of all it allows you to replicate, as mentioned before, every weapon that is found around and to transport up to a maximum of three at a time together with the explosives. These offensive tools can be upgraded with special objects recovered in the field, exchangeable when you want and quickly selectable using the directional cross. Terrorism of the future The weapons supplied to our hero could be defined as standard: pistol, machine gun, assault rifle and missile launcher. The only ones that are a little more particular are a sort of energy gun, a laser that locks onto multiple targets and a limb-slicing blade launcher. However, all of them respond very well to the inputs from the gamer thanks also to the excellent mapping of the game controls. Returning to the peculiarities of the suit worn by Gideon we continue by saying that when it records intense synoptic activities during phases of excessive stress such as a high number of blows suffered, or after activation by the wearer (and therefore consequently by the user with a cocombination of back and normal buttons plus the left stick of the pad) activates a special function called AR: once you enter this mode, everything around Sam slows down and it is thus possible for him to dodge enemy attacks and take them out before they are killed. realize it either with machine gun shots or through a melee attack (by repeatedly pressing the B button with Xbox 360 or Circle with PlayStation 3 you can also perform a combo). Obviously all this must take place within a certain period of time after which the speed of action returns to normal. Finally, thanks to mini rockets mounted on the limbs and on the back, the suit is able to quickly slide Sam away from one shelter to another or from one enemy to another by activating a turbo. By combining these factors with another, apparently trivial as the jump is, a rather interesting mix of strategy in the use of weapons and positioning with respect to the opponents is obtained. However, the armor cannot withstand workloads beyond a certain limit, so it tends to heat up and block some of the wearer's special functions, making him partially vulnerable. To restore the controls and become fully operational, you must therefore wait for it to cool down. And since in these situations Sam is often at the mercy of enemy assaults, it is better to think carefully about when and how to use all these functions. Xbox 360 goals Vanquish offers fifty achievements to unlock: they are distributed in the single player mode and are obtained simply with the progression of the game by eliminating particular enemies such as the Romanovs, or by destroying specific elements of the Argus KNRB-0, etc. Some are particular, such as the one that requires users to destroy all the statues of Pangloss hidden in the colony. Battle for survival In this way the gameplay remains constantly at a high pace even if there are moments of greater calm, where the shootings are less chaotic and require a minimum of strategy. Especially against the bosses at the end of the area. Precisely the latter make the videogame experience of Vanquish slightly unpleasant in some situations, but more because of the rescue system than for their actual hostile nature. The game features a series of checkpoints from which to restart after each death. In some areas this system appears functional to the natural flow of the adventure, that is, without annoying restarts from excessively distant or difficult points. In others, especially when dealing with the end-of-level phases mentioned above, unfortunately not, thus forcing the user to repeat the same session several times, perhaps fighting again from the beginning with the henchmen, the flying vehicles and then with the boss. Considering that in some cases the latter are two in sequence or at the same time and it is hard to break them down, it is evident that in the long run this proves to be rather frustrating, especially for those who are not very skilled with the type of product in question. At the end of each level you are rewarded with a series of scores calculated taking into account various factors, such as the number of enemies killed, the time taken to finish the area, the amount of ammunition fired or allies killed or managed to cure. Because in each act the player is never alone but always flanked by Burns' marines, as in a real war mission. Moving with a group of soldiers, fighting with them, you always get the feeling that you are participating in a real war action. In this way the identification, corroborated by an absolutely epic cinematographic staging, with lively battles, barrels and explosions, definitely gains. Not to mention that the artificial intelligence that manages the military is by no means limited and therefore really helps the protagonist in many situations. Metropolitan legends To slightly vary the gameplay, the developers then used the classic tricks of the case, inserting sessions aboard magnetic trains, planes and giving users the opportunity to use some fixed locations or to take control of large robots with enormous destructive potential. Too bad for the absence of any multiplayer mode both online and offline. This option would have guaranteed not only a greater variety of contents but also a superior longevity. While other products of the genre make up for it by inserting various new options to be unlocked once the game is over, such as playable characters, objects or scenarios, Vanquish instead limits itself to proposing, in addition to the main single-player campaign, some Tactical Challenges that appear however a sort of Mercenaries mode to Resident Evil 4: dozens of enemies to be killed within a certain time frameor to rack up as many points as possible. But alone, that is, perhaps without the possibility of a cooperative session. Or Missions, that is, where the various areas already played in the main adventure can be faced individually by choice. But then the game lasts only four hours or not? The answer is a clear, unequivocal no. Vanquish isn't very long-lived, it's true, but its overall duration exceeds six/eight at a normal game level based on the user's skill and his habit of the challenges posed by this type of product. Venturing a hypothesis, the misunderstanding about the length of the product probably stems from two factors: having played it at easy difficulty levels and skipping the videos: the internal counter of the game, among other things, only indicates the actual minutes of the game, not total ones. It also excludes the filmed interludes which are also part of a videogame production as a glue for the story and an integral element of the various sessions. The colony Vanquish leverages a respectable graphics engine borrowed and improved by Bayonetta, which is based on the famous Havok development kit for the animations (and physics in general). And the work done by the developers on the final product is worthy of mention. The graphics are very detailed: we are not at the levels of a Gears of War 2 but the aesthetic level of the game is certainly excellent. The main character is stylistically spot on, with his Solid Snake-esque smoking habit, he wears live armor, which varies in real time depending on the events. His fellow adventurers are quite neat and Burns, the colonel of the marines, has something charismatic with his huge mechanical arm. A sign that the character design has actually worked very well. Furthermore, every detail is not left to chance. Play the level where the road beneath your feet shatters and threatens to plunge you into the void while all around is chaos, with enemies shooting at you, marines fleeing and fighting hand to hand even being dragged down with Russian robots, pipes exploding and fragments of all kinds flying at you. In a nutshell, pure entertainment and without the slightest slowdown. Even the enemies, despite their repetitiveness, are well done and in particular the mega robots and the head of the Russian nationalist fanatics are appreciated, whose armor is reminiscent of that of Dingo Egret from Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner. The filmed interludes made with the game engine are excellent and which contribute considerably, as mentioned in a few paragraphs, to further immerse the gamer in the context. The same judgment can be applied to the audio sector. The Italian dubbing is well made even if occasionally a certain asynchrony is perceived between the voices of the actors and the lips of the characters. The sound effects are excellent and full-bodied, especially in the phases in which dozens of marines and monsters collide on the screen in a whirlwind of explosions, bursts of machine guns, screams and radio communications. All accompanied by a soundtrack at times epic and at times more techno-trance but always in keeping with the futuristic environments in which one moves.", "date": "2010-10-22", "grade": "8.5"}
