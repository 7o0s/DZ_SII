Fans in dogfight withdrawal can now find consolation in this Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces, inspired by the anime of the same name by Mamoru Oshii and behind which the Project Aces team is hidden. Let's see if the transition to the Wii and the alignment with an animated film have somehow changed the feeling of a now consolidated gameplay. Out of control (system) The first impact with the Namco Bandai product is certainly not the best: the menus appear extremely poor from a stylistic point of view and not very intuitive to consult, while the tutorials that should teach the user the flight techniques prove to be so long-winded and poorly interactive to be effectively useless. But the real punch in the stomach concerns the control system set by default by the developers, evidently eager to take advantage of the Wii's motion sensor features at all costs, even on condition that their title is essentially unplayable. The solution adopted borders on insanity: by holding the Remote and Nunchuck, one is called to exploit the inclination of the first to manage the speed of the plane, while the movement of the second (we are talking about the entire peripheral, not the analog stick) establishes the direction to follow. Needless to say, the almost total lack of precision of this mode is capable of inducing anyone to abandon it immediately, in favor of a more classic setting fortunately contemplated by the game, albeit as the last variant made available. In this case, Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces returns to being a video game worthy of the name, even if there are substantial differences compared to the Ace Combat series, mainly concerning a considerable simplification of the global gaming experience. Piloting the plane with the analog stick gives a slightly too static feeling, which is fine for newbies but which will make the more savvy users turn up their noses, not related to this sort of flight on rails: a clear indication in this sense lies in the introduction of a series of default evasive maneuvers - which can be selected on the fly and carried out by pressing the dedicated button - which are then performed automatically, freeing the player from the need to engage in immelmann himself , twists and so on. Furthermore, there is an indicator that fills up as you are on the heels of an enemy aircraft, the completion of which allows you to perform (again without any effort) in a particular stunt capable of positioning yourself in perfect shooting condition. In short, all elements that contribute to making the dogfighting of Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces as immediate for newcomers as it is excessively easy and guided for fans of the Ace Combat series, used to a completely different kind of challenge. Not that the Namco Bandai product is not pleasant, but it cannot be excluded that any user with a minimum of flight experience can complete the 18 Story Mode missions in a very short time and not without a few yawns. Play war The influence of the anime that inspired the project is present in the storyline and in the setting that form the backdrop to the game action: the scenario is that of an alternative past (approximately between the 40s and 50s) in which large corporations fight a fake war among themselves, useful only to generate profits and to keep the desires of a real conflict dormant. The protagonist of the plot is Lynx, a recruit of the Cheetah team who will gradually climb the ranks until he becomes captain, in a sequence of events which is actually devoid of major points of interest and which certainly will not remain in the annals. Some pleasant cutscenes intersperse the various missions, but a good part of the story is narrated via radio communications during the fights: not a minute goes by without someone saying something, a fact that would not have a negative relevance if it weren't for the English dubbing really too over the top that characterizes the Namco Bandai production. However, the plot has never represented the spearhead for titles of the genre, and Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces is no exception, to the point that you can easily skip all parts of the storyline and finish the game without being able to say that you have missed much. On the other hand, it goes much better in terms of lud contentici accessories to the real action: the user can rely on a vast range of aircraft, unlockable mission after mission together with upgrades, liveries, secondary weapons and so on, to the delight of customization lovers. On the other hand, the absence of alternative modes or multiplayer takes on an important weight if we consider the substantial brevity of the Story Mode, which would have definitely needed a few more stages. The overview is closed by a graphic sector that is up to the task, but which certainly does not make one cry out for a miracle: if one excludes a particularly inspired aircraft design, Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces can be easily compared to a title in the Ace Combat series for PlayStation 2 from a purely technical point of view, resulting perhaps even slightly lower as regards the definition of the image and the polygonal complexity.", "date": "2010-02-25", "grade": "7.8"}
