{"name": "L'ultima esclusiva?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93082-hard-reset-lultima-esclusiva.html", "text": "In a market characterized by increasingly high production costs, now comparable to those of cinematic blockbusters, the path of multi-platform development has become an understandable rule. However, when people who have worked on titles such as Painkiller, The Witcher and the less brilliant Sniper: Ghost Warrior meet together and decide to create a cyberpunk FPS with classic gameplay and no multiplayer mode, it goes without saying that the rules can also be broken. This is precisely the case of Hard Reset, whose teaser trailer peeked out a few months ago and which from September 14th will be available on Steam at the budget price of $29.99 (but if you make it in time you can still book it and save 10%) . First of all, it is a game with a precise direction, which avoids the latest evolutions (sometimes criticized) of the first person shooter genre in favor of an ~old school~ approach, openly inspired by Serious Sam, with all those objects to detonate and with which to eliminate multiple enemies in one fell swoop. Secondly, despite the ~indie~ nature, which often rhymes with ~limited funds~, Hard Reset features high-level cosmetics, worthy of a triple A production but optimized to run well even on mid-range PCs. In an apocalyptic future, in which the human race is almost extinct and the only survivors live in a city called Bezoar, a former soldier contributes to maintaining order by working for the CLN, an agency that deals with limiting attacks from part of the robots, primarily responsible for the catastrophe. This is Major Fletcher, who has become a mercenary to make ends meet but still possesses the rigor and sense of justice that have characterized his career in the army. A robotic assault puts the CLN on alert and Fletcher is sent on site to check: the bloody trail of corpses left by a group of robotic assassins points straight to a character who was part of his past, but the truth may not run on a single track. explosive situations Hard Reset fully supports the Xbox 360 controller, but it is immediately clear that this is a title to be played with a mouse and keyboard. The original choices made by the Flying Wild Hog guys in fact require a much faster and more reactive aiming ability than that obtainable using the analog sticks, and at the same time the situations in which, instead, the support of the stick could come in handy are rare (platform sections are very rare). The gameplay sees us explore different scenarios with the aim of carrying out the operations that are indicated to us by the headquarters, or to activate switches or eliminate certain enemies, but in principle the action focuses a lot on individual confrontations rather than on what happens along the way. Is there a switch to flip? Well, doing so will most often involve the arrival of a variable number of more or less threatening robots, to be destroyed in order to move to the next area on the map. An indicator (which can be deactivated, if desired) shows us at all times the direction we need to take, even if there are various situations in which we will have to think a little to understand what to do. Difficult to define these ~puzzle~ episodes, an element that is indeed distant from the approach chosen for Hard Reset, but this does not detract from the value of the exploratory phase, which through explosions can reveal hidden areas, earn us some extra items and unlock one of the eighty available achievements . However, the fights remain prevalent in the game's economy, given that they have the advantage of being based on very solid foundations: an excellent feeling of the weapons, the already mentioned presence of many explosive objects within the scenario and an excellent variety of enemies, whose various types are not slammed in our faces immediately, but take turns with a very well-planned progression. We must also add that the ~normal~ difficulty level is already very difficult, and that therefore the clashes at a certain point arise almost like strategic problems to be solved, because after a couple of game overs we will know where the robots come from and we will be able better prepare ourselves to welcome them. The cybernetic army will first offer us small but annoying androids with built-in blades and some of their ~colleagues~ capable of exploding when they approach the target, and then launch the broadside of bigger and more powerful monsters, really complicated to kill, and those equipped with medium and long range weapons, again in different variants. Original choices As mentioned above, Hard Reset adopts a number of measures that make one opt for il control system with mouse and keyboard. The original weapon management in fact sees us alternating a traditional rifle with an energy device, both of which can be upgraded on several fronts by adding extra modules and modified bullets. The points needed to buy these upgrades are obtained by collecting the objects scattered within the maps, so it is always good to scour any corner because most of the time it will be rewarded. The character can also be enhanced, in terms of resistance to attacks and new skills, an operation that is also recommended since very few bursts will be enough for our opponents to put us out of the game. We said that the weapons have an excellent feeling and it is appropriate to reiterate it: the impact sensation is excellent and invites you to try and try the stages again in order to make as much mess as possible, between electrical terminals, explosive barrels and everything that can be blown up and which, depending on the case, can help us in our missions or kill us. An original choice was also made for the management of ammunition: there is no button for reloading the weapon, which indeed has a single magazine, whose rounds are perhaps used in several units at a time for the more powerful modules (grenade launchers , missile launcher). Getting used to this type of setting is not very quick, but a few games are enough to master the controls well and be able to alternate between different shots to eliminate even the largest and most dangerous robots more quickly. On the technical front, as anticipated, the work done by the developers is excellent, worthy of much more famous titles and certainly among the best things that the indie market has been capable of producing so far. There are those who take the longest step by forgetting the fundamentals, and the ~ex~ who formed Flying Wild Hog demonstrate in this case that it's all a question of know-how, of knowing one's abilities and above all one's limits . The proprietary Road Hog Engine is capable of combining power and lightness in a single solution, putting the spectacular graphics of Hard Reset at the service of even mid-range PCs, which can maintain a decent frame rate in most situations. Of course, when the barrels that explode and the enemies that fall apart start to become really many, it is normal to run into some slowdown on the less performing machines. With the test configuration, however, we stuck to 25-30 FPS at a resolution of 1600x900 pixels, with everything maxed out. The sound sector is also good, with excellent effects that make what happens on the screen well. Too bad for the almost total absence of music...", "date": "2011-09-12", "grade": "8.4"}
