The introductory story of this new adventure mentions the facts that really happened, which led to the discovery of the ~Mary Celeste~ on December 4, 1872: a rugantino found completely intact about 600 miles west of the Strait of Gibraltar. The personal effects of the crew, the ship's log and the cargo of the ship itself were still intact ... but all trace of the crew was lost. A quick time jump takes us to 2083 when the first humans landed on the soil of Argilus: a planet of clear alien origins that featured entire cities, houses and artifacts of rare splendor still intact. Too bad that the whole planet was uninhabited. The numerous expeditions of scientists to unravel the mystery of this planet were of no use, indeed, the scientists themselves began to disappear inexplicably one by one. The player will have to impersonate Sam and Hannah: the crew members of the ship ~Angel~ arrived on Argilus for a normal routine mission. The two unfortunates will first find themselves forced to make an emergency landing and then, once they reach the ground, they will have to find a way to reunite and, possibly, be able to unravel the mysteries of this fascinating planet. ... I would like a star that is all mine. The first impact with Schizm is already a big disappointment. The graphic setting is very reminiscent of the titles of the Myst trilogy and from certain points of view it could also be defined as superior. The game scenarios were reproduced using luxurious pre-rendered three-dimensional graphics. The game environment does not offer any solution of continuity (unlike, for example, the now old but always valid Gabriel Knight 3) but is divided into several predefined locations, the movements between one location and another are represented by elegant pre-calculated animations that, at times, give us the feeling of playing a sort of cross between Quake III and Dragons Lair. This means that our movements will be very ~forced~: we will be able to rotate our gaze 360 in every single location but we will not be able to raise or lower our gaze (except in a few predetermined moments) and often we will not even be able to reach certain places which, although visible, will be inaccessible because the designers have decided so. ... I would like a star that is all mine. However, all this ensures us an almost photorealistic graphic rendering, the settings are very varied: we go from dreamlike aerial landscapes to claustrophobic underground tunnels or complicated biotechnological mechanisms. Furthermore, the various graphic screens are not always fixed but sometimes they can give us the gentle movement of the sea or the uncertain fluttering of the drapes in the wind. At this point, speaking of disappointment might seem counterintuitive except to say that, unfortunately, the graphic resolution of the game has been set to an anachronistic 640x480 pixels. Too often in front of our 17'' we should turn a blind eye too many to Pixels as big as a house or movies that recall the Full Motion Video sequences of titles that are at least 2 or 3 years old. In fact, in the pre-development phase the game was designed to be distributed only on DVD support, the developers' forecasts were however too optimistic and today, faced with a diffusion of DVD-ROM players not yet up to par, they found themselves having to ~plan~ all the multimedia content to fit the game on the 5 CD-ROMs of the current version. Good news instead from the audio department: the sound is very clean, the sound effects are really spot on and atmospheric. Furthermore, the Q-Sound system is implemented for the three-dimensional positioning of the sound sources. Really well done. The game is fully dubbed into our native language quite satisfactorily. It's a pity that the interpreters used (defining them as actors would seem excessive to me) during the various films seem to compete, in terms of expressiveness, with the best performances of Lassie and Rex. Extraterrestrial, come and see me ... The game interface isbasic. The definition ~point and click~ has never been more appropriate: in fact, the maximum interaction with the scenario is precisely that of clicking, here and there, on the few ~Hot spots~ granted by the goodness of the programmers. The use of the inventory is almost useless, we will rarely carry any object with us and we could rarely use it in places other than the one designated by the authors. Then forget the ~tree~ management of game dialogues, above all because all the dialogues (it would be better to say monologues but I don't want to spoil too much the discovery of the plot of the game) do not foresee a minimum of interactivity on the part of the player. Anyone who thinks that the game, with such a stripped-down interface, could be simple is blatantly wrong. The game puzzles are in fact monstrously difficult and the game will hardly give you any help. The nature of the problems to be solved is then of the ~puzzle week for the new Einsteins of 2002~ type and will lead us to establish spatial coordinates through abstruse mathematical calculations based on 12 or to have to decipher ideographic symbols born of who knows what alien (as well as sick) mind. To complicate everything we then find the fact that having to command two distinct characters we will also have to find a way to make them collaborate in a fruitful way (in very particular ways among other things ... but even now I don't want to spoil the surprise) ... I want a Planet to start over. ~Too bad~: I repeated this word to myself several times while playing Schizm. Too bad for the waste of such great graphic splendor with such a poor video resolution. Too bad for the splendid game atmosphere undermined by puzzles that more than once will make you bang your head against the wall in desperation. Too bad for the little interaction with the game scenarios and for the little freedom of movement that more than once will pull us out of the game environment and give us the unpleasant feeling of playing a kind of interactive ~Slide Show~. Unfortunately I recommend this title only to expert adventurers, and by experts I don't mean players used to playing this kind of game since Monkey Island, but players who have the patience and desire to try their hand at puzzles that are sometimes really improbable. Trust me: if you want a game to relax in the evening at home, look elsewhere, if instead you want to seriously test your gray matter, however satisfying (albeit with some regret) sight and hearing then you have found the right title for you. Introduction Once it was just the (text) verb and it was preached by Infocom, then Magnetic Scrolls thought it would be good and right to satisfy the sight and created the first graphic/text adventures. It was thanks to a nice lady named Roberta Williams that the world of adventures was able to boast to all effects of the adjective ~graphics~ and finally it was thanks to a very famous acronym (SCUMM: Script Utility for Maniac Mansion) that the graphical interfaces definitively enter the homes of all gamers in the world. In 1994, therefore, Myst was released: a title that managed, at least according to many, to restore the feeling that masterpieces such as the Zork saga had been able to give to millions of fans. Schizm tries to follow in the footsteps of the Cyan title and does so with the help of Terry Dowling, an appreciated Australian science fiction writer.", "date": "2002-02-09", "grade": null}
