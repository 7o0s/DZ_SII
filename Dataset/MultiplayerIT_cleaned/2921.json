Read our review of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 that maybe we convince you to take a look at the past, which is also sometimes incredibly similar to the future. Going back to go forward, isn't that what they say? Our poor fingers, how they hurt. The pads of the thumbs have lost sensitivity, the knuckles of the middle fingers pull like the calves after a marathon and inside they show redness that heralds the appearance of blisters. Everything is exactly as it was in 1999, when we first encountered the game system of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. And the same faithful feeling of deja vu is also very present inside the screen, where the remake of the first two games of the series, this new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2, keeps going spitting out music and sound effects that t' they catch by the crumpled shirt of those who have spent the night with the pad in hand and, bullying, they invite you to another round, another attempt, to aim for an ever higher score. The faux pas Faithful, very faithful this remake. Quite the opposite of what the developer Robomodo did in 2012 with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD, the first attempt to modernize a progenitor who is worth the passion for video games of an entire generation. Graphically it was fine, but to play a real agony with busted animations and a response to commands that made everything slow, tiring and extremely inaccurate. The series had reached its historical and gameplay apex, it no longer had much to say after twenty years or so of successes, but Robomodo is undoubtedly responsible, for a large part, of its sharp decline and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD it was proof. Robomodo - which in any case had a good name, let's grant it at least that - has definitively closed its doors, and this new double remake is entirely the responsibility of the good Vicarious Visions. Perfect job The result, as anticipated, is close to perfection. What little has changed was done to give the two games a stylistic and gameplay parity, for example by adding the manuals to the first chapter, which Neversoft didn't have time to insert and implemented only from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 onwards. The rest is a real journey through time, where even the sound effects follow in a surprising way those that could be heard while playing connected to the standard Mivar (for the younger ones, it is an old TV brand that is very fashionable popular at the time). Even the graphics, despite the high definition, the new textures, the more convincing lighting, don't differ much, at least in terms of feeling, with the two classics released at the turn of the millennium. Vicarious Vision had already done an incredible job with Crash Bandicoot's N. Sane Trilogy, reconstructing a large part of the code with absolute verisimilitude, and here we are on the same formidable levels. Although in this case it was not necessary to reprogram part of the game from scratch, the timing required, and to be replicated, to make a product like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater work properly is certainly very difficult to reproduce, perhaps more difficult than restarting the stiff leaps of the beast Naughty Dog. open world? No thank you Having ascertained the excellent work done, the biggest doubt needs to be dispelled: are Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and its sequel still fun games? Twenty-one years have passed, a huge amount, and we're still talking about games built around a generation of consoles that struggled to respect the perspective of polygons, a generation of consoles that actually represents the prehistory of three-dimensional graphics. The answer is a big, fat, bright, glittery yes. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is the confirmation that a good concept never gets old, and often a little oil in the wheels is enough to make the animations smoother and the frame rate more constant and modern, to totally restore its undisputed charm. We already told you that our fingers hurt us, right? It happens because today as then it is impossible to stop, because you want to improve, beat that score, reach that ceiling, ring the longest combo possible and maybe even longer than they say is possible. It is also interesting to discover in the more concise formula of these two games, before the open world took hold, one of its most convincing aspects. You don't have to wander around for hours, you can't get lost: here you have a more or less high level and you have to give your best. Popular wisdom This does not mean that there is no exploration: each setting has its secrets (some borrowed from the originals, others totally new), and it will be necessary to get to know them thoroughly to complete all the challenges present. To bringat 100% every single stage we will have to reach three different types of scores, find all the letters that make up the word SKATE, locate some characteristic elements which does not automatically mean knowing how to reach them; the iconic level of the school, present in the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, requires for example to grind on five tables and five bells scattered around, as well as finding five books, it also presents more classic challenges such as performing a certain trick over a precise gap . In each level there are also one or more counters which, once reached, will allow us to improve the different skills of our skater, which will make it more interesting to go back to the old levels where we still could not pass certain scores. Because the heart of everything in the end is to beat the three proposed records within the three minutes allowed, and to do so it will be necessary to understand where and how to increase the special bar, and then understand where and how to perform the more complex tricks to which the same bar, once active, it will give us access. Psychologically this structure unconsciously leads players to want, more than anything else, the perfect run, and consequently to the unhealthy but also disgustingly pleasant practice of forced retry: if you miss the first three tricks, you will want to start over, every single time, even if you are a bloody bonze who until the day before yesterday was in meditation on the bloody Himalayas. After all, it is impossible to forget the words of that friend, a Roman like the writer, who in 1999, trying Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for the first time, exclaimed aloud: ~but this game eats your head!~. Folk wisdom... Two games in one The package offered by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2, which includes two complete games, is one of the rich ones. The first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater includes nine levels of varying size, some slightly different in structure: the Mall unfolds for example like a sort of downhill, and when you reach the end you will be teleported all over again until the time runs out. then there is Skate Park where we will be called to challenge our scores with six other famous skaters. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 of levels instead offers one less (there are in fact eight) but decidedly richer in surprises and capable of stealing much more time to be exploited to the maximum. Choosing the Ranked & Free mode it is possible to explore all the settings present in a free way, useful for getting carried away, and visiting the skate parks created with the appropriate editor by ourselves or by other players. There are also several multiplayer modes, online and offline, including the classic ones that made us so entertained at the time, such as Combo Mambo, Graffiti and the Hanged Man. To make everything more personal, an excellent editor has also been included with which to create our dream skater, dressing and sprucing him up according to our tastes and choosing from the rich offer of sweatshirts, shirts, t-shirts, shoes and of course skate decks. wheels and trucks. Finally there is the soundtrack, which in addition to showing off many of the pearls present in the original games, adds and changes very little and at the same time very well.", "date": "2020-09-03", "grade": "9.0"}
