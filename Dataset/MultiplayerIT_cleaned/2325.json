{"name": "Maquette", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maquette-recensione.html", "text": "In March 2021 it arrived on the PlayStation Plus Maquette (precisely in the PS5 version), a game published by Annapurna Interactive (publisher of Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, The Pathless...). Maquette is also the debut work of the Graceful Decay team. Let's find out together in our review of Maquette if the start of this study has been positive. Maquettes | Review Maquette: That key is very small in a recursive world Maquette is presented in a very intriguing way. It is in fact a recursive first-person puzzle game, that is, it is set in a world that has smaller versions of itself within it. By interacting with one of the dimensions, we also influence the others. An easy example is the use of objects: for example, if a huge cube blocks our way, we can use the world's smallest version (which from our point of view is basically a model) to move that same cube that appears hour minute. Even in the world of our dimension the huge cube will have moved and we will be able to continue. The focus of the game is therefore the interaction between dimensions. We'll have to figure out how to move an object from one place to another using its small or large versions, also bringing a certain object in and out of the various dimensions to change its size and adapt it to our needs. Maquette, however, is not a pure puzzle game, both for its approach to storytelling - which we will see shortly - and for the structure of its puzzles. In fact, you shouldn't expect a Portal-style game: we won't be faced with a series of rooms with increasingly structured puzzles that offer new rules and new tools that add up and create more complex puzzles. Maquette plays with its initial idea and proposes it in a slightly different way from section to section, without evolving it too much. Maquette: big or small, that bridge will get us across Let's be clear, the lack of ~evolution~ in the rules underlying Maquette's puzzles does not cause boredom. Each new interaction asks us to do something different: unfortunately the consequence is that the user is not always accompanied towards the solution, but must understand it independently. The new mechanic is then quickly discarded to make room for something slightly different: good for the variety, a little less so for those used to playing more ~logical~ puzzle games like The Witness. In fact, in a couple of situations we were stuck for several minutes unable to understand how to advance, since Maquette had not suggested the new solution explicitly enough. Fortunately, if you play the PS5 version of Maquette and are a PS Plus subscriber, you have access to the Game Help functions that indicate the solution to the exact point where we are with videos and written tips (in English). However, we point out that in some situations there is the risk of blocking progress: on a couple of occasions it was the fault of bugs (which do not always appear and may already have been resolved by some patches released after this review was written), while in others we found a way to ~break~ the game - in one case we locked a key behind a door locked by that same key and in another we entered a place in an unexpected way and Maquette ~trapped~ us. In such situations the only way to solve it is to start over with the level: fortunately once you know what to do it is possible to repeat all the steps in literally three minutes. Maquette is in fact very short: we completed the game in just over three hours but there are trophies that ask you to complete the levels in a maximum total time of 38 minutes and zero seconds. The remaining trophies ask you to then complete some particular interactions with the game world. Maquette therefore proposes a fairly simple and quick Platinum. Remaining on the PS5 theme (subject version of this review), we also point out that Maquette uses both haptic feedback and DualSense adaptive triggers but in a minimal way and the impact on the experience is almost nil. A story of images and sounds Maquette is visually striking As mentioned, however, Maquette is not a pure puzzle game. Graceful Decay has created a hybrid work between puzzle game and narrative adventure in the style of What Remains of Edith Finch. We see it right from the opening: the first area that acts as a tutorial has almost exclusively a narrative purpose and introduces us to the two characters around whom the whole adventure revolves, a man and a woman who, after a chance encounter, begin a romantic relationship . In the course of the game we will find out what happened to him. The main themes are love, healing and the value of memories: we won't go further to avoid spoilers, but we can say that Maquette has optedor for a simple story, but no less effective. As you progress through the game areas, between one puzzle and another, writings (in English, with Italian subtitles) will appear on the screen, telling a fragment of their story. Furthermore, from time to time there will be short films that will tell the key moments: the real power of these scenes lies in the very high quality dubbing. The various scenes are then illustrated with the drawings that the two characters make during their relationship: in fact, the two share a passion for painting. Each image will create a symbolism that we will learn to know and decipher: the care in the graphic presentation helps the involvement enormously. Even the environments and objects with which we interact symbolize the story of the two, making every single element of the game a fundamental part of the narrative. Still speaking of the graphics, it is impossible not to comment on the effect that the recursive world has on the player. The experience can vary from person to person, probably, but in our case we were positively stunned to find ourselves in a world that contains itself. Moving from one dimension to another and feeling like giants and moments later like ants is alienating and unique. Finally, we have to applaud Graceful Decay for the musical side as well. Various sections of the game are accompanied by songs such as San Franciscan Nights, Tidal Waves, There Are No Words for You and Meridian (to name a few). These help enormously to give strength to various exploration sections. Overall, the graphic and sound presentation of the game is excellent, although on a purely technical level Maquette is an unpretentious indie game.", "date": "2021-03-04", "grade": "7.8"}
