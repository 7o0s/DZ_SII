I like appearing in video games Magrunner: Dark Pulse is a first-person puzzle game that draws heavily on the Portal formula. Before talking about the narrative side, it is worth examining its magnetism-based gameplay. The protagonist, Dax Ward, a competitor in a kind of contest to get a prestigious job, holds a rifle capable of giving objects a positive or negative magnetic charge. As in reality (is it?), objects with the same charge attract each other, while those with different charges repel each other. From these simple principles, which you should all know (subtle irony in the editor who tries to make you understand his squalid irony at all costs), a series of ingenious puzzles are born. Let's take the most trivial one possible as an example: by superimposing two metal cubes and climbing them on top, it is possible to give them opposite charges to use the one at the top as an elevator to reach an otherwise precluded elevated platform. Another case, a little more complicated: given two platforms, one connected to a tractor beam and the other not, it is possible to charge them in such a way that the magnetic field of one drags the other (each charge has its own area of action, displayed by pressing a key). The more objects you make interact with each other, the more powerful the repel or pull effects will be. Some puzzles are ingenious For example, two cubes with the same charge will push a third cube with a different charge more strongly than one, causing it to fly higher or further. In short, as was the case in the Portals, a very simple idea was chosen, which however allowed the developers to create puzzles of ever increasing difficulty, even going so far as to propose extremely bizarre situations in the end. Don't worry, because entry into the game is very gradual, with the first nine levels serving as a long tutorial to understand how the mechanics work to be exploited to overcome the various difficulties. In reality, going forward in the maps, new gameplay elements will be added which will complicate the situation a bit. But at this point we imagine that some of you have already wondered for more than a few lines what good Cthulhu has to do with what appears to be a science fiction title... Will Magrunner: Dark Pulse have managed to mix science fiction and Cthulhu? Let's find out Cthulhu to whom? As we said a few times later, in Magrunner: Dark Pulse they take on the role of a certain Dax Ward, a candidate to win a prestigious job for the most powerful company on the planet that would lead him to explore space. To do this, our hero must pass some tests related to magnetism, the ones we talked about above, trying to bear the dislike of his superiors and to follow the advice of a hacker friend of his. All seems to be going well, with the various characters appearing to Dax in the form of holograms and he doing better than expected by the company's executives, but at some point the tentacled good god arrives and transforms the sci-fi atmosphere into pure horror, with the aseptic and two-tone environments of the base that are deboned giving way to pleasant dungeons where the monsters of the Lovecraftian imagination are the masters. Our planet is in danger of being a victim of bad writing. We have to save it And here we come to a crux of the matter, which allows us to understand how important the plot is in a modern video game and how much, for example, good writing has made the fortune of a title like Portal. Probably the horror twist of Magrunner: Dark Pulse must have seemed like a great way to make the game more original, in an attempt to forget the influence of the Valve title. The problem is that it doesn't work and, although the plot takes itself bloody seriously, it's really hard not to laugh at such absurdities. Sure, there are some scary moments, but it's really hard to forget that you're in a puzzle game and not a survival one, despite doing everything possible to overlap the two genres. For example, it remains a mystery why, despite the space base in which we operate has been practically gutted, the magnetic puzzle devices have remained active. So we find ourselves solving complicated puzzles based on magnetism while around us the irrational of a universe that seems to have passed by chance, just to form an unsuccessful amalgam. Looking for balance As already mentioned, as the game progresses, the puzzles multiply and require more and more time to be overcome, to the point of completely breaking any possibility of identification with the narrative. We even go so far as to consider the horr sideor as a nuisance to overcome and would almost want to ask for a patch that removes narration entirely. It is here that we understand once again that the greatness of Portal (and Portal 2) was not only in the puzzle solving mechanics, however ingenious, but in the ability of the writers to transform an aseptic gaming experience into a masterpiece narrative capable of surprising with every gimmick. These cubes don't keep company, sadly Even there, not everything had a definite logic (and in a fictional universe it's not even necessary for everything to have it, in reality, otherwise it would cease to exist as such and would become reality), but in Portal the set of elements was linked in masterly manner and never lost track of what was happening. In Magrunner: Dark Pulse this is not the case and the complete lack of irony, the only weapon capable of giving meaning to a plot so disjointed in its key elements, ends up penalizing the player who is repeatedly faced with a terrible feeling that brings him thinking about whether or not to switch to another video game. It would have been enough to follow the source of inspiration to the end, i.e. also picking up its tones, and read the arrival of the forces of darkness in a 'deliberately' comic key, to avoid finding an 'involuntarily' comic product in your hands that manages to justify what happens on the screen. In such a context, the excellent work done on the graphics, derivative but well done, with some really excellent moments, is of little use. Never as in this case is the statement true that a video game is given by the set of characteristics that compose it and a few well-implemented ideas are not enough to create an excellent title. However, don't get us wrong, because we are still dealing with a playfully well-made product. Just play it as a mere puzzle sequence instead of as if it also claims to tell you an exciting story.", "date": "2013-06-28", "grade": "6.7"}
