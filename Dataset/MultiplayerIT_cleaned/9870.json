Age of Zombies, also available for PlayStation Portable, is just that, a ~cheerful~ top-down platform-shooter, along the lines of low-key masterpieces of the past of the caliber of KiKi Kaikai (Knight Boy, although there is no 'were firearms), Chaos Engine and above all, for the themes, Zombie hate my neighbors. Everything in this product developed by Halfbrick Studios is characterized by a very cute and crazy cartoon style, starting from the plot. The insane Professor Brain has decided to alter the order of things on our planet by manipulating its history by sending it to five different time periods (Prehistory, 1930s Chicago, Ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs, Feudal Japan and the future) of undead hordes for the purpose. The player in the role of the heroic Barry Steakfries has the task of restoring the natural course of events and saving the attacked populations. Dear old ~blast~ The gameplay of Age of Zombies is the most elementary that can exist: the character is moved by the user up and down the map and the primary purpose of the game is to eliminate all forms of life, so to speak given the type of enemies that move on the screen, using both the main weapon used by Barry and all those that the latter will find around the areas where he will have to roam as well as to make a clean sweep, precisely to recover flame spears, heavy machine guns, rifles and explosive devices. The latter are perhaps the most useful element to free the ground from the high number of opponents who en masse rush on the protagonist. By attracting dozens of walking corpses to certain points it is possible, also taking advantage of the natural or artificial conformation of the scenario (a bridge, a corridor of rocks, etc), to blow them up and in groups. Also because not only is the number of zombies on the screen always very high, but each historical period presents a different series of undead warriors, each of which boasts its own attack characteristics such as the zombie ninjas who throw their shurikens or those in gangster version who they shoot, and therefore are more difficult to deal with. In case you are overwhelmed by hordes of opponents or hit our friendly protagonist does not die immediately but as happens in some modern shooters, the screen tends to turn red. To restore vital energy, therefore, there is no need for potions or derivatives, but a careful analysis of Barry's health conditions, which must be removed as a precaution from the hordes of ravenous undead in order to try to avoid contact while waiting to regain strength. Cartoony However, this often turns out to be more difficult than one might imagine, given that sometimes the opponents are really too many and above all they swoop in from all sides forcing the player to sacrifice a life. For the rest, there isn't much else to report since the product doesn't offer trophies or anything else important to unlock or obtain. We therefore conclude our analysis of the game by talking about the technical sector: graphically Age of Zombies presents an excellent level of detail for a 2D game, with very large and well-kept sprites, colorful scenarios and an overall view that is beautiful to look at. The cartoonish characterization of the various undead, their differentiation from an aesthetic point of view help to better appreciate the title developed by Halfbrick Studios, especially for those slightly gore little goodies. Same goes for the audio part: normal effects, fine, but hearing the zombies scream ~braaains!~ in various shades depending on the case as they run towards the unfortunate Barry who shoots desperately is really fun.", "date": "2010-08-02", "grade": "7.0"}
