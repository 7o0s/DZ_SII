{"name": "Rayman Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-advance-2.html", "text": "Frequent tasks in the virtual universe The presentation, which introduces us to the adventure, informs us about the unpleasant events that have hit the lush valley where Rayman lives. An evil wizard, such Mr. Dark, has stolen the Great Protoon, source of energy and balance of the planet, throwing discouragement and chaos among its inhabitants. Our task will be to free the Electoons, small beings lost and imprisoned by Mister Dark, who are needed to restore the power of the Great Protoon. Thus begins our ~rescue expedition~ which will engage us for a total of 62 levels, variously redistributed within the areas which in turn divide the 6 worlds of Rayman's wacky planet. See how it glitters, feel how it sparkles What is immediately striking is the majestic graphics of the game. Excellently made, colorful and varied backdrops, fluid and well thought-out animations, even very large sprites, make Rayman Advance one of the most graphically impressive titles for the GBA, which already comes at the launch of the console. However, it should be noted that in some moments of the game, when the action becomes very fast and numerous sprites move on the screen, slowdowns occur which, while not affecting playability, slightly undermine the high technical quality of the title. Furthermore, the general darkness that pervades the Game Boy Advance LCD screen prevents the player from fully enjoying the graphical magnificence of the game. Regarding the sound, it is correct to say that the music and effects are very good and varied, sometimes you can even hear sampled voices (or rather verses). Each world has its own musical theme that goes well with the setting of the same, moreover, the dynamic adaptation of the music is effective in underlining the pace of the action and the key moments of the levels. The effects are also well done and any animation (or almost) is associated with one, contributing together with the music to create an engaging sound image. Too bad that, due to the reduced audio capabilities of the console, especially the music sounds too metallic and overall a certain distortion of the highs is perceptible; probably, these defects are mainly due to the compression imposed by the cartridge format, in fact even with headphones these disturbances are clearly perceptible. A brave eggplant At this point we need a brief description of the playful approach to the title. Despite being a limbless aubergine, Rayman has many faculties of movement, in fact, to achieve his goal he needs many different powers, which (apart from the punch) are not available from the beginning, but are granted to him, one at a time, by the sorceress Betilla (benefactress of the moment) or by other characters that our hero meets during the adventure. Since certain areas of the levels, where there are Electoons to be freed, are not accessible until you have the necessary power to reach them, we are encouraged (forced) to replay them several times if we want to complete the game 100%, freeing all the cute little creatures. In each area a maximum of six are imprisoned and their number for each level is highly variable. The levels are of varying length and difficulty, at the beginning they have a rather linear setting following the classic scheme for which they are completed by moving from the left to the right of the screen. However, as the game progresses, these also take on a vertical development and in some cases they are twisted and fraught with dangers, so as to greatly disorient the player. In principle, the level of difficulty rises rather progressively, allowing for few push-ups. The controls are very simple and depending on the context A, B and R can have different functions assigned (the above powers). The movements of the aubergine commanded by us (ie Rayman) are excellently managed by the directional cross, in fact we will hardly lose a life due to our inexperience in jumping a cliff, it will rarely be necessary to calibrate the leaps to the millimeter. Therefore the playability and the resulting pleasure are very high. We are fruit In conclusion Rayman Advance is a technically very, very good product, extremely playable and pleasant to see and listen to, but unfortunately not original or innovative. The high number of levels, their relative re-playability, the degree of difficulty that can reach considerable heights of infamy later in the game, manage to raisestrongly affect the longevity of the title. The purchase is strongly recommended to sympathizers of the protagonist, to the diehards of platformers and to the nostalgic, however not recommended for the little ones. Pros: Excellent graphics Very good sound High gameplay Cons: Nothing innovative to offer Sometimes frustrating The Rayman is back! Rayman Advance is none other than the perfect GBA conversion of that Rayman released in the mid-90s (again by Ubisoft) for the PC market. For those unfamiliar with it, the game belongs to the large group of 2d platformers, a genre that will undoubtedly also have a massive presence on the new Nintendo laptop. 9", "date": "2001-06-27", "grade": null}
