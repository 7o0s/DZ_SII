We could frame it in these few words the story of the long hack and slash saga of Dynasty Warriors which for better or for worse has carved out its honorable space in the last few years of videogame history, embracing numerous platforms and thickening its genealogy also with numerous spin- off (remember, for example, the crossover with the Gundam science fiction universe). Having reached the seventh episode of the main series, the developers have gone to be inspired directly by one of the Four great classic novels of Chinese literature: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms written by Luo Guanzhong. Drawing from these pages, the story of a China still divided and exhausted by conflicts is described: the ideal context for staging the numerous battles offered by the title published by Koei. The basis on which the new Dynasty Warriors rests is therefore solid and full of content ideas, which can represent an excellent opportunity to revive a saga that has suffered a heavy decline in quality in recent episodes. Three kingdoms, plus one Set during the era of the three kingdoms, Wei, Shu, Wu, to which the fourth Jin faction is added, once again we are called to experience firsthand the battles that forged the future great Chinese nation by embodying numerous heroes who recall the characteristics of their counterpart from Far Eastern legends. In Story mode, once you have chosen your faction, you go to face the battles following a rather articulated narrative thread, enough to give space to all the heroes of each army. Each of these characters has peculiar battle characteristics starting from the movements and favorite weapons which, if equipped, make the most of the character's war capabilities, while the tools with which there is a lesser feeling end up clumsily limiting the offensive potential of our avatars. It is also possible to associate seals with these weapons which help to improve the parameters or attack capabilities according to the player's tastes. In addition to the differentiation of the numerous weapons, the development of the hero is also given by a tree of skills (actually rather poor) that can be unlocked as points are accumulated by massacring enemies. These skills can directly affect the character's stats, or provide other types of bonuses such as new moves and combos that can be performed. The dimension of growth of the character actually ends here since it is not the core of the gameplay of the Dynasty Warrior series, so on balance it is much more important a careful choice of weapons to equip and related upgrades rather than the true warrior skills. The Story mode in its entirety, i.e. including all four available campaigns, offers dozens and dozens of missions, which, while not shining for heterogeneity, still provide a large number of hours of gameplay even if the specter of boredom, given the continuous repetition of situations and objectives substantially similar to each other, it always hides around the corner for the player who least lets himself be carried away by the events narrated. After all, even the almost telenovela structure of the intertwining of the protagonists' destinies does not help to follow the development of the story with participation. More detached from the narrative of the book from which the developers took their cue is the Conquest mode, where always by impersonating a hero of our choice (among those previously unlocked during the normal campaign) you have the opportunity to carry on the conquest of the entire territory which for the occasion is divided into numerous boxes, each of which represents a battle or a city. In this mode, the advance of the protagonist hero is at the discretion of the player who, just like in the famous board game Risk, can choose to face any battle as long as he is present in a box adjacent to one we have already conquered, pursuing the goal last of the domination of the entire nation. In this type of game, it also becomes essential to establish solid relationships of loyalty with the other heroes who gradually join our army, the stronger their bond with our leadership and the better their performance in battle alongside us. The Omega Force wanted to give maximum freedom to the player who begins the conquest adventure by making it possible to change the hero at any time while maintaining the already accumulated conquests. In favor of this also all ot skills, weapons and sealskept remain in common between all the characters, as indeed also happens in the story mode. By offering total sharing of progress regardless of the type of hero chosen, it is possible to vary the protagonist according to our tastes during the long road to conquest, while playing a campaign effectively increases the value of all the prominent members of the army although the story tells us which character to use in each mission, who will inherit the baggage of skills and weapons obtained up to that moment. Nothing new on the Eastern front The evolution, never so necessary as in the case of this saga, is still limited only to the historical / narrative sector which, while not shining for particular quality, at least tries to renew itself with each chapter. The game action on the battlefield, the true beating heart of every self-respecting hack and slash, is reconfirmed as still anchored to the canons dictated by the previous chapters, inheriting the peculiar characteristics that have attracted the fans but also the historical defects that have been for too long plague this play structure. The unfolding of the clashes proceeds following the overused philosophy of ~kill everything that moves~; as per tradition, our hero proves to be enormously superior to his opponents on the battlefield, thus determining a completely unbalanced balance of power in favor of the protagonist. At our side we will have entire infantry divisions that have the role of simple extras, forget any help from them in battle, not that you feel the concrete need but seeing dozens of our comrades surround a single enemy infantryman without attacking him ruins the atmosphere of the fight. On the opposing side the only elements that represent an obstacle to victory are the enemy heroes, some of which are particularly tough while on most of the others it is necessary to linger a few more moments with a bit of frantic button smashing to see them go down without sweat none of the proverbial seven shirts. With this type of balance each mission, once familiar with the characteristics of the hero we are called to play, ends up becoming little more than a formality and the risk of being defeated appears ever more distant: the only obstacles towards a predictable victory they can be the fall of some of our heroic companions that we are called to defend who often demonstrate that they are unable to look after themselves forcing themselves to come to their aid by hastily crossing the playing area. Xbox 360 goals Seventh Dynasty Warriors' 50 objectives are spread evenly between Story and Conquest modes. It is necessary to complete all the campaigns of the kingdoms, conquer the entire Chinese territory and mass trust with all the unique warriors that we will meet. The other few remaining points are contextualized to different actions in battle, such as replenishing 100 times of healing items or defeating certain enemies. Deus ex warrior The omnipotence of the player during the clashes also ends up mortifying the combat system, as no search for tactics in battle is absolutely necessary. By wildly chaining the two available attacks, the normal one and the brutal one, we will have the best of hundreds of enemies without problems; to these is added the special EX move available with a specific type of weapon for each character and exploitable through an elementary combo. In the most agitated situations and once the appropriate bar has been filled by scything enemies, a musou attack can be carried out capable of routing entire divisions or, more usefully, of inflicting serious damage even on the most tenacious enemy heroes. During the clashes it is possible to collect objects that can permanently or temporarily increase the statistics of our character or heal our vital energy, while managing to defeat particular opponents in a short time we will be able to obtain the weapon supplied. Although limited and simplistic, the combat system in its mechanics does not appear deficient, however it is the scarce (non-existent?) enemy artificial intelligence that does not push the player at all to implement a prudent fighting style or to search for complex combos, the only moments of difficulties are given by a camera that always struggles to follow the action often leaving our main opponent off the field, situations that become frustrating against those heroes capable of inflicting severe damage on us. The technical sector has to make obvious compromises with the large number of units on screen but also from this point of view we realize that a lI work more refined in highlighting the differences of the various units and in the case of the main characters who do not shine in their realization and who even appear ridiculous in their awkwardness during the cutscenes. The animations suffer from some issues bonding between attacks sometimes disrupting what should be a harmonious dance of swords and spears. The battlefields all boast a modest extension, functional to the advances of the armies, but a greater characterization to make the surrounding environment more alive would certainly not have hurt, as well as a greater differentiation of the areas that often appear as a photocopy of the other both in the architecture of the structures and in the geography of the land. To accompany the action a soundtrack composed of rock songs with guitars clearly inspired by heavy metal; however, the tracks sound too short for the length of the missions so that their repetition soon makes them repetitive and not very evocative. In the game there is an exhaustive encyclopedic section where the events and protagonists of the complex narrative plot of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms are described exhaustively through numerous entries and even a timeline. From this point of view, the developers' commitment to making the narration of events, in itself anything but easy, as usable as possible for a Western audience is undeniable.", "date": "2011-05-11", "grade": "5.6"}
