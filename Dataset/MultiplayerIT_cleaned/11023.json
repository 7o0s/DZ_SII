{"name": "Wild Earth: African Safari - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-earth-african-safari-recensione.html", "text": "You are in the very famous Serengeti natural park. The rain falls copious from the sky, lightning illuminates the prairies and hyenas are hunting wildebeest. While a zebra peacefully grazes in the dry grass, an elephant uproots a tree and a hippopotamus gets his teeth cleaned by a bird, we realize astonished that, silently, an enormous lion is devouring the meat soup that was previously cooking on the fire  How beautiful Africa is! There are two crocodiles... Who doesn't know Quark, SuperQuark, Northwest Passage or any of the programs hosted by the very dynamic Angela Family? Whether the lively Piero or the plastered Alberto is in front of the cameras, the gist does not change: a good part of the broadcast is filled with a more or less interesting naturalistic documentary. This in the vast majority of cases is set in Africa and more specifically in the aforementioned Serengeti park. It goes without saying, therefore, that by now everyone, after twenty years of bombardment, knows better how a pride of African lions lives rather than a flock of sheep or a herd of local cows Obviously the charm of the exotic, and a certain return to the primordial, make gazelles and vultures more interesting, and it is precisely on this fascination that we want to build this game. Shouldn't it be fun to make one of those documentaries? Standing silent against the wind and witnessing the migration of the wildebeests, the powerful assault of the crocodiles near the ford, the lionesses sinking their fangs into an old, now tired gazelle? All, of course, continuing to take photos expertly guided by two attentive and educated guides - no, they are not Piero and Alberto! - ready to explain in detail the why and the how of certain behaviors that have been repeated for thousands of years. Shouldn't it be fun to make one of those documentaries? ... and an orangutan... In addition to being playful therefore Wild Earth, African Safari also has an evident didactic character, wanting to partially replace, or at least make an alternative to, the traditional film. So here we are armed with a camera and perfectly free to move along the huge ~levels~ that form alpine peaks, grasslands, hills, forests, craters of extinct volcanoes and lakes and rivers. In each of these we have several moments to document and collect by immortalizing them on film. After the guided trip, an article is written that explains the photos we took and provides further information on the magical African world. At the end of each of the eleven environments, a mini-game is unlocked that takes advantage of the well-known characteristics of the Wii controls. These exploit the animals and settings discovered during the safari and range from flying a Condor in some rings by flapping its ~wings~ to having to wash a herd of animals with water sprayed from an elephant's trunk. The photos that we consider most beautiful can be saved in a special album that we can look at at any time. You can also face a cooperative mode where each player can take a photo of the same action so that they can then compare the result and decide who is the best photographer. What is completely missing in the game is the challenge component. In fact, no judgment, comment or note on our actions is indicated and the only indicator on the screen to keep an eye on is that of our ~environmental impact~. This bar, which runs from green to red, indicates how much we are disturbing local wildlife. If we get too close to a wildebeest, in addition to the remote control vibrating and a flashy red arrow appearing on the screen, the bar moves towards red and when it is filled, the mission must be restarted. ...two small snakes... If the premises can be attractive and perhaps can suggest a pleasant diversion, unfortunately the title collides with a realization and a series of defects that seriously undermine its use. First of all we always find ourselves with an excessively slow pace that never allows the viewer to be captivated. What happens on the screen is too little to be able to entertain in the role of observers alone. Furthermore, everything is too guided, the objectives to be achieved are marked on the screen a moment before the facts happen and this only further eliminates the surprise effect. The typical sequence is warthog fighting and you see one warthog approaching another and they start fighting, photo, warthog backing off and you see the warthog running away, photo, and so on. Secondary goals are just as driven. In a huge and theoretically freely explorable environment, one finds himself necessarily having to follow a predetermined path ad even called by a useful, but intrusive, direction indicator for the next event. All this would be mitigated if we were presented with a world pulsating with life and full of details. Unfortunately, however, this is not quite the case. Most of the time you have the impression of being in front of a Nintendo 64 at 16/9 in 480p! Just enough textures, polygonal constructions reduced to a minimum and an approximate realization of animals and plants are not a nice incentive to move forward. The grass that appears a few centimeters from the nose, environments with very few polygons and poor and sometimes even ridiculous animations complete the work. The minigames aren't any better, on the contrary they are the most boring and badly done you can see. The cute ~Afro new-age~ music is saved, unfortunately accompanied by ridiculous sound effects and by a speech from an ~English lesson~ toneless and devoid of bite. Comment It's really a pity that an intriguing idea full of potential has been realized in such an approximate way and with little bite. More often than not, instead of being the protagonists and creators of a photographic documentary, we find ourselves bored spectators of events that have already been seen, much better, dozens of times. The lack of challenge in this context takes over and definitively sinks the game. The technical implementation certainly does not help being somewhat approximate. The only positive aspect that this title could have is that of being able to make African nature more interesting for the little ones through a video game, but are we really convinced that it is not enough to follow them while the programs mentioned at the beginning of the article are on the air? Pro Accurate and serious in the didactic part Relaxing Very large environments Cons General technical realization Too poor in actions and details Ugly mini-games", "date": "2008-11-25", "grade": null}
