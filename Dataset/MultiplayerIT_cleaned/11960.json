{"name": "FIFA 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-08-recensione.html", "text": "It's incredible how football, the most popular sport in the world, is videogame monopolized almost exclusively by only two houses, Konami and Electronic Arts, unlike other considerably more inflated genres. At the same time, the scepter as the best football simulation has always gone to the Japanese house, with its own saga which has always proved to be the point of reference for all the most intransigent fans. For some time, however, the Vancouver studios have decided to abandon the path of more slavish imitation, and thanks to this move they seem to have recovered part of the gap: do you think we had fun with Fifa 08? Melius abundare quam deficere As before, more than before. The numbers of Fifa, which has always been the main workhorse of the series, are bigger and bigger every year, and able to satisfy the tastes of all players. In Fifa 08 it is possible to take part in 30 championships, for a total of 620 teams and 15,000 players, all (or almost) with official licences. Any inaccuracies or transfers shouldn't alarm perfectionists, given that a broadband connection is enough to update the players' squads and looks, checked practically on every connection. Melius abundare quam deficere Equally conspicuous, as usual, are the modalities: in addition to the more obvious ones, such as friendlies, championships, and customized tournaments, the new ~To be a pro~ makes its debut, in which you take direct control of a single player . According to what was declared by EA, thanks to it we have the possibility to train in view of Fifa World Cup 2010, in which 10 against 10 online matches will debut! Utopian or not, the mode has some interesting ideas: real football players will certainly benefit, as they can enjoy movements and tricks typical only of those who have stepped onto a real playing field, but even newbies have the opportunity to earn good evaluations, thanks to some aids (such as the arrow that indicates the position to hold, or the red circle that marks the man to be marked) that can be inserted in case of need. Your report card rises based on the completion of shots or passes that have brought some danger to your opponents, or on closures and marking doubles if you choose to impersonate a defender. The control of the rest of the team is entrusted to the AI, even if there is the possibility of orchestrating the action of your dreams in the best possible way: for example, by pressing the pass button it is possible to call the ball from your teammate, and so on . Everything is pleasant and functional, thanks also to the view from behind the shoulders which offers ample visibility of the pitch. However, a greater depth would certainly have been welcome: the mode in fact gives the possibility of facing only a friendly match, and not, as would have been more logical, an entire championship. Once the evaluation has been obtained, it is possible to spend the points earned in the game's virtual shop, from which new balls, special types of celebrations and the third jerseys of the greatest teams in the world can be bought. Show football and realistic! The real sense of satisfaction arises once you get on the pitch. After having selected and deployed the favorite team (in this regard, the ~harmony~ factor that rises if the most charismatic players are put on the field is interesting), we are faced with a really very interesting playability. The difficulties encountered in creating networking chances are not in fact to be attributed to an ineffective control system, but to the perfect alchemy between video game and realism. To get the better of the excellent opposing defenses, it is therefore necessary to set up highly maneuvered actions: only with a dense network of passes, and some sudden changes of play, is it possible to put your center forward face to face with the goalkeeper. The mapping of the commands is practically perfect, with different choices for shooting and passing, keys dedicated to entering players, triangulating and dribbling (forget to do them only with the left analog). The artificial intelligence of the opposing players is also excellent, which cover the spaces much better and force the player to choose the most difficult solution to try to get to the penalty area. The level of challenge is further exacerbated if you decide to set all the controls in manual mode: the experience becomes even more simulative, and even the most innocuous disengagement can become a real threat. Perhaps even too much, because the component of fun and simplicity that must characterize a videogame production compared to the real counterpart is a bit dumbfounded. What is there still to improve Stand everything becomes perfect, we editors would be forced to retire; luckily for us, even a great product like Fifa 08 has some problems. The main one is represented by the (in)efficiency of the goalkeepers, who alternate extraordinary saves with incredible ducks. It's true, this too could be a factor dictated by the absolute search for realism (seeing Dida is believing), but the ~fainting~, especially from crosses from the back, are too frequent. At the same time, the players are still not very reactive in changes of direction, which in almost all cases see the defenders chasing the ball rewarded. To give support to the most hardened dribblers, many fakes have been inserted, which can be achieved with the right analog stick in conjunction with the triggers of the Sixaxis pad. Even in this case, however, the speed of execution is not optimal, forcing the player to anticipate the move to ensure that the timing choice of the rubber band, rather than that of the roulette wheel, is optimal. Playing first therefore often becomes an obligation rather than an opportunity, again due to a certain cumbersome control of the players often derived from too long animations. It being understood that, with due practice, the satisfactions are many, even if it lacks that complete feeling with the players on the field which is still a great prerogative of PES. Online Multiplayer The online department is very elaborate, and is being perfected. Currently, in fact, you will be able to participate in two against two matches, but only from two consoles, while a patch is planned for the next few months which will present, in addition to the double from four consoles, the highly anticipated five against five, in which it is not yet clear if we will control two players each, or if instead half the team will be entrusted to the AI. In addition to the discounted single matches (ranked and unranked), it is also possible to take part in leagues of up to 32 participants. In this case, it is the game itself that guarantees the smooth running of the tournament, autonomously saving results and rankings. However, two things leave us dumbfounded: first of all, the absence of the ~numerical~ ranking, given that the total score is missing at the bottom of the results obtained, forcing the player to make simple but also avoidable calculations. Secondly, it is impossible to go back and forth: the game offers the possibility of playing only an odd number of games: 1,3,5,7,9 or 11. Fortunately, in our many online games we have practically never noticed the presence of lag, to guarantee a multiplayer almost identical to the offline one. Finally, the tasty introduction of a football news podcast that accompanies the player, under impression, along the navigation of the menus, should be underlined. Stadium atmosphere Even on a technical level, the game draws applause. Players are not only gifted with a large number of polygons, but also enjoy highly detailed textures, and faces that, in most cases, are easily traceable to their real-life counterparts. In addition, the most famous players will also be equipped with characterizing movements and a unique style of play: for example Ibrahimovic tends to never get rid of the ball, while Cristiano Ronaldo has the most deadly weapon in one-on-ones in his double pass . Therefore, the animations are excellent (except for the aforementioned which unfortunately negatively affect the controls), and the physics of the ball is nothing short of surprising, which, except for some situations (such as after a post or a crossbar), is the most realistic seen so far in such a game. Stadium atmosphere At the same time, the setting of the matches literally takes your breath away, thanks to the perfect reproduction of 23 of the most famous stadiums in the world, and the constant cheering of the fans in the stands. By the way, an honorable mention should therefore be made for the sound sector, which in addition to the good commentary by the Caressa-Bergomi duo, includes really existing choirs, which gives more than a thrill to those who, on the bend, live their Sunday afternoons . Comment While awaiting Konami's response, the days of the pinball machine and poor control over the progress of the match are also far away for Fifa. This time, in fact, a lot of substance has been added to the usual excellent level setting, which has its greatest strength in the playability finally based on simulation. The advice is to set aside prejudices and test the product yourself: I am sure that all fans will find in Fifa 08 an essential purchase to quench their thirst for football. Pro Simulation! Tons of modes, online without lag. Technically commendable. Cons Shallow ~To be a pro~ mode. Players still unresponsive and slightly cumbersome controls.", "date": "2007-10-05", "grade": null}
