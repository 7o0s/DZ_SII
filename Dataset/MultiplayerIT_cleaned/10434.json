But let's admit that we find it strangely pleasant to retrace the history of video games with a viewer on our head, because that's what we're doing. Enchanted by the undeniable power of VR, even more by the wireless one offered by Oculus Quest, we live in this strange situation in which past and future coexist in ambiguous harmony. Technically VR is two generations behind, but otherwise it's two generations ahead: in the review of Resident Evil 4 VR for Oculus Quest we will find out how this is possible. A Lion from another time El Gigante is even more... giant, in the VR version. Resident Evil 4 VR is the game of all time, identical in all respects to the version released on the GameCube in 2005, except for the additional content such as the Mercenaries mode and the mini-story dedicated to Ada. The graphics are cleaner, there has been a slight overhaul over time that you can see the results here too, albeit with a totally different perspective, but the bulk of the work has been done to adapt the gameplay to the wonders of virtual reality . And from this point of view there's really nothing to complain about, thanks to the skill of the team that embarked on this adventure, but also to a game that just can't stop surprising. Who would have thought that Resident Evil 4 would have found itself so at ease in such a different context? Some sequences of the original game really seem to have been designed from the first moment for virtual reality, we had so much fun reliving them forking Oculus Quest 2. The first assault on the village is nothing short of crazy, when you find yourself in the arena with El Gigante you really feel in danger, oppressed, defenseless, so much so that you want to rip the visor off your head to catch your breath. It's not so much fear, but there's that too, but a sort of fun overdose. It helps a lot to have no wires in the way, especially in a game that intelligently embraces VR in full, thus allowing you to control the two hands of the protagonist independently (which paradoxically does not happen in the PSVR version of the most recent Resident Evil 7). There are also less fun sections, where the potential of virtual reality remains a bit with the brake on, in this case every time we find ourselves in the boat (those who have played it know, the others will notice it), but there are no There's a single moment in gameplay where this Resident Evil 4 VR just doesn't work. Hands The freedom granted in the movement and in the use of the protagonist's hands completely transforms the game, makes it new, more satisfying than ever The hands of Leon, the protagonist, are our hands and the most common objects will all be physically accessible without having to enter any menu: if you want to take out the gun, just bring your hand towards the holster, if you want a grenade, just take an imaginary one from the our back. The placement of each tool is well thought out and there is no overlapping of any kind, instead present in other games that adopt a similar system. The player is then given complete freedom of engagement, this means that he can hold the gun with one hand and the knife in the other, shoot while throwing grenades, run, turn around, climb over looking for some flying headshot that thins out the crowd of fanatics behind us. We failed to understand how much they worked on the AI of the enemies, or on their number, in order to make the same situations faced in 2005 work so well in virtual reality; the first person view, being so at the center of the action, made it difficult to compare the old Resident Evil 4 with this reincarnation. On a normal level, the game seemed well balanced to us, with some upward jerks in moments where the action became and became more intense, however nothing unsurpassed after a handful of attempts. Damn cut-scenes The idea of cut-scenes doesn't work very well in VR... There's only one downside to this single but ubiquitous Resident Evil 4 VR: cut-scenes are not designed for VR and are frequent at various points in the game. It happens in practically all products not designed for this technology, but adapted in the second line, this because it would be a very long job to revise them so thoroughly, sometimes impossible. The fact remains that feeling torn away from the action in such a brutal way, to be slapped into an uncomfortable front row at the cinema almost hurts and in Resident Evil 4 VR it happens often. Other than that, reliving such a classic in virtual reality is sIt was an electrifying experience, as different as it was the same as we remembered it. After all, a masterpiece is forever.", "date": "2021-10-21", "grade": "8.5"}
