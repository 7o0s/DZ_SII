{"name": "Recensione di Grom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-di-grom.html", "text": "A European Indiana Jones The Second World War has not yet ended and is spreading to areas never before touched by the conflict. We are in 1942 and more precisely in the remote region of Tibet. Among these mountains, the Nazis are looking for ancient traces of a sacred city, the Lost City. In the ruins of the city they hope to find weapons hidden by a past king, Arjuna. By recovering these weapons, the Nazis can tip the balance of the fate of the world war towards their cause. The research has been going on for more than 4 years and has not yet given the desired results. As in the best of traditions, a hero is destined to fight the villains and stop their pursuit; The new Indiana Jones is a Polish Colonel who responds to the name of Grom. Our hero is a rude person with a perpetually lit cigar in his mouth that causes a grim look (you know, the smoke and mirrors is not healthy). Grom is located in Himalaya, after a period of imprisonment in German concentration camps. Now his only purpose is to start a new life and forget the past bad times. But his fate is decided. His path will have to cross again with that of his hated enemies and this time you will be the one to give him a hand... In other words, how lucky! Little snow in Tibet Grom's graphics are pleasant to look at and in many situations it brings to mind old RPGs that are now classics, such as Baldur's Gate and Fallout. Mind you that I said ~in many situations~ and this does not mean that the graphics of the game are dated or completely isometric, a mode that is still widely used in RPGs. Grom's graphics engine best manages different views that can be found in a game: the classic isometric, pure 3D and finally an unprecedented bird's eye view. Our view changes depending on the situation in which we find ourselves. The exploration of the cities and the external parts are in isometric, while the closed places such as houses or inns become 3D. A separate discussion must be made for the fights that change everything, bringing the bird's eye view. The detail of the objects and the protagonists is very accurate. Cities are not all the same and the exteriors are represented with details that make everything more ~alive~, even if there are few objects with which we can interact. A very strange thing I noticed is the almost lack of snow. I was expecting more snow peaks for a mountainous region like Tibet. Of course, this aspect does not affect the general judgment but, playing with it, it is immediately noticeable. The various protagonists are designed with ~cute~ graphics, which want to defuse the figure of the beautiful and damned hero. Many times Grom and his allies will make you smile, both for how they move and for the faces they will show you during the game. The long road to the lost city We met the protagonist and understood the world in which he moves. Now we have to understand how Grom moves and what methods he uses to do it. The comfortable initial tutorial is used to familiarize yourself with an interface that may seem complicated at first but which soon reveals an ease of use that will be useful as the game continues. Our movements are mainly guided by the mouse and thanks to a ~wheel~ of retractable buttons we have both the free game screen and quick access to particular actions of Grom and his companions. Through this wheel it is possible to crouch down, lie down to crawl (this movement is in practice Grom's Stealth mode), get up and decide what attitude to keep during the fights (attack, defense or maintain position). We must quickly learn how to move our hero and his companions, because the enemies we will meet along the way to the lost city are many and dangerous. The main antagonists are the Nazi soldiers, but in Tibet there are other dangerous figures such as the Yetis, Tibetan bandits and even magical creatures from ancient times. I found the difficulty of the fights quite high. Although it is possible to pause the game during the fight, you need to plan your movements and moves well and above all understand which weapon is the most useful against a specific enemy, otherwise you risk being defeated soon. The choice of weapons for battles is quite diverse. Our Grom has various firearms at his disposal, ranging from the classic shotgun to the machine gun, passing through the powerful arquebus. Of course, even the white weapon has its place in a gameaction games like this one, and the Colonel is able to fight with swords and throwing knives. A last resort are the classic punches. Carrying around an arquebus is not everyday stuff and in fact many of the weapons that we can use take up considerable space in our backpack. We will have to decide well what to take with us during our missions and perhaps sacrifice some ammunition, to carry some very useful boxes of meat for our health. To facilitate this choice we are met by the skill we have with the various weapons, represented by colored squares. Grom and his companions are skilled in using different weapons, each in the way they have been trained. You will immediately notice that the Polish colonel prefers the rifle, while his comrade Petr loves the powerful blunderbuss. Of course, using a weapon during specific training sessions leads to an increase in the ability to use it. As mentioned earlier, very often Grom does not travel alone. Other comrades with the same ideals and goals as him can be recruited, up to commanding a large group of fellow soldiers. Among our ranks, sometimes, there will be a Yak that can be loaded with material that has no place in the backpack. Just be careful that in Grom's solo missions, you won't be able to use the objects of your companions, so keep the most important things for yourself. Your travels will allow you to get to know the local inhabitants and their customs. All the merchants you meet, or people who want to trade something with you, have a good habit of haggling over prices. This negotiation takes place through a card game that I will now illustrate. Each character has several cards available that represent a certain emotion or action (begging, insulting, verbally assaulting, superiority). Before negotiating, you have to choose two cards to use against your opponent. The combinations are varied and each result corresponds to an increase or decrease in the price of the object we are negotiating. This is a variant of the classic purchases that are seen in many games, even if it is really difficult with Grom to be able to extract money from the tenacious Tibetan merchants. Bargaining is much easier if we use his companion Petr, who has very varied cards to oppose. Another aspect to analyze is the sound. I deliberately avoided comments of any kind during the review because the music and sound effects don't even reach enough. Few effects accompany Grom's travels, and most of the noises you will hear are the gunshots and screams of the dying enemy breathing his last. Each new important location is accompanied by music, which however is not enough in a ~silent~ game like this. So Grom is a good game? To the question I answer that I have seen worse. You have to judge the product also on the basis of the atmosphere you breathe while playing. Fun and carefree. The situations in which our hero comes across are the classics of any action film, but the attitude of the protagonist and the jokes he exchanges with his companions defuse the solemnity and seriousness of the mission. An example above all is the presentation that tells of the beginning of the search for the Lost City by the Nazis in 1938, all represented by an elegant airship that flies menacingly between the mountains of Tibet. The scene fades out and after a while the message after 4 years the search continues appears and we see the airship still wandering through the mountains.I don't know about you but I laughed for half an hour..This is the air that is breathed in Grom. A game where the seriousness of the heroes is played down and where you can spend hours of carefree fun. Otherwise, Grom adds nothing new. Ultimately a fun game that unfortunately risks being ruined by some defects, such as poor Artificial Intelligence, excessive difficulty and sometimes difficult controls; but at least it manages to make us forget the frantic wait for heavier caliber titles. Pros: good presentation good mix of adventure and rpg funny dialogues Cons: poor and inadequate sound Almost no AI poor interaction with the environment A European Indiana Jones The past was a lean period for computer RPGs. The major software houses are waiting for better times to release the titles that the gaming community is anxiously awaiting. Lionheart, KotOR, Greyhawk, Deus Ex 2, just to name a few. It happens in situations like this to have to play something that is not really apure RPG; Grom falls into the category of adventures with RPG traits. While waiting for the big shots, the German CDV allows us to enjoy the latest work by Rebelmind.", "date": "2003-07-05", "grade": null}
