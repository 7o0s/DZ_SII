The streets are teeming with stoned desperate people who don't know what to do with their lives. Everything is metal and rust and the sky itself seems to be suffocated by it. RUINER, the first title from Reikon Games, a Polish studio made up of highly experienced developers with titles such as The Witcher and Dying Light behind them, puts us in the shoes of a disturbing nameless character, with his face covered by a strange electronic helmet, who has one goal: to kill the boss of Heaven, the most powerful multinational in the city of Rengkok, the place where the entire adventure takes place. The glitch aesthetic is used a lot His principal hasn't explained anything to him, except to tell him that if he doesn't, he'll kill his brother, who is being held hostage who knows where. The plot develops along the course of what is basically an action with an isometric view, in which most of the time is spent massacring hordes of enemies using white weapons, such as clubs or swords; or firearms, such as machine guns, shotguns, freezing rays, grenade launchers and so on and so forth. Weapons and against whom to use them The game begins with a long tutorial that immediately makes you understand one of the fundamental characteristics of the game: it's very difficult. The first fights are punishing, but they are nothing compared to what awaits us later. The basic mechanics are simple to explain: in addition to running and fighting, the protagonist can sprint or use one of his special abilities (which consume a separate bar placed under the energy bar), such as a barrier, a shock bomb, slowing down time, a bomb blast, and so on. Skills can be unique, or tied to others. They are unlocked and upgraded by spending karma points on them (practically experience points by another name). Weapons on the other hand, apart from the starting ones which are fixed (a close combat weapon and a firearm), can be collected from the corpses of enemies, or from boxes and other containers, some of which must be hacked to be opened ( the hack is a simple keystroke to press). They all have a limited duration due either to bullets or durability. Enemies on the other hand can be henchmen of a gang, mercenaries defending Heaven, cybernetic soldiers and variants. It doesn't matter, since their only goal is to kill us: there are those who try to bolt him, those who shoot him, those who choose the path of explosives and so on. Apart from a freely explorable neighborhood of Rengkok, Ruiner's gameplay is mostly made up of long combat sequences that take place in linear levels, in which you often find yourself surrounded. Play styles The combat system is definitely the best part of Ruiner. With various tricks, Reikon Games has managed to make the clashes frenetic and at the same time physical, without depriving them of a pinch of strategy. In Ruiner you die a lot and often, right from the early stages. Sometimes the number of enemies seems overwhelming, but in reality it is enough to start using all the tools available to dominate even the most difficult battles. For example, at the beginning it is difficult to exploit the shooting sequences, i.e. the possibility of shooting several times in a row by setting intermediate stages, but when you master them you realize how useful they are in many situations. Some bosses are really difficult and require you to be perfect in executing the tactics needed to destroy them After all, the possibility of choosing which skills to enhance paves the way for different styles of play, which pay more or less depending on the situation. Ruiner's fights also have another aspect that makes them unique: the brutality of their representation. Hit an enemy with a club and they will fly to the ground leaving a trail of blood behind them; freeze it and then hit it with a club and you will see it end up shattered; hit him with an explosive and you will see him transform into a cloud of blood shreds. Multiply this by dozens of enemies who attack you at a frenzied pace and you will understand where most of the game's charm lies. Besides the normal enemies there are several bosses to take down. Normally these are bigger and meaner human opponents, equipped with particularly powerful weapons, even if there is no lack of more spectacular clashes against more generously sized robotic entities. They usually require special tactics to be defeated or at least you have to demonstrate that you know how to master the control system perfectly and keep in considerationeration all the skills you have. Plot and final considerations What little plot that holds together the various massacres of RUINER develops for the most part in the aforementioned Rengkok district. More or less shady individuals live here who will help us move forward in the game, or will give us some minor secondary missions (find hidden objects in the levels, kill some bosses, hack some robot cats and little else). Although the scenario is well outlined and the artistic direction has been very careful to create a credible universe, the level of writing is low and the characters you meet are decidedly stereotyped: you go from the cynical mechanic who ends up helping us despite himself, you go through the sympathetic madam of a brothel and we arrive at a mad old woman in search of the chosen ones. Moreover, they are very fleeting figures, in the sense that one never deepens their knowledge. Let's just say that you lose a little time in the city only during the first visit, when you are curious to visit it all and want to discover every corner. The following visits are much faster and you almost always go straight to the point, i.e. to the next mission. In general it is the whole scenario that is not exploited very much, narratively speaking. Somehow it denotes action, but the developers didn't go too deep, preferring to focus more on the mystery surrounding the protagonist. The combat system is satisfying and some weapons are a pleasure to use The levels of them are big metal boxes filled with debris and sparks. Overall there isn't much variety, even the eight hours it lasts pass quite quickly, concentrated as you are trying to figure out how to kill the various bosses. Less forgivable is the careless design of the bosses themselves, which in many cases are limited to being sponges for bullets, while in others they admit a single approach to combat, making some of the skills that have developed useless. The skills themselves are not all on the same level: some, such as the ability to take control of an opponent, are almost impossible to use because you are not given the time to do it at times when you need it most. In short, beyond the charm that RUINER conveys from every pixel, thanks to its psycho-glitch aesthetic that reminded us of that of Hotline Miami, it carries more than a few problems. Finally, the splendid soundtrack is worth mentioning, made up of very hard electronic songs, which make for much more involvement in the action than the narration.", "date": "2017-10-04", "grade": "7.5"}
