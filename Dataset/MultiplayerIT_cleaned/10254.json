{"name": "L'Icaro scaricabile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73447-nyxquest-kindred-spirits-licaro-scaricabile.html", "text": "Although there are many productions based on very simple concepts within WiiWare, the digital delivery of Wii has also shown us some ingenious applications of the characteristic interface of the Nintendo console that face head-on the triple A titles that normally boast the release in store and a pack. In fact, the downloadable catalog can be considered as a real forge of ideas in this sense: deprived of the weight and responsibilities of a big budget production but also - if desired - freed from the market logic that imposes the continuous recycling of ideas , the world of WiiWare allows developers to indulge themselves in original concepts that, at times, seem to show the public and insiders what should be the right spirit with which to apply themselves to Wii development. One of these examples is given by NyxQuest: Kindred Spirits, a particular mix between puzzle game and platform that reminds a bit (especially for the layout of the commands between Remote Control and Nunchuck) that little masterpiece of LostWinds, one of the first examples of full exploiting the potential offered by the Nintendo digital delivery platform. Developed by the independent Spanish team Over The Top Games and initially known under the name Icarian: Kindred Spirits - and presumably renamed to avoid misunderstandings with the other Nintendo ~Icarus~, i.e. the long-awaited Kid Icarus - the game exploits the suggestions of the myth Greek born from the pen of Ovid to stage a simple but effective story, and above all a really interesting gameplay. It is essentially a puzzle game with a platform-style structure, in which we have to control a small winged figure called Nyx until the end of the levels, running, jumping, gliding and using special powers through the pointer. An ancient story NyxQuest: Kindred Spirits borrows the fable of Icarus, a famous passage in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and reworks it in its own way, bending it to the needs of a video game. Perhaps in order not to disturb the myth too much, the protagonist of this story is an unpublished character, precisely called Nyx, a female semi-divinity who has formed a particular friendship with Icarus, who thanks to his artificial wings has reached the celestial kingdom and met the winged girl. When Icarus mysteriously disappears, Nyx decides to go looking for him: going down to the surface of the Earth, the protagonist finds a world in ruins, and among these she begins her search. The control system is divided equally between the Remote Control and Nunchuck, with the latter responsible for the movement of the main character through the analog stick and the first to command the special abilities donated by the various benevolent deities through an on-screen pointer. In addition to running, pushing objects, jumping and gliding thanks to her wings, Nyx is able to move objects from a distance, raise gusts of wind and hurl lightning bolts at enemies through divine powers that are progressively unlocked throughout the game, usable by acting directly on objects on the screen with the pointer. Coordination between the movement of the character and the interaction with the elements of the scenario is therefore essential, for example when we find ourselves moving stones to clear the path, blocking the fall of huge boulders that would crush the protagonist or controlling the flames by moving them to the screen in order to hit enemies or burn wooden obstacles all through the Remote Control, while with the Nunchuck we move Nyx between platforms. Hellenic platformer The style adopted by Over The Top Games is rather austere and linear, characterized by the use of 3D graphics implanted on a typically two-dimensional game structure, but the simplicity of the lines and geometric figures on the screen make everything elegant and fascinating in its particular evocation of Hellenic suggestions. Ruins, statues, sand and sky are the predominant elements that make up the various scenarios of the 12 levels present in NyxQuest, while the soft colors and delicate color combinations help to create a dreamy atmosphere, as befits a story that recalls Greek mythology . Even the audio accompaniment is suitably inspired by the Greek tradition (or at least by the image we commonly associate with it), with motifs in a classic style and rarefied atmospheres. The 12 levels into which the game is divided (plus a thirteenth secret final level, unlockable by finding a series of hidden objects) present a rather simple although effective and well-structured level design, with andclear puzzles and in most cases not difficult to solve. The level of challenge of the game is actually not too high, with puzzles that never put major obstacles in the way of completing the story, which is not very long in itself, as is more appropriate for a digital delivery game. Considering that on the other hand, as a platform, NyxQuest does not present any difficult elements - also featuring a rather low pace of action - the resulting impression is of a product suspended between its two different natures of puzzle game and puzzle game platforms, which doesn't sink the pedal into either feature. We also note the presence of a multiplayer mode that allows a second player to use the remote control to use special powers, but it is an unconvincing solution.", "date": "2010-01-13", "grade": "8.0"}
