{"name": "Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-3-definitive-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is the title that concludes the restoration work of the Ensemble Studios series, started years ago by Microsoft, waiting to launch Age of Empires IV. As we will see in the course of the review, it is also the weakest episode of the group, despite the large amount of content offered and despite the graphic remastering being more incisive, even if less clear-cut, than that of the other two episodes. However, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition and Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition had a conceptual grandeur on their side that is completely missing from the third chapter, more devoted to expanding its audience by making some simplifications to the original formula and veering the gameplay towards that of strategic in most famous real time of its era. From this point of view we are faced with a paradoxical situation: Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is certainly the most modern exponent of the trilogy, but in the worst sense of the term, so much so that replaying the first two episodes, in particular the second, it was a joy, while the third made us work a little harder. Graphics As mentioned, the graphic remastering of Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition was more incisive than that of the previous chapters, although the work done is overall reduced. The reason is simple: the engine is fully 3D and allowed improvements to be made more quickly, without affecting the original gameplay too much. For example, we have high resolution textures, more defined 3D models, support for higher resolutions, as well as many embellished effects compared to the original, such as those of explosions or the destruction of buildings, made more realistic thanks to the use of a more modern physique. The narrative side has also undergone a complete overhaul, with the addition of well-crafted cutscenes, made using the game engine. So, from a purely cosmetic point of view, the work done by Tantalus Media and Forgotten Empires is truly remarkable, so much so that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition does not disfigure in front of most of the real-time strategy games released in recent years, where the predecessors, on the other hand, were weak precisely from this point of view (they were however embellished, but it was not possible to take them beyond a certain threshold, which was insurmountable due to their original setting). The work on the interface is also remarkable, which has been completely revised and made customizable, which never hurts in similar titles. Gameplay The gameplay has unfortunately not received the same treatment and appears to be the original one without any significant changes. Natural that this is the case, since we are talking about a remastering and not a remake, as it is also natural that the criticisms that hit him then also concern this new version. The problems of Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition emerge in particular by making a direct comparison with its predecessors. The simplification process, which we have already mentioned, mainly concerns the micromanagement mechanics, which enormously affect the game time and the depth of the action itself. In particular, the resources have been reduced from five to three (food, stones and wood), so as to deprive the map design of quite a few possibilities. For example in the other AoE some maps were designed around the scarcity of a certain resource, creating interesting situations between rapid exploration and early battles, something that in the third chapter was simply not possible to do. Even the defense of the territory is more superficial, simply because there is less to protect and it is easier to organize. If we add to this the greater speed in the generation of troops, the cut of collection points, which reduces the movement of settlers to the bone, and the greater speed in the evolution of our civilization, you will understand that everything has been designed for faster games , that is to favor the multiplayer side and less cunning players, however removing different layers of complexity and ending up making the game formula look like that of all the other RTSs on the market, that is, losing the peculiarities of the first two chapters along the way. The additions have unfortunately not balanced the problems. For example, the Mother City, substantially the capital of our civilization from which we receive bonuses in the game that increase in quantity and quality as we progress in the game, is indeed interesting, but it discourages experimentation with other civilizations, here much more characterized than in the previous AoE, and creates big imbalances in multiplayer, where the extra callable resources are often crucial for thevictory (or defeat), with the utmost frustration of those who have less available. Some single player campaign missions are also affected. For example, some are built around the scarcity of certain troops, so being able to perhaps recall some from the Mother City results in a real nonsense. Contents This is not to say that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is a bad game. In particular we want to clarify that the mechanics have worsened especially if we consider the predecessors, while they do not disfigure in the face of those of some modern RTS. Furthermore, between single player campaigns, factions (sixteen in total) skirmish mode, challenges and online mode there is to play for months, which is no small thing given the price at which it is sold. There are also two new factions compared to the original: Inca (perhaps too aggressive and powerful, but it is to be verified once the game is launched, i.e. when many will be able to play it) and Swedes (the catenacciari, if you pass us the footballing term), are new multiplayer maps have been created, there has been a general renewal of the features, including more performing matchmaking, the possibility of cross-playing between versions for the various stores where the game is on sale and other little gems that they may be missing in a 2020 title. Of course, there is less content than AoE 2 Definitive Edition, but it must be said that we are talking about a game that has gone far beyond the guard levels, therefore difficult to reach. The work done on artificial intelligence is also excellent, which makes the higher difficulty levels a considerable challenge even for those who know all the maps and missions by heart. In short, Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition has its good qualities, but also the misfortune of having prestigious and loved predecessors, as well as that of not being particularly appreciated by purists. If we wish we could define it as the perfect title to enter the genre and in the series, given the minor complications for newbies, but nothing to regret too much, in case you skip it.", "date": "2020-10-14", "grade": "7.0"}
