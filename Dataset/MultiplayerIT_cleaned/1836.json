{"name": "Balan Wonderworld", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/balan-wonderworld-recensione.html", "text": "Balan Wonderworld's review is one of those pieces inevitably destined to cause discussion, given that the new game directed by Yuji Naka, the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, has already begun to divide critics and audiences, giving rise to very distant and varied evaluations .Who is right? Everyone and no one: as often happens in these cases, the truth lies in the middle and some concepts need to be clarified well to give a precise idea of what gave birth to the newfound collaboration between the two standard bearers of the Sonic Team, on the one hand the aforementioned Naka and on the other the character designer Naoto Ohshima. Balan Wonderworld, the doors of master Balan's mysterious theater. Therefore, it is better to face the question immediately: Balan Wonderworld is an artistically highly inspired title, characterized by an extraordinary soundtrack, which will not fail to drag you into a wonderful world ... in its own way. The downside is in fact represented by antiquated mechanics, by a balance of questionable difficulty and undoubtedly dated graphics in many of its aspects, as well as a selling price which, in the light of all this, appears a little too high. History Balan Wonderworld, the protagonist of one of the stories told in the campaign. Told through truly beautiful and well-directed cutscenes, as per Square Enix tradition, the story of Balan Wonderworld puts us in the shoes of a boy (choice between Leo and Emma) who, in the throes of despair, ends up unknowingly crossing the threshold of a strange theater that came out of nowhere. To manage this place halfway between Video Girl Ai's Gokuraku, the Broadway Theater and Disneyland we find the mysterious master Balan, who immediately understands what the problem of the character we control is and decides to help him by opening the doors to a sort of small inhabited planet by cute little animals called Tim. Balan Wonderworld, one of the first game worlds. From this colorful hub, embellished thanks to structures and objects that we will be able to activate using the crystals collected during the missions, we will be able to access twelve different worlds, each linked to a particular theme as well as to the people who generated them, also victims of trauma, disappointments and unpleasant situations that have transformed them into real monsters. To take advantage of their desperation is the disturbing Lance, a sort of evil twin of Balan who from time to time makes his Negati appear within these worlds , dark creatures that can put a spoke in our wheels but that don't represent who knows what challenge: to defeat them, just jump on their head or use the offensive abilities of some of our costumes. Structure Balan Wonderworld, a fight sequence with the Negati. The Balan Wonderworld campaign is made up of twelve worlds, as mentioned: each of them is divided into two levels and a boss fight that we will have to complete to put an end to the nightmare of people trapped in their fears, freeing them and giving their story a happy end, also told first with a real group dance, then with yet another quality cutscene. Completing the internships in itself does not require great skills, given that as mentioned the enemies are few and easy to defeat; however Yuji Naka thought, unfortunately or fortunately, of somehow making completionism an integral part of the experience. So in order to unlock the new worlds, in groups of three at a time, we will have to collect a minimum number of golden statuettes of Balan within them. Balan Wonderworld, Costumes and worlds are linked by numerous mechanics. Being able to obtain the amount of statues necessary to be able to carry on the adventure is not very simple, especially if you are not used to this type of mechanics: most of them are hidden in the most remote recesses of the scenarios, a bit like the moons of Super Mario Odyssey, and to reach them we will often need to resort to the skills of Costumes not present in those specific locations. This aspect adds depth but also a bit of frustration to the campaign, urging us not only to observe the settings well but also to understand which powers could come in handy and where, providing us with a checkpoint system through which to call up a cabin where we can possibly equip the necessary Costumes, provided however that we have ~kept~ them at the end of the missions in which we used them for the first time. Gameplay Balan Wonderworld, one of the last boss fights. It is therefore time to understand what these mysterious Costumes we have been talking about are. This is probably one of the most particular elements of the Balan Wonderworld gameplay: instead of giving our character extra skills to unlocklittle by little, the developers thought of linking these features to a set made up of no less than eighty different Costumes. Here too, if you wish, we find a bit of Super Mario: open one of the crystals that contain the Costumes, rigorously after obtaining a key around the level, the protagonist takes on a different appearance and the powers associated with that configuration. Some Costumes allow you to launch attacks that can also destroy blocks of stone, others act on mobility by improving the jump and making us levitate or glide to cover long distances. Balan Wonderworld, the Costume with the candle comes in handy for setting fire to certain objects. There are no perfect Costumes: some are unsuitable for exploration, others for combat, still others are quite useless, as could be expected in the face of these numbers. We will be able to equip three of them, being careful to unlock new ones so as not to replace those we deem most useful (the Japaneseness of Balan Wonderworld is also manifested in the progression from right to left applied to this and other situations) and not to suffer damage or fall while wearing the best configuration.As much as the idea is interesting and intertwines effectively with the needs of completionism we have already mentioned, as well as with the local cooperative mode, the in-game sensation is that of being faced with outdated and very limited (just think that a single button on the controller is used), often devoid of bite and above all trivial in terms of difficulty. The boss fights are an exception: although they are also easy-going, they really shine for their characterization and artistic direction. Sports and quick time events Within the worlds of Balan Wonderworld we will also find a couple of variations on the theme. The first are simple sports minigames that can be accessed simply by collecting some special Costumes: that of a football fan (an Inter shirt, in practice: well done Yuji!), that of a golf player, a baseball player and so on Street. The second is Balan's top hats, which start a challenge based on quick time events in which the game director once again reaffirms his passion for Dragon Ball Z, the same one that probably inspired the birth of Super Sonic. Technical realization Balan Wonderworld, master Balan in one of his QTE-based battles. Balan Wonderworld manages to be contrasting even in terms of technical realization. In fact, if on the one hand the game adopts quite dated solutions as regards polygonal modeling and effects, while moving everything on PS5 at 4K and 60 fps with instantaneous loading, on the other it puts a piece thanks to the weight of a very inspired artistic direction The show that runs before our eyes is therefore an alternation of beautiful and less beautiful things, truly suggestive sequences (see the flying whale towards the middle of the campaign) and others characterized by a basic workmanship, always spectacular cutscenes and some sensational boss fights for their ability to mix images and sounds, but also some camera madness and frankly old-fashioned solutions. And then there's him, master Balan, with those particular features and the ability to fly that closely resemble the atmospheres of Nights into Dreams, but also a bit like the Jack Skeletron of Nightmare Before Christmas, only with much less restlessness than background. In this regard, the aforementioned soundtrack signed by Ryo Yamazaki has a lot of Danny Elfman in some moments, but also a generous handful of Harry Potter in the London scenario and inevitable references to Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell in a specific boss fight.
