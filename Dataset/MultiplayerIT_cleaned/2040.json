{"name": "Sid Meier's Sim Golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-sim-golf.html", "text": "Lights and shadows? The second, very welcome, aspect that characterizes Sim Golf, is precisely the presence of characters that move on the lawns and that resemble the Sims in all respects. Just like their illustrious simulation colleagues, golfers convey their thoughts, desires and unhappiness about the positioning of a hole to us, for example forcing us to continually decide how to improve the appeal of our golf club. Naturally they do it their way, with situations of involuntary humor that lighten the weight of the simulation and at the same time encourage us to continue to see what all the possible reactions are. And if it happens that some champion honors us with his presence, so much the better of it, in terms of publicity, when it doesn't even happen that he gives us something, in money or in ornaments, because he is satisfied with our golf course. The micromanagement of all desires is what makes Sim Golf a demanding title but it is also its beauty: in any case, the choice is ours to maximize profits by entrusting the care of the course to a reduced staff or to hire as many technicians as there are holes so as to make the camp as luxurious (and expensive) as possible. Lights and shadows? As if the simulation element at the management level were not enough, there is also the possibility of playing on the course with your own golfer, almost as if you were personally going down to the green and dealing with your guests as good hosts. . Your player grows hand in hand with the growth of the field, gains skills, can become a champion himself. The stroke control system is certainly not that of a title dedicated to the simulation of golf; it is a simplified method, suited to the spirit of Sim Golf, able to pleasantly insert itself between one decision and another without becoming overwhelming: it is therefore only a question of choosing which type of shot to execute, of choosing a point for the shot and of assisting while the sim performs swing rehearsals. And if the shot succeeds, prepare to distribute the experience gained among the various skills. Perhaps a slightly more complex control system would have benefited the depth of Sim Golf, such as inserting the choice of club or the measurement of strength but evidently this aspect was considered secondary to management and therefore, however fun, a little sacrificed. Conclusions At the level of game modes Sim Golf features three different levels of fun. For those who want a complete challenge there is the Regular mode in which the expansion and beautification of our golf course must take into account income and expenses, obviously aiming for profit. For those who feel a bit like an architect, a bit like a park decorator, here is the Sandbox mode, i.e. the area within which to create your dream pitch, without the restrictions of a limited budget. Finally, the Tournament mode allows you to tackle the golf course that we ourselves have prepared or that someone, among the possible, many enthusiasts, has designed. The same solidity of the game options is finally found in the graphics which, without referring to the capabilities of a latest generation card, are still sharp and pleasant, with its bird's eye view very comfortable for an effective glance. But the thing that most satisfies is the breadth of the different decorations, objects, embellishments that the player can arrange on the field: such generosity is certainly another strong point in support of longevity. Summing up, we can only be happy with this excursus in the field of light simulations by Sid Meier, even if we know that his genius is found more in more demanding titles, as the latest incarnation of Civilization has been able to confirm: Meier, one of the most inventive programmers on the gaming scene, he didn't propose anything particularly innovative, but limited himself to carrying out his task within the limits of his skills. We can therefore only recommend the game to those who want a management system that is not too demanding and has a simple and profound interface at the same time, but those looking for Sim Civilization are bound to be disappointed: forewarned is forearmed And now for something completely different Sid Meier is a name that for many means insomnia. A happy insomnia, however, because it is linked to great moments spent in front of a monitor to solve strategy problems or simply to make a decision.the idea of losing a few hours of sleep continues to tease you here is another title by Sid Meier that will give you this pleasure: Sid Meier's Sim Golf is in fact a simulation of a golf course, from its creation from nothing, right from the purchase of the land , up to the arrangement of all those comforts that revolve around a renowned field, from catering services to staff, from surplus to hotels. In this sense, Sim Golf combines the positive aspects of two great titles of the (even recent) past, i.e. the managerial and inherent design elements of the Sim City series and the characterization of the characters that move on the green typical of a game like the Sims . At the beginning, as in any self-respecting simulation, you find yourself restricted both in economic possibilities and in the size of the field: in reality you have available the space you need for only one hole or two. The ideal is therefore to focus entirely on quality rather than quantity, avoiding jumping headlong into land expansions which then leave no funds to make the holes attractive. Therefore, it is better to embellish the available land and make it intriguing so as to gradually attract the public and at the same time convince the local owners to sell the remaining land. As the golf club expands, the financial resources expand so as to be able to make the various greens more and more attractive and the course more and more difficult. This is one of the most intriguing purposes of Sim Golf, wasting pleasant hours to arrange every possible decoration and to tweak even the position of individual trees so that the challenge offered by the course is high. This is the beauty of Sim Golf: a game scheme capable of capturing the player's attention for a long time without noticing that time is passing. And time really passes when flower beds, statues, cart storage rooms and hotels are arranged. The golfers who frequent the course are the mirror of our management and architectural skills and certainly do not fail to point out any flaws.", "date": "2002-07-29", "grade": null}
