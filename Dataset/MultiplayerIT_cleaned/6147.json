A play on the beauty and joy of growing.~ This is the concise description that the American developer Joel McDonald (former level designer of Raven Software) provides regarding its creation, and it is also the best and most suitable way to arouse interest in this atypical, original and aesthetically wonderful platform title iOS. Prune is ultimately the attempt to express the art of bonsai through a puzzle game, at the same time enhancing the incredible ability that nature has to adapt to the conditions in which it ends up finding itself. Who knows how many times you have in fact admired a flower blossoming among the rocks, or a shrub managing to grow in inhospitable terrain. The idea behind the gameplay of the game is precisely this: to favor the development of a tree by acting on pruning (pruning = to prune), so as to allow it to reach the light and therefore be able to flourish. Prune is an aesthetically stunning puzzle game capable of leaving its mark A zen game New age, zen, relaxing, poetic. If these words give you hives, you can safely stop reading this article now and move on to something else. Prune is not in fact a title designed to put the reflexes on the ropes, nor to make the meninges squeeze in front of its puzzles. On the contrary, Joel McDonald's idea was rather to propose a soft progression, without obstacles, more based on emotions than on the real element of challenge. Wanting to make a not too risky comparison, the philosophy is similar to that of Thatgamecompany's Flower, so to speak. With the Sony title, Prune also shares the extreme brevity: it takes less than two hours to complete all the levels available, and although mobile gaming conventions leave the doors wide open for any future updates intended to expand the contents, at the moment it must necessarily speak of an intense but fleeting experience. The basic structure is extremely simple: it involves planting the seed of a tree in a pre-established area, determining the possible curvature of the plant's development and then assisting in its autonomous growth. It is precisely at this point, i.e. in the shrub's maturation process, that action can be taken to condition its shape: in fact, by pruning a branch, the tree will grow more in the remaining ones, so as to continue in a broad or rather thin and slender development . The aim is to make him reach sunlight, an essential element of life, avoiding obstacles and finally allowing that flowering which is in fact the goal for passing the level. From this base, Prune intelligently continues to introduce elements capable of adding variety to the experience: for example the wind, which conditions the direction of growth, or the red suns which infect and irreparably corrupt the plant upon contact, or the blue ones that stimulate development in a sensitive way or even the black ones that can be moved at will to attract a precise direction towards the fronds. The control is very simple, and passes only through a few swipes with which to proceed with the pruning work, and little else. The ability to pinch to zoom makes the experience accessible and enjoyable even on smartphones, but in general it seemed to us that the optimal environment is the large screen of an iPad. There is no evaluation system of one's work or timer to measure the time taken: Prune levels are exceeded or not, and even in the latter case you can choose to skip one if for some reason you find yourself stuck. It is therefore perfectly clear that Joel McDonald's fatigue has nothing to do with the concepts of challenge or frustration, and this is an aspect to take into deep consideration when considering the purchase. Undoubtedly Prune's qualities find perfect expression through the graphic component, characterized by a very original and fascinating minimal style, which expresses and supports the gameplay contents in the most convincing way possible. Everything passes through silhouettes and graphic elements reduced to the bone, with a use of taupe, black, red and gray colors that offer rarefied images, with oriental flavors, vaguely melancholy, which can also be immortalized with images to share on social networks or save , perhaps to use them as a background. The musical accompaniment is also excellent and very apt, by Kyle Preston, capable of creating an authentic caption of the images with the notes, thus completing the product perfectly.", "date": "2015-08-03", "grade": "9.0"}
