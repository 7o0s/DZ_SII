{"name": "Il Piccolo Popolo Nascosto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180385-hidden-folks-il-piccolo-popolo-nascosto.html", "text": "When in the mid-80s the English illustrator Martin Handford began to draw a series of strange and complex plates full of characters and details, among which readers had to see little Wally thanks to his eye-catching red and white striped shirt , he probably did not expect either that he had given rise to some kind of mass phenomenon. The idea is as simple as finding a character hidden inside a large image, but it hides a very complex and expensive elaboration on the part of the illustrator, who finds himself having to fill the scene with a disproportionate amount of other characters, objects and various elements of the scenery, moreover extremely detailed in the classic style of Handford. Perhaps also for this reason the imitations of ~Where's Wally?~ they have never equaled the quality and notoriety of the originals, but at least some reworkings manage to achieve excellent results, as this Hidden Folks demonstrates. Developed by Adriaan de Jongh with the fundamental contribution of designer Sylvain Tegroeg, the game demonstrates how Handford's concept can still be applied in an original way today, finding a particularly suitable and comfortable home in mobile platforms. The developer in question has a history of alternative titles with the Game Oven Studios label (Bam Fu, Jelly Reef, Fingle), therefore the know-how in creating games somewhat outside the box is certainly not in question, and when this experience combines with an original trait like that of Tegroeg the result can only catch the eye. In fact, Hidden Folks bases its entire structure on drawing, using it to build the play mechanics but also a vague form of environmental narration that makes everything a particular experience, beyond the simple game of visual skill at the base of everything. We talk about Hidden Folks as a sort of ~Where's Wally?~ But there is something more to this game The spy The game offers a long series of full-screen 2D hand-drawn animated illustrations or ~navigable~ by scrolling the shot in every direction, in each of which we are asked to find some elements between characters, animals, objects and more. The concept is therefore very simple, it's just a matter of sharpening your eyes and finding the subjects in question, which blend in with the scenery thanks to the quantity of visible details and the very large scale of the illustrations, rendering the very small and barely visible elements a first glance. Or they actually hide behind other elements, and then it becomes essential to interact with the objects present in the illustrations by observing the reactions that can be unleashed, all accompanied by nice animations and sound effects. In this lies the most properly ~adventure~ feature of Hidden Folks: each object to be found is accompanied by a brief description that provides some clues about where it is located within the scenario and at that point it is up to us to understand in which area to concentrate and then possibly tapping around the screen looking for the right reaction to bring it out, unless it's already visible. It is true that this mechanic carries with it the intrinsic defect of the possibility of touching around blindly hoping to solve something even without thinking too much about it, and the problem is that this ~technique~ also bears good fruit, but it gets lost in this way the essence of Hidden Folks, a game composed of relaxed rhythms and focused on attention and patience. It is a title that can generate a bit of frustration in particularly complex screens, difficult to manage on smaller screens, but which in general makes calm and almost Zen reflection its main elements.", "date": "2017-02-28", "grade": "8.5"}
