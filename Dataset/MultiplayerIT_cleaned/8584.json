In the meantime, Italy was also pressing from the south, with one of its best contingents, and Stalingrad saw itself in danger for the first time. But Stalin was not devoid of resources and ruthless cruelty, and decided to push the counter-offensive to the maximum by placing platoons considered expendable in the front line. Groups of men, found guilty of crimes or misconduct, sent to the front with the order not to take a step back, on pain of death. Also in this new chapter, the key points of the recipe are the direct control of a soldier of your choice, even on a vehicle, and the high destructibility of the maps. The strategic mechanics do not change and stick to a formula that favors fun and is rather immediate once you understand the key dynamics. In short, the result is an RTS without too many complications, with all the soldiers who can jump on any vehicle and use any weapon to perform decidedly spectacular heroic actions. However, a too relaxed approach is not recommended: mortality is high and some situations must be tackled step by step, using the movement system expertly, which shows us a preview of how the troops in cover will arrange themselves. From this point of view, a rather effective and fun tactic is to create a solid front with your own troops and then go around the opponent with the directly controlled character. But this only becomes possible once we have obtained more platoons since, as always, we start with a minimum contingent and are forced to loot the corpses in order not to run out of equipment. In any case, it is also possible to play by sticking exclusively to the strategic formula alone and with satisfactory results in any case. Nothing new on the Eastern front Men of War: Condemned Heroes is divided into four campaigns made up of different missions which, as in the other chapters of the saga, are in turn broken up into various segments. Longevity is therefore not a problem but there is a lack of substantial additions compared to the last chapter. In fact, the defects remain the usual with the camera not always optimal and the aforementioned lack of historical breadth, reinforced by the absence of information and details relating to the context, which clashes with the choice of a setting with high dramatic potential. In short, a fundamental piece is missing with only the short cut-scenes at the beginning of the mission, accompanied by a not too convinced dubbing, to deal with the narrative component. The cutscenes aren't badly done and get a little more care including better modeling and new textures for the soldiers, but from a technical standpoint we would have liked clearer improvements to the terrain and vegetation which remain the weak points of the series. The result is still acceptable with convincing side effects, explosions in quantity and a large number of units fighting each other. The level of destruction is also valuable, which includes the deformation of the terrain and the drama of the battles. The buildings are literally riddled with bullets and the holes are visible, while the positions hit by a grenade or a cannon explode in action movie style. In short, the spectacular side of the war is guaranteed between settlements, towns, bridges with a cinematic flavor and even planes that crash on the troops. To further increase the variety we then think about the large and credible movements of the enemy units which obviously also influence the gameplay. The sound effects that perform their task with convincing sampling are fundamental. Too bad for the music that once again offers a couple of well-chosen songs alternating with dull and not at all evocative motifs. Predictably, the novelties are also in hiding on the multiplayer front, with only two modes both focused on the conquest and defense of one or more flags. The units are purchased with points and can be up to 100, but with 8 players the result is chaotic and spectacular. Unfortunately, a modification is needed to unlock the possibility of playing cooperatively, but it is worth wasting the time necessary to install it since in this case the multiplayer sector enhances the peculiarities of the series.", "date": "2012-04-20", "grade": "7.5"}
