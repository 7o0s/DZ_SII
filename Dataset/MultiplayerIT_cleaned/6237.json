The franchise has continued its run through the years, and while it's not doing so well today (see the mediocre Sonic Boom for Nintendo platforms) it remains a point of reference for nostalgics, thanks also to a protagonist who is still extraordinarily popular. The Japanese house has seen fit to use Sonic in different areas, including mobile gaming, creating spin-offs based on jumps (Sonic Jump) and also experimenting with third-person endless runners, those in the Temple Run style (Sonic Dash) , also enjoying great success in terms of downloads. Now it's the time of horizontal scrolling endless, in line with the mechanisms of the original episodes of the series, and what better development team to entrust such a project than the legendary Sonic Team? Full of enthusiasm, the members of this historic team have developed new renderings for the character and the scenarios, going to compose a particularly difficult obstacle course full of details to discover, but at the same time endowed with a different look due to the ~dry~ nature of the gameplay. Collecting rings also in this case allows you to enjoy an extra life in the face of an unwanted impact, of course, but falling into an abyss still translates into game over and abandons the player in the embrace of a complicated and limiting freemium system, which works through tokens or viewing advertising trailers to be able to continue a game (only twice, though). Sonic Runners is a suggestive endless runner with some advantages, but also with too many problems The world in colour Endless runners are by definition very simple and immediate products, the typical games to pull out for a minute or two, maybe while we're waiting somewhere. The Sonic Team's approach therefore appears completely out of place, due to a rather slow initial registration system and long and frequent uploads, which make rapid and impromptu use difficult. Beyond this initial barrier, as already mentioned, the freemium system, with all its bonuses on consumption, the different currencies, the invasive advertising and so on, proves to be too cumbersome and complicated, very far from such a title it should be. Fortunately, once in the game, the situation improves substantially: accompanied by a beautiful rocking soundtrack, perfectly in line with Sonic's style, we will be asked to touch the screen to perform normal, double or triple jumps, and collect a large number of objects, therefore not only the traditional rings but also various types of gems and momentary boosts. There will also be enemies, to be eliminated rigorously by jumping on them but trying to manage the rebound in the best way, creating a sequence that takes us to the next platform without hitting a spike or, worse, falling into the void. The structure of the levels remains basically the same, making us grind meters up to a (trivial) boss with Eggman which results in a second even faster lap, and then another, until you reach the finish line or get eliminated for a few reason. The formula opens up to some variations only when you get to unlock the other characters included in the package, Tails and Knuckles, each with its own location and a different approach to the action. At that point, however, you will probably have considered the many alternatives available on the App Store and Google Play, full of products that are perhaps less fascinating but more successful, at least if you remain in the field of endless runners.", "date": "2015-06-30", "grade": "6.7"}
