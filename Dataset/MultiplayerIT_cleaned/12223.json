{"name": "Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-madness-battle-for-suburbia-recensione.html", "text": "Certainly some of you will remember the old Zombies Ate My Neighbors by LucasArts, a shooter for Super Nes and Megadrive which became a real cult of the 16-bit era, even though it didn't represent one of the biggest commercial successes at the time . The light-hearted horror comedy spirit of that game seems to have been fully inherited from this Monster Madness, which combines a shooter structure fully devoted to multiplayer, a representation of the classic horror clichs mediated through a comic-cartoon style. What emerges is a sort of mixed parody of horror films and 80s comedies, containing all the classic repertoire of the genre: invasion of zombies, aliens, deformed monsters, wolf men and other aberrant figures that roam around in the (once ) quiet average American suburbia. A plot in perfect 80s teen movie style could only be based on a quartet of characters-symbols of youthful adventures, real stereotypes: the nerd, the dark girl, the messer and the cheerleader. The story is narrated through comic strips, and begins with Zack, the nerd, who has finally managed to invite the charming Carrie (the dark girl) to his home, with whom he is secretly in love and to whom he hopes to confide his love just on that occasion. Obviously, this is precisely the evening in which everything is destined to happen: Andy, Zack's messy friend, shows up on the spot ruining all the boy's plans, and shortly thereafter Jennifer, the school beauty, intends to exploit the nerd for his tasks. The psuedo-romantic moment obviously plunges into an initial confusion, then leading to real panic and destruction, when the zombie invasion suddenly appears, forcing the boys to take up makeshift weapons and rush towards the police station. , desperately seeking help. Dawn of the Dead Despite the presence of the living dead and assorted amenities, we are not dealing with a survival horror. A nostalgic flavor comes over during the first few minutes of the game, as Monster Madness is an old-school action-shooter, with top-down action and no other purpose than frenzied destruction and the quest for the end of the level. The reference to the aforementioned Zombies Ate My Neighbors is clear, since this title could easily represent its sequel, with 3D graphics but with an almost unchanged spirit and structure. At the beginning of the game we can choose one of the 4 characters available, each with different characteristics and with a different type of basic attack for melee clashes, but the choice will not affect the unfolding of the (small) plot in any case. Starting from Zack's house, we will have to make our way to the police station, through the haunted streets of the suburbia, and then continue from level to level until the end of the game, and the eventual grand finale. In all, there are five different settings to go through, in turn divided into various sub-levels, for a total of about 25 schemes, and 12-14 hours of play declared. Although there are some exploratory elements, the gist of the game is the elimination of all the enemies on the screen. There are two shots available in the single-player mode, which considerably change the gaming experience: the close-up, in third person, frames the main character from behind, and therefore allows you to always have the portion of space in front of your eyes before your eyes. protagonist, while the aerial one, the only one available for multiplayer, has a fixed angle, and scrolls 360 degrees, following the directions taken by the characters, with different zoom levels depending on the distance between them. Dawn of the Dead This last framing can cause several problems: while the close-up one closely follows the movements of the player, who finds himself having the framing pointed in front of the character, facilitating aiming, the ~bird's-eye~ one, being fixed, forces the player to madly move the left analog stick, which directs the shot of the character. What derives from this is a sort of ~Smash TV syndrome~, in which you have to coordinate the movement of your avatar (through the right stick) and that of the line of fire (with the left stick) in speed. Combined with the generally lack of clarity and cleanliness that dominates the game, especially in the most agitated phases, this control system can become quite annoying. The game areas are more or less large settings, which can be explored with a fair amount of freedom, following the objective indicated by an arrow that indicates the direction to take. LMost of the time, the screen will be full of enemies of various kinds, who will come towards us in droves and which we will have to promptly eliminate. Occasionally, the exploration of the levels is interrupted by events of various kinds: in some cases all the accesses to continue in the scenario are closed, and the characters are subjected to the ~Monster Fest~, or a storm of enemies that falls on our heroes , a mass attack to be repelled by eliminating all the monsters present in the area, before being able to continue. In other moments it will be necessary to collect some particular object, before being able to move forward, such as a key or something similar, so it will become necessary to pay more attention to exploring every corner of the game area, rather than eliminating enemies. Other more traditional detachment elements are represented by the classic boss fights, which usually take place in well-defined arenas and require a (slightly) greater effort to be killed, although it is never a matter of developing attack strategies that much complex. Monster Fest The gameplay is typical of the shooter: although there are melee attacks, in general the clashes take place trying to keep the enemies at a distance, the only way to survive against the overwhelming number of monsters. With bare hands, it is possible to rely on your basic attack or on the possibility of grabbing practically every object present within the scenarios. This is where Ageia's Physyx engine comes into play, which allows for a fair amount of interaction with surrounding objects, although this does not allow for great things in terms of gameplay. In essence, the possibilities offered are limited to grabbing all the various pieces of furniture and scenery and throwing them at the enemies. However, most of the time we will find ourselves using firearms. These will be provided to us by Larry, a subspecies of Easy Rider who appears from time to time within the levels with his van-stand, ready to offer us, for a fee, help against adversity. Larry, in addition to money in the form of precious gems that are collected in the levels, needs as many scraps as possible (screws, mufflers, cans, pipes, etc.) which we will find scattered throughout each level. With these, our official supplier will be able to build, and gradually upgrade, new weapons with a very unconventional appearance such as nail-guns, gutter-derived rifles, laser-mobile phones and so on. These weapons have limited ammunition, but given the abundance of supplies (purchasable either from Larry himself or through vending machines along the way), it is not necessary to economize on shots throughout the game. The main button to keep in mind is therefore the right trigger, which triggers the attack or fire, if you have equipped weapons, while the left allows you to launch hand grenades and Molotov cocktails with superior destructive power. The few alternative movements to simple walking and shooting are given by pressing the right analog, which allows you to make small jumps to overcome low obstacles, and the left analog, which allows you to perform a quick dodge in the selected direction. These few commands, plus the ability to switch equipped weapons and grab scenery items with the X key, are all you need to know to progress through levels. The gameplay, occasionally, is modified by the introduction of some means, of the most disparate types, to be used to complete some phases of the game: a romantic swan-shaped boat to shoot down the pirate monsters that infest the pond in the park, a sort of super go-kart with a built-in machine gun, and even an armored mech, built by assembling parts from a small car. In still other situations, always quoting the old Zombies Ate My Neighbors, the protagonists are transformed into beasts of various kinds, such as werewolves, mummies, vampires or zombies who donate super-powers and different attack methods for a limited period. Crazy monsters It is quite obvious that Monster Madness is not a game programmed to rise to high qualitative peaks, within the current videogame offer. The extremely simple structure, and the graphic style adopted, demonstrate that more than great pretensions, the aim of Artificial Studios and Immersion Games was to create a fun and nice game. The problem is that Monster Madness is characterized by numerous flaws, which affect its overall quality. Some of these are somewhat structural, and you have to live with it from the first minutes of the game: first of all the confusion ggenerated by the aerial camera, the only one available in the multiplayer mode, makes everything unmanageable, even if with a little habit the defect can be overlooked, the fact remains that especially in the phases where you have to climb upwards, being able to doing exactly what you want is practically impossible. This problem is associated with the poor fluidity in scrolling the scenario, which is badly associated with the frenzy of the action, but even in this case these are not decisive problems, even if they partially undermine the quality level of the graphics sector. The latter, created using the famous Unreal Engine, does not make one cry for a miracle, but defends itself with dignity: the comic and grotesque look of the characters and monsters does its duty well, while the scenarios in some cases are decidedly pleasant, with good lighting effects and reflections, although often characterized by somewhat questionable chromatic choices, but generally in line with the caricatured aspect of the whole product. The biggest problems are the bugs that appear periodically during the game experience and which often make the situation completely lose control. In some points the bad management of collisions makes it impossible to continue, since you are unable to jump over an obstacle that should be easily within reach, in others the automatic respawn causes your character to be reborn in a point of the screen from which the fulcrum cannot be reached of the action, creating a total stalemate. In one case in particular, after the death of the characters and their ~rebirth~, the camera continued to frame the last game area reached, with the protagonists who therefore remained totally ~off the field~, with no possibility of being controlled , thus facing a quick elimination. These are episodic errors, certainly, but the frequency with which they were detected during the game test suggests that the testing period to which the product was subjected was absolutely not sufficient to eliminate the bugs present in the code. Xbox 360 goals The objectives of Monster Madness are arranged in such a way as to reward both the most ferocious player in battles with monsters, and the one most dedicated to exploring the levels. In all, there are 50 achievements for a total of 1000 gamerpoints: some are unlocked by achieving particular results, such as ~walking 1000 kilometers~ or ~killing 10,000 monsters~, or ~collecting 72 special melee weapons~. Others can be unlocked by focusing more on exploration, such as ~collecting all weapon fragments~ scattered throughout the levels. In general, some objectives, those strictly related to progress in the game, are easily achieved, but many will require a lot of effort. Comment Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia is a nice old school action game, a light-hearted and simple shooter that is quite fun, especially in multiplayer. This flavor, with frequent references to some past successes, is certainly fascinating, such as the comic style adopted and the references to certain youth-horror productions of 80s cinema. However, the game offers a good amount of levels and hours of gameplay, with a small online mode via Xbox Live that allows you to collide directly against other human opponents. However, for a game that relies entirely on fast and immediate gameplay, the problems associated with the use of the camera and the poor fluidity of the action are heavy, and the bugs present are equally debilitating, which periodically ruin the gaming experience. Too bad, with a little more care, and an adequate testing period, Monster Madness would certainly have deserved more. Pros: Pleasant atmosphere, full of humor Fun, especially in multiplayer Cons: Graphics not up to par with other contemporary productions Poor fluidity and clarity in the action Presence of bugs, even quite serious ones", "date": "2007-06-06", "grade": null}
