The demigods, the Demigods in fact, coming from the world of mortals must therefore fight and kill each other until a single, unique demigod is unable to indissolubly affirm his divine power. Hard-core What may seem like a rather spartan plot and written within a quarter of an hour between one developer meeting and another, on balance turns out to be just like that. In support, an atypical cross between an action role-playing and a real-time strategy game designed specifically for multiplayer and strongly oriented towards the so-called hard-core players, those used to ~investing~ several hours a week in a game to dissect every single aspect of the mechanics, perhaps disregarding other less choreographic aspects. The original sin of Demigod seems to be just this: focus on a hyper-specialized and very demanding slice of the public (dissatisfying everyone else) and fail, at least partially, in your intent. Thus managing to disappoint everyone a little. Mind you, the structure of Demigod was and still remains valid and able to offer playful ideas worthy of note, the problem is that despite a rather thorough beta-testing phase, even today the title lends itself to more youthful defects or less serious. A clear example of this situation is the game's net code, which has practically prevented a large number of players from being able to play online, due to connection problems due to the particular P2P architecture on which the network infrastructure seems to be based. To this we add the fact that the entire single player counterpart gets bored already after a couple of games against the bots controlled by the artificial intelligence scripts. In addition to the various technical problems and exploits on which the Gas Powered Games programmers are working hard (let's acknowledge them) by releasing patches on an almost daily basis, precisely from the point of view of the hard-core gamer, game balancing denounces the need for a further refinement work. Playing among ~friends~ it could also go unnoticed, but clashing against well-trained players and against the right combination of opponents, winning becomes almost impossible, while losing takes on an almost mathematical nuance. With a good match-making engine at least this problem would have been mitigated, unfortunately - at least in the current state of things - everything that resides outside the game mechanics, understood as the user interface, account management, game search and so on saying, it appeared to us rather sparse and lacking in options. Considering the nature of the game, that's no mean feat. To be or to appear? Once you have managed to connect without problems and found a non-unbalanced game, the game (inspired by a famous MODifca for Warcraft III, we recall) manages to entertain and distinguish itself from the vast majority of all other online titles. The third-person point-and-click interface applied to a game system usually combined with first-person shooters gives life to a title with a certain personality. Although the action component is not entirely accessory, for once to win it will not be necessary to have fiber optic connections, rather than the reflections of a rabbit fallen into a bag of cocaine, but rather a good vision of the game, able to integrate best with the characteristics of the Demigods commanded by their teammates. Looking from the other side of the sky, then, we are not even faced with a strategic one where micro-management of the units and management of resources bordering on autistic represent the only big difference between victory and mockery. The eight Demigods available, divided into Assassins and Generals, open the field to dozens of different tactics and playful insights. The former, characterized by the fact that they are not flanked by any troops, are perhaps the most immediate and simple to use, at least for even partially profitable use. The Generals, on the other hand, by introducing the management, albeit rather basic, of the support troops put the player in front of more numerous usage variables. Learning to make the best use of each of them rather than delving into the most profitable growth paths, may require a considerable amount of time. Graphically the game certainly fails to impress. Although excellent from the point of view of level design, the arenas in particular do not offer noteworthy ideas, except for some backgrounds. The situation is decidedly better when talking about the three-dimensional models of the Demigods and the altsre characters on screen, both stylistically and in terms of the number of polygons used. Of course, after a few games you won't pay any attention to it and, on the contrary, you will find yourself lowering the level of detail to decrease ping times - which will then also affect the connections of all the other connected players, given the particular net code. Unlike what all the other great (and not) online successes of recent years have accustomed us to, the game does not offer any native support for modifications by users except, at least partially, as regards the features of the three-dimensional models of the personages. Let's forget about new or unreleased maps and particular game modes. Ultimately, a game more geared towards substance than appearance or, awkwardly paraphrasing the catchphrase of a famous commercial, for a few but not for everyone.", "date": "2009-05-28", "grade": "7.1"}
