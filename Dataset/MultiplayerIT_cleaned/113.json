{"name": "Okami", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/okami.html", "text": "Tell me a story... The plot that is the background to Okami is based on Japanese legends, and therefore enjoys a very particular atmosphere and style. The protagonist is Amaterasu, divinity of the sun, who descended to earth in the form of a white-haired wolf with the aim of eliminating the perfidious demon Orochi and thus putting an end to his desire to destroy Japan and all its inhabitants; all this thanks also to the support of Issun, an artist with tiny dimensions who is rather intrusive but also generous with advice and suggestions. A fairy tale with an oriental taste both in substance and in form, since Okami can count on an absolutely unique graphic style. The technique adopted is that of cel-shading, so fashionable a few years ago and then put back in the drawer by practically everyone; Clover Studio decided to choose her for this project instead, and honestly we couldn't have imagined a better solution. The result is visually something wonderful, thanks to a stretch of the design that we don't struggle to define sincerely artistic and, simply, beautiful. The sensation, playing Okami, is of being in the middle of a colorful watercolor painting, alive, constantly evolving and ready to give emotions at every step. Remaining insensitive to the graphic component of the Capcom production is something that we believe is impossible to do even for the most experienced and savvy player; lovers instead of the typical visual style of Japanese art will probably find the Holy Grail of video games in Okami. More generally, however, not only the use by the programmers of the now outdated hardware of Ps2, really pushed beyond its limits, but also the attention to detail that shines through every single aesthetic aspect of the Clover Studio effort remains surprising. How else to define the luxuriant growth of grass and flowers that follows the passage of Amaterasu, or the whirlwind of pink petals that accompanies the protagonist's most important actions, or even the beautifully crafted animations of every single character or living being on the screen. But more than a thousand words it is worth observing Okami in action with your own eyes, to realize that (visual) originality in video games still exists. The story, we said, follows the typical lines of oriental mythology, with a plot that unfolds far beyond the thin line of mere connection between events. On the contrary, the Capcom production is a title that relies heavily on the text, with long dialogues whose reading is undoubtedly recommended. The characters ~speak~ with a verse language similar to the one used, just to give a couple of examples, in Banjo-Kazooie or in Ocarina of Time; a solution that for some might seem annoying in the long run, but which in any case represents a preferable expedient, given the general atmosphere, to actual dubbing. Link to the wolf Okami has often been compared, in terms of gameplay, to Zelda. In reality, the points of contact are at least as many as those of detachment from the Nintendo masterpiece, thus doing the Clover Studio product much more justice than that linked to a hypothetical well-made ~Zelda clone~. Sure, it's about wandering inside a large game world (in this case Japan), eliminating enemies, facing dungeons with attached final bosses, completing side quests and solving more or less simple puzzles. Without a doubt there is no shortage of objects to use, techniques to learn and menus in ~Zelda style~. But the use of the magical brush, for example, is so valid and well studied that it alone gives Okami all the personality it may possibly need. As many will already know, this term means the possibility of using the left analog stick to trace drawings and strokes of various shapes, as if you were directly controlling a brush. Within the game there are a total of 15 techniques, which correspond to as many ~drawings~ to be created on the screen to obtain a series of effects, both on the scenario and in combat. For example you can draw a bridge to be able to continue on an otherwise blocked path, or a bomb to blow up fragile rock walls, or cut rocks or other objects in half to get bonuses and so on. During the aforementioned fights, which take place in real time, the magical brush can provide decisive help to go where Amaterasu's strength is not sufficient. To strengthen an already robust mechanic we then think about the ability to obtain new weapons, main and secondary, additional techniques and experience points to spend to improve the characteristics of the protagonist. Despite being a linear progress game, Okami provides una such a quantity of secondary objectives and parallel quests as to make spending hours in front of the TV truly a full and rewarding experience. And the hours are decidedly numerous, from 30 to 40 to complete the adventure in its entirety at 100%; let me be clear though, Okami is a product that prefers to accompany the player, tell his story and show his progress. Precisely for this reason the difficulty level is rather low, never particularly demanding even during boss fights; not a negative point in our opinion, but it is right to point this out so as not to delude those looking for a certain level of challenge. One last quote for the musical accompaniment, simply fantastic and perfectly in keeping with the setting thanks to above-average quality songs. Comment Okami is a game that shouldn't be missing in the collection of any gamer worthy of the name. The Clover Studio production is one of those titles that transcends the console to which it belongs, instead taking its place in the small circle of names that really deserve to be remembered after many years. In addition to an artistically sumptuous and technically excellent graphic component, Okami also brings with it a superfine gameplay, beautifully studied and capable of embracing and involving the player in a story that is a pain to complete. In the face of such works of art, watching the closure of Clover Studio helplessly represents a videogame mourning whose weight perhaps we will only understand in some time. Pros Aesthetically one of the most beautiful games ever made Excellent mechanics and no real weaknesses Great longevity and excellent sound Cons Long wait for the PAL version, and no Italian localization and 16:9 format... Maybe too easy for some Italian version The PAL version of Okami does not bring substantial differences compared to the US version, at least as far as we Italians are concerned. The game, in fact, has suffered a considerable delay on European territory due to the long processing required for localization in the main languages of the Old Continent, among which, however, Italian is not included. The available languages to choose from are in fact English, German and French, while the instruction booklet is only in English. There are no extras for the European version, while as regards the video options there is the possibility of viewing the game in 60Hz NTSC mode but the 16:9 widescreen format is not present. However, there is an option to tell the game if you are viewing it on a CRT or LCD TV, in order to optimize brightness and contrast. Sin. It's a real pity that Okami was released on the US market (and only today on the PAL one...) when the hype and the interest of the media and the public in it had faded, totally channeled into the frenetic next-gen race , the same one that has led many to consider the console generation now over. And it's a real shame that Clover Studio, one of the very few teams able in recent years to move boldly outside the box of an incredibly rigid market, was prematurely dissolved by Capcom in the name of a dubious and questionable ~productive reorganization~. Yes because Okami, from the bottom (unfortunately) of its few thousand copies sold, is undoubtedly one of the top 5 games released on Ps2 as well as the authentic masterpiece of the prematurely late Clover Studio.", "date": "2007-02-05", "grade": null}
