{"name": "Turok - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/turok-recensione_a.html", "text": "Dawn of the Dinosaurs As mentioned above, the first impact with the Touchstone title left us quite perplexed: we expected something exceptional, innovative and instead we fell into the usual clichs of the perfect killing machine versus the rest of the world, with an Unreal Engine only partially exploited and not particularly varied game mechanics. Going in order, even the plot is not saved from the usual heated soup: you will play (who would have thought it?) Turok, a tough mercenary with an excessively murky past, who then decided to take the side of the righteous in order to finally enjoy the life; unfortunately, on a mission against our pet's former employer, the spaceship crashes and we find ourselves surrounded not only by our irritated old comrades in arms, but also by ravenous dinosaurs, directly imported from Spielberg Park. You players will thus advance through the game levels, massacring everything you come across, occasionally enjoying a sweaty interlude movie, but nothing more, nothing less: the usual story we've been used to for years, but as long as you fun, why change? Utahraptor? The question arises spontaneously why Turok is fun, if the gameplay follows the classic patterns, and the reason lies in those aspects that distinguish this game from the crowd. The first element of distinction is represented by the presence of dinosaurs, in all their various shapes and sizes: we go from crossing with small and agile Utahraptors, up to the colossal T-Rex, passing through some other race of which, forgive the extreme ignorance in the field, we ignore the name. Apart from the merely zoological discourse, these nice and extinct little creatures could prove to be, if necessary, precious allies if you know how to grasp the suggestions given by the developers: why face a large group of enemies armed to the teeth, if you have the possibility of unleashing against them the nature? For the purposes of the game mechanics, the possibility of resorting to tricks to make your life easier is certainly not new, but it still represents an alternative that will be up to you to decide to take and which, especially as the difficulty level increases , you should take advantage of it, because Turok is strictly a slave to its complexity: at the lowest level (and, we add, more boring), the game completely loses its bite, allowing you to advance regardless of your opponents and exterminate them effortlessly; the matter at the normal or even difficult level of difficulty is different, where you will see your stealth attempts and the use of more elaborate tactics than tirelessly advancing pay off handsomely. Mulino Bianco flavour Whether you opt for the tank approach or the Sam Fisher one, the guys at Propaganda Games have given you the possibility to choose from a large arsenal, where each tool of death is characterized by the presence of a secondary attack: this represents more of a maneuver commercial than anything else, of course, but in any case you will be able to enjoy the extermination in the form of grenades, knives, pistols, machine guns, heavy gatlings and the inevitable bow, which adds that pleasant return to the origins to the entire game. the spaceship crashes and we find ourselves surrounded not only by our old irritated comrades in arms, but also by ravenous dinosaurs, directly imported from Spielberg Park Mulino Bianco flavour We will also be linked to the flavors of the past, but crouching in the tall grass, emerging when an enemy appears, running, doing a lateral somersault and then shooting an arrow that impales the opponent against a tree has a completely different flavor than conclude the action with a vulgar rifle: you will therefore make extensive use of the bow especially when you discover the possibility of detonating groups of enemies with exotic explosive arrows. The use of weapons is combined in an acceptable way with the design of the maps: despite being, except in rare cases, a fixed path, the structure vaguely resembles long corridors (someone said DooM?) that connect combat arenas, where you will see human opponents and dinosaurs fighting like blacksmiths: this solution, combined with the right alternation of outdoor and indoor locations, proves to be a good value of the game, so you will rarely get bored with a certain setting, thanks also to a discreet level design , although not particularly inspired. Not all dinosaurs come with a hole While the game maps are quite varied, the same cannot be said for your human opponents: playing on a low difficulty level, we managed to finish the game without practically ever dying, also thanks to an art intelligencenot exactly excellent official that makes our enemies rather prone to suicide. Once a higher level of difficulty has been set (read Normal or Difficult), Turok begins to give a hard time even to those who have grown up on bread and shooters since the dawn, presenting themselves in a completely different way in the eyes of the gamer. For the sake of completeness it must be said that the AI does not vary according to the difficulty, but the only parameter that is modified is the amount of damage that enemy weapons inflict, quickly bringing you to game over with a couple of hits (or bites , depending on the case): all this translates into the player's greater attention in looking for alternative solutions and covers, with the always vivid hope of crossing a benevolent checkpoint around the corner you are about to turn. Speaking of defects, we must also underline the almost total absence of a physics engine, which is limited only to the ragdoll of the opponents and an Unreal Engine which, perhaps thanks to the multiplatform origin of the title, shows continuous ups and downs, especially as regards the textures of the environments, in some cases decidedly of poor quality. In general, if you are looking for a graphic revolution along the lines of Crysis in Turok, you have got the wrong title: Propaganda Games has adapted a graphics engine to make it as scalable as possible and suitable for the widest range of possible configurations, consoles included, limiting as much as possible loading times (on computers reduced to a few seconds) and focusing more on the fluidity of 60 frames per second than on quality. Comment Turok is a title that you can love and play until you drop (including achievements) or loathe and classify as a missed opportunity. After all, Propaganda Games' game is both, a small mixture of adrenaline-pumping fun (the escape from the Raptor's lair is unforgettable) and unfulfilled promises, vast marketing operations that have taken expectations beyond above the original ones. Turok is not a revolution, it has its ups and downs and will not enter the Olympus of video games. But it is fun, for several hours, it will give you a few smiles due to the charisma of the character and lots and lots of frenetic but never repetitive action. Buy it if you want to spend a month of delicious childish food, waiting for something more substantial.
