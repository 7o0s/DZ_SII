Playstack has managed to find a good compromise between a simplified and easily digestible structure, suitable for mobile users, and a remarkable completeness in terms of management and construction possibilities, which are gradually revealed through a particularly well-constructed campaign. The situation is the same as always: in the role of a newly elected mayor, we find ourselves having to personally take care of everything a city needs, from the construction of buildings to the management of work, education, entertainment, traffic and every major aspect of citizens' lives. It is a cauldron of activities that obviously go beyond the real duties of a mayor, but provide a complete simulation of everything that lies behind the correct functioning of an urban agglomeration. There is much more management than constructive creativity to be honest, particularly in the Campaign mode which sets continuous progressive objectives by funneling us along a path of discovery and learning about every single aspect of the game, but the most engaging part of Cityscapes: Sim Builder is in fact, precisely the fact of trying to constantly satisfy the citizens' requests and seeing one's own city grow and prosper, maintaining an excellent social fabric through great attention to the services and needs of the inhabitants. That said, it doesn't sound too much fun, but the game manages to put even these boring chores into a truly colorful perspective, proposing new objectives at a constant pace. Beyond the rather basic early construction phases, between roads, residential districts and paramount structures, Cityscapes: Sim Builder opens up a number of options and gameplay elements that are quite amazing, for a mobile game. Remarkable, for example, the attention to the topic of sustainability, which leads us to have to take into consideration numerous complex aspects of the city organization, in terms of use of resources, energy consumption and waste management. However, the correct construction and management of the city also includes particular attention to the general well-being of the citizens, which takes into consideration numerous other elements including traffic, clean air and the possibility of satisfying one's aspirations, all things that the inhabitants can point out directly, through messages readable by the player. The city and its needs CityScapes: Sim Builder, a screenshot of the game under construction We are quite far from the depth and breadth of Cities: Skylines, which currently represents the state of the art of this type of games on PC and consoles, but Cityscapes: Sim Builder is probably the most appropriate meeting point between the city builder and the mobile game. The fact that it was distributed through Apple Arcade, however, avoids the free-to-play drifts that could have easily emerged through a more standard business model, with some traces of these being visible from the ~city pass~ with progressive objectives to be unlocked daily or weekly and a imperative presence of an in-game currency for purchases. Fortunately, the introduction of the game in the Apple subscription catalog has made these elements an integral part of the progression in the classic sense, constituting an organic and well-structured single player campaign, which naturally leads to discovering the various construction and management aspects. The problem is that it is not always clear what we have to do and how to do it: although Cityscapes tries to guide the player in a rather rigid way, in some cases the gameplay mechanisms are not exactly immediate, also due to an interface so simplified as to be somewhat hermetic. There are also some small inconsistencies, such as the fact that citizens tend to make requests that are not yet in line with the building possibilities unlocked by the player, but these are still small things that are corrected within a few minutes of play. The control system is designed to be used with the touch screen and the interface manages to convey the necessary information in a few words and symbols, although in some cases, as we have said, it tends to exaggerate a bit with the synthesis. CityScapes: Sim Builder leads us to discover the game through objectives and tips uThe system of dragging and moving the shot is also a bit confused, with the controls which, on this front, sometimes tend to overlap when trying to position some particular structure more precisely, however they are quite understandable drawbacks for a title so layered but developed to be enjoyed using practically a finger. The simple and clean graphics gain in clarity, especially on particularly small displays, even if the attention to detail that is instead characteristic of other titles of this genre is somewhat missing, leaving little room here for the aesthetic contemplation of one's own city.", "date": "2023-06-24", "grade": "7.5"}
