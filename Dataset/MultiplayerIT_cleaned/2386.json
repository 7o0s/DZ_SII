{"name": "Final Fight One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fight-one.html", "text": "STYLE FIRST OF ALL An apt blend makes this game timeless, still flaunting the power of solid 2D today. You will be able to destroy bins, collect objects, use and throw weapons, see the ~life-meter~ of each opponent you are beating up, perform amazing special moves (which however weaken your energy), let off steam in hooligan bonus stages (the destruction of the car is always a masterpiece...) and face arrogant end-of-level bosses, all wonderfully punctuated by the impeccable horizontal scrolling, all in one breath until the end of the game. You can decide which character to play among the three available (Guy, Cody, Haggar), which each have a peculiar mix of speed and power. The fixed screens illustrating the dialogues of the protagonists and the evolution of the research are extremely beautiful; in general the graphic impact is always pleasant, remaining faithful to the original and where possible improving it. Even the animations reflect this philological spirit, in fact, although the GBA can do some prowess (and you can see it with the two hidden characters of Alpha-Cody and Alpha-Guy), it was preferred not to excessively alter everything. You will have 5 difficulty levels available, ranging from VeryEasy to VeryHard, to test yourself as you see fit. A notable gem is represented by the fact that the more enemies you shoot down, with the succession of games, the more secrets you unlock (a delightful invitation to barbarism). To play in two you will need two cartridges, in addition to the link cable, nice alone I know, but I think it would have been rather difficult to transmit that amount of data in real time. Leaving aside this neo there is very little to say about this title because it is splendid from all points of view. The presence of numerous secrets also guarantees a good longevity. The sound effects are pretty rough and spot on, the tunes maybe a little trivial but it's still a GBA, we can't expect miracles. GOUT BUY IT Let's summarize briefly: you have a GameBoyAdvance and some money in your pocket, well I think buying this game is a great way to spend it. The version has been improved over both the arcade and the SuperNes version. An instant title for anyone, a fast-paced enthusiast of high craftsmanship. PROS Fabulous feeling for old-school players Technically flawless Tasty secrets CONS Soundtrack could be improved Useful Links Nintendo Game Boy Ubisoft Capcom NEVER STOP FIGHTING UbiSoft has distributed this game in Europe, in its shiny new version for GameBoyAdvance. For some players of the old guard, this title means a lot; at the time it was innovative and sought after: it set new standards for the genre. Consider that a decade ago beat'em ups in dating were in an embryonic state and this was the right way to give it to yourself, alone or with a friend. Those magnificent atmospheres between the 70s and 80s, that characteristic graphics, that immediacy and that playability paw and quiver in the cartridge to be relived once again. Who would dare to leave unpunished the kidnappers of Mike Haggar's daughter, the upright mayor who will never bow his head to the Metro City underworld and least of all to the most ruthless gang: Mad Gear; certainly not us who, armed with our long and hard martial training, are ready to embrace the crusade.", "date": "2001-10-09", "grade": null}
