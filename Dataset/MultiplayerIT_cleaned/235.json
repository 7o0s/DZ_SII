Thirty-nine characters plus an unlockable boss, twelve locations, three fighting styles and dozens of special moves: these are the numbers of this new KOF, which unlike the other episodes of the series does not have a precise time location, but takes old and new characters, in different versions (see Geese Howard, here young and with long hair), and sees them fighting against each other. Going into the specifics, the game modes are basically three: Team Play, Single Play and Endless. The first two can be ~player against player~ (even online), while Endless is just a ~survival~ mode, in which you choose a character and fight against an infinite number of opponents with a single energy bar available, to establish your own endurance record. Both Team Play and Single Play have not changed from the episodes of KOF seen so far; more than anything else it is possible, once the characters have been chosen, to select a style of play between ~Super Cancel~, ~Guard Break~ and ~Max 2~. The Super Cancel style has a maximum number of times the super move gauge can fill up, as well as the ability to cancel a super move before launching it to fool the enemy. With the ~Guard Break~, on the other hand, we will also be able to parry the unstoppable moves (for example some tricks), however emptying the super move bar. Finally, the ~Max 2~ style will see the super move bar fill up automatically in a short time, for an infinite number of times, and therefore will allow us to perform our most powerful attack maneuvers even at the beginning of the fight. Oldwave. Despite the introduction of some new characters, however not very successful compared to those included in the latest editions of The King of Fighters, Neowave immediately reveals itself for what it is: a reworking of KOF2002, made without too much effort only to test the platform AtomisWave, which has been replacing Neo Geo hardware in arcades for some time now. The thing that first catches the eye are the sprites, since they haven't changed one iota compared to the past: in low resolution, without any new animation and above all with just enough movement quality. The speech improves slightly if you look at the backdrops, but up to a certain point: it is a mix of polygonal and bitmap graphics, in some cases successful, in other cases not. Forget the backdrops that made the history of King of Fighters, because in Neowave you won't find any evocative locations, nothing to remember. The same can be said for the sound: effects and music are well done, but it is by no means new material. The control system has remained unchanged, after all the four-button interface is well suited to the Dual Shock 2. But whoever oversaw this conversion (Ignition) should have taken into account the fact that the directional cross of the Neo Geo joypads was a , that of the Dual Shock 2 is decidedly different, much less forgiving. The timing of the execution of the combinations had to be ~filed~ to meet the characteristics of the PS2 hardware, because you will find yourself more than once losing a match just because a special move does not come out when it should.

There is reason to be sad if a genre that was all the rage ten years ago has not been able to renew itself and adapt to the times. The King of Fighters: Neowave is unpresentable on the Sony console, given the quality of its direct opponents, both from a technical point of view and from a gameplay point of view. If this series does not want to disappear, it urgently needs new oxygen: redesigned graphics that finally contemplate high resolution, as well as at least one mode that adds thickness and therefore extends the life expectancy of a product that right now can be sold only in the budget line. Costing as much as a Platinum title, Neowave can be recommended to those who have never played KOF and want to dive into the past, without expecting great things. Pros: It's cheap Suitable for those who don't even own a KOF Some decent quality locations Cons: Absolutely nothing new Graphically inadequate characters No alternative modes Once upon a time there was SNK, a Japanese house that fought to the sound of numbers for the domination of the arcades, thanks to the powerful Neo Geo system. A platform so advanced as to represent for years the forbidden dream of many gamers, who could not afford the expensive oneshome version nor its very expensive cartridges. A platform on which fighting games flourished, initially to ride the wave of success that Capcom enjoyed thanks to Street Fighter 2, later to counter it. And so if the first Fatal Fury tried to impose its own style while still being immature from many points of view, its sequel was considered on a par with SF2, creating a crowd of enthusiasts who were then able to appreciate many variations on the theme: Art of Fighting, Samurai Shodown and precisely The King of Fighters, of which Neowave is just the umpteenth incarnation.", "date": "2006-12-05", "grade": null}
