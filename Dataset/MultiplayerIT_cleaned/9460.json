{"name": "Oggi prendo la metro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85457-cities-in-motion-oggi-prendo-la-metro.html", "text": "Once upon a time Transport Tycoon, a title developed and distributed by the glorious MicroProse in which we were called upon to manage the complicated balance of a public transport network, putting ourselves in the shoes of those who design the various types, adapting them to the needs of citizens and doing the same time so as not to devastate the aesthetics of the city beyond what is necessary. It was 1994 and the game, despite being a niche product, succeeded in its enterprise, even pushing the developers to subsequently re-propose a Deluxe version, with which the sub-genre of ~tycoon~ games dedicated to transport was definitively consecrated public. Often referred to as sim transportation. Almost twenty years after the arrival of that progenitor, the hunger of players for this genre has been witnessed by the reserved wait for Cities in Motion, the new effort by the Colossal Order team published by the Swedish company Paradox Interactive and dedicated to the management of complexes systems that hide behind public platforms on urban land. If in reality we always have someone to rail against for public transport delays, here the person to whom to address your insults will be the same person we see in the mirror every morning: are you ready to take on this responsibility? Building the future A game like Cities in Motion necessarily requires a learning phase, which is possibly favored by the game itself through a tutorial that properly introduces the mechanics. From this point of view, the work of Colossal Order does not disappoint expectations, offering a special section in which to become familiar with the game and the possibilities that are given to us to better manage the transport system. All through a well-studied introductory chapter that takes up the right amount of time to teach everything there is to learn before jumping into the fray. The only defect that can be found in the tutorial is the lack of preparation for the impact which will then come in the presence of some advanced mechanics, which will lead to the management of particularly complicated scenarios and which would have deserved a dedicated tutorial. But the beauty of a title like this is perhaps the challenge that is presented to the player. Speaking of challenges, the main mode is obviously the campaign, in which to try your hand at all the tests that the developers have chosen for us: so it happens that we find ourselves in different situations over the course of a century, with specific objectives linked to the cities chosen as setting. The latter are Amsterdam, Berlin, Helsinki and Vienna, each of which with its own needs also dictated by the historical context that we find ourselves going through. For example, it may happen that you have to modernize the public transport system in the city or instead of having to completely rebuild it from scratch, starting from the 1920s up to the present day and (slightly) beyond. The various scenarios of the campaign mode are then also available individually, together with the sandbox mode in which to jump into the game by personally choosing some difficulty parameters. The picture of the alternatives present in Cities in Motion is completed by the inevitable editor, excellent and powerful as one would expect, with which to create customized scenarios in order to continue the game once all the completions have been completed. The possibility of sharing one's creations directly online would certainly have been appreciated, but in any case it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the community will be able to organize itself in this sense. Question of balance Possible settings aside, the heart of the game is always the same: you need to build a functioning, widespread transport network that satisfies those who use it, from all points of view. All this without losing sight of the budget at the same time, like any self-respecting company. Easy said, a little less done, but the game puts its effort into meeting the player. Starting from the line construction system that is intuitive and immediate enough to be used even without a tutorial, which is still necessary to learn how to create a working line on the built layout. Either way, with just a few clicks you can create stops and lay tracks where needed, making the whole process quite simple. The challenging part lies in providing a slap-up service, which can satisfy the entire city: also in this case Cities in Motion provides a whole series of parameters and graphs to control to keep the various factors at bay. Just to give an example, the level of approval of travelers towards dn our service is always available through the appropriate bar on the screen, which can also be expanded to see in more detail how the value is distributed among the various categories of people. In fact, it is not certain that the type of transport that a worker may like will also like a student or a tourist and so on in the same way, giving the player the possibility of carrying out targeted interventions to improve the virtual company where it is really necessary. Continuing with the discussion regarding the level of satisfaction of the various social classes, the possibility of relying on targeted advertising campaigns to reach the categories in which we are most interested should also be kept in mind: pensioners through a newspaper, while students and tourists via the Internet , just to name a few examples. Given that the various scenarios offered by the game range from the period of 1920 to the present day, the available technology will also be appropriate to the historical context in which we find ourselves: this applies both to the advertising just mentioned (Internet in the 1930s?) and for the means of transport themselves, increasingly evolved as we approach the new millennium. But if on the one hand there is customer satisfaction to be taken into consideration, as it should be, on the other it is equally right to seriously take into account the corporate and national economy. Any examples? In a thriving and wealthy society, people will tend to prefer the car to public transport, just as in the event of an economic crisis citizens will be willing to see buses and trams, even if they obviously want to save on travel tickets. Finding a balance between all of this is the very essence of Cities in Motion, as well as a large part of the player's activity when he is not busy building new lines. Fortunately, the balance offered by the game is considerably meeting, immediately putting it in a position to remedy one's mistakes but always without encroaching on too much welfarism, nor in leaving the player to his own destiny and in the throes of frustration. Purists of the genre who love extreme challenges may perhaps turn up their noses a little. The difficulty, however, lies in realizing the particular situation in which we find ourselves: what to do, for example, if the cost of electricity increases and people want to pay less for the tram ticket? How to unravel an area that becomes a real traffic factory at rush hour? How to equip the city with a new line, without defacing its beauty? Questions that must also be answered by trying to juggle the various means of transport that the game offers us (land and sea buses, subway, tram and helicopter), thus managing to direct travelers to one or the other depending on the occurrence. How beautiful the city is! The substance of which Cities in Motion is made allows this game to fully do its duty also from a technical point of view: the graphics engine developed by Colossal Order is able to manage practically all game situations, while the interface is proposed in a fairly simple and intuitive way even if sometimes it is a little too intrusive, especially when there are several open elements. But it is above all the graphic detail that raises the quality of the technical sector: it is simply what one would expect from a title of this kind, with glimpses of daily life that can be fully appreciated through the excellent zoom level offered by the game. Animals, walking pedestrians, cars and all the other means that populate the streets sometimes push the player to stand still and watch with satisfaction what has been achieved in the city ecosystem. This level of immersion in the life of the streets is adequately supported by a sound that fully does its duty, bringing out of our speakers all the effects that distinguish the streets of such important cities, while being careful not to exaggerate in distracting the player from their tasks with too much chaos that can often be part of their real counterparts, especially in more modern times.", "date": "2011-02-21", "grade": "8.0"}
