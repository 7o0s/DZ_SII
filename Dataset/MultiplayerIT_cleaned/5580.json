Let's say so. The fighting game developed by Examu spurred us to discover more about a universe - that of Japanese visual novels - that we knew to a limited extent: not all the series that participate in this bizarre multimedia crossover have been translated into English, not to mention Italian. and some we had never heard of. Diving into that bottomless pit that is Google, we searched for information on Tokyo Necro, Gekk no Carnevale, Jingai Maky and other far less famous productions than Fate/zero, Senran Kagura or Arcana Heart. We didn't always like what we discovered - in short, the Lovecraftian story of Saya no Uta is quite repulsive, so to speak - but it allowed us to better contextualize the roster at our disposal in what turned out to be a decent fighting game. aimed at a small niche of true enthusiasts. Nitroplus Blasterz is a discreet fighting game dedicated to fans of the visual novels represented Few guys around there As you may have guessed if you have read our introduction without rushing to peek at just the vote, the new fighting game by Examu, the Japanese developer of two-dimensional fighting games such as Arcana Heart and Aquapazza, lines up the main protagonists of the various visual novels published by Nitroplus or those that the writers of the Japanese company worked on. Imagine it as a kind of female Marvel Vs. Capcom in which the blonde Saber of Fate/zero collides with the buxom Homura of Senran Kagura: Nitroplus Blasterz is a decidedly bizarre crossover that the Story mode, even divided into two parts, fails unfortunately to justify entirely. Before you rush to write, sour, that in a fighting game the story is not important, we want to remind you that Atlus and Arc System Works have managed to bring together the casts of the JRPG Persona 3 and Persona 4 in Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game of the highest quality that leaned on an authentic and very long visual novel. Considering the origins of Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel, it is absurd to think that many experienced screenwriters have not been able to write better: the first Story mode limits itself to proposing some cryptic dialogue between one match and another, without clarifying how and why these heroines get to meet and have to fight against each other. The answers come in Another Story mode, where the complete opposite occurs: little playing and lots of reading, but fans of the series involved will notice important differences between the heroines they know and those depicted in the crossover. The answers to many questions take a long time, and when they arrive they are not completely satisfactory: although it was clearly difficult to orchestrate this interdimensional battle, we must admit that the guys from Nitroplus and Examu didn't try too hard. To the roster, made up of fourteen characters, there are also about twenty support characters who can be ~summoned~ for the few seconds necessary to see them launch an attack during the fight, as well as a final boss, in Story mode, which reminded us the frustrating final showdowns in old-time SNK fighting games. Fortunately, the combat system of Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is solid enough to make us appreciate every hit more. Playstation 4 trophies The trophy collection associated with Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is well-stocked, with 38 bronze, 2 gold and 10 silver trophies for a total of 50 trophies to add to the platinum one. You have to complete the various modes, fight offline and online, train and use the various fighting techniques to unlock them - ironically, at the time of our test the trophy names were still in Japanese! For some but not for all It must be said that we appreciated Examu's idea of designing the combat system around the idea that fans of the visual novels represented in the roster might not be particularly accustomed to the genre of fighting games: in this way, the developer managed to conceive a game that is easy to learn but decidedly difficult to master. In this sense, the roster immediately appeared a bit unbalanced to us. While proposing the archetypes of the genre, we got the impression that the hard to control female fighters outnumbered the more accessible ones. It's quite simple to select Saber and take advantage of her wide melee attacks, a little less to manage Saya and her bizarre mid-range shots unrelated to her spriteor body. However, the various fighters are very diverse and each is unique in its own way to play, although the special moves available - to be performed through the traditional rotations of the directional cross or the analog stick, unfortunately not always as reactive as we would have liked - are actually a bit ' few, however strategically devised. The entire control system relies mainly on five buttons: one for light attacks, one for medium ones and one for heavy ones, to which are added the ingenious maneuvers of evasion and rejection. The latter, in fact, allow you to dodge attacks or drive away the enemy by simply pressing the associated keys, and provide novices with a simple and intuitive system to turn the tide of a game, disengaging themselves from difficult situations in which they would find themselves accusing the imaginative combos that the game allows you to ring. Furthermore, as we said, it is possible to recall the two selected support characters into the field after choosing the fighter, provided that the recharge indicator that determines their availability is full: this expedient limits its abuse, but it must be admitted that most some of them proved to be quite superfluous, given that some ~assists~ are excessively powerful. The circle is closed by the canonical super moves that trigger a very short cartoon sequence - here called Lethal Blaze - and some particular techniques, such as the Variable Rush, which in the hands of an expert player can literally pin opponents. We realized this by playing online, thanks to a decidedly well-structured multiplayer mode that even allows you to choose the region in which to search for other users: the netcode behaved quite well, despite some uncertainties. Unfortunately Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is a low-budget fighting game - just think that it is the spiritual sequel to what we could actually consider an amateur project - and you notice after a few minutes of play: the initial glance is deceptive, because often the discreet animations of the various wrestlers betray their colorful and defined sprites. What left us most perplexed, however, were the almost completely static scenarios and the fairly anonymous soundtrack for those unfamiliar with the original visual novels: two aspects on which much more could have been worked on.", "date": "2016-04-12", "grade": "6.0"}
