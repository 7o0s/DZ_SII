{"name": "Ski Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ski-challenge-recensione.html", "text": "Among the practically extinct genres, in what is called the triple A videogame panorama, there are winter and summer sports simulations, or those experiences that once emerged almost seasonally and which have practically stopped being produced regularly for several years. Beyond the Winter and Summer Games, even the official simulations of the Olympics have given way to different interpretations and digressions, because it is less and less justifiable to present simulations specifically dedicated to individual disciplines for sports of not enormous resonance such as skiing , for example. Also for this reason, the Ski Challenge review could come as a surprise, given that it returns to dealing with an obsolete topic such as a downhill simulation, which has managed to find space in the large and dynamic mobile panorama. MiPuMi Games, in collaboration with Greentube, has recovered the tradition of winter sports simulations with this excellent reproduction of skiing and in particular of downhill skiing, managing to find a good place on mobile platforms. What is particularly successful is above all the control system through ~tilt~, i.e. with the simple inclination of the device, which is associated surprisingly well with the flow of the ski. It is obviously not an original solution, given that it is adopted by many racing games, but in this case it tends to reproduce the movements and dynamics of the ski in a particularly sensible way, increasing identification and also resulting in very precise response to inputs. King of skiing Ski Challenge, a screenshot in the midst of a descent The gameplay is basic: it is simply a question of competing on different tracks against various opponents, exclusively in the discipline of downhill, that is, descending more or less complex routes in the shortest possible time, trying to correctly cross all the gates arranged along the track. The limitation to a single sport necessarily determines a certain repetitiveness of the game in the long run, but the fact that it lends itself well to quick sessions and the challenge offered by the presence of other players to beat manages to keep the attention on the game for a period of long enough time. On the other hand, Ski Challenge is clearly a ~seasonal~ title, using the winter atmosphere and the desire for snow to attract players for a limited time, just by its very nature. There is however a good amount of tracks to choose from that can substantially vary the action and there is no shortage of opponents: in this regard, we note the presence of the single game against artificial intelligence and classified multiplayer against real opponents, in passionate asynchronous clashes on descent times. In Ski Challenge there is a good variety of tracks inspired by real settings There is also some progression in Ski Challenge, organized through free and paid seasonal ~Ski Passes~, which set various goals for you to achieve and rewards for you to unlock. These above all concern the aesthetic modifications applicable to the character, therefore even the micro-transactions present do not affect the gameplay too much. As regards the technical aspect, Ski Challenge is rather simple but also very evocative: scenarios and characters are slightly stylized but still manage to convey the idea of the snowy slopes, while various applied and perspective effects do a great job of increasing the sense of speed, making the action quite spectacular.", "date": "2023-01-06", "grade": "7.5"}
