What aspect of trying to be innovative can be blamed? Nothing and no one. Unfortunately, after many years of development and a huge series of investments, economic but not only, APB - All Points Bulletin has not managed to present itself in the starting blocks in the way it should have been. In reality there is nothing missing compared to what was supposed, simply the technological and design effort was not sufficient to ensure that all the elements fit perfectly, bringing out a title that when it works it does it properly but which too often it breaks the magic due to a series of more or less gross imperfections. We played the beta for a long time and went through a couple of pre-launch events, then dived into the officially opened game servers in Europe on July 2nd and found ourselves in front of an experience far from negative as suggested by some rumors, but still too much in the making to really meet our expectations. A city between two fires As mentioned on other occasions, the idea is simple but fascinating: a city, divided into several areas, to act as a battlefield for the eternal challenge between criminals and policemen; a persistent world with an infinite series of quests justified by a more or less subtle narrative line, in this case not in order to arrive at who knows what final battle or end game but to create a competitive environment where the action is non-stop and with it is supposed to be fun. By choosing the criminals, infractions, crimes and raids will have to be carried out, while the guardians of the law will be busy preventing these from happening, as well as investigating some tasks assigned by the contacts to whom one can affiliate to receive the missions. Regardless of the choice of faction - and the fact that the first is a little more active while the second is more inclined to wait for calls to take over the action - the experience uses the quests as a simple excuse to set in motion the matchmaking, the beating heart of the title, which assigned some preliminary objectives to the player uses the time necessary for their completion to find one or more opponents to oppose him. In practice it cannot be said that the system itself does not work, with very few moments of pause and a series of secondary activities, such as the climb to the level of Fame and the relative temptation to become the most wanted of the map for the opposing faction , to occupy the mind in the few moments of rest. Rather, the number of players per instance does not combine perfectly with the duration of the missions, creating a situation in which it is very difficult for teams of more than four or five users to collide; few compared to what is supported in theory. Still on the front of the only partially positive aspects, San Paro is currently divided into three areas: the social district, reserved for the customization of the avatar, as described in the appropriate box, and the two in which the game itself comes to life, the Financial District and the Waterfront Discrict. The latter are two vast urban areas that mix a good amount of different possible scenarios, resulting at the same time believable and populated by a good number of non-player characters, on foot or engaged in driving. The level design is therefore of quality, probably the best that could be achieved in this sense, but unfortunately it often ends up excessively favoring the player or team who arrived first on the area to be conquered or on the object to get hold of. , in some cases suggesting excessive camping, honestly not tolerable - see the dockside warehouses of the Waterfront District. In other cases, such as in the reinterpretation of the classic VIP or in deathmatches with a number of lives for each team, if you scale down to zero, the game works better and races through the streets, collecting your companions on the same vehicle and then heading towards opponents fierce as ever, are a reason for genuine entertainment. As you want, just pay Basically, when you buy APB you get free access to the Social District and 50 hours of gameplay within the two districts where the fighting takes place. Once that package of hours is finished, you will have to proceed with the purchase of new time in two ways: for the equivalent of 6 euros in RealTime Worlds Points you get 20 additional hours, while 10 euros are worth 30 days of free play. There are also packages to subscribe for 3 or 6 months. Added to this are the costs to put customized items up for sale or acquire the possibility of doing so with those previously purchased or created and equipped at least once; this secwave part of the speech represents a point against the growth of what remains the best done aspect of the game, to date. Chinese morra Like any entirely player versus player game, APB tends to make the same situations repeat over and over again, without giving a sense of progression to an action that offers the same package of tasks from start to finish. Not bad and basically it is what happens in Team Fortress or Counter Strike, even if unfortunately in this case not all the gears are perfectly oiled. The alter ego is the only element of the experience to enjoy growth, entirely linked to the objects it possesses and to skills capable of increasing certain statistics: the money earned can therefore be spent on weapons, vehicles and the upgrades unlocked by progressing within your organization or growing in certain areas of interest, also leaving you free to go to the auction house inside the game to take a look at what is available. All this part with a vaguely role-playing flavor it falls within the realm of the positive for what will then have to prove valid in the long term and, above all, it could have been supported by a more intuitive menu management system. More problematic is the arsenal, which consists of a fairly large number of weapons belonging to the usual categories, from pistols to submachine guns, from shotguns to sniper rifles. Even if we want to overlook several balancing problems - which hopefully can be resolved in the very short term - there is always the feeling that the clash is solely determined by the type of weapon that the player and his opponent have equipped, a sort of rock-paper-scissors which, when pushed too far as in this case, is ill-suited to a shooter, especially if, as mentioned above, the first battle and therefore the conquest of a given area of interest have such a central role. The driving of the vehicles has improved compared to the beta and is now fun, even if the sensation of being behind the wheel of a washing machine has not been completely lost and the physics of the clashes still leaves several doubts. Still in the car, some unrefined dynamics take place, such as sessions in search of the opponent to steal a given object from which often, when alone or in a very small group, resolve themselves into a chase lasting entire minutes without any hope of reaching and stopping the other escape. Overall, the big impediment to the success of APB - All Points Bulletin, to see from the writer, is the inability to entertain even when the mission does not end in one's favor: various elements tend to gratify only the winning players, resulting in frustration for the others. It is therefore not a question of repetitiveness, inherent in any player vs player, but in the only partial satisfaction that the elements that compose it are able to give. I (Fucking) Love Shopping The editors included in APB - All Points Bulletin are, in a nutshell, exceptional. Users can make and, surprisingly given the release for a few days, are making, a series of changes to practically every aspect related to their experience. The system for creating logos, tattoos, graphics and themes is the same as Forza Motorsport , using different overlapping ~labels~ to give the possibility of achieving any desired result - provided you are good enough - without weighing down the game as it would happen if you had opted for the creation and saving of new textures. The themes or logos created can be spent as much on clothing as on objects and vehicles, adding to the many options for modeling the physique of one's alter ego, even in this case enough to waste several hours on it. There is also a special music editor with which to manage the tracklist and create unreleased songs, which can also be used as a personal jingle or for your group. Just take a tour of the auction house inside the game to understand what levels of ~politically incorrect~ you can get. Different from usual As for the controls, APB does a good job, letting you manage the character with the mouse and keyboard perfectly thanks to a series of intelligent solutions, such as the use of a single key, F, for all environmental interactions. In a similar way, aiming and shooting is intuitive, so it's a pity that the feedback of the shots is not so well done and instead of a classic life management system, with a total of decreasing points, we have opted for the now standard absorption of damage over time; the other solution would probably have solved some imbalances and made the a more dynamicv take turns at key locations on the maps. As far as the quality of the netcode is concerned, the situation has improved a lot over the months and today there seem to be no problems whatsoever, except in a few sporadic occasions. Voice chat is good, necessary to better communicate with teammates and absolutely a key tool to enjoy the experience to the fullest. Technically the use of the Unreal Engine, for once, has not resulted in the usual look that titles powered by Epic's engine have and it has been successfully adapted to the game's vast environments, especially considering that it is an entirely online title. The modeling of the characters, vehicles and buildings is therefore valid, making up for the rather trivial starting style thanks to the excellent editor. With the test configuration, all settings maxed out at a resolution of 1440x900, there were no problems with fluidity at an average of 60 images per second. The customization of the graphic settings is bad, really devoid of options. Finally, there is the problem of possible developments in the coming months and the opportunity, after the first fifty hours of gameplay in the districts dedicated to combat, to buy more. At the moment, with the defects that currently afflict the experience, it is difficult to think that many could extend their stay, paying supplements, on the streets of San Paro.", "date": "2010-07-09", "grade": "6.5"}
