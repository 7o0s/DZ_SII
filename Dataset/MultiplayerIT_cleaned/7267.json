However, the news arriving from the Frontier does not end here: in fact, the release of Apex Legends Mobile is scheduled for May 17, which will make the world of Apex games within reach of smartphones. We got to try it for a few weeks and we tell you everything there is to know in the review of Apex Legends Mobile. Introduction to Apex Legends Mobile The main menu of Apex Legends Mobile Apex Legends Mobile offers the winning formula of its PC and console version, but adding a corollary of exclusive content around the ~pocket~ experience. Respawn's goal, said Mike Hoff (Senior Director), was to offer the public an experience as close as possible to that already known by the public in the past three years, but at the same time enhance it with a series of innovations designed tailored for mobile, as well as a technical optimization specifically designed for the platform. This means, going into the heart of the matter, that there will be no cross-platform inventory management (Legends skins, weapon skins and other cosmetic extras), progression and battle pass, which will also be present with its own version on mobile. A choice that in our opinion is sensible because it is said that those who are passionate about the mobile application will switch to the PC / console version and vice versa. For this reason, the introduction to Apex Legends Mobile takes nothing for granted and accompanies the player in all the initial steps. The founding pillar on which Respawn has built the experience, Jordan Patz (Design Director) told us, is that of the maximum usability of the product, a concept that passes through different design choices. First, the development team went through every single building block of the game, analyzing and optimizing it for the mobile experience; an example is Pathfinder's Grapple ability, which can only be launched when aiming locates a hookable surface. Another decision taken by the developers to help new players settle into the mobile experience is that of having thought of exclusive modes for Apex Legends Mobile, a path that has already been undertaken for some time also for the PC / console version and which we will tell you about shortly in the next paragraph. The last factor, this time totally disruptive but aimed at improving the experience of new players, is the introduction of the third person. The fact that Apex Legends Mobile is a full-fledged stand-alone game could scare fans, given that Respawn usually narrates the events of the Titanfall / Apex Legends expanded universe using different communication channels. Hoff assured that nothing of Apex's already written lore will be changed in any way and that the mobile version will simply expand some narrative aspects. The expedient used for Season 1 Mobile is that of the television program: all the narrative details will be enjoyed by the player through a fictitious TV program broadcast by the Syndicate, a sort of day-by-day commentary of the Apex games, however told from the point of view of mysterious organization. Legends game and management modes Some of the events featured in Season 1 of Apex Legends Mobile We mentioned earlier the special game modes designed exclusively for the mobile version. Alongside the classic Battle Royale mode and ranked matches (playable on the World's Edge map), players at launch will find a 6v6 mode, where Legends will battle to rack up kills against the other team. The respawn in these games is very fast and designed to encourage players to jump into the fray and become familiar with the firefights. The 6v6 is distinguished in ~Clash~ (playable in the Artillery and Market areas of King's Canyon and the Aqueduct arena) in which you will be teleported to your base after dying, or Deathmatch (playable in the Artillery and Skull Town areas of Canyon del King and World's End Spa), where the teleporter will take us in the vicinity of our team. These are accompanied by a cinematic tutorial level, free practice in the shooting range and exclusive events such as the beloved Armed and Dangerous (snipers against shotguns). The Legends available at the launch of Apex Legends Mobile The work done on the characters is also interesting. The launch roster includes the most beloved Legends from the Apex games and at launch will feature Bangalore, Bloodhound, Caustic, Gibraltar, Lifeline, Mirage, Octane, Pathfinder and Wraith, plus a'mobile exclusive addition: Fade. We want to hearten everyone immediately by saying that the Legends can obviously be unlocked with real money or by gradually leveling up (the last to be unlocked will be Caustic at level 20), while for Fade things are slightly different because you will have to collect ten Fade Fragments to unlock the Legend. You will get these fragments by progressing with the level of the Battle Pass which, as always, has a double progression line: the standard and free one (in which the Fragments are contained) and the Premium one available only through payment with real money, which however adds they are extra cosmetic material. The battle pass will last a month, while as regards the contents of the Seasons, a Season Hub has been inserted in the initial menu in which all the news of the season are summarized. Obviously there will also be exclusive challenges every 24 hours and rewards to be redeemed with the daily log-in. The Octane perk tree However, there is another mechanic linked to the Legends and much more rooted in the gameplay that particularly intrigued us, namely the tree of advantages. Each legend will be equipped, as usual, with three unique skills, divided into passive, tactical and ultimate. Alongside these, which remain unchanged compared to the PC / console version, there will also be a tree of additional advantages: the more we play with a specific Legend, the more Legend points we will collect for that single character. We will then be able to spend those points in the perk tree by unlocking further unique passive skills, which will remain permanently linked to the character. The more we play, therefore, the stronger our Legends will become without however going to upset the balance of the games, because we are talking about small perks that are not heavy in the game economy. A mechanic that we honestly find interesting and that goes well with the mobile soul of the game. New Legend: Fade Fade is the first Legend exclusive to Apex Legends Mobile Among the exclusive contents arriving for Apex Legends Mobile there will also be Legends designed exclusively for the smartphone version. The developers have said that it is not impossible that some of the Legends already present in the PC / console roster can arrive on mobile, but it is practically impossible for the mobile ones to make the reverse transition. This, according to Respawn, serves to maintain the balance as balanced as possible, and it is no coincidence that the last Legend arrived in Season 13 is a defensive support (which the roster desperately needed) and that instead Fade is a particularly aggressive attacking legend with some tactical implications. But who is this new character? Fade is part of a family of mercenaries: the mysterious fighter has lost everyone and everything and is looking for a desperate revenge. For this he stole a phasic armor, equipped with the same technology as Wraith, and is willing to do anything to get justice ... the Apex games are just the beginning. Wake, Flashback, and Phase Camera are Fade's three unique abilities Speaking of abilities, let's start with the passive, Wake: when Fade slips, his armor absorbs kinetic energy, increasing his speed. The tactical ability, however, called Flashback, has something of dj vu because it allows Fade to enter quantum space with a phasic leap, rewinding his actions and bringing him back about 60 meters further back in his path. Overwatch players will recognize this ability because it is identical (even in name) to Tracer's. Although it has already been widely seen in Overwatch, we are curious to find out in the future where this ability will place Fade in the Apex Legends Mobile meta. Finally, his ultimate Phase Chamber is a bomb that teleports everyone within the detonation radius of the device to the Quantum Oblivion for a few seconds. This ultimate can be used in two different ways: either by directing it towards an enemy team, to momentarily imprison them in quantum space and reposition your team to surprise them, or on Fade's own team, to guarantee an effective escape. We admit that Fade is really intriguing as a Legend, and we are a little sorry to know that we don't have it on PC and consoles, but we are equally aware that skills of this type would be heavily unbalanced within the current gaming experience. Game feedback and technical side An image of the Apex Legends Mobile shooting range And finally, we come to the real feedback from Apex Legends Mobile: how is it to fight and shoot on smartphones? We were definitely amazed after our tests with Apex Legends Mobile, which turns out to be extremely pleasant overall from alreadyocare, maintaining the high levels of precision to which Respawn has always accustomed the public. The title, in addition to offering the possibility of being played in first or third person, offers two screen interface and three control modes, as well as implementing a long series of options for customizing the commands and their sensitivity. On the left side of the controls interface are the digital stick for movement and a button dedicated to shooting. On the right side, however, there are several keys reserved only for the fire options: a key is for rapid shooting, one for shooting with a viewfinder (therefore entering and exiting aiming mode by pressing and releasing the key) and finally a key for entering and exit aiming mode, which must be combined with a shoot key to fire. This works well with the different types of weapons: you can easily fire without aiming with a shotgun, switch in and out of aiming with an SMG or LMG and toggle aim and fire with the right button if you are using a sniper rifle . On the left side there are also buttons for jumping, crouching and reloading the weapon while aiming is managed by pressing in any direction with the right thumb. Positioned at the top right the two keys for tactical and ultimate skills while at the bottom in the center we find the two equipped weapons. To the right of the weapons is the wheel dedicated to batteries and medkits while to the left is the backpack and grenades; pressing on the backpack expands the inventory menu. Obviously we will be able to indicate objects and places with the key dedicated to the report and the objects can be collected with a key depicting a hand: there a small drop-down menu will open which will ask you which objects you want to collect, the same thing for opening the chests of death and the assistance capsules. Finally, there is no shortage of all the information necessary in the game such as the number of remaining teams and the game map, which finds all the microphone and group chat keys lined up on its right side. A rookie rewards system welcomes new players to Apex Legends Mobile What we've loved, and would love to have on PC and consoles as well, is the automatic collection and equipping of ammo and weapon upgrades. For example, if you equip an Alternator, the game will automatically collect light ammunition and everything you need to upgrade your weapon such as scope, magazine, stock and hop-up, but that's not all. If by killing an enemy, you find equipment of higher value than yours in his death chest, the game will automatically exchange it. Obviously this option can be disabled but we found it really comfortable and there it will be up to you to decide whether to opt for extreme comfort by giving up control of the backpack a little, because obviously the downside is finding yourself full of ammunition, batteries and syringes. We found it easier to cycle through your inventory and clean up! Moving the discussion to the technical sector, the game looks good, resulting clearly more bare and angular than its PC / console counterpart, but still proving to be honest from a graphic point of view. The game provides a wide variety of settings to improve and customize the graphics sector, responding to the performance of different devices. We tested the game with the suggested options, playing it on a Samsung Note 10 Lite (Chipset: SAMSUNG Exynos 9 Octa 9810 and GPU: Mali-G72 MP18). The graphic quality is compensated with a very high precision and response of the commands However, it is the feedback that has left us really impressed on a technical level. During firefights, the commands are really precise and with zero latency on the 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display used for the test. However, what really amazes is the feedback of each individual weapon, so faithful as to be extremely close to that tested on the console if a support pad is used. After all, anyone who plays Apex Legends knows that shooting an R99 is not like doing it with a Flatline and shooting a Triple Take is not like using a 30-30 Repeater. As mentioned above, we also tested the game with pad support, using one for Xbox Series X. We cannot, to date, tell you exactly if players who use the pad will also collide against those who use the touch screen. but what we can tell you is that the performance of the touch screen is still of the highest level and in our opinion what really makes the difference is finding a correct calibration of the pointing speed (which we have slightly lowered when playing with the pad, for example).Update later one month after launch. The first days post day one were really intense and you could feel the weight at which the servers was", "date": "2022-06-08", "grade": "7.8"}
