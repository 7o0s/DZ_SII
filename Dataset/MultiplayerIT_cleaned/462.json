{"name": "Jackie Chan Adventures", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jackie-chan-adventures.html", "text": "The Cartoon Style Graphically, JC Adventures is very unique, and tries in every way to recreate the simplistic and colorful style of the cartoon. The technique used is that of cel-shading, which makes the drawings very defined and ~cartoony~, and also gives that particular two-dimensional effect to 3D environments. JC Adventures, although it could be pleasant and flawless looked at from normal screenshots, in reality it is not for two reasons: firstly, the drawings are excessively simple and poor in details, and also the animations are technically poor, secondly place the game is not free from annoying slowdowns. Fortunately both problems are not extremely relevant, in fact the slowdowns are not excessive and occur sporadically, while the graphics, although very sparse, are still of a discreet visual impact. Another small problem that derives from the type of design adopted is that it becomes a little difficult to understand well which objects it is possible to interact with, for example the doors that can be opened are designed in the same way as those ~for embellishment~ and it is therefore difficult to distinguish them. The sound sector turns out to be average due to mild effects while the soundtrack manages to raise the global acoustic level of the game a little with catchy and captivating motifs, even if unfortunately they do not stand out for their originality and in the long run they become monotonous. Even the Italian dubbing does not differ much from the low technical level, due to dialogues of dubious workmanship and poor expressiveness. The Way Of The Dragon The structure of JC Adventures is very similar to that of most of the action games out there. Our hero, armed with kicks and punches, will have to explore various locations in search of the talismans and defeat the henchmen of the Black Hand who will hinder him. Governing the character is immediate from the early stages of the game, considering that there are few basic controls to learn: jumping and kicking and punching will be all you need in your adventure. The game is essentially divided into two main parts, the exploratory one, and the fighting one. Exploration is very reminiscent of role-playing games and can take place differently depending on where you are, for example in a city your task will be to talk to the inhabitants to acquire useful information to continue the story. If, on the other hand, you find yourself in a temple in search of the talismans, you will have to solve small puzzles and make the best use of Jackie's skills to overcome obstacles. The main flaw is that all this has been rendered with a monstrous simplicity, the puzzles do not need an excessive use of gray matter due to their obviousness, and are almost always reduced to the movement of a boulder, the movement of a lever or to the use of the power of the talismans, which allows Jackie to increase speed, strength, and even transform into a monkey to climb walls. Fortunately, the camera system allows you to always keep the situation under control and only in the most frenetic moments will you be forced to adjust the view manually. The combat phases are also boring and easy. Jackie has two types of attack available, punch and kick, alternating which it is possible to perform a three-hit combo. It also has the ability to parry the blows of enemies to make a counter, to use various objects to use as weapons, and to exploit the powers of the talismans to simplify the fights. Since there are few options in battle, the actions will be limited to the repeated use of the kick and punch keys; if we then add the fact that the enemies, in addition to not being very varied in typology, also have a bad artificial intelligence, and that the animations and sound effects are trivial and not very engaging, we easily arrive at the conclusion that the fights have a level of playability and competition especially indicated for a younger audience. ...About Longevity To expand the gaming experience, JC Adventures offers a varied number of minigames, some of these made interesting by the fact that it is possible to play them using the Eyetoy. Despite this innovative addition, the mini-games are trivial and simple to complete, for example one will see Jackie grappling with the jump rope and you will have to press the key at the right time, another will allow you to ~fight~ against the infamous wooden man always using the ~press the right button at the right time~ system, you will also have the opportunity to participate in an auction to grab the object requested by Jackie's uncle, using the least amount of money possible. Unfortunately, even though the minigames sare always welcome, it must be said that these add little to what is already in itself an adventure unfortunately not exciting. It will take just 5 hours to finish it, to reiterate how the target of the game is aimed only at a very immature group of players. JC Adventures is undoubtedly a game specially designed for teenagers and fans of the cartoon, which explains the low difficulty and style that characterize this title. However, the defects are not limited only to the difficulty level, but also to the technical and playability side, where they are quite evident. The game therefore remains recommended only to members of the aforementioned category, who in any case will find a game that certainly cannot be said to be exciting. Pros: cartoonish impact faithfully reproduces the TV show Cons: below average technical level boring and monotonous mediocre playability All martial arts film fans will know perfectly who Jackie Chan is, given that together with Bruce Lee he contributed to the spread in the West of a film genre born exclusively for an Eastern audience. However, the Chinese actor did not limit himself only to the world of cinema, but also became the protagonist of a cartoon for children, from which this video game of the same name was based. Jackie Chan Adventures is therefore a cartoon-like action game that partially incorporates the adventures of the television show in which Jackie Chan plays the role of an expert archaeologist who works for the government's secret services. The objective of our videogame adventure will be to travel the world in search of 12 particular magical talismans which, in addition to representing the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac, grant special powers to those in their possession. Obviously the search won't be a walk in the park, and Jackie will have to deal with the bad guys of the Black Hand gang who need these talismans to summon demons and conquer the world.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
