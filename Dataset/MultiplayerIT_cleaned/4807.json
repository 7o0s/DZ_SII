For some time the releases of the main series have been rarefied, as it should be, and the Finnish team has concentrated on publishing, entrusting its main brand to various developers to create more or less successful spin-offs, more or less funny. The latest is precisely Angry Birds Evolution, whose ~bouncing~ mechanisms immediately make one think of the discreet but not exciting Angry Birds Action!, released last year. In reality, however, the two products are very different and the approach of this latest iteration draws on the genre of RPG and strategy to offer us challenging turn-based battles with a certain depth; all with a roster made up of over seven hundred birds, many of which are completely new, divided into five classes and endowed with peculiar abilities. The launch of the bird The scenario of Angry Birds Evolution is an island made up of various areas that are unlocked by proceeding in the long single player campaign. There are no indicators of the energy of action, which suggests the possibility of playing unlimitedly and without waiting, but the freemium mechanisms show up approximately every hour to exhaust the three ~scouts~ we have, interventions that allow to reveal specific challenges with which to maybe do some grinding and level up the team. The problem? It takes an hour to recharge each individual scout. Beyond this aspect and a balance of difficulty that inevitably undergoes a surge after the first missions, the game structure appears solid and convincing, with a team initially formed by three elements and the continuous release of new characters that we will be able to select for the team or ~spend~ to make one of our birds level up, seeing its attack and defense skills enhanced. Once you take the field, the gameplay of Angry Birds Evolution recalls that of the original Angry Birds, although the view is in third person and the targets to hit are not holed up inside more or less complex structures, with a physical base determine its destruction. You have to launch the birds with the usual ~slingshot~, making a game of banks to hit the enemies several times and inflict the greatest possible damage, to then see their elements return to their starting point. The strategic element lies in identifying the most dangerous piglets and/or those who will attack us first and try to neutralize them in time to avoid losing part of the vital energy bar, unique for the entire team. The system is therefore valid and interesting, with a good degree of variety between the characters also represented by the special shot, which loads after a few rounds and can make the difference in terms of the match. The graphics are excellent, which uses a style similar to that of the computer graphics film and abounds in effects to embellish the surfaces of the locations, giving it a remarkable glance.", "date": "2017-06-23", "grade": "8.0"}
