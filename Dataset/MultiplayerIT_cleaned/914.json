Had we had to write an article based on the first few minutes of the game, we would have branded it as a Goat Simulator out of time (the designer is the same) and with four elderly people instead of the goat and we would have closed the matter quickly and painlessly. Having to write the review of Just Die Already, however, we decided to give it more time and a strange thing happened: the more we played, the more we got stuck in its weird dynamics. Going around wreaking havoc for sheer anarchic taste proved truly rewarding, and the sheer number of things to do and experience kept us overdue. In this, the title of DoubleMoose is very similar to its protagonists who really don't want to know about dying, despite having been given up for dead by society. Game mechanics Ending up in the water in the port means being devoured by a terrible shark The premise of Just Die Already is very simple: four old men, two men and two women, live in a retirement home, far from the eyes of society, which has already given them up for dead and considers them completely useless. Our grumpy anti-heroes, however, are just not there to play the role that has been assigned to them and decide to flee to start spreading death and destruction in the city where they live. The game begins inside the nursing home, where you have to find a way to escape from your room and then get kicked out by a decidedly nasty nurse. Although the environment is very small, we can already witness the first follies concocted by the developers. For example, by opening the refrigerator we are torn to pieces by a giant crab, or by approaching the fish tank in the next room we are literally devoured (after all, they are piranhas). When we talk about ~being torn apart~ we mean it literally. The nice octogenarians can in fact lose limbs, head and even the torso, while continuing to live. One of the activities of the outside world will be linked to the loss of the limbs (to be opened some gates require that certain limbs have been detached from the body), but more generally it will give life to extremely grotesque and comical moments. In any case, when you want you can press the respawn button to return all the old men in one piece... to the nearest dumpster. Escaped from the retirement home after ruining the party for the other guests, we find ourselves free to literally do whatever we want. A homeless couple broadly explains to us what our objectives are: none in particular, but if we want we can perform a series of actions shown in the game log, to unlock weapons, medicines and various objects. It's not about missions themselves, it's about making things happen as you explore. For example, we have to lose a certain number of limbs, or get shocked several times. In reality there are also more specific and complex objectives, such as finding certain hidden objects in the scenario, or unlocking secret passages, which require the resolution of real puzzles. As you can imagine, some goals are completely insane. For example, we are asked to go around public toilets looking for naked men to ~grab~, or to jump on strange sheep a certain number of times, or even to play a game of football against machine guns. Whatever our purpose in life, every time we complete a task, items are unlocked that become purchasable from vending machines, most of which are immediately available, while others require the purchase of tickets that are received by exploring (no microtransactions, don't worry ). For the rest we are completely free to do what we want, including wandering around aimlessly, just to see what can happen to us and what we can interact with, perhaps stealing some vehicles (scooters, steamrollers, jet skis, just to mention some) to make it even more chaotic. Wandering through the city we will inevitably end up reaching and unlocking the various areas that make it up, such as the port or the Zen garden. Gameplay Ready to wreak havoc in the city? If we had to describe the gameplay of Just Die Already in a concise way, we would use the expression ~controlled chaos~ without hesitation: at the beginning you are a bit lost and turn around without knowing what to do, but gradually the design of the world itself guides the player towards its secrets, revealing to him that in reality what seems random really isn't. Thus we end up climbing buildings, fighting against martial artists, racing on jet skis, even fishing in a moI do almost spontaneously, being amazed every time by the level of interaction granted. Just the interaction with the game world is managed in a simple and brilliant way: the elderly can grab and use the game objects with one of the two hands (or with both in case of excessive weight). Of course, the type of interaction changes depending on the object: for example, a sword will allow us to perform lethal blows, while a magic wand will allow us to throw fireballs. There are also objects with more specific functions, such as keys, which are simply used at the right time (with doors... but there was no need to specify it). If we want Just Die Already is a crescendo: it starts slowly and quickly becomes a playground where the attractions never seem to end. To help communicate this feeling, which gets stronger as time passes (especially in cooperative mode), the size of the game world, fortunately small, takes care of it. The goals are many and very varied It will seem a paradox, but in this way the density of the action becomes very high and it always seems to be surrounded by things to do or places to explore, whether they are tall buildings or the internal areas of a park. Needless to say, Just Die Already gives its best when playing with friends. It should be noted that cross play between all platforms is supported, a feature that is not obvious for such a small production. Of course Just Die Already also has problems, the first of which is the lack of polish. In some cases it is not clear what is intended or what is the result of some bug. Given the nature of the game after a while you don't pay much attention, but certain bugs emerge quite overbearing, such as people flying or characters suddenly becoming immortal. Fortunately we are not talking about a very expensive game, so the tolerance is necessarily higher. Sure, a little more cleaning wouldn't have hurt, but overall it takes little away from what is a light-hearted and anarchic product, to which one often returns even if one never quite knows why.", "date": "2021-05-20", "grade": "8.2"}
