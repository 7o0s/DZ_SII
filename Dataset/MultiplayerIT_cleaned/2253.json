{"name": "Medal Of Honor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-quando-la-guerra-genera-eroi-2.html", "text": "1941, America enters the war Our entry into the Second World War will take place first of all through in-depth training, which will allow us to understand how to best move within hostile territories, and which will give us the opportunity to acquire the basic notions on how to use of part of the paraphernalia with which we will have to interact during war operations. All this will be possible thanks to the obligatory tutorial that we will have to go through at the beginning of the game. Immediately after becoming familiar with the controls of the character we will be sent to our first operational mission, the objective of which will be explained to us inside the War Cabinet Rooms in Whitehall. Each briefing will be punctuated by an off-screen voice which, with the help of various slides, will give us information both on the state of the conflict and on what will be the objectives and obstacles we will have to face in order to complete our tasks. Once these notions have been acquired, we will be catapulted directly into the actual action or through an introductory movie made with the game engine or into a location from which the plot of our mission will then unfold. Men in battle The missions that we will have to face will often see us joined by other soldiers with whom we will have to collaborate in order to best succeed in our objectives. In the first level, for example, we will be supported first by a group of American soldiers who will have the aim of opening the way for us towards enemy buildings and then by an army officer (liberated from German captivity by us) who will provide us with valuable information and additional objectives to be achieved in order to allow us to finish the mission. Fundamental, in order to be able to finish the various tasks that will gradually be assigned to us, will be to move in synchrony with the rest of the group so as to cover each other's backs and advance as quickly and safely as possible: on more than one occasion the covering fire carried out by our allies will be crucial in order to advance in the game. The missions that we will face will be the most disparate: we will have to free prisoners, sabotage enemy war equipment, steal projects, eliminate people and participate in collective war actions, all within environments reconstructed with a novice of details and a care truly remarkable detail. hostile territories The programmers have really given a lot of importance to the reconstruction of realistic environments in which to project our electronic alter ego. Remarkable is the implementation of the textures and the use of polygons and plays of light, which denote a truly intensive exploitation of the potential of the Quake III engine used to create the product. The facial expressions of the protagonists are also well constructed, whether they are relevant or not, which, in some situations of the game, will change in real time based on what is happening around us. An example of all is given by the sudden changes of mood to which the characters present on the screen will be subjected during the assault on the bay of Omaha Beach, where there will be proposed expressions of triumph, terror, despair and pain based on the situation which will involve them. Despite the excellent work done and the good interactivity that is given with the surrounding environment, there is still a ~bad taste~ in realizing that more could have been done with regard to this aspect. After having been able to play with Max Payne where almost all of the environment in which we are projected is destructible, where every type of wall and material shatters with truly realistic effects, and where every single shell of our weapons bounces and remains on the ground he misses these things in Medal Of Honor. It should be noted that thanks to this ~reduction~ of realism it will be possible to play Medal Of Honor in Multiplayer mode, which is not feasible in Max Payne due to the limitations to which the title is subject due to the superior environmental effects. A soldier's best friend? His rifle. In addition to the novice environments of details, it has also been spent in the implementation of the weapons that we will be able to use to make a clean sweep of the obstacles that will appear in front of us on our path to glory. At our disposal we will have over 21 weapons from the Second World War period reconstructed in a truly realistic way, including: Thompson semi-automatic rifles, Mark II grenades and machine guns of the time; almost every weapon sIt will be present in two versions, one relating to the armament supplied to the American forces and one for the German ones. Note a peculiarity of the game that increases the realism of the simulation: the ammunition will not (obviously) be compatible between different types of similar weapons, i.e. an American machine gun will use bullets of a different caliber than the German one and therefore we will have to recover the right bullets to use it. It seems strange that, in the face of such a ~fussiness~ of details, one then finds oneself in possession, in some situations of the game, of position machine guns or the like equipped with infinite ammunition... the motivation could lie in the hypothesis of having a continuous exchange of bullets but also in this case it is very jarring not to be called to replace used bullet rolls with new ones; this also in the face of the often vital importance that having to waste time to fill our weapon with new cartridges has in the game. In addition to the accurate reconstruction of the weapon models, the ~physics~ response to their use has also been well implemented; firing machine gun bursts we will be subjected to a certain recoil which will make us deviate from the optimal position and the reload times of the various war devices will be realistically different making it longer to insert a large caliber cartridge inside a sniper rifle rather than inserting a submachine gun's bolt-action magazine. In addition to the weapons of the time we will also have to deal with the vehicles used during the Second World War, both for the purpose of sabotaging them and by finding ourselves driving them or using the weapons made available. Among the various we mention the M4 Sherman tank, the M3 armored vehicle and various jeeps. The success of a war? Intelligence question The artificial intelligence of the enemies we will meet settles on medium-high levels giving moments of high realism interspersed with flaws that should be noted. Nothing to complain about the combat tactics and the reactions to our blows that the members of the opposing army will have as the German soldiers have been ~trained~ to react in an optimal way to the various situations they are faced with managing to make the best use of objects present in the environment as cover for our shots, lying down on the ground to be less visible, using all the equipment made available to them and alternating machine gun discharges with grenade launches and acting in synchrony so as to create cover for their comrades during combined actions. But there are two little appreciable characteristics attributable to Germanic patriots or a poor spirit of observation and a very high lack of hearing. In almost all occasions, in fact, the presence of a corpse in a corridor will not in the least alert the soldier who passes by and, even worse, no action will be taken when hearing machine gun discharges and screams of pain; these flaws that appear even more evident in the face of the excellent implementation of the rest of the A.I. of the game. Worth noting is the valuable presence of moments in which the enemy retreats or seeks cover in order to reload his weapons or when, seeing an adversary shooting wildly, he tends to flee in panic or simply overwhelmed by the survival instinct . In final analysis, and hoping for the resolution of these ~inaccuracies~ in some patch, we must give a very positive vote to the realism of the actions and behaviors of our opponents. The noise of battle Like any self-respecting battle, a good soundtrack is needed in order to underline the crucial moments and enhance the actions taken by the soldiers who take part in them. In this respect, while not realizing anything innovative or excellent, Medal Of Honor performs well by giving well-chosen and never invasive or frustrating musical backgrounds. Remaining therefore average in terms of the sound track, the title gives its best as regards the sound effects. The reproduction of the noises emitted by the various weapons is remarkable and even the speech (viewed in the American version) is worthy of praise. Very beautiful are the moments in which you can listen to radio communications or speeches made by enemies unaware of our lethal presence. To be noted as topical are the sensations one experiences during mass warfare and those totally alone in the middle of the silence of expanses of snow where the only audible noise is that of the white trampled ground, the explosion of firearms and the screams of downed opponents.A mass conflict As previously mentioned, Medal Of Honor contemplates, in addition to an excellent single-player mode, also the always valuable and interesting possibility of playing in multiplayer; form, among other things, with which the playable demo of the product was equipped. The longevity and enjoyment of the game are therefore also extended to the possibility of facing flesh-and-blood opponents in battles to the death by challenging them in numerous and varied maps. Since Medal Of Honor is not an extreme simulation product like Counter-Strike but being deliberately focused on a more action and immediate game mode, the classic death match and cooperative modes to which the various Quakes have accustomed us are currently used. where the primary purpose of the challenge is to eliminate as many enemies as possible in the time allowed. 1945, end of the war In conclusion, we can only recommend Medal Of Honor to all lovers of first person games or action products in general; the title is very pleasant both to play and to see, offering moments of great entertainment and involvement. In terms of difficulty, selectable among other things among 4 possibilities, the game is neither too easy nor frustrating, able to be attractive and playable both by the hardened shooter and by those approaching a product of this type for the first time .74P.S.: The above review refers to the US version of the game, tested on an imported final product. In a few days, however, we will be able to offer you a review of the Italian version of the game, i.e. the final product that you will find in stores from February 15th: we are particularly curious to be able to evaluate the quality of the localization, considering that the title has been translated, text and spoken, completely in our language. A little more patience, so... 1939, the beginning of the conflict. It was back in 1999 (speaking of the videogame era) when the first Medal of Honor peeped into the world of electronic games, and it was immediately a success. Four years later, a sequel to that title appears again on our computer screens, and this time we will find ourselves in the role of Lieutenant Mike Powell, a member of the 1st Ranger Battalion recruited by the OSS and the background of our adventures will be that of the hardest years of the war, between 1942 and 1945. In the succession of missions we will find ourselves at face we will be called to carry out war actions in the lands of Normandy, we will find ourselves projected into the assault of Arzew, we will have to better manage a meeting with the Resistance outside the village of St. Lo, and we will try to cross the highly controlled German border for the taking of the bridge in Remagen... and this is just a taste of the 20 levels that you will have to finish before our war is over.", "date": "2002-02-06", "grade": null}
