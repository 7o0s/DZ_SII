{"name": "Pokmon XD - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-xd-recensione.html", "text": "Pokemon have closed their hearts Anyone who has played Pokmon Colosseum will remember that the only difference between ~normal~ and ~shadow~ Pokmon is that the latter have closed the doors of their hearts, just as it is literally explained in the story, and that they have become very aggressive towards humans. The XD plot begins five years after the events of the previous chapter, during a ferocious attack on a cargo ship sailing in the middle of the ocean. The boat, full of Shadow Pokmon, was attacked by a powerful creature who wants at all costs to create an evil army, recruiting Shadow creatures from all over the globe. It will be up to us, in the role of a young trainer, to try to stop his destructive madness, defeat the bad guy and purify all the saved Pokmon. Watching an XD session it will be almost impossible to distinguish it from the Colosseum XD is the classic Pokmon sequel: just like in the episodes seen on GameBoy, Nintendo has fully recycled the previous chapter, taking every part of the design and game mechanics and managing to create a ~new~ title. Watching an XD session it will be almost impossible to distinguish it from the Colosseum. But in the end, why change a winning horse? Surely this was thought by the developers Genius Sonority who also have a chapter for NintendoDS in the pipeline. Pokmon Colosseum had introduced, compared to the ~Stadium~, a massive single player story and the classic RPG mode of the series. Even XD begins with a long introduction that immediately manages to immerse the player in the game setting and history. The game structure of XD is the same as any chapter of Pokmon. Exploration and fighting. Rarely, very simple and intuitive puzzle solving elements have also been included in the game, which break up the action and make the experience slightly more varied. The first part is the slowest and most boring, especially for those who have already played the prequel. For two or three hours the game does not take off and will be reduced to a sort of tutorial where it is explained how to capture and how to purify Shadow Pokemon. Luckily, after a while, he engages second gear and the adventure comes alive, proving to be quite long. Initially we will only have one Pokemon available and we will be called to fight in the streets, in arenas and in special dedicated stages. Very soon we will receive a device that will allow us to detect the presence of Shadow Pokmon and to be able to snatch them from the clutches of their trainers. Initially we will only have one Pokemon available and we will be called to fight in the streets It won't be easy to catch them, and moreover once captured they will also be purified to ensure that the doors of their hearts finally reopen. Using them in combat, the Shadow Pokmon will purify themselves, but there is a simpler method: Doctor Germano's ~Purifier~. Using them in battle is not the only way to ~save~ them, we can also try including them in our team or giving them a massage with cologne (unbelievable but true). Each Pokmon we are using has two ~types~ that make it immune to certain attacks, stronger but also weaker. During a battle, if we use a move that matches the right type of our fighter, the damage done to the opponent will be increased by 50%. Conversely, if the hit Pokmon is vulnerable to that type of attack, the damage taken will double. The strength of the Shadow Pokemon The peculiarity of the Shadow Pokmon lies in the fact that they are immune to their Shadow attack type, and are therefore excellent defenders. Deploying them on our side has the double advantage of obtaining an increase in defense and being able to purify them at the same time. Despite being exceptional defenders, the Shadows also have some pretty good attacks: Ondascura manages to hit all the opponent's Pokmon at the same time, Cieloscuro attacks all non-Shadows at every turn and Iraoscura, if it manages to hit, can halve the damage. 'HP of all enemies at the same time. In Pokmon XD it will also be possible to capture wild Pokmon, free in special hunting ~reservoirs~. In order to catch them, it will be necessary to adopt a few simple tactics. In Pokmon XD it will also be possible to capture wild Pokmon, free in special hunting ~reservoirs~ The strength of the Shadow Pokemon For example, our task will be facilitated if they find themselves under the effect of some attack or some particular state such as confusion or paralysis. Even playing the poison or freezing card will help us in the task. The Poke-Snacks, nice colored snacks, will be used to attract the animals' attentionline that we want to catch. The Pokmon in our possession must be taken care of and trained in the appropriate Pokmon Centers, through the terminal at our disposal we can therefore change the ~owners~ of our party, check the statistics and access the Tool Deposit to be able to take new useful objects. Almost all the battles in this chapter are actually ~double~, as both we and our enemy will be equipped with two Pokemon. A strong sense of Dj-Vu However, it would be wrong to consider XD a chapter completely ripped from the previous one, as there are still some new features, albeit not substantial ones. The graphics sector is slightly improved, with new light and shadow effects applied to each character, with game action always anchored at 30 fps. Another novelty is the possibility of capturing Pokmon not only in battle, but also being able to catch wild ones in the appropriate hunting areas, as explained in the previous paragraph. Connectivity with GameBoy Advance is no longer a secret, and it's implemented again this time. It is also possible to export creatures from Gamecube to GameBoy. Oddly, there are no options for using Colosseum Pokmon in XD. Analyzing the audio sector, it must be said that this game could almost have none: there are no spoken dialogues, the background music is few and quite boring, uninspired. The ~noises~ produced by our creatures are comparable to those already heard on the Advance, which is saying something. The single player game is long, it will take from 18 to 22 hours to complete it, helped by much more elaborate and longer fighting animations than the other chapters. Pokmon XD is a chapter that only true lovers of the series should take into consideration. There are too many points in common with the previous ~Colosseum~, starting from the design to the gameplay. The few additions such as the new story, gameplay tweaks and wild Pokmon therefore do not constitute a strong attraction towards the game. For those who haven't played the prequel, XD is a title that doesn't get boring, except in the first two hours of the game. Single player is very long but the game dynamics are old and they don't have big incentives to complete it. The picture is closed by an almost non-existent sound sector and the multiplayer which is the same as in the Colosseum. Pros: Improved graphics It's a Pokmon RPG adventure on home console Very long single player Cons: It looks too much like the previous chapter Too slow initially Non-existent audio compartment Gotta Catch'em All! Last year, Pokemon Coliseum marked the first home console appearance of the classic Pokemon turn-based RPG for the series. Previously, other titles related to the cute little monsters had appeared but completely disconnected from the main trend, real Spin-offs that had little to do with the classic role-playing games. The ingenious intuition was the one that allowed the connection with the GameBoy Advance and related game, an idea that perhaps was born to push the owners of the Nintendo laptop to also buy the console for home. Also to look for the association between the word ~Gamecube~ and ~Pokmon~, one of the most powerful and profitable brands of the last ten years. It was not just a mere commercial operation as Colosseum possessed respectable intrinsic qualities. The new chapter for Gamecube is called ~XD~, and in the Italian version it has the subtitle of ~Tempesta Oscura~. The ominous name derives from the fact that in this game the Shadow Pokmon represent the central point of the story.", "date": "2005-12-19", "grade": null}
