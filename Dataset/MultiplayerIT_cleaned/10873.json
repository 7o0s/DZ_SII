{"name": "Gish", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gish_a.html", "text": "In the continuous search for charismatic and particular characters, the video game market has seen the birth of anthropomorphic animals, bottle caps or even agglomerations of objects held together by who knows what energy bond. Some of these experiments were successful, some were not. The developers have even tried the ~blob~ route, even recently (see the excellent title released for Nintendo Wii and transported to mobile phones some time ago), due to the potential of this type of shape, which is shaped externally depending on the surface they come into contact with and allow a whole series of actions impossible for anyone else. Gish is precisely such a creature, to be exact it is a ~ball~ of tar that moves by crawling and can adhere to the walls thanks to its structure. Created in 2004 by the Cryptic Sea team and published for PC, the game has garnered extremely positive reviews and it seems that a sequel is in the process of being released, even if it is unknown for which platform. In this mobile reduction curated by HardWire for Pixalon Studios, Gish brings much of the elements seen in the original title to mobile. The character can therefore move by crawling, jump higher than normal by exploiting the inertia of his movements, destroy certain objects or throw them into the air, become slippery or adhere to various surfaces. The game is also one of the first products to support the Zeemote bluetooth controller, which can be activated from the options menu, and offers an interesting wireless multiplayer mode. Furthermore, there is a certain attention to the quantity: the stages are quite numerous, with a level of challenge that gradually grows as you go along and even some bosses to face from time to time. In some ways, the levels act as puzzles to be solved: Gish must go through them using his abilities, then reach the exit. The control system is very simple and immediate, with the d-pad for character movement and jumps, the 5 key to carry out an attack (Gish becomes ~heavy~ for a few moments, destroying certain objects or enemies) and the * keys and # respectively to make your surface slippery or sticky. Very often we will find devices to activate and objects to move (exploiting the creature's ability to adhere to things) in order to reach the end of each stage, while our energy is represented by a series of dots that can be restored by collecting tar bubbles in around the locations. Gish is injured by contact with enemies, but can lose a life in an instant if crushed by walls or heavy mechanisms, so you need to proceed carefully and evaluate your movements rather than rushing headlong. The technical implementation of the game is excellent, in particular the graphics manage to make the most of the ~softness~ of the character during movements: the ball of tar swings, changes shape and ~spreads~ depending on the context, with excellent results. The enemies we'll find on our way aren't very numerous, but they boast a good design and decent animation. Finally, the work done for the locations is also very good, especially from the point of view of the colors, which represent the main element of differentiation of the levels. Filler graphics often repeat, but this is handled best as it's barely noticeable. PRO Fun and full of depth Technically excellent It supports Ziimote and bluetooth multiplayer AGAINST Sometimes frustrating Average sound Impeccable translation into Italian", "date": "2009-02-17", "grade": "S.V."}
