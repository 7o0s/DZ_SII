Overwatch 2 comes to the end of a long and troubled process, which has passed through the legal flaws of Blizzard Activision and the departure of the creator of the first chapter, Jeff Kaplan, replaced at the helm by Aaron Keller. Maybe that's why we expected more. The franchise, behind it, has a wonderful imagery, a solid infrastructure, a multi-million dollar League, yet Overwatch 2 arrives on PC and console without the much desired campaign and in a free to play format that is raising a lot of controversy. Marred by technical problems in the first hours of life, between inexhaustible queues and unpleasant bugs, Blizzard's ~new~ hero shooter is not an easy title to review due to its nature, which deserves a more complex discussion. For this reason, we invite you to read our Overwatch 2 review carefully, which will explain what convinced us and what didn't about this sequel that is not a sequel. Numbers issues Overwatch 2, Kiriko is the new support heroine Let's assume that Blizzard advertised Overwatch 2 as a sequel, changed the logo, changed the distribution model, set a release date: Overwatch 2 is a new game, but at the same time it's not. It's certainly not a sequel. It's an update, a major patch, but calling it a sequel is an overstatement to say the least. In terms of gameplay, almost nothing has changed since the day Overwatch became Overwatch 2. Even the transition from the formation of six with two tanks to that of five with one tank is a change that, after the first few games, is hear much less than we would have believed. Thanks to a general revision of roles and parameters, the new dynamic promotes a more dynamic and aggressive style of play, but also more reasoned in terms of positioning and teamplay. The bar therefore moves in the direction of the notorious ~dive comp~, which may or may not like it, but it certainly strongly reduces the risk of stalling, which is the reason why Blizzard has eliminated the maps in Conquest mode from the rotations such as Hanamura or Anubis Temple. In their place take over the new escort maps, which effectively express not only the new gameplay philosophy, but also the attention with which the Irvine developer has designed the new scenarios. The new maps are much more articulated and strategic, between ups and downs, defiles and hiding places that guarantee an enormous situational variety, but also show off the muscles of the renewed technical sector in polygonal counting, lighting and sound effects. Blizzard has practically redesigned every single character, giving them a new look, which however blends in with the multitude of old and new alternative models, but the effort is there, and it shows not only in the 3D modeling, but also in the interface overhaul , now much more streamlined, and out of game screens. Overwatch 2, Junker Queen is the new tank Overwatch 2 therefore remains an extraordinary team shooter: it is imaginative, creative and frenetic, but also immediate and intuitive, with a roster of selectable characters that can satisfy every expectation. The launch adds three, one for each role: we found Sojourn not very inspired, but Kiriko and Queen of the Junkers much more interesting and surprising. It's obviously too early to talk about metas, as the competitive season has just begun, but with one less tank and so many changes we can already expect some surprises. Too bad, however, that these changes have only affected a handful of old characters. Apart from a few tweaks here and there, there are practically only three heroes that Blizzard has thoroughly redesigned: Doomfist, who has officially become a tank; Orisa, who has lost her Barrier and her static tank abilities to become something of a battering ram; Bastion, who is now much more mobile but also vulnerable. All the other heroes have remained pretty much the same, with their strengths and weaknesses. But out of a total of thirty-five heroes, three unreleased and three reworks are a bit small for a relaunch that wants to be a new game. And that's okay too. Many heroes are perfect as they are, others remain improvable, but in the vast majority of cases there was no reason to go and touch up a balance already on the razor's edge just to justify the suffix in the title. Overwatch 2, Orisa has been heavily modified Overwatch 2 is a quality title, if we talk about bare gameplay and crudo, but it's Overwatch with a new veneer, some additions and something missing from the previous version. Above all, it is a title out of time, at a time when the competition has made great strides and offers a variety of content that is sometimes even wider and more surprising.Overwatch 2, in addition to competitive matches, custom ones and unranked ones at Roles Queue or Open Queue, always offers the usual methods. Mysterious Heroes and TCT Deathmatches have been moved to the unranked category, but instead, in Arcade Mode, we find the usual rotations of specific modes, such as Total Mayhem, No Limits, 3v3 Elimination and so on: while changing every day, they are modalities that we have seen and overseen, and which to be honest were not very original even before. Overwatch 2, in the new Escort mode we have to defend a robot We miss that Campaign that Blizzard had promised to fans of the game, and to those who fell in love with its incredible artistic direction and its charismatic cast of protagonists, and that to date we do not know when it will arrive, nor how it will be since Irvine changes their mind every week and doesn't seem to have clear ideas about the direction they want this project to take. For this reason, evaluating Overwatch 2 with a cold numerical vote is essentially unfair. The game is the same; if you liked it before, you will like it now, and it remains the 9 shooter we reviewed in 2016. And in some ways it is even better. But Blizzard, choosing to publish it as a new chapter, has taken a tortuous path, because at this Overwatch 2, which was as much fun for us as the first, will also bring all those new players who, perhaps attracted by the free to play formula, will discover a small amount of content that relies on a monetization system that to define as controversial would be an understatement. The catch of the Battle Pass Overwatch 2, the Premium Battle Pass Having moved to a free to play model - you pay nothing to play, the download is absolutely free - Overwatch 2 necessarily had to embrace a monetization system that, in theory, should support Blizzard's support in the long term. The Battle Pass solution is really nothing new: there are now more and more games that adopt this microtransaction system to hook the player, reward him for the hours he spends on the game and, perhaps, induce him to buy a little something. The problem is that not all companies are able to find an acceptable compromise, and in this specific case Blizzard has gone the extra mile with a very divisive mechanism. Let us state immediately that these considerations have not influenced our evaluation of the game itself and for itself. Nothing the Battle Pass offers changes the perception we have of Overwatch 2, which remains a fantastic shooter even without additional models, emotes, victory poses and other amenities. If anything, it changed our perception of Blizzard. Overwatch 2 weekly challenges The Battle Pass and the Shop, in fact, replace the old chests of the first Overwatch. On paper, it was a welcome change: Lockboxes were akin to a form of gambling, encouraging collectors to spend real money on completely random rewards. It is now possible to directly choose a model or a pack of themed collectibles from the Shop and buy it with Overwatch Coins, a currency that can be accumulated in a limited amount weekly even just by playing, or that can be bought in different sizes for real money. The Battle Pass, for its part, is a collection of contents that are unlocked by climbing the various ranks: the player earns experience points with each game, with more or less generous bonuses that depend on the challenges eventually overcome, and each new rank also represents a reward in the form of skins, audio, emotes, etc. Of course there is a free Battle Pass, for those who don't want to spend anything, and a Premium Battle Pass, which offers a greater number of ranks and rewards to those who decide to invest in the Blizzard title. Overwatch 2 Store screen The problem lies in the gap that exists between the two Battle Passes, with the free to play one offering practically nothing attractive that is worth playing for. Even completing the challenges, in fact, you have to play a lot to climb all the ranks in the Battle Pass, an undertaking that could be difficult even for those who have purchased the Premium but do not have a lot of time to play: it is no coincidence that there is the possibility of buying Battle Pass ranks by spending Overwatch Coins, eso real money. Yes, because the Overwatch Coins that are obtained by playing are very few, and in any case they are not that simple to obtain: constancy is required, rather than skill, which in any case should not make a difference, i.e. that those who are less good playing should have the same opportunity as an expert. The idea is that the player can buy the Premium Battle Pass with the Coins earned game after game, but even if you complete all the weekly challenges, you would reach the end of the season with an insufficient number of Coins to purchase a Premium upgrade. In short, those who do not want to swipe their credit card will have to complete more or less all the weekly challenges of two seasons just to be able to afford a Premium Battle Pass. Overwatch 2, the new screens are much cleaner and more stylish The new heroes that Blizzard has anticipated will be available every other season starting from the third season, are bound to the highest ranks of the Battle Pass. Kiriko, for example, is the level 55 reward in the Season 1 free to play Battle Pass, and this means it can take days, if not weeks, before you can unlock her. Upgrading to the Premium Battle Pass, however, immediately unlocks the new character - if provided - and in addition to adding many more, higher-quality rewards, it also adds a small bonus to the experience points earned in each game. In short, for an assiduous Overwatch 2 player, the Premium Battle Pass is practically essential. Everything also depends on the value you give to these collectibles. If we exclude the new characters, which certainly have an intrinsic value, any other reward is purely aesthetic, and basically useless for gameplay purposes. Despite this, the idea of getting a prize is certainly an incentive to play a title which, however fun, can often be frustrating due to a toxic and aggressive community. Overwatch 2, the new Circuit Royal map At this point we could almost regret the Overwatch 1 Chests. The thought of opening that kind of Kinder Egg at the end of the game, in the hope of finding a nice epic or legendary model inside, was enough incentive to play one game and another even later, while with the Battle Pass (Premium or not) we already know what the next reward will be, and in most grades it is far from exciting. If we then consider that the new Shop was supposed to offer a plethora of models and collectibles for purchase, only to then offer a handful of them, mostly old ones, at the cost of the very small Overwatch Coins, it is clear that Blizzard will have to work hard to improve a system of monetization which, at the moment, really leaves a lot to be desired.", "date": "2022-10-11", "grade": "8.0"}
