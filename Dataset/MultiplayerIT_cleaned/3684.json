Yet the premises were excellent: a mobile 4X turn-based strategy at a premium price, without microtransactions or advertising set in the SpellForce universe. What could go wrong? Sometimes it's better not to ask certain questions... but first things first. Launched SpellForce: Heroes & Magic you have to choose whether to play the campaign or to face individual battles. In truth there is not a real campaign, but a series of challenges of increasing difficulty unrelated to each other, overall insignificant for the mythology of the series. To be honest, in some respects it is so generic that if it weren't for the presence of the word SpellForce in the title, it would also be difficult to recognize the game universe. The challenges are not customizable, apart from the selection of one of the three playable factions (humans, orcs and dark elves) and they all have very similar objectives: conquer a certain territory, resist enemies, kill opposing heroes and little else. Since the narrative side is so poor, will at least the strategic one be worthy of the 4X it boasts? Nah... 4X strategy At the beginning of each challenge we are assigned a hero, accompanied by a handful of basic units, which differ according to the chosen faction. The general map of SpellForce: Heroes & Magic is made up of a series of sites, usually occupied by enemy troops, arranged on the corners of large hexagons, joined together by roads that form small mazes. Each site is linked to a raw material, which is essential if the buildings that give access to the best troops and the troops themselves are to be built in the capital. The liberation of the first occupied sites allows you to immediately experience the combat system. The battlefields are small chessboards divided into hexagons on which we must first place our units, taking into account the position of the enemies and any obstacles. Then we have to give him orders (move, attack or defend) and finally we have to observe the resolution of the turn, and then give orders for the next turn. This continues until one of the two armies has been defeated. Each unit, of the approximately thirty available, some to be unlocked by overcoming challenges, has different attack options and unique abilities, which can be improved by leveling them up. For example, dark elf mages can throw lightning bolts or freeze enemies, human knights are very strong in close combat, while eagles can fly. More broadly, abilities also serve to shape the factions, with dark elves being the best from long range, orcs being excellent bruisers, and humans falling somewhere in between. Between ourselves we are not talking about something shocking or that has not been seen in many other fantasy titles, but honestly we did not expect anything different. Just as we didn't expect who knows what revolutions from the equipment system, with each unit having weapons that can be improved or replaced with others that can be obtained in combat or by opening some chests, usually protected by stronger units. In particular, the heroes have complete sets of items, some of which are unique, which greatly increase their power. So why didn't we really like Handy Games' game? The defeat The biggest flaw of SpellForce: Heroes & Magic is the repetitiveness, due to the lack of content and the very structure of the gameplay. The challenges, especially the advanced ones, can last several hours in which you basically always do the same things. The fights themselves in the long run turn out to be really bland, due to the too small maps, the elementary opponent intelligence and the lack of characterizing elements. Incidentally, the battlefields are all identical, apart from the presence of some obstacles, and the boxes do not affect our troops in the slightest. To say, we solved most of the fights always using the same tactic, whether they were the opponents of small bandits or powerful demons: stronger troops forward to absorb the blows, bombardment of arrows and magic from the rear. Just follow the right process of upgrading the hero and units to become practically unbeatable. The only real difference between the first challenges and the advanced ones concerns the number of opponents, who as they grow require slightly stronger units. For the rest, the game does not include special events and does not reward original approaches. Sometimes you feel so guided that it seems to be in front of a puzzle game rather than a strategistplay. Could this be why the developers have implemented a terrible save system, which forces you to start the challenges from scratch in case of defeat? Imagine having played a challenge for a couple of hours and having lost due to a simple lightness, how about having to start over from the beginning without being able to load a save that allows you to remedy the mistake made? But there's more and worse, because the challenges don't allow you to keep heroes and troops. So every time you have to regrow the hero from scratch. Not bad if there was a minimum of variety, but given that the heroes change only according to the faction and that their skill trees are very limited, you always find yourself making the exact same growth choices. In short, it seems to be faced more with a draft than with a finished game, a feeling that is reinforced by the game interface, full of paradoxical choices. For example why can't I set a destination for troops beyond their movement points? Not bad if I have to make them reach a nearby place, but when they have to overcome different territories it becomes frustrating having to move them step by step. Another problem concerns the size of texts and details if you play on a smartphone: on a Huawei P30, the device used to test the game, the texts were far too small, as were the units in combat, with the risk to confuse them in the positioning phase. Playing on a tablet things improve, but this does not justify the impossibility of increasing the font size of the few texts present or the lack of clearer icons for the units. In short, by now some problems of playing on mobile systems should be known and seeing them ignored in this way is not good for the mood (and for the eyes).", "date": "2019-05-03", "grade": "4.0"}
