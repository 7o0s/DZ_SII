A tradition that the developers of Electric Pixel Factory hope to be able to renew with the Gorilla Gondola present here, which sees users engaged in commanding nothing less than a primate standing on the roof of a cable car. Let's see if there's substance beyond the funny premise. Mountain monkey The apparently useless role of a gorilla on a cable car is soon explained by the efficient tutorial that occupies the first stage of the nine made available by the title. The aim of the game is therefore to reach the end of the levels by collecting as many bananas as possible and avoiding obstacles and enemies, all while relying only on the oscillations that the hairy protagonist can apply to the cabin. With an upward swipe you make the gorilla jump while crawling down when the primate is in flight you can give greater force to the fall causing the oscillating motion of the cable car: these are the only inputs necessary to play Gorilla Gondola, united to the stresses of the gyroscope which allow the cabin to be tilted slightly. In the intentions of the Electric Pixel Factory developers, their product should fall within the context of those games with extremely basic premises but which require considerable practice and patience to be mastered perfectly: the final result is actually not the desired one, for a product that yes, it is funny at first but ends up wearing out its appeal rather quickly. In fact, it is useless to deny that the original mechanics of Gorilla Gondola are not initially captivating: avoiding stalactites, stalagmites, mines, laser beams and other amenities by exploiting only the oscillation of the cable car while trying to grab as many bananas as possible is a good challenge, made even more tantalizing by a score multiplier that grows as you overcome obstacles without making mistakes. The fact that the title is pleasant from a graphic point of view - with a very colorful and appreciable two-dimensional cosmetics especially for the beautiful backdrops - and equipped with a cheap dance musical accompaniment which ends up being likable, doesn't hurt either. However, a few games are enough to realize the limits of the Electric Pixel Factory title, mainly related to the control system. Playing it on the iPhone or iPad, you end up running into two different but equally annoying limitations: in the first case, swiping down on a small screen often leads to inadvertently dragging down the notification curtain, while in the second case the Using the gyroscope is made awkward by the size of the device. This is accompanied by some singularly insignificant little ingenuities, but which put together end up inevitably ruining the experience: the elements of the seabed that occasionally get confused with the actual obstacles, a sometimes approximate detection of collisions and routine a little too fickle physics regarding the swings of the cable car that make the gameplay almost more a matter of luck than real skill. All things that can be forgiven for a game that costs 1.59 Euros, but which take on a certain gravity if one considers that for even lower prices it is easy to find much more valid alternatives on the App Store.
