{"name": "Team Fortress 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/team-fortress-2-recensione.html", "text": "Orange Box The Orange Box is THE ultimate package for Xbox 360 and PC (a PS3 version is also planned, but will be released later and we don't know if it will contain any extras due to the delay). By purchasing it, you take home the following titles: Half-Life 2 (Review - Score: 10) Half-Life 2: Episode One (Review - Score: 8.7) Half-Life 2: Episode Two (Review - Score: 9.2) Team Fortress 2 (Review - Score: 9.0) Portal (Review - Score: 8.5) In addition to the ~major~ products, the package contains several Extras including Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast, an additional level released for free by Valve a few months later the release of Half-Life 2 in stores and Peggle Extreme, a fun puzzle game from Popcap Games capable of captivating for a few hours with its extremely ~casual~ gameplay (you have to throw a ball hoping it hits the various buffers distributed for levels). The product is available in PC and Xbox 360 versions. Note for the PC version: Anyone who has previously purchased Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2: Episode One can give a copy to anyone, as long as the recipient does not already have the two games registered on Steam. The procedure to follow is explained by Valve itself (look in the package sheet). For the rest, the quality of the titles speaks for itself: Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 are masterpieces, the two episodes of the serial trilogy are excellent games while Portal is a great extra (let's hope that in case of a sequel they opt for greater longevity) that is worth a try to understand what a group of students supported by a great developer can come up with. The Orange Box, from any point of view you look at it, is an essential purchase that you must not miss. Valve distributes the roles Each of the nine selectable figures has its own weapons and characteristics and, beyond some similarities, such as the sharing of secondary weapons, choosing who to use in a game radically changes the gaming experience and determines the basis the assumption of one role rather than another. The shady impersonable figures are: the Heavy, a big and slow beast with three hundred life points and with a machine gun capable of wiping out opponents in a short time; the Demoman, the explosives specialist, averagely fast has a lethal grenade launcher; the Medic, the healer of the group, to use an MMORPG term, can heal the players of his team, can increase their maximum viewpoints by 50% and, by activating the so-called ubercharge, can make them (and become) immortal for a few seconds ; Pyro, armed with a lethal flamethrower, is unbeatable in close quarters where he can fry several enemies at the same time; the Spy, an elusive character capable of killing anyone with a well-placed backstab and becoming invisible to get behind his opponents more easily; There are six game maps in total, for as many game modes (some similar). And here the judgment of the players split. Valve distributes the roles the Scout, agile and fast character, weak in combat but excellent in moments when speed is everything; the Soldier, a fighter armed with a missile launcher, resistant and fairly agile, the average character par excellence and probably the easiest to use; the Sniper, or the sniper of the rose, capable of hitting enemies from a very long distance, can kill anyone with a shot to the head; the Engineer, useless in the fray is one of the most strategic characters thanks to the possibility of creating defensive and healing positions (a turret well placed and kept in good condition can be worth the victory). Not a few will notice the affinities between some roles of Team Fortress 2 with those of any MMORPG. In short, the tank is there, the healer is there, the support troops are there... only the instances are missing. To each his own character, one might say, and entering the game, one soon realizes that this is exactly the case. Each player tends to have a favorite character, of course, but everyone, in a less obvious way, is forced to think tactically which role to assume from time to time depending on the situation. On the same map it can, for example, happen first of all having to defend a control point placed after a narrow passage and then a control point placed in a wider area. Based on your characteristics, you can therefore opt for one type of defense in the first case (for example a Demoman to cover the passage of grenades) and for another in the second (for example an Engineer to cover the turret area). Maps and balancing There are six game maps in total, for as many game modes (some similar). And here the judgment of the players was sphit. There are those who consider them few, especially compared to the competition and there are those who, thanks to the experience with other multiplayer shooters, consider them adequate especially for how they are made. A real clash of philosophies. From our point of view, several elements must be considered before making a judgment. In the first place it is true that the competition offers games with many more maps but, in our experience, the gaming community tends to elect some maps as ~best~ and, often, we end up not playing the others anymore. It happened in Unreal Tournament, it happened with Quake 3, and it happened in UT 2004 and, we imagine, it happened in other games too (if you want, you can bring your testimonies in the comments). On the other hand, however, it has always been a matter of ~natural selection~ processes in which the communities have decided and not the developers. In short, we are facing a controversial problem that can only be answered individually. Let's imagine, however, that it is more difficult to create levels for nine different characters and harmonize them properly, avoiding easy and frequent imbalances, rather than for characters who are all the same in which it is mainly important to know the spawn points and the position of weapons, medipacks by heart , vehicles and so on. Furthermore, it is not improper to think that, within a few months, Valve itself will release a map pack. It is difficult to find other faults in Team Fortress 2. Some elements can be annoying, but the more you play the more you realize that, for example, the 20 second spawn time imposed when defending control points, is to avoid abuse and to balance the game dynamics which, otherwise, would favor the defenders too much. One of the abuses that we wanted to avoid is the risk that some players spend their time switching characters rather than playing. In this way, hysterical and frustrating practices for other players are discouraged. The respawn time sets the pace for the action and makes players smarter in what they do. Having become aware of the fact that dying in crazy actions is not convenient, one is more inclined to look for teamwork, in order to stay alive longer and be more useful for oneself and for others. Playing, in fact, it is not uncommon to see complete strangers who, after a few games together, sketch out more or less elementary tactics to make their team stronger. Probably the biggest complaints come from the frag hunters, those who only think about trying to get their name at the top of the map leaderboard, rather than following the purpose of the different modes. System requirements Team Fortress 2 runs thanks to the Half-Life 2 engine and it shows, especially in terms of fluidity. Less spectacular than Unreal Tournament 3, of which we tried the impressive demo, however it is extremely more fluid and is held up well even on older computers. Minimum Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 1700 MHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Compatible with DirectX 8 or higher DirectX 9.0c Free HD Space: 5 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3000 MHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1024 MB Video Card: Compatible with DirectX 9 or higher DirectX 9.0c Free HD Space: 5 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment The rating you see in the box refers to the entire Half-Life 2: Orange Box package while the rating for Team Fortress 2 is 9.0. Whether or not Team Fortress 2 will be a success only time will tell, as with any online game. The feedback from the community will decide the developments and the permanence of the players on the servers will decide whether or not the series will have a future. For now, what is there is made in an amazing way and the experience that the game offers is definitely worth trying, especially if you are a fan of multi-player FPS. Don't let it slip away. Pros The nine characters are very balanced and well characterized The gameplay enhances teamwork Fluid even on old machines Cons Few maps even if very well made Some might not like the respawn times Team Fortress 2 is part of Half-Life 2: Orange Box, is available for PC and Xbox 360 and will be available for PlayStation 3. The tested version is the one for PC. Who would have thought that after all these years Team Fortress 2 would finally come out? After the apparent abandonment of the project, the hopes of seeing the sequel to one of the most popular mods for Half-Life, second only to the eternal Counter-Strike, were close to zero. He seemed forever lost in the limbo that belongs to all vaporware, in the company of the ethereal Duke Nukem Forever (which is always goodllo to mention when talking about missing games). Fortunately we lived long enough to see Team Fortress 2 come back to life, resurrected by some sorcerer (perhaps Gabe Newell dressed as a necromancer) who decided to infuse it with new life by changing it in appearance and content. What was supposed to be a tactical multiplayer FPS with a realistic visual style has become a kind of dusty cartoon always focused on teamwork, but more oriented towards pure frenetic activity. Indeed, if we had to use a single word to define Team Fortress 2, we would not hesitate to use ~explosive~. If you have had the opportunity to watch the videos of the characters, made available in recent months, or if you have tried the beta, you will already know that on a visual level an extremely caricatured style has been chosen, with characters characterized in a decisive way and maps full of ironic elements . The artistic direction has preferred to deeply mark the game on a stylistic level, providing it with immediate recognition that allows it to be distinguished from the competition without misunderstandings. To obtain this result, a profound differentiation of the gameplay was also opted for, although many of the standard canons that characterize the genre have been maintained. The elements of originality of Team Fortress 2 are certainly not to be found in the objectives of the various modes or in some impromptu gameplay gimmick made to amaze in the short term but dysfunctional in the long run.", "date": "2007-10-18", "grade": null}
