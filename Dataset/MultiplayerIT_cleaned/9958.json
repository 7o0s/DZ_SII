With 800 Microsoft Points or 9.90 euros on PC, we can get new missions for Archer and Kestrel in four new additional maps for ~Special Operations~. The game modes available for this additional content are once again the ~Hunter~, in which alone or in company we have to eliminate all the enemies on the map; ~Infiltration~, a variant of the first with the difference that it is absolutely forbidden to be discovered or located (and therefore favors the stealth and reasoned game rather than urban warfare); ~Last Man~ instead sees us as protagonists in defending a certain area of the map from the invasion of enemy guerrillas, a sort of ~Horde~ a la Gears of War in which we are constantly submerged by enemy fire and attacks from all sides; complete the pack of ~Last Man Standing~ modes, one-on-one versus missions in which we have to eliminate our opponent with the help (or added difficulty) of the enemy AI. Four major American cities The complexity and size of the four new maps exceeds even the original ones contained in the game disc, amazing for the amount of details, ravines to hide, alternative alleys to go through to surprise the opponent. The new settings take place in four major American cities, San Francisco, New Orleans, Salt Lake City and Portland, immediately capturing their spirit and peculiarities. For example, the map of San Francisco takes place in a seaport full of cranes, freight elevators and containers, exactly what anyone would imagine from a port in that area. In Portland, an old lighthouse stands guard over a huge prison detention area. These areas are extremely complex and detailed, thus favoring both the cooperation between two players and the choice of one's own style of play. In fact, their vastness allows you to decide whether to go through the missions hidden in the many dark ravines, waiting to capture one enemy at a time, or to enter the maze of the internal rooms or the port to start a real guerrilla war. The Insurgency Pack maps are full of ladders, ups and downs, alternate alleyways and places to hide. The map of New Orleans, on the other hand, is a gloomy cemetery occasionally broken by some fleeting light that breaks its perennial darkness, in short, an ideal place to wallow in the darkness without being seen, especially in stealth modes such as ~Infiltration~. Moving to Salt Lake City instead we break into a secret research complex, a maxi laboratory full of rooms, corridors and steps that take us from one level to another. Here the situation is less dark than usual, leaving room for many neon lights that illuminate the most important areas. Luckily we can choose to go through air ducts, secondary corridors or over the steel beams that cover the roof: there are many choices for approaching enemies, and the fun is always discovering new ones. Xbox 360 goals The download of the Insurgency package adds 250 points to unlock to the 1000 already present in the base game, bringing the total loot of this Splinter Cell chapter to 1250. There are 9 new objectives, quite simple to unlock especially for those who have already completed the game . To get them all, just complete all the maps on a realistic level and make a certain number of kills without getting caught. The celebration of stealth If the cooperative modes are always and in any case fun, in these new maps the stealth characteristics are enhanced thanks to their enormous complexity and excellent level design that make the ~Player vs player~ game the best of what one could ask for from a Splinter Cell. Just the great variety of new maps makes the game very adrenaline-pumping and unpredictable, given that the enemy could always be anywhere. All maps have specific characteristics that generate this tension. First of all, they are drawn both horizontally and vertically: looking left and right is not enough to feel safe. Then they have a disproportionate amount of objects, ravines, walls, stairs, hiding places inside or behind which to hide and wait. Last aspect, to reach a certain point there are several possible options, especially stealth (crawling up a pipe, rappelling from above, passing from below, facing the enemy head on, etc.). The Insurgency Pack expansion therefore does not add anything regarding the narrative part, it is not an unpublished chapter or a piece butncante of the story, but focuses exclusively on the multiplayer component and the cooperative. A small problem that even these new maps drag from the original game, if you will, is the extremely dancer Artificial Intelligence. Once again, enemy intelligence proves to be extremely alert and active when it comes to defending and attacking, much less in interacting with allied corpses. Just like in the main game, once an enemy has been killed, his corpse will attract the attention of a second guard, who will check too carelessly and openly, leaving us free to eliminate him easily, in a sort of infinite loop in which it is possible pull them down one by one without them ~activating~ in a more careful and convincing way. The four additional maps, all masterfully designed and with great graphic impact, are a must download for any fan of multiplayer action and for lovers of the saga.", "date": "2010-06-11", "grade": "8.4"}
