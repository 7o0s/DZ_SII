{"name": "Arena FPS in stile vittoriano?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106543-nexuiz-arena-fps-in-stile-vittoriano.html", "text": "The planet Atavirta is devastated by a meteor shower and civilization ends up being almost wiped out. From the ashes emerge two races, Kavussari and Forsellian, who clash for dominance, each driven by their own ideals. The fight becomes so bitter that a third party decides to regulate it before Atavirta is destroyed again, and so tournaments are established which involve the two factions in clashes to the death, which take place within various scenarios. The teams of Kavussari and Forsellian, each made up of four elements, can exploit a large number of weapons, ~mutators~ and abilities to prevail, and it will be up to us to side with one side or the other for the achievement of the final victory. Available on the Xbox LIVE platform since last February and also expected on the PlayStation Network, Nexuiz arrived on Steam at the end of May and, believe it or not, we bought it without a second thought. The aggressive price of 9.99 euros, the use of CryEngine 3, the reliability of the Valve infrastructure and the Victorian-style setting promised by the developers convinced us, only to find ourselves in a truly odious situation: the game suffered from frequent crashes and, above all, problems related to matchmaking that made the task of trying it out enough to be able to review it really difficult. And so we waited for a patch, or rather two, to return to the attack with even greater enthusiasm. Was it worth the wait? Faster The frenzy of clashes comes first, in Nexuiz. The game supports the Xbox 360 controller little and badly, which in the end is perhaps a good thing, given that our enemies certainly won't wait for us to aim with the analog sticks before freezing ourselves. We must therefore opt for the traditional mouse / keyboard combo, which guarantees excellent precision as usual and goes well with such a fast gameplay, in the name of quick shots and jumps from one platform to another. The nine maps available support this approach in the best possible way, given the frequent presence of ramps that allow us to project ourselves from one part of the location to another, escaping sudden sorties from opponents or perhaps chasing those who try to escape and then catch them at shoulders. Unfortunately, the limited number of players for multiplayer matches (eight, four on each side) makes the size of the stages not only superfluous but even harmful, which are always too empty and fill the experience with dead time. And speaking of ~empty~, it is appropriate to immediately address what arises as the most serious problem of all Nexuiz, or the lack of matches in which to participate. Honestly, this didn't surprise us that much: if you launch a game with the problems we mentioned above and you don't solve them within a few days, it is natural that users quickly abandon the product for move towards better supported titles (the same Quake III Arena, for example, or the recent Gotham City Impostors). In short, to find a match, resign yourself to having to wait even several minutes, in the hope not only that the number of eight participants will be reached, but that the match will not be spoiled by lag, a factor often present (and decisive) during our tests . Sure, there are bots that can replace human players, but it doesn't seem like a desirable solution, especially if you have to resort to it in most cases. mutant factor It is really a pity that the developers of Nexuiz have not taken care of the most important aspect of the experience in the best possible way, i.e. the online implications, because the game itself is not bad at all and, while not being absolutely original, it offers some interesting ideas. The ~mutators~, for example: these are factors that can be activated during matches, both in deathmatch mode and in ~capture the flag~, and which can substantially modify the nature of the action, for example by providing everyone jetpack participants or by changing their equipment, or by applying bonuses and penalties to values such as speed and resistance. There's even the ~mutator~ that turns sound effects into farts! The arsenal, on the other hand, does not shine in terms of personality, with the usual supply of assault rifles, sniper rifles, missile launchers and so on, each equipped with two fire modes. Unfortunately, the sensation of impact that characterizes the best FPS is lacking, resulting in a fast but decidedly ~slippery~ and bite-free gameplay. The same shortcomings afflict the technical sector: we don't know what the IllFonic guys meant when they spoke of ~Victorian style~ in the press releases, pWhy did we not notice anything of the kind in the design of Nexuiz, which indeed seemed rather dull to us, characterized by anonymous choices and with the only positive aspect represented by the use of CryEngine 3. A double-edged sword, however: to make to run the engine at the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, with all the effects at their maximum, a rather powerful PC is needed and on the test configuration we didn't go beyond 30-40 fps by disabling the antialiasing. Not exactly a ~value~ for an FPS arena that aims at a large audience.", "date": "2012-07-30", "grade": "5.0"}
