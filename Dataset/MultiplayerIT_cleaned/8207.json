{"name": "Il lato B della WWE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110628-wwe-13-il-lato-b-della-wwe.html", "text": "Despite the recent restructuring at THQ, the WWE franchise has never been in question. The series developed by Yuke's, moreover, continues to produce significant revenues year after year: the 2012 edition exceeded two million copies sold, albeit down compared to the previous one, and it is reasonable to expect similar results for WWE ' 13, which also arrives on Wii in a far from simple situation for the now former Nintendo flagship console, close to retirement (at least on paper, given that it still has a huge installed base and it would be stupid to underestimate it, especially in future perspective) due to the imminent release of Wii U. It goes without saying that the technical limits dictate the rules this time too: Wii owners cannot enjoy the Predator Engine 2.0, capable of making the animations of the superstars more realistic, nor the ~Holy sh*t!~ moments, which have given so much spectacularity to the HD version of the game. Also missing is online multiplayer, confirming the fact that the developers have tried to bring home the result with minimal effort. However, for wrestling fans there is still some reason of interest to justify the purchase of the game, in this case the new Attitude Era mode, a real celebration for what has been the most intense and significant period for the federation of Vince McMahon, who saw the rise of the likes of ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin and The Rock, as well as the infamous ~Monday Night War,~ in which WWE and WCW Monday night house shows battled it out in a war of ratings which in the end saw the former prevail and absorb the latter. Attitude issue Once you start WWE '13, you are faced with a home screen particularly rich in options. In fact, it is possible to try your hand at a single performance, choosing whether it will be a one-on-one match, a tag team match, a triple threat, a fatal fourway, a six-man match, a handicap match or even of a specialty or the King of the Ring tournament. Each of these options has various possible stipulations: from the standard match to the extreme rules in which everything is allowed, from the fearsome Hell in a Cell to the Inferno match, passing through the Iron Man, the Last Man Standing, the Steel Cage and the Ladder match. Nothing new under the sun, mind you: this type of offer has been present in Yuke's production for several years, but it's nice that at least nothing has been cut, quite the contrary. The WWE Universe mode on Wii is unfortunately a shadow of itself, as it takes the form of a simple television ~season~ between Raw and Smackdown, with a sequence of matches that we can decide to play in first person or simulate, but without the possibility of intervening substantially on the storyline. In short, the old General Manager mode provided much greater satisfaction. On the other hand, the speech relating to the Attitude Era mode is quite different, which also on the Nintendo console represents an interesting novelty compared to the previous ~Road to WrestleMania~ and offers us six storylines to be unlocked gradually, in which we will control the D-Generation in order X, ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, Mick Foley, The Rock, Bret Hart and the duo formed by Kane and The Undertaker. The goal is to recreate events that really happened during the ~Monday Night War~, so it won't be enough to simply win the matches, but certain requirements will have to be met, slightly increasing the variety of an action otherwise too similar to that of the past editions. Don't try this at home The control system of WWE '13 provides for the use of Wii-Mote and Nunchuk or the Classic Controller, better if Pro. The commands have not changed, but some interesting additions can be noted in terms of gameplay, in this case the possibility of executing moves aiming at a certain part of the body, with a view to then applying a submission maneuver, and the so-called ~comeback~, i.e. a sequence of characteristic moves that every superstar performs during matches when, in fact, he ~gasses~ and returns to control the match. Thus we have John Cena's ~flying blocks~ sequence, followed by the dunk and the ~Five Knuckle Shuffle~, rather than Daniel Bryan's somersault off the post, followed by a running dodge and then a flying elbow. In short, sequences that wrestling fans will not fail to appreciate and which give a minimum of panache to the playful offer, unfortunately scarce due to excessively slow rhythms, which ~put the contest to sleep~ rather than making it engaging. To this we must add the age-old question of the technical sector, which if on the sound front manages to limit the damage (but not even thenmuch, given that the commentary edited by Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler seems less ~alive~ than usual this year) collapses miserably from the point of view of graphics, which in practice has not changed since the days of the WWE games on GameCube and therefore offers us the usual polygonal models with few variations, some new animations and an unwatchable polygonal audience.", "date": "2012-11-05", "grade": "6.0"}
