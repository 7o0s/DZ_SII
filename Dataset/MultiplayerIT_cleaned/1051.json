Already starting from the introductory film one can notice an exponentially greater care for the story factor compared to the previous episodes: beyond the exceptional technical realization of the FMVs and the tastefully cinematic cut of the direction, the explicit presence of the actual protagonists of the story should be noted, who now have a name, a face and a personality. All with the exception of the main character, i.e. the user, who remains a ~ghost~ figure in order to increase the player's feeling of identification. The choices made by Namco in this sense seem quite spot on, both because they contribute to making the storyline more exciting (which therefore acts as a further incentive for the player to continue in the adventure) and because they manage to make the actual dogfight sessions more dynamic and engaging of the game. During the first moments of the adventure, in fact, the user will find himself having to play the role of captain of his own squadron, made up precisely of three pilots appearing in the filmed sequences. This event is directly related to two of the novelties present in Ace Combat 5. The first, more exquisitely choreographic and accessory, concerns the very dense radio dialogues that accompany every single mission of the game: communications from companions, allies and enemies follow one another at a rapid pace , sometimes even generating confusion, but still contributing significantly to increase the feeling of pure involvement. Above all because the player is often asked to respond with a simple ~yes~ or ~no~ via the D-Pad to requests or questions over the radio: to tell the truth, the consequences of choosing one or the other option are almost nil, but the trick still works. More important in playful terms, on the other hand, is the possibility granted to the player to supply his wingmen at any time with four different types of orders (frontal attack on the objective, defense of the guide aircraft, dispersion and use of the special weapon) assigned to the directions of the D Pad. It must be said that regardless of the profile chosen, the bulk of the work is always up to the user: and thank goodness, since taking down enemies in Ace Combat 5 is damned fun. Lucy in the sky with missiles As we said, the basic gameplay in Ace Combat 5 has remained substantially unchanged, as has the control system, still balancing between ease of use and semblances of realism. Hovering in the air and hunting for planes, tanks and enemy positions is always an exhilarating experience, made even more complete by the new potential of the on-screen map, which is more informative and whose zoom can be adjusted by pressing the appropriate button . The missions that make up the game vary between enemy annihilation operations, the protection of certain objectives and even reconnaissance or stealth attacks: the variety on offer is good, and above all appreciable are some twists in the middle of certain missions involving sudden changes in objectives. Of course, those familiar with the series will find themselves the victim of powerful deja-vu in certain cases (the stage inside the canyon is now a classic), but this in no way weighs on the overall value of the product. As per tradition, then, Ace Combat 5 places a lot of emphasis on the care in the construction of the aircraft available in the game: in graphic terms, this takes the form of truly high-impact specimens, but that's not all. The different planes have unique characteristics, which make them very different from each other and greatly affect their performance at the time of battle. It is no coincidence, in fact, that the player is asked, during the briefing, to choose a device for himself and for his three companions that may prove to be suitable for the situation envisaged in the stage in question. Furthermore, new aircraft models become available for purchase both by meeting certain requirements during missions (most often by shooting down a good number of opponents), and by using the same type of aircraft several times. In short, Ace Combat 5 offers an experience that is in some ways more complete than its predecessors, and as it is reasonable to expect, it also takes a leap forward on a technical level. In addition to the aforementioned excellence of the aircraft models, the Namco title offers graphically excellent scenarios to the eye, endowed with a truly remarkable and extremely realistic extension: although some areas suffer from less care in the realization, in general we often find ourselves forget for a moment the war commitments for festop to admire the breathtaking sceneries that the game is able to show. Also from the sound point of view, Ace Combat 5 settles on high quality levels: the effects are credible and enveloping, while the voices that make up the dubbing are spot on and even provide a discreet acting. Then the orchestral music is excellent, able especially in moments of maximum drama to give the user a further emotional boost. Comment Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War continues in the best way the tradition of successes inaugurated by the progenitor on PSX, proposing the well-tested game structure of the previous ones and enriching it with a whole series of side elements capable of making the playful experience even more exciting. Graphically excellent (albeit with some sporadic drop in tone) and fun as always, Ace Combat 5 enhances its proverbial dogfight action, thanks to a truly atmospheric audio sector, with evocative music and dense dialogue via radio. An exciting storyline described through high-level FMVs and an intelligent realization of the various missions complete the picture of what can certainly be defined as the best chapter of the series. Pros: Excellent technical realization Race gameplay Storyline and exciting missions Cons: Not revolutionary Some occasional drop in tone US version review The Ace Combat series has always represented a sure point of reference for Sony users passionate about dogfight, both for the absence of serious competitors on the market, and above all for the constant good quality of the products: characterized by frenetic arcade game mechanics with realistic and probable elements, the titles of the Namco brand have therefore built their success precisely on the basis of this winning formula. Which as such, is obviously not distorted by the latter Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War, a harbinger of some sideline news but loyal to tradition in terms of the play structure. And this is undoubtedly a good thing.", "date": "2005-02-03", "grade": null}
