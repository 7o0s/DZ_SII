The Sims expansions can be categorized into different types: free updates, Stuff Packs, i.e. expansions of objects only, Game Packs that introduce objects, social interactions and a small themed neighborhood and Expansion Packs that add to all the elements already listed new game mechanics. Until now we have always dealt with the last category of expansions, currently three in all, but today for the first time we find ourselves talking about a Game Pack, in this case the one dedicated to vampires, welcomed by the players with great happiness and which, compared to Trip to the open air and A day at the Spa, offers decidedly interesting novelties and dynamics. The Supernatural We Like: The Sims 4 New Game Pack Introduces Vampires! Family matters Before talking about vampires (don't worry, we'll get there) mention should be made of the latest free update of the game which introduced babies with no small delay. We won't explain in detail all the dynamics added to the game with the arrival of babies but two in particular seem interesting to us. The first concerns the frugoletti themselves, capable of improving in 5 different skills and which will lead to the consolidation of the Sim's character after the transition from baby to child, because with the exception of the ability to use the potty, which does not affect the Sim, babies can excel in the development of intellectual, motor, social and creative skills. The other interesting aspect concerns the Sims who can take care of babies: not all Sims can in fact take care of a baby and to do so they must be either the biological parents of the child or guardians directly. The game defines the latter as assistants in the care and each Sim dear to the baby can become one (or stop being one) by selecting the ~adopt as in need of care~ item in the baby care menu. Once the baby issue has been addressed, we finally get to talking about vampires... starting right from the family. In the Create a Sim section it is possible to create a vampire using all the new tools of the mode and in addition to clothes with an ancient and gothic taste, many different somatic traits have been introduced, so that everyone can create their favorite vampire Sim; we will therefore have access to different skin colors, facial features, iridescent eyes and fangs of different sizes. A vampire also has different character traits and for this reason three sub-types of aspirations have been added in the categories knowledge, family and popularity. In the first case, our vampire Sim will want to become a powerful and respected undead by climbing the social hierarchy; in the popularity branch we will be able to select the ~good vampire~ item, after all nobody would like to have a bloodsucker as a friend, while in the family section we will find the desire to create a family of vampires. Here a small distinction should be made on the term family, more similar to the concept of vampire progeny. In fact, with the ~vampire family~ aspiration, our vampire will want to create his own personal circle of undead, vampirizing human Sims and then introducing them to the vampire arts; however it is possible that within a loving couple, where one of the two is a vampire and the other human, a vampire baby is born but it will not be possible to determine the nature of the unborn child until they reach adolescence, when they will begin to manifest vampire powers. In short, it is possible that our Sims become vampires, are created as such or are already born like this by inheriting the trait from at least one parent... and in case you are wondering, in the last case it is possible to ~force~ the growth of the vampire teenager , since vampires don't age. I want to suck your plasma! Managing a vampire Sim is not like managing a human one given that the need bars have dropped to only five: the energy one is no longer green but purple and is twice as long, then sociality, fun, hygiene remain while ~hunger~ becomes ~thirst~; another interface change is the plumbob, because the green diamond above the head of our vampire Simmers is surrounded by a stone ring with a bat carved on it. Everything then takes place in the new Forgotten Hollow district, a map with five lots arranged around a Gothic garden: like every district, Forgotten Hollow also has its own peculiarities and in this map the night will last much longer. As we well know, vampires shun sunlight but our vampire Sims, with a little attention, can also walk during the day but it is logical thattheir mood and the effectiveness of their powers will improve after the sun goes down. Once our Sim is a vampire what will they be able to do? Essentially our vampire Sims will be able to move much faster than others, manifest or hide their vampire form, transform into a bat, hypnotize other Sims and of course drink their plasma. Obviously the effectiveness of their powers depends on his degree of vampire experience. A special menu point has been added to the Sim menu at the bottom right of the screen, to keep the evolution of our vampire under control; as we mentioned, in fact, in the vampire community there is a sort of hierarchy and each degree can be reached by enhancing one's vampire powers. To acquire new vampire points you essentially have to devote yourself to the study of vampires, train your powers and associate with other vampires, challenging them in supernatural battles or simply chatting with them. The more the score grows the more powerful the Sim will become and each level earned will give the player the opportunity to unlock new traits within the vampire menu, a sort of tree of vampire upgrades. Obviously, power comes at a price and to make your extra abilities more effective, malus must also be selected, always from the same menu: your vampire, for example, may not digest and vomit human food, be more sensitive to sunlight or feel guilty after drinking plasma from another Sim in a non-consensual way. The personal interactions on third-party Sims are perhaps the funniest introduced in this game pack and in addition to being able to vampirize another Sim or drink their blood (or by asking a friend kindly or by attacking a stranger) you can hypnotize all the humans you want by forcing them to various actions such as sitting down, being evil or even more helpful, cleaning the house and fixing broken objects... after all, why pay a plumber or a maid when you can charm a fool who passes by your mansion? It goes without saying that the game pack really adds a lot of objects both in the buy and build mode: furniture, stone floors and candles are some of the most inspired objects, ideal both in the home of a vampire and a human with very goth tastes!", "date": "2017-01-23", "grade": null}
