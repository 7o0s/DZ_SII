{"name": "Tell Me Why: Capitolo Uno - Ritorno a Casa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tell-me-why-capitolo-uno-ritorno-a-casa-recensione.html", "text": "Dontnod has never made a secret of his willingness to address sensitive issues in his latest video games, starting with the first Life is Strange in which he talks about homosexuality, among other things, to then move on to a declared social criticism and a clear stance against Trump thanks to Life is Strange 2. The review of Tell Me Why talks about a project that is no less since it deals with a topic that is possibly more delicate than the previous ones: transsexuality. Where in past titles the themes brought into play formed the scaffolding of the narrative but were not necessarily the fulcrum, even if they played an important role, in this case the development team decided to rotate the story around the transition path faced by the protagonist and to the concept of acceptance by the outside world - especially the mother. A high stakes, that of Dontnod, which in a period where it is easy to get caught up in an involuntary mistake (see the case of Deadly Premonition 2 and deadnaming) has decided to take a risk and contribute to the LGBTQ+ community by exploiting the video game. Tell Me Why is a narrative adventure divided into three episodes, which will be published just one week apart and which we will deal with step by step at the right time: starting with the first, Homecoming. In freezing Alaska Tell Me Why tells the story of Alyson and Tyler Ronan, twins who were separated for ten years due to the death of their mother: it is difficult to tell a purely narrative game without running into spoilers but we can tell you that the tragedy is due to an act of self-defense for Tyler, a young girl at the time but already sure of her transition path and with whom her mother seemed to disagree adamantly. This incident led the brothers to live far from each other until the longed-for reunion: they have grown up, are twenty-one years old and are ready to make a definitive change in their lives by closing the accounts with a past that has not stopped torment them. The first episode focuses precisely on the return to their hometown, Delos Lake, where Alyson remained to live while Tyler spent his years at the Fireweed Residential Center - a center where he was able to reflect on himself and undergo hormone therapy to become in the end the person he felt he was all that time. The big step to take in trying to move forward is to sell their old house, the one where the tragedy took place and which still carries too many memories: both for him and for her, setting foot again is a considerable weight on the shoulders that from their words he returns a childhood where happiness was a rare luxury. It talks about a mother, both called only Mary-Ann, very strict but they are memories that at times clash with our surroundings to the point of making it difficult to establish who she really was - and it is undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the game so far. Mary-Ann is an ambiguous figure, a mother in constant conflict and tense to the extreme to keep together a family without a father figure: nothing is known of the father, he is never mentioned and it is as if he never existed. A trip down memory lane, that of the twins, which not only passes from the voice but also from real apparitions, the backbone of the entire game together with the now well-known narrative crossroads due to the various branching dialogues. Bond between twins Following the path traced with the first Life is Strange, Tyler and Alyson also have very particular powers which in this case we can read as the concrete manifestation of that bond that the twins are said to have: something that however goes beyond what was seen with Max and Daniel , emerging in different ways starting with the possibility of reliving one's memories when they feel a strong emotion. These appear at the beginning as indistinct particle shapes, which come ~to life~ when we interact with them, re-presenting a cross-section of their lives as children: it is a fundamental mechanic in the continuation of the game, aimed at shedding light on the figure of the mother - in particular by the will of Tyler, who from that fateful night carries with him the weight of having been almost killed by her because he did not accept who he was. Setting foot in the old house will lead the two brothers to reconsider their positions, including Alyson who, although not having experienced a concrete danger like that of his brother, he seems to be hiding something. Investigating Mary-Ann consequently leads to seeing past events from another perspective, to doubt themselves and their perceptions, to wonder if the woman was really as wrong as they always believed she was. In this respect,Dontnod manages once again to paint a deeply felt cross-section of life, in which it is difficult to take sides with one or the other because they are all so human - and therefore fallacious - as to make it impossible to understand who is right; assuming that this reason really exists, we are talking about two worlds at the antipodes like that of two little girls who feel ~tyrannized~ by their mother and a woman who shares nothing about herself, preventing us from understanding what she is thinking. Returning to the question of powers, Alyson and Tyler also share the so-called Voice, i.e. the ability to communicate telepathically: it is something they had in common as children and apparently it was lost over time, it is not clear whether due to the trauma suffered or for the distance that separated them. This mechanic can be exploited in the game to share thoughts that otherwise could not be expressed aloud due to contingent situations (trivially, the presence of other people who should not hear the conversation) and looks interesting for the future. For now it has been little used, limiting itself to being the background during some sections of the chapter. Finally, considering the rather discordant memories between the two brothers, in certain cases it is possible to choose which of the re-enactments to listen to in order to continue with the story: this is another way of exposing what in the previous games were the critical decisions, able to give a real twist to the narrative and help strengthen or loosen their bond. Of course, there is no shortage of relationships with the other characters, who can usually evolve and improve or encounter resistance depending on our decisions. While remaining faithful to the origins, the gameplay tries to expand a little by offering some if not original twist in itself at least new in the series, thus increasing the diversity of approach. Structure of the dialogues We want to dedicate a small paragraph to this point for the simple fact that the structure of the dialogues begins to feel old and stagnant: unlike other video games, trivially the recent Wasteland 3 (without prejudice to the diversity between the two genres), the construction of the dialogues follows a logical thread in which the conversation evolves, for better or for worse, based on the answers we give. This in Tell Me Why is missing, just as it was in the previous titles, thus presenting a dissonance and leaving the feeling of following a dialogue between automatons rather than human beings. Of course, the expressiveness and the tones combine to make it very plausible but since the now distant 2015 the weight of this ~compartmented~ narrative is making itself felt: after the first interaction, whatever it is, the remaining options feel very clearly forced to the 'inside a dialogue that has taken its own direction but is abruptly brought back unraveling that connection that has arisen between the two parties. To give a practical example, if the question ~how can I help you?~ we decide to answer by asking what the interlocutor is dealing with, once this exchange is over, the next bar cannot bring the dialogue back to the beginning as if what has just been said had never existed. On closer inspection, in some cases it seems that the order of the answers is pre-established, from first to last, in order not to run into these logical inconsistencies that break the immersiveness and leave us perplexed to think what a conversation like this would be like in real life. If in Life is Strange it could have been forgivable and with the second season it began to make itself felt a little more, having reached the third game it risks weighing too much on the fluidity of the narrative. Summing up Homecoming is, like all the introductory chapters, a slow start, which takes its time and works above all on the character of Tyler - his relationship with his sister, inevitably stunted after ten years away and some friction of which there is no we reveal nothing, but also about the outside world itself towards which it has an instinctive aggression aimed mostly at protecting it. An excellent job has been done in visual terms, leaving aside the still somewhat ~plasticky~ style of the previous game to embrace a softer one and give further likelihood to its characters, who can be even more expressive. On the narrative level, however, the desire to focus on Tyler means that the chapter is quite flat, well built on the human side but slow on the development itself, so much so that the final twist has little impact and is rather predictable.C 'is a hint of supernatural external to the powers of the twins that could lead the story to interesting shores, for the moment, however, the departure of Tell Me Why is fair enoughta: there is also the decision to divide the game into three chapters and distribute them closely together. From the almost biblical times of Life is Strange 2 we move on to a clean cut which, however, is almost ridiculous, given the few days apart from each other. Given the brevity of the story, which in length follows the pattern of Life is Strange: Before the Storm, it remains to be seen how much Dontnod will mesh with the two remaining chapters.", "date": "2020-08-27", "grade": "7.5"}
