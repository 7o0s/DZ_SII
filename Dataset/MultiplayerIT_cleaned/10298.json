The fourth episode had made us catch our breath, and then suddenly take it away at the end during the killing of Guybrush, who awakens more alive than ever, but trapped in the realm of the dead. We don't want to reveal what will happen to our hero in the afterlife, but we can tell you that he will have to face a journey that will confront him with different feelings: loyalty, trust, disillusionment and redemption. He will suffer, yes; we will see him trudge, lose momentum and finally regain vigor thanks to his love for Elaine. The jokes and jokes are confirmed as a trait dear to the series, but without becoming predominant and leaving room for gloomy and finely mature tones. The fifth episode also abounds in unpublished scenarios and focuses attention only on the primary characters. This last aspect is important, because it restores the stature of nemesis to LeChuck and allows us to fully explore the secondary plots of a psychological nature that have been more or less explicitly woven throughout the series. The age of reason You will forgive us if we don't dwell too much on the analysis of the episode itself, but Tales of Monkey Island: Rise of the Pirate God is such an important piece precisely because it manages to overcome the concept of a self-contained chapter that had partly characterized the first three releases of Tales of Monkey Island, recomposing all the work done by Telltale in a major episode that finds its place in the macro continuity of Monkey Island. On the one hand it is the easiest chapter to solve in terms of puzzles, but it reaches significant peaks from the point of view of the evolution of Guybrush Threepwood. The formidable pirate, once quite ditzy and light-hearted, is now capable of making choices and taking on responsibilities: this means that he has grown up. We are also very pleased to hear that the music finally lives up to the voice acting and artistic direction, helping to weave the powerful atmosphere of Rise of the Pirate God. That said, there is still some work to be done, as some twists fall into genre clichs and the pace of the story flattens out on an average line that lasts most of the time. From this point of view, if you can't feel a personal attachment to the series, you may not understand all the enthusiasm that longtime fans reserve for it. In particular, some key revelations will leave you indifferent if you are not able to connect them to the past of Monkey Island. But that's the limit you come across when you want to develop a storyline that has a decade of history on its back. Ultimately, these five episodes confirm the return of interest among the general public for graphic adventures, and we hope they will encourage Telltale to courageously continue along the path they have taken. Tales of Monkey Island is a series composed of five chapters and inspired by a saga of the nineties, The Secret of Monkey Island. The work is carried on by Telltale, with the collaboration of a large part of the original team. The episodes are released on a monthly basis and from time to time you can read the review on Multiplayer.it. NOTE: At launch, all Tales of Monkey Island episodes are available in English only. After some time, Telltale releases translations of the subtitles in other European languages, but there is still no official announcement about the timing. Those for the PC version cannot be purchased separately, unlike what happens for the Wii.", "date": "2009-12-21", "grade": "8.3"}
