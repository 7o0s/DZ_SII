{"name": "Moto GP Manager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp-manager.html", "text": "Born in 2002 to replace the 500 class, the Moto GP category represents the most powerful branch of the world championship. The name change is due to a modification of the regulation which made it possible to use engines larger than those of 500 cubic centimetres, reaching up to 1000 cc. This value has been limited to 800 cc since last year, following a policy more oriented towards driver safety. Motorcycle racing has seen Italy in the spotlight since time immemorial, and in Moto GP in particular we have outstanding riders such as Valentino Rossi, Loris Capirossi and Marco Melandri to represent us. For such a spectacular sport, a correspondence with the world of video games could not be missing, which for many years has been offering us official and non-official titles with the aim of capturing the emotions, speed and spirit of the world championship. THQ Wireless, formerly responsible for the official Moto GP mobile game, has now decided to release a different product... Moto GP Manager, as the title suggests, is a real manager set in the world of Moto GP. We will therefore find ourselves selecting a driver and a team (both real, given that it is a licensed production) and then face all the situations that occur during the championship, from the fundamentals to the details. In the first place, we will have to check the budget available to the team to guarantee the wages of the mechanics and technicians, paying attention to organizing the work so that it does not exceed the standard times: a team that is squeezed too much inevitably yields less. Once this is done, we will be able to move on to a series of activities that translate into an improvement in the characteristics of the bike and rider: test sessions, physical training, fine-tuning the vehicle from various points of view, and so on. We will have five days available to prepare for each race, and in this time frame we will have to try to get the most out of it in order to then collect the results on the track: if we have done our homework well, the rider will reach a good position and our budget will definitely be fleshed out. At that point we can not only pay the team, but also invest certain sums of money in research and development, dedicate ourselves to press releases and promotions (which bring in more money) and manage any problems. The first thing that catches the eye about Moto GP Manager, unfortunately, is its excessive static nature: the action takes place through a small number of screens, mainly using a simple graphical interface that allows us to control all the factors involved. The qualifying and race sessions, over which we have no direct control anyway, consist of a small number of animations, which become very repetitive already on second viewing. The choice of fonts for the text is not always happy, to the detriment of readability, and in general the developers could have done more to add ~quantity~ to the product. The sound sector, as often happens, consists of a small number of MIDI music of mediocre quality. PRO Original basic idea Simple and intuitive interface Official Moto GP license AGAINST Limited and repetitive Graphics too thin and essential Not much fun", "date": "2008-10-23", "grade": "S.V."}
