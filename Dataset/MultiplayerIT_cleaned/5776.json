Growing up in the dust and coming to rest on your laurels. The iconography of a complex sporting world such as boxing is among the most effective in conveying this kind of values. Through the struggle of a single man for success, the audience is able to identify themselves, to experience that sense of accomplishment that is sometimes lacking in everyday life. The cinematic examples abound, from the myth of Rocky to the excruciating realism of Million Dollar Baby, from the reconstruction of Ali to the dramas of The Fighter, and we could go on and on. For its part, the world of video games has always tried to represent the fighting disciplines from slightly more pragmatic assumptions, focusing on the action itself and outlining only in a veiled way the difficulties, the sacrifices, the prospects for success of those who believe to the end. Lazy Bear Games is a small studio based in St. Petersburg and the adventure of these guys is the same as hundreds of other indie developers have in common: trying to turn a passion into a full-time job. Born at the turn of the 80s, they spent their childhood among the consoles of the 8-bit era, animated series such as The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the films of Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal. The appreciation and nostalgia for that era led them to create a title that draws heavily from that period, both visually and sonically and with an eye for quotes. The passion for the strategic genre has also persuaded them to set up a game in which entering the ring does not only mean fighting, where interaction also involves careful management of all the details of one's career. Thus was born Punch Club, an interesting experiment which, while referring to past aesthetics, offers us an unconventional interactive reading. Punch Club will make you sweat the proverbial seven shirts and will force you to optimize your resources Talent is not enough The opening cut-scene shows us a boxer intent on training with a bag, his son watches him a few steps away. ~One day you'll become better than me,~ she tells him, without interrupting her physical activity. The next sequence takes us to a deserted alley, where the man is shot dead by a mysterious individual dressed in black and with one eye lit up red. On his deathbed, the man urges his son to give his best, to train every day of his life with a single purpose in mind: the summit. The feat is easy to say but not so simple to put into practice, as the player will be able to understand on his own skin from the very first bars of the game. A tortuous journey begins, you meet people in and out of the ring, you face choices, you suffer and you sweat. The Punch Club adventure recalls many different experiences, amalgamates role-playing and strategic tendencies with a good dose of planning drawn from the management genre. It is essential to get into gear, manage resources properly, choose what you want to become and then act accordingly. Getting something wrong is equivalent to soon finding yourself on a dead end, pace of dreams of glory. Basically you have to train, but everything has a cost, both in economic and physical terms. To exercise properly in the gym one must be healthy. That's why there are four different bars that manage the conditions of the protagonist, marked throughout the twenty-four hours of the day. By sleeping you regain your strength but your metabolism consumes food, so you need to eat before each workout and you need to have money on the side, because the gym and supplements don't give them to you. Money that at the beginning can only be raised by carrying out hard and low-paying jobs, capable of negatively affecting the happiness bar. A low level of satisfaction soon leads to bad training and poor results, worsening the use of resources. The direct consequence is a lower spending capacity: it means having to skip the gym, start losing and end your days on a bad path. As it is easy to understand the balance is delicate, the player has the task of guessing which resources are more effective than others, developing an efficient daily strategy and continuing to level the character without interruption, also starting to participate in the meetings. The management of all the activities takes place through a map, on which the points of interest necessary to continue the adventure are progressively marked. Moving from one place to another can come at a cost in terms of money or time spentor, depending on whether you decide to go on foot or by bus, therefore setting up your winning strategy must also take these variables into account. If you want to avoid being subject to robberies, for example, it is inadvisable to accumulate too much money in your pockets without spending it. Moreover, this solution does not hide contradictory and sometimes unjustly punitive profiles. After all, which boxer, even an amateur, would let himself be robbed by the first desperate unarmed man passing on the street?! Choose your path In Punch Club the very idea of sacrifice has been rendered very well, it is immediately clear how much you have to sweat already to get the first noteworthy results, let alone sign a professional contract and enter the Olympus of the discipline. Fundamental in this respect is the criterion of physical fitness management, combined with the choice of the most congenial path for building the athlete. After the first hours of the game it is in fact possible to choose three different paths: The Via dell'Orso is suitable for those who want to maximize strength, the Via della Tigre is perfect for focusing on agility, while the Via della Tartaruga winks at those who prefer to specialize in stamina control. Choosing between one of these categories is an obligatory step, since the points obtained through victories in fights will not be sufficient to optimize everything. The skill trees have also been designed in great detail and branched out to the point of guaranteeing a wide range of alternatives to the player, inspiring him to continue and touch each progress with his own hands. The structure of the fights, on the other hand, is typical of a managerial one, you simply select the type of moves and perks with which to equip your athlete and you have to analyze the build of the opponent controlled by artificial intelligence in order to maximize the damage. The system is quite intuitive but in our opinion the balancing would have required more care. In fact, we have found differences in efficiency between the strength and agility categories, which often appear unjustified for the same performance. Beyond the sporting complications, the personal vicissitudes of the protagonist must also be managed, which will lead him on a terrain full of pitfalls, up to the decision to avenge the murder of his father. Along this path, non-sporting decisions will therefore be taken, such as for example the opportunity or not to lend aid to the underworld in exchange for money and respect, support for friends and the courtship of a woman. As we had already mentioned, Punch Club is full of quotes of all sorts, from the soundtrack vaguely inspired by Rocky to the presence of characters that resemble Steven Seagal and the Ninja Turtles, from wrestlers taken from the Street Fighter universe up to iconographic details inspired by films such as Pulp Fiction and The Godfather.", "date": "2016-01-14", "grade": "8.0"}
