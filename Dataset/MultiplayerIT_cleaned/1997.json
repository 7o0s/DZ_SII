{"name": "Beach Life", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beach-life_a.html", "text": "A tropical and virtual paradise The goal of the British developer Deep Red was to offer a title that would appeal to fans of classic strategic and management games, however introducing some original innovations and leveraging a popular theme, such as the summer holidays - which it would not even resist the most sedentary and workaholic gamer! The strong point of the game, as well as the main innovation promised by the manufacturing company, is the balance between the management of human and financial resources and the interpretation of customer behavior, which requires the player to be able to profit from the administration of your own virtual village, adapting to the changing needs of the mass of tourists who populate it. To facilitate this thankless task, detailed statistics are provided, as well as the possibility of ~spying~ on guests during their stay (even in the most intimate moments and thoughts): we will get to know them one by one, we will learn their tastes, we will follow them all their activities on the island and we will even be able to immortalize them in photography. It is above all because of this voyeuristic component that, from the very early stages of the game's development, comparisons with The Sims were inevitable but, in reality, I think that Beach Life is more easily comparable to titles such as Rollercoaster Tycoon and Theme Park: there we still find ourselves managing an entrepreneurial activity and not so much the life of our customers, even if their happiness and well-being for us translate into wealth and are therefore desirable! A tropical and virtual paradise Beyond this, the title provides everything necessary for the creation and management of a self-respecting tropical paradise. And in fact here I am, after a few hours of play, admiring the fruit of my labors in ecstasy: it's sunset and a soft light caresses the beach, on which happy couples stroll; from a sheltered cove, my lifeguard watches over the last customers lingering in the warm tropical waters of the island; time seems to have stopped, while the bars, the ice cream parlors and the rental of deckchairs and pedal boats close, but soon the lights will come on which will enliven the long night of the village, full of fun, music and above all alcohol (the most requested product ever)! Needless to say, the magic of nature is irresistible...at least until it scourges tourists with endless tropical downpours or decimates them in shark-infested waters! But we are also here for this: it is our job to provide entertainment of all kinds and ensure the safety of the village's customers. Preparations are in full swing and the first clubs and restaurants open; punctual, I unleash a horde of entertainers willing to do anything to make my guests' evenings pleasant and I make sure that the technicians check the correct functioning of the reception facilities and the games room, into whose coffers rivers of money will flow within a few hours. Only the cleaning ladies are always ready to take advantage of my every moment of distraction to hide under a tree and laze around, but the unfortunate women don't know that a click in the personnel management menu is enough for me to sort them out! This instant of peace that I am savoring is destined to be short-lived: I will only be able to catch my breath at the first light of dawn...at least until the morning boat docks, with other customers thirsty for fun on board! For an unforgettable holiday... Two game modes are available: the first consists in overcoming a dozen scenarios of increasing difficulty, unlocking as many settings which include different objectives, from the recovery of an abandoned village or the inauguration of a new island to real challenges with forces of nature; the second mode is called Sandbox and leaves the player carte blanche, i.e. absolute freedom in the development of a tourist village, where and as he sees fit. The missions and environments are varied enough to provide constant stimulation, and the difficulty level is well-balanced. Environments range from lush Caribbean or Mediterranean islands to the driest and rockiest areas of South America - it's up to us to always make them hospitable. For an unforgettable holiday... As has been said, our aim is to offer an ideal holiday destination and to ensure that customers spend more and more, to gradually expand our villa.tourist lage. We have at least sixty items and structures available, including various types of trees and flowers, benches, lighting, restaurants, night clubs, casinos, swimming pools and shops. The buildings are divided into three categories: catering, accommodation and attractions. The latter are certainly the most interesting and range from the rental of equipment such as jet skis and windsurfing to centers for sea excursions; the event stage is especially original, on which shows or beauty contests, singing and wet T-shirts are staged from time to time  a must to keep customers busy even in bad weather! At our service we will have a bevy of employees: lifeguards, entertainers, security and cleaners, mechanics and workers. All buildings and employees are controlled through a series of schematic and intuitive menus, in which it is possible to establish prices, choose the qualities of beer to be sold in the various premises (having these costs and ~side effects~ clearly distinct), program periodic checks of technicians and cleaning shifts, hire and fire staff or change their salaries. To manage everything with maximum efficiency, we will always have to keep an eye on the detailed statistics provided on buildings, staff and customers, easily accessible in each phase of the game and from the resource management menus themselves. The only thing I missed in the interface - otherwise very functional - is a pause button that allows you to stop the game, still being able to enter commands. For an unforgettable holiday... The graphics are very colorful and sufficiently detailed, even if the three zoom modes available are ultimately reduced to two, because the close-up one is too grainy. The impossibility of rotating the isometric view to your liking is a bit inconvenient. The animations are especially pleasant and well cared for: I watched with dismay as a rescue by my busty lifeguard, complete with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and a shark attack complete with screams and blood splatters on the water. Even the climatic and environmental effects, which make a conspicuous contribution to the atmosphere, are decidedly realistic: I was particularly struck by the mirage effect on the warmer islands and the gradations of light in the alternation of day and night. Given the level of detail and the breadth of the settings, when many characters and many animations are concentrated on the screen, it becomes onerous for the system to keep scrolling fluid, but otherwise the game is not at all pretentious in terms of hardware resources. For an unforgettable holiday... The soundtrack of Beach Life is made up of a dozen catchy songs, even if tiring in the long run, but there is the possibility of personalizing it by copying your own MP3 files in the appropriate ~Music~ folder, and then managing their reproduction thanks to a integrated player: in fact, two distinct lists can be created, one with songs with exotic, summery and carefree sounds to accompany the daytime life of the village and one with techno or ambient songs for night-time revelry; to those provided in the game we can also add our favorite titles. The sound effects are normal for a game of this type: laughter, squeals, exclamations from customers, all seasoned with the sounds of nature. Build, manage and...spy A particular mention deserves the artificial intelligence of the customers, on which we are provided with a whole series of parameters, from the level of satisfaction to that of burns and drunkenness. But that's not all: we can follow them while they sunbathe, brutalize themselves with alcohol or try to hook up at the disco. It is obvious that keeping an eye on them also and above all helps to understand what their needs are: a customer who turns green and vomits is certainly not well, for example, and could suggest a malfunction in the water purification system. Nonetheless, voyeurism itself offers healthy entertainment: just to get an idea, I tried to follow two clients for an entire day (and at this point a premise is in order: in the USA, this title is recommended to a ~mature~ and, although our overseas colleagues are too puritanical, you will soon understand why...). Joy Custer swam all morning with enviable endurance, ate, shopped, and went to the bathroom three times; as darkness fell, however, she turned into a deadly sex machine (her words): she flirted without restraint withfor an aperitif at four in the morning, until she managed to drag a poor victim onto the beach, indulging in a few minutes of passion with him. John O'Reilly's constant thought throughout the evening, however, was something like this: ~The only thing I can think of is a nice pair of firm butts!~ ... then he got drunk and fell asleep on the beach, after tragically going blank with two girls in a row! Summing up... Beach Life is definitely enjoyable: satisfying our guests by filling them with alcohol and ice cream is always a pleasure, as well as discovering new attractions from time to time and learning how to break your own box office records. The objectives proposed in the various scenarios add flavor to the challenge and the humor that permeates every aspect of it, from the descriptions of the options in the menus to the considerations of the customers, makes the gaming experience even more enjoyable. The only missing ingredient, perhaps, is the male presence: the menus are densely populated by attractive daughters in bikinis, but young men are scarce  this is a note for the developers, who seem to have shamefully neglected the female audience! Summing up... All in all, it is a rather original title in its setting but fundamentally classic in its implementation: protecting customers from sharks or sunstroke is something hitherto unheard of in strategic and management video games, but experts in the genre will be able to exhaust the game's resources in a relatively short time, also exploring its limits - the Sandbox mode guarantees a long life for the title, offering the opportunity to test yourself with ever new attractions and scenarios, but still linked to the twelve standard missions. It is therefore an ideal title for summer nostalgics and for those who want to try their hand at a carefree and original management game, but without the pretension of simulating too faithfully an entrepreneurial reality: in short, more than being business-oriented, it is a game pure and simple fun (which doesn't hurt and certainly makes it attractive to a wider audience). A tropical and virtual paradise I've always dreamed of emulating Marlon Brando and buying myself a tropical island, perhaps even placing a nice hotel on it! In the meantime, with the hope of one day being able to realize this and my other imaginative projects, I had to work non-stop all summer, but I was able to vent my frustrations and my desire for holidays thanks to Beach Life, a simulation that allows you to try your hand at managing tourist villages located in beautiful exotic locations.", "date": "2002-10-01", "grade": null}
