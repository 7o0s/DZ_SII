{"name": "Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magic-the-gathering-battlegrounds-2.html", "text": "From cards to pad Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds, this is the title in full, is proposed in the unusual guise of a dynamic strategy, in which a rather significant action component is superimposed on the care for one's choices. At first glance it would seem almost like a fighting game, with the two contenders facing each other ready to fight to the death on a battlefield with pre-established borders. The battlefield will soon prove to be rather atypical, broken in two by a clearly visible dividing line which will greatly influence the movements of the contenders. In fact, if in his own half the player will be able to use all the combat components at will, in the opposing one he will only be able to make sporadic visits, since he has been deprived of all his battle arsenal and therefore defenseless. Often, however, it will be necessary to visit the enemy half to steal the crystals impregnated with the magical sap on which the entire combat system hinges. Everything revolves around the magical power called mana, which will be viewable on the screen in the form of stones and fragments imbued with this force. The specific difference that distinguishes stones from fragments lies above all in their shape, where the former will be visually much larger, but also in substance: if collecting stones will be necessary to increase one's mana slots, recovering the fragments will serve to fill them. To perform one of the three available actions (physical attack, barrier and invocation of a spell) it will be necessary to have sufficient mana points and, consequently, to know how to spend them in the right way. If there is little to say about the barrier and a few words can be said for the physical attack, as the reaction to commands is imprecise in timing, a separate discussion must be made for the spell system. Magical invocations fall into three categories: attack magic, summoning a creature, and support magic. The creatures will be characterized by the value attributed to the resistance and that assigned to the strength, as well as the offensive spells will have ranges of action and well-defined characteristics. In order to put together a spellbook that is as balanced as possible, an infinite number of elements must be kept in mind. In order not to disorient the player too much, Atari has implemented a full-bodied and exhaustive tutorial in the story mode which, in addition to gradually introducing the player into every single card with targeted challenges, will also narrate the epic story of the summoner. The multiplayer component will have a very important role, both for offline and live battles. Going online with your spellbook and challenging players from all over the world is certainly exciting, and the service offered is always up to par. Arcane spells... Even from a technical point of view Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds defends itself quite well, offering a glance of sure interest despite the ups and downs. Well animated and sufficiently detailed polygonal models will alternate on various and characteristic battlefields. Unfortunately, the latter suffer from textures below the potential of the Xbox hardware, resulting in more than one occasion being washed away. Even the framerate is certainly not a hymn to stability, especially in situations where the load for the polygonal engine becomes onerous. As far as light and particle effects are concerned, the Atari title performs really well, giving its best in advanced spells and evocations. Note of demerit instead touches on the sound sector: the accompanying songs are too anonymous and monotonous, which never succeed in the attempt to further immerse the player in the experience given by this full-bodied title. Comment Atari hit the mark, succeeding, although it was not absolutely easy, in recreating the world of Magic the Gathering accessible even to the less experienced. The tutorial, assisted by an almost flawless text translation into Italian, manages to immerse any player in the complex universe of this famous brand, as long as he is stimulated to learn mechanics and geometries. In this sense, the multiplayer modes offered both off and online certainly encourage learning, which will ultimately be repaid by exciting challenges and captivating preparations for battle. Pros: Online service at the height. Complete and effective tutorial. Endless strategy. Cons: Control system not always accurate. Assimilating all the mechanisms could discourage the less accustomed to the genre. Sound not too inspired. Taking part in a fantasy game and being engulfed in itit is a more unique than rare feeling. Stimulating the fantasy neuron, a bit like a feather tickling the nose, causes a well-defined, sometimes astounding reaction. The boundaries between reality and imagination sometimes lose definition, entangling each other to the point of arousing a feeling of loss in those who end up in this spiral. Wizards of the Coast has been dedicated to these details since 1990, the year in which it was founded by Peter D. Adkison, and since then the successes obtained by the various games produced by this immense US house have had a worldwide response. Lately Atari has been very interested in the Wizards brands, first reproducing the most famous tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons in polygons, and then arriving at one of the most famous trading card games ever: Magic the Gathering. Succeeding in the arduous task of involving both enthusiasts and those who are only now discovering the vast world of Magic in this new Xbox title is certainly not a trivial matter. But Atari seems to have found the right way", "date": "2003-11-20", "grade": null}
