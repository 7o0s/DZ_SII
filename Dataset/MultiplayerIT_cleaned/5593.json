The setting is that of the roguelike, with a single life available, while the game model is the classic one of the twin stick shooters seasoned with a somersault that allows you to overcome chasms and stretches of water, as well as guaranteeing immunity during the leap. A ~bullet hell~ comes to life from this recipe, a hell of tough bullets that asks us to avoid tons of shots and to drop as many on enemies of all shapes and colors that get under us every time we enter a room and the doors are sealed. Escape is impossible but we can often count on tables to be used as protection, chandeliers to be dropped on enemies, braziers to be overturned on unfortunate victims and explosive barrels to be used to damage groups of enemies. The result is a hybrid between roguelike and shoot'em up that combines crazy imagery with a John Woo-esque pace. We dove into lead hell to review Enter the Gungeon Two hundred weapons may be enough for me Starting with the name, Enter the Gungeon celebrates its total dedication to the cult of weapons. The incipit of the slender plot revolves around a gigantic divine bullet that devastated an ancient fortress transforming it into the Gungeon, a dangerous place that hides a mysterious gun capable of erasing time. Our goal is to reach it by overcoming five levels that are not particularly long but far from easy to cross. From level to level, heavily armed enemies become more dangerous and difficult to predict among snipers, wizards, animated books that hurl lead letters, warmongering ghosts and adversaries capable of anticipating our movements. When all these funny guys get together, Enter the Gungeon can become a real hell of lead capable of testing our reflexes which fortunately are helped by reactive and precise controls regardless of the control system used. However, it happens that the volume of fire is such as to make it practically impossible not to be hit and this is where vital energy comes into play, symbolized by shell casings that are romantically paired to form the classic little hearts. Vitality can be recovered, as can bullets, but it is not said that it is possible to do so since the drops are random as well as the items in the shop. Among these, however, we can find equally useful resources such as special shells that eliminate all stray shots, power-ups, extra magazines, maps, cigarettes, bombs of all kinds and armor. Every item can make a difference, including basic equipment and special abilities that differentiate the four available characters. The latter do not affect the gameplay, unlike some of the passive ones, but they can still be essential for survival. A striking example is offered by the pilot, a bold type inspired by the young Han Solo, who can try to break into the chests even in the absence of keys. This means one more possibility of accessing the drops that can radically change the course of the game, starting with the weapons which, as we have anticipated, are the protagonists of the setting. The arsenal of Enter the Gungeon begins with the more or less modest equipment of the four characters to arrive, in a short time with a little luck, to sci-fi monstrosities capable of producing end-of-the-world laser kaleidoscopes. And between the two extremes there are about two hundred instruments of death which, between experiments, inventions and quotations, cover an immense imagination. Impossible not to mention the t-shirt shooter with which Homer made Flanders a widower, the ice shooter that slows down enemies, Judge Dredd's gun, the camera, the naval cannon, the explosive banana and so on and so forth. The choice is vast to say the least, as is the variety of situations despite the obvious limitations of the procedural generation of the rooms and despite the fact that the extension of the levels is not particularly large. But between weapons, secret dungeons, rooms full of chasms, well-characterized bosses, traps of all kinds and mine carts, it's really hard to get bored. Lead apocalypse Enter the Gungeon is a challenging and punishing title but the high difficulty is not just a question of gameplay calibration. The combination of the enormous number of drops and their total randomness has the advantage of making each game different, but it can also catapult us into a real nightmare due to the low precision of some weapons and the enormous differenceof potential among the loot available. If on the one hand it happens to already arrive at the first boss with a heavy machine gun, on the other it happens to find oneself in the presence of the fearsome Beholster with a seagull shooter and two thirds of the starting vitality, despite having never suffered damage. In these cases, frustration is lurking and it is clear that big balancing problems can arise. However it must be said that Enter the Dungeon does not end with its random side. The player's dodging and skill in using it are of fundamental importance in the face of recognizable enemies linked to very specific patterns that allow us to embark on a tactical approach. Among other things, the movements of the enemies are quite predictable and hardly avoid traps, even if they exploit every single opportunity granted to them. The end-of-level monsters, for example, rely on the classic spins but reserve close-quarter surprise attacks for us. All the others, on the other hand, have no qualms about using the screen, just like us, protecting themselves with tables and trying to hit us with chandeliers. The level of care is undeniable and also manifests itself with a series of secrets and quests that further expand the title by opening the way for a delicious shortcut, for secret dungeons or for a museum inevitably dedicated to weapons in which we can spend a resource obtainable from boss to unlock new trinkets. We are not talking about complex additions but appreciable touches that guarantee an important sense of progression in the face of an experience suspended halfway between player skill and chaos, which can sometimes be frustrating and does nothing to engage us narratively. Too bad, among other things, for the local-only co-op which is not supported by particularly exciting synergies, although there are obvious advantages in being able to combine the effects of some weapons. Visually, however, is another story. Seemingly pure two-dimensional craftsmanship, Enter the Gungeon hides a trick called Unity. The 2D setting rests on a 3D engine and this gives us a combination of detail and fluidity that manifests itself as much in the movements of the characters as in the debris of the explosions, in the fluttering sheets and in the laden tables that project supplies everywhere. All topped off with occasional real-time reflections and an inspired design that gives us four delightful characters sent to defeat a large number of well-differentiated bosses that include the aforementioned Beholster, an annoying rock snake, the ruler of bullets, a large skull, the Gorgun, a seagull armed with Vulcan and the two trigger cufflinks. The overall quality is undoubtedly high, including the audio samples which do not stand out for their originality but manage to mix extremely different sounds without too many problems even in the case of the soundtrack.", "date": "2016-04-08", "grade": "8.5"}
