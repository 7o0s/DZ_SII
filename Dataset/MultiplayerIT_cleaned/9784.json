{"name": "Castlevania: Harmony of Despair", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80944-castlevania-harmony-of-despair-le-tenebre-di-konami.html", "text": "Waiting for the now upcoming Lords of Shadows, Konami has released on XBLA the latest title of the legendary Castlevania series, born almost twenty-five years ago in the middle of the 8-bit era. Harmony of Despair presents itself as a 2D action-adventure platform that offers us the possibility of being played in cooperative multiplayer for up to 6 players, and which in several aspects is similar to Symphony of the Night, probably the most successful and loved among all Castlevanias. The hard life of the vampire hunter If all action and little theory is what you are looking for in a game, Harmony of Despair is perfect for you: the plot is non-existent and very little explanation is given regarding the five usable characters and their abilities, and the only thing clear is the purpose final of the player, that is to kill the final bosses in each of the 6 huge levels, full of enemies and traps of all kinds and with only 30 minutes available for each one, partially resuming the Boss Rush Mode present in others of the series. To add longevity is the considerable difficulty in single player, given that the bosses at the end of the chapter are tremendously difficult and in case of death you have to start the entire level over, even if fortunately you keep objects and gold collected before game over. To have any hope against the bosses you need to upgrade your character, and here too there are pains: forget experience points and levels typical of Symphony of the Night, because in Castlevania: Harmony of Despair the only way to improve your character is to collect and use the equipment left by defeated enemies or buy it using gold coins that we will find scattered throughout the levels, which forces the player into long sessions of grinding in the hope of obtaining useful objects for his character. It is therefore necessary to replay each of the six chapters several times, lengthening the experience in terms of time, but at the same time making it boring and frustrating in the long run, considering that even the most experienced player will die several times during the adventure. Co-op and visuals In multiplayer, however, Castlevania: Harmony of Despair changes its face and becomes decidedly pleasant in co-op, where up to six vampire hunters can work together to reach and defeat the end-of-level boss, which however will in turn become stronger depending on the number of players present. In this mode, the game is slightly less difficult and more fun than the single player, which, together with the presence of different areas that can only be reached with the help of other players, makes us understand that Konami has focused heavily on this component. Each player has complete freedom of movement and can reach the final boss following the path that best suits him, and it is possible to observe the movements of our allies by setting the zoom to the minimum, which allows us not only to follow their progress, but also to be able to admire the entire level. In addition to this ~total~ view, useful for planning a strategy, but impossible to use in combat, there are two others, decidedly more suitable for tackling skirmishes with the monsters you encounter. There is also a ~deathmatch~ style multiplayer mode where players can fight each other in an arena: the winner, as always, will be the last one standing. Xbox 360 goals Castlevania: Harmony of Despair features 12 objectives that will give us a total of 200 points. Three of these are only obtainable in co-op mode, while the others can also be completed solo, even if you try to finish Harmony of Despair in single player in Hard Mode (unlockable once you kill the last boss of the sixth chapter, which in turn will give us another achievement) is a real tough feat, so it's recommended to try it first in co-op with well-equipped allies. I recycle! Castlevania: Harmony of Despair is practically a patchwork made up of pieces taken from the most recent Castlevania, both graphically, with sprites and backdrops taken from the Castlevania released for Nintendo DS, and in terms of gameplay, with the five characters, the six end-of-level bosses and their respective skills taken from previous titles in the series. This certainly favors longtime Castlevania fans, who will find some of the protagonists of the series and as a result will know their specific skills well; on the other hand, those who approach the series for the first time with Castlevania: Harmony of Despair will find themselves decidedly displaced at the beginning by the almost total lack of information on the characters and how to use them, as well as by the useless cumbersomeness of the menus. Graphically it is pleasant in HD, and the same goes for the sound which stands on a good level especially gthanks to the excellent music that will accompany us during the adventure.", "date": "2010-09-24", "grade": "6.3"}
