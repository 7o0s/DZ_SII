{"name": "Parkour mon amour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149948-lemma-parkour-mon-amour.html", "text": "Although parkour is now a common element in many titles, those who try to implement it rigorously within the mechanics of the game are truly a rarity. In most cases, developers limit themselves to solutions such as ~hold the X key to grapple / climb / jump~, there are few who decide to follow the path indicated by Mirror's Edge. From today we can add Lemma to this list, an independent, simple title with a very particular atmosphere, which could be what you need while waiting for Faith's return. Finally a game where parkour is done right: check out Lemma! A mysterious story Lemma puts us in the role of Joan, a scientist who finds herself trapped in a world of floating blocks that resemble the dream of someone who has played too much Minecraft. It is not very clear why we ended up there or how, the only sure thing is that we find sheets with strange notes on the ground and that we are looking for someone, a colleague of ours, Mark, with whom we can only communicate via cell phone at each checkpoint of the map. Each time we will be able to choose between two predefined SMS, so the level of knowledge of the story can vary greatly from one player to another. Part of Lemma's charm lies in this unusual way of telling the story. No film sequences, explanations or introductions, just us, hundreds of blocks to overcome and a few scraps of information every now and then. The rest will have to be filled in with our imagination. Nor is it said that the ending leads us to a clear resolution of the story. Did we go through an extremely complex adventure, where an alternate virtual reality started its process of destruction with the arrival of Mark, or was it just Joan's dream? Maybe it's time to play again to find out more details! Freedom (of movement) I am looking for Beyond the story, it is clear that the true heart of Lemma lies in the movement mechanics and exploration possibilities of each level. Initially we will only be able to run, jump, roll on landing to help ourselves less hurt and cling to the edges, but level after level we will enrich our moveset with wall runs, wall breaking, double jumps and more that will allow us to explore in far and wide every environment in search of collectible energy sheets and globes. Some moves will even allow us to create part of the world as we go forward, such as a particular wall run where the wall itself composes under our feet with each step. Being a parkour game, it was reasonable to expect a particular care in the movements and in this respect Lemma does not betray. Both from a physical and sensory point of view, we feel the weight and inertia of our body, a sensation accentuated by the possibility of clearly seeing hands and feet if we move the view, we are not something floating in the void, but a real body moving in space. A bit like in the aforementioned Minecraft, over time we will be able to find objects that will allow us to modify the blocks and build a personal parkour gym where we can practice in total freedom. However, as liberating and fun as it may be to explore following one's inclinations, Lemma's narrative structure will also lead us to progress from level to level following the thread of the story. The first half of the game has a fairly linear development: you start at point A and you have to finish at point B and, however much we may deviate from the pre-established path, we will always find ourselves having to follow a certain path. At a certain point, however, the story takes a turn that drastically changes the cards on the table and we find ourselves going back and forth between various areas of the map in search of a way out, solving puzzles and looking for objects that will allow us to continue . Puzzles and athletics Despite a certain lack of indications, this is where Lemma really gives his best. The puzzles will require skill and quick reflexes to solve, because they will often ask us to touch certain switches with our body located in areas that initially seem inaccessible and we will have to rely on a certain amount of lateral thinking to reach them. Having to do a little backtracking we will happen to revisit areas we have already seen, which will still bear the signs of our modifications and which we will be able to further change, creating and destroying other blocks in total freedom, discovering new details of the story from time to time as we jump, we run and roll without ever losing rhythm. And there are obviously some threats, represented by blocsome explosives that will chase us as soon as they sense our presence, burning walls that will be activated as we pass and will force us to never stand still and, of course, the pure and simple error of judgment that will lead us to attempt one leap into the void too many . Don't worry though, from this point of view Lemma is absolutely not punitive: in the event of death we will find ourselves without a scratch on the nearest platform, ready to try again. It's better with Oculus From a graphic point of view, Lemma is perhaps a little dated, but it is definitely very clean and essential, just like a parallel virtual universe should be. Each area has its own specific theme that will make it look like a desert, a city or the inside of a giant computer. The ethereal style is made even more evident by the soundtrack, composed of tracks with a new age tone, perfect for a meditation room, which discreetly accompany the game session. In total, Lemma will take about four or five hours to complete, and once finished we will be able to count on a Time Trial mode to show everyone our athletic skills by completing the level in the shortest time possible. Another fascinating aspect of Lemma is that it is already compatible with Oculus Rift, but sadly we can only imagine how exciting it can be to explore its blocky worlds with a real first person view, when 2016 arrives!?", "date": "2015-05-17", "grade": "8.0"}
