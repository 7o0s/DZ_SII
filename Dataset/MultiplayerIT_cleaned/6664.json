So here, after the fantastic exploit of Kim Kardashian's Hobbit game, we welcome with open arms the great initiative of Lindsay Lohan, another modern heroine (it is appropriate to say it, given her addiction to drugs!) that we all always remember with affection for being, together with Anna Tatangelo, the woman in the entertainment world who wears her age worse! Many fans, little fun Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame is first of all a very coherent title, being fundamentally empty just like the character it is inspired by: in fact, the game is so thin and purposeless that it is almost difficult to define it properly. Put in slightly less old-fashioned language, it's a product that focuses so much on making fun of the subject it's about that it ends up forgetting that it's something that (at least in theory) should be fun. But it is a great provocation! It's a criticism of the star system! It's a successful sarcastic operation! All ufo big words that we OK guys from Multiplayer.it had to go look up in the dictionary (among other things, did you know that ~dictionary~ is written with a zeta? We don't! LOL!) but that we honestly don't feel like sharing. First of all because they really seem like geek phrases to us, and secondly because anything goes, but if a game completely lacks sense like Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame we really don't know what to do with it: we prefer to go around making a some shopping or have a bee with our best friends forever! In any case, the ~purpose~ of the title is to accumulate fans, a goal to be achieved simply by continuously swiping your finger from the bottom to the other: once you reach a sufficient number of poor followers, you can spend them to buy useful upgrades to swell your following more quickly. The upgrades are divided into those that multiply the number of fans obtained with each swipe, those that give a total number of admirers per second and finally those that allow you to increase your audience even when the application is closed. Thus a vicious circle is created which, in the intentions of the developers, perhaps wanted to represent a metaphor for the futility of showbusiness, but which to us OK guys from Multiplayer.it simply seems boring! Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame is as sarcastic as it is utterly empty The absolute lack of game content of Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame is somehow compensated by an omnipresent and in some ways very successful ironic vein: translated from the sfigatese into Italian, this means that the title can at least be good for making a couple of laughs looking at the absurd list of upgrades that can be purchased. Raw food diet, adopted baby, nude selfie, Twitter fight, release of a sex tape, fake engagement or release of a rap album are just some of the items on a list that makes fun of the world of star system that we love so much and that one day we would like to be part of. Too bad that the application is poorly translated into Italian, making these humorous ideas understandable only to those who have a knowledge of English that goes beyond the titles of One Direction songs! Luckily Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame also has a component a little closer to the soul of us fashion kids, or rather a section in which it is possible to create one's own avatar (in the sense of a character, not in the sense of a blue thing of a sci-fi movie for nerds!) by buying all sorts of clothes, hairstyles, accessories and so on with the gold coins that are earned by accumulating fans. Here too there is an evidently ironic imprint, with exaggerated elements typical of the sparkly world of Hollywood, and scrolling through the many available variations can be amusing for a few minutes: but then you realize that modifying the character is absolutely useless , and we feel cheated again by these nerd developers who think that we young people with smartphones are empty and materialistic people with nothing better to do in our spare time. Meanwhile, we OK guys from Multiplayer.it to write this article had to give up at least two bees and a few tubs in the center to look at the shop windows, sorry if it's not enough!", "date": "2014-12-22", "grade": "5.0"}
