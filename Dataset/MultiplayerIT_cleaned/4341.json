One lives, one looks, one suffers, one chooses and one dies, without great clamor or great deeds. For some this is not enough, as evident from the comments on the free edition available as a demo for some time, but for others it is almost transcendental, so much so that we approach the full version of the CyberCoconut title with particular interest, a small and talented team all Italian, which is recently available on Steam. The old man and the child Once you've downloaded 500MB and launched The Way of Life: DEFINITIVE EDITION, a short tutorial illustrates the simple mechanics of what is a hybrid between an adventure and a walking simulator, a journey through life fragmented into thirty different dynamic experiences that guarantee several hours of gameplay. These, accessible through ten doors, vary in duration and complexity and can be experienced in the role of a child, an adult or an elderly person, changing according to the ages of life that inevitably intersect but are profoundly different in perception, commitments and physical possibilities . Sometimes we are allowed to jump, other times we just have to interact with some elements, in other cases we have to face futuristic or other driving mini-games and in still others we simply have to make a choice that puts us in front of a reflection on our existence and the ghosts that accompany us every day. Ghosts who guide us by the hand through a myriad of situations related to terrorist alarms, hooligans, frustration, assaults, family quarrels, difficulties of the elderly with technology, war, jealousy, depression and so on, for an experience that, although presented in a stylized is doubly linked to our reality. On the contrary, the generic scenarios set in floating islands and the faceless characters help us to put ourselves in the shoes of the protagonist of the event, taking advantage of colours, suggestions and music to involve us with a discreet intensity in an undoubtedly peculiar and courageous experience. And it's an experience that uses The Sims-like animations to replace dialogue and vivid colors to set the mood, underline emotions and point us to elements of interest in a scene, making up for the inevitable technological shortcomings of a title developed by a small independent Italian team. However, there are limits, especially in the gameplay which, although designed to support the emotional experience, often ends up being an obstacle. We can certainly pass over some forcing, especially in scenes such as that of the bully who throws paper balls at us with effects comparable to those of a cannon shot, and we also pass over those mini-games whose repetitiveness and slowness are functional to the emotions that a scene it wants to convey us, but in some cases the gameplay should be important while it is almost always heavy, incomplete and often superfluous, so much so as to irritate instead of involving. Desperate pedagogical stomp The Way of Life is a title that wants us to think and is designed to make its message loud and clear. And it succeeds, despite the evident ingenuity related to the gameplay, even if it confronts us with the difficult task of evaluating the quality of the message. And although the invitation of the title to face life with greater civilization and openness finds us in agreement, from the point of view of the depth of the reflections we would have liked a few more nuances. Nuance that in the CyberCoconut title we rarely find despite the team's decision to address sensitive topics such as prejudice, childhood sadism, racism and depression. All these elements are part of a complicated human maelstrom, made up of tones of fear and the need to define who we are, an intricate inner universe that influences life on the planet of which, willy-nilly, we are the ruling race. And these complex factors lose strength when they are simplified and underlined by pedagogical reflections which, like extremely vivid colors for children and often monochromatic for adults, are trivial and are often permeated by a do-gooder who risks having very little human. But by its very nature The Way of Life remains a title that can undoubtedly arouse some reflection, even involuntarily where some linear situations lead us to think about how many simplifications we adopt to try to organize this crazy world in our heads. And simplicity gives a certain strength to some experiences which, thanks to the soundtrack and the profoundly human nature of the experienceza, actually manage to send us back to the daily existence, despite the simplifications and despite the prevailing do-gooders, the forcing and the stylized approach. Several times while playing The Way of Life we asked ourselves how we would react in the face of the same situations or did we find ourselves faced with our own experience, tossed between the regrets of those who are no longer a child and the fears of those who one day, hopefully, will have to bear the weight of the years. And all this is a good baggage for a video game which, although imperfect, manages to convey something to us also thanks to an excellent aesthetic sector, capable of combining vivid colors, stylized shapes and real situations with great effectiveness. Among other things, all seasoned with a soundtrack that is both simple and functional and engaging, so much so as to make the gaps in the gameplay and the too many simplifications even more indigestible. But we are still facing a title that does something new and that could be interesting for more than one player.", "date": "2018-03-17", "grade": "6.0"}
