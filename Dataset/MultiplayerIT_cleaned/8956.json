{"name": "Nell'attesa di Revelations", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95472-assassins-creed-rearmed-nellattesa-di-revelations.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhoneAssassin's Creed Bloodlines has shown that it is possible to export the dynamics of the Ubisoft series even on much less powerful platforms than the current home consoles and PC. The game that ran on PSP, in fact, was not a variation on the theme structured as a two-dimensional platform, nor something completely different; it was just Assassin's Creed, with its third-person view, Altair in the lead role and a far and wide explorable scenario. The game was certainly less detailed than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, with fewer people on the street and angular polygonal models, but the feeling was basically what we know well. So what prevents the creation of a third-person action game with those features for iPhone and iPad? Unfortunately it is a question that will remain unanswered, at least in the short term. Indeed, Assassin's Creed Rearmed was published on the App Store, an ideal sequel to that Assassin's Creed II: Multiplayer released in March last year and which really didn't surprise anyone for the concept or for how it was put into practice. The series is in fact set up as a top-down action game, playable exclusively online with up to three other people in competitive mode. Our templar (because we assume that the assumptions are the same as the multiplayer of the ~mother~ series) is therefore projected into a scenario and there he must hunt down a different target from time to time, trying to locate it among the bystanders and to eliminate it before being killed in turn by an opponent. The release of the previous edition was accompanied by huge problems related to matchmaking, but luckily everything went smoothly this time and indeed Ubisoft has seen fit to embrace the freemium format, thus making the download of the game free forever but by inserting a purchase system in-game for those who like to win easy. Pocci, pocci, popopo Winning easy, we said: in Assassin's Creed Rearmed you can do it by putting your wallet and buying objects: chests containing diamonds to be spent in various ways, larger bags (which therefore allow you to carry a greater number of upgrades), weapons more powerful and various customizations for your alter ego. The choice is very vast, the figures vary from the starting 79 cents up to a hundred times as much, and the advantages are immediately evident: an enhanced player has an easy time eliminating his prey, while those who enter the game counting only on its ability, in the hope of earning enough experience points to proceed with the upgrade without buying anything, plays the classic role of ~cannon fodder~. However, the transition to the freemium format had the undoubted merit of immediately pushing the diffusion of the Ubisoft product, thanks to a very fast matchmaking and able to find matches in seconds, at any time of the day. Ten skins available, most of which can be unlocked by gaining experience, and the same goes for modes and scenarios. From the gameplay point of view, however, unfortunately things have not improved and indeed, if possible, we found the touch controls less precise and responsive than we remembered (on the iPhone 4S, however). The rules are also unchanged: during each game we are assigned prey that we have the task of identifying among the ~civilians~ by observing their movements: if they run or climb on some roof, in all probability they are templars like us. Depending on the weapon at our disposal, we enjoy a more or less large circle of influence, and if the target is inside it, by touching the figure on the screen we can kill him. Simple, isn't it? Too bad that everything turns out to be extremely cumbersome, especially at the beginning and therefore with the character without any enhancements: a significant obstacle to fueling the desire to continue. As far as the technical sector is concerned, we found the in-game graphics really of poor quality for animations and design, while there is nothing to say about the sound: the music is very few, but they are those of Assassin's Creed II and alone they are worth the ticket price.
