{"name": "Il tocco mortale di Snake", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-solid-touch.html", "text": "Solid Snake also conquers the iPhone universe after being on all (or almost) consoles in videogame history. The developers of Kojima Production make it possible to relive the deeds of Old Snake through 12 levels totally focused on the game mechanics of the classic third person shooters of about 20 years ago. In fact, the player is called to command an Old Snake that is motionless and hidden from the most classic of shelters, from the most classic hedges to the most solid walls. By moving from one location to another the object of the game is to take down a specific number of enemies by hiding at times when you come under fire. The movements are reduced to the mere aiming of the fire scope so by holding down a point on the screen you can aim at the enemy. With a quick tap on the screen, Snake will fire the gun; in some cases the enemy soldiers position themselves too far away to be reached by a classic shot, so it will be enough to use two fingers, as we do for the zoom of the photographs in the gallery, and enable the sniper rifle to then let the lethal bullet go off. Remaining hidden instead not only Snake can avoid bullets but gradually restore his energy. Special items are available to help Snake, such as a curious little duck that restores some energy or a frog that makes Snake invisible. The plot of Metal Gear Solid Touch perfectly follows that of its older brother for Playstation 3 so we don't dwell on the various developments, obviously the iPhone version leaves out all the technical characteristics that made Metal Gear Solid 4 so great. two really interesting gems: Special and Drebin's Shop. In Special there is, in text format, the entire plot of the Metal Gear saga starting from the episodes on MSX2 and Nes up to the present day. Drebin's shop, on the other hand, allows you to purchase special backgrounds from the game using the points accumulated within the Touch adventure. If Metal Gear Solid Touch is too repetitive and a sort of target practice with Old Snake as the protagonist, applause must be given to the technical sector used to make the game. Graphically the polygonal models used both for the creation of the environments and for the construction of the characters. The game backdrops are taken directly from the original game, perfectly recreating the air breathed in the console version and the same goes for the care reserved for the recreation of enemy soldiers, including metal gear. Even the audio sector is of excellent quality both in the soundtracks used and in the moments dedicated to the crash of weapons, diversified by type.", "date": "2009-03-31", "grade": "7.0"}
