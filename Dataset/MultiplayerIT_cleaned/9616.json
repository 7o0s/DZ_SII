Now, however, we are faced with a port of the discreet sequel, already released in September for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and considering the lack of shooters on the Wii this is certainly a good and right thing. Unfortunately, however, it cannot be said that the center was hit. For the uninitiated, H.A.W.X. is a sort of arcade shooter that mixes elements of realistic and political fiction, with a nod to flight simulators. Rather than castrating the more sophisticated aspects of the original game, Ubisoft has well thought of adapting it practically in its entirety, an idea that in another case we would have also felt like praising... Where are my glasses? The detachment from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions already takes place on a narrative level, since H.A.W.X. 2 doesn't feature the same story and, to be honest, not even the same characters. While the protagonist of the series so far has been David Crenshaw, in this Wii version we will step into the role of Cole Bowman, known as Arrow: the plot has some political fictional elements and is narrated through cutscenes and artwork, but in reality it is far from the typical serious tone and realistic of Tom Clancy's games. Political intrigues and international crises are almost only the background to a somewhat more private and personal story, which however fails to interest the player enough due to an unfortunate combination of reasons: the characters, for example, extremely unpleasant and mundane, shown in the form of illustrations halfway between a comic and a B-cartoon; and the dialogues, extremely poor in content and recited with little enthusiasm and participation by the English-speaking voice actors, which make the narrative sequences more boring than interesting. The cartoonish style is not limited only to the narration and character design, but to the rest of the game: basically H.A.W.X. 2 offers settings inspired by really existing places but reproduced with a pastel coloring which, if at first glance it also appears fairly original, once you get into the action it turns out to be more annoying than anything else. The more elaborate areas also demonstrate a very low polygon count, as if it weren't important to make them the best to focus instead on the aircraft. These, in fact, are really convincing: very similar to their real-life counterparts and embellished with good quality details and textures. Automatic or not? Luckily, in battle, H.A.W.X. 2 performs well, without hesitation or slowdowns: the clashes, which are the fulcrum of the game, turn out to be quite spectacular and pyrotechnic, including explosions, streams of bullets and homing missiles. The decent variety of missions offered in H.A.W.X. 2 boils down to a decisive choice: play on autopilot or not? In case the player wants to have full control over the aircraft, the feeling of freedom offered by the control system almost immediately crashes against a level design that seems to have been conceived for autopilot. Essentially the player controls the aircraft with the Nunchuk, aiming at the targets on the screen with the Wii Remote, a fairly common practice for the Nintendo Wii toy library which also in this case presents no problems whatsoever, except for the difficulty of moving easily targeting enemy aircraft, missiles and other targets. Especially in the advanced levels, the game manages to become frustrating in these cases due to such an unintuitive and practical control system; the autopilot thus becomes preferable and in this case H.A.W.X. 2 works much better, essentially becoming a much more enjoyable shooter on rails even if certainly more naive and easy going. In reality, there are no particular reasons to continue playing after completing the main campaign: the extra modes, such as Arena or Survival, seem decidedly hasty and superficial, as well as the multiplayer mode, which actually allows you to play only with another friend locally, at the controls of an extra weapon, and it doesn't add anything to the gameplay at all.", "date": "2010-11-25", "grade": "5.0"}
