Since we are traditionalists, we say it anyway: for the uninitiated, Naruto Uzumaki is a teenage ninja from the Leaf Village, one of the many who populate the mystical world of Kishimoto. However Naruto is also the body that imprisons the demon of the nine-tailed fox but above all he is a tenacious and idealistic boy surrounded by numerous allies and opponents. As the comic moves towards its natural conclusion, Takara Tomy intends to squeeze as much as possible from this goose that lays the golden eggs: sometimes the results are good, sometimes only moderate, in other cases they are a real disaster. Naruto's first foray into the Nintendo 3DS software library belongs decidedly in the latter category. SuperNaruto Bros?! Naruto is an action-adventure manga that has the merit of proposing decidedly in-depth situations and characters, unlike many series where two-dimensional characters, in every sense, beat each other up for no good reason. The same care for the narrative aspect is also found in this Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era, set during the second part of the manga, when Naruto has already grown up and his friend and rival Sasuke has abandoned the protagonist and his companions. The story of the game was written specifically and although it does not offer who knows what complexity or twist, it still manages to be satisfying and to provide a valid pretext that connects the various game levels. However, the series revolves around many fights between ninjas who use increasingly exaggerated and spectacular techniques, but instead of proposing the most appropriate and winning formula of a fighting game, Takara Tomy has well thought of following in the tragic footsteps of the Ninja Council series for Nintendo DS , proposing a questionable hybrid between a traditional platformer and a scrolling fighting game. The result is a truly identityless product in which the player is forced to cross the horizontally scrolling stages by jumping from one platform to another and eliminating the enemies that appear in front of him, equipped with an artificial intelligence bordering on the suicidal instinct. with a single combo that can be performed by repeatedly pressing the same key. In short, variety is not something that Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era can boast of, despite our protagonist being able to hurl kunai against even the most distant enemies or activate the infamous ~hermit mode~ which amplifies its power: the gameplay is therefore reduced to a repetitive pressing of a couple of keys, alternating with a feature designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS which we will tell you about shortly. The 3D effect Not received: this is how we could synthetically define the 3D effect of Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era. The illusion of depth is barely perceptible and, despite the platform soul of the game, it is absolutely negligible and irrelevant to the gameplay. In general, the effect is decidedly weak and makes the high-sounding title of the cartridge rather ironic. The Ninja Who Tried Perhaps with a nod to the games in the LEGO series, Takara Tomy has inserted a rather particular mechanic designed above all for players who love to collect every object and complete the games one hundred percent. Naruto can in fact make use of the help of some adventure companions: after acquiring them, it will be possible to ~summon~ them to take advantage of their special abilities and access previously closed portions of the level that contain extras and bonuses of various kinds. Of the two most interesting novelties, this is certainly the best: now comes the worst. Each level of Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era features bosses that fans of the comic and cartoon will surely recognize, inserted for some drama with interactive cutscenes featuring their special techniques. Similar cutscenes are also triggered during the levels and are basically a sort of ~quick time event~ that the player must successfully face if he wants to continue the game. In practice these QTEs exploit the gyroscopic technology of the Nintendo 3DS and require precise movements by the player to be overcome, the problem is that their implementation is nothing short of disastrous: the game hardly recognizes the movements of the player holding the console and sometimesit misinterprets otherwise correct inputs, remaining unmoved and forcing the cutscene to be repeated until an almost entirely random positive result. It can happen that you are literally stuck in one point of the game without being able to overcome it despite performing the correct movements, needless to say that this feature which should be the backbone of the game is a source of frustration and annoyance. Fortunately, the actual cutscenes are decidedly pleasant and closely follow the animated series, unfortunately they are the only prominent element of a mediocre and superficial technical realization. The polygonal models of Naruto and his companions are well made, even if a little woody in the movements, but the various stages and enemies are really anonymous and poor in details and this makes the frequent drops in the frame rate even more inexplicable; the absence of any form of speech is also even more evident in the face of numerous lines of textual dialogue and a dull and repetitive soundtrack.", "date": "2011-06-29", "grade": "4.5"}
