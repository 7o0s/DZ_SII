The watchword is ~simplicity~: the concept is in fact extraordinarily basic but it is the context and the charm of the LEGO bricks that make such a simple idea even damned fun. LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is, needless to say, the third foray of the LEGO world into the universe created by George Lucas. It goes without saying that enormous strides have been made compared to the prequels (which followed the two film trilogies) and the new Traveller's Tales proposal has treasured the experience obtained with the most recent LEGO Batman, LEGO Indiana Jones and LEGO Harry Potter. Indeed, LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is an interesting evolution and as the next LEGO-game based on Bruckheimer's Pirates of the Caribbean approaches, what can we expect from the future of this successful franchise? The Clone War has begun The CG television series which is placed between Episodes II and III of Star Wars is considered by fans of the saga a bit as George Lucas' official apology for the creation of Jar Jar Binks, but also as the closest product in spirit and atmosphere to the classic trilogy that has bewitched the whole world since the 1970s. For the uninitiated, the show tells the vicissitudes of famous characters such as Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi during the infamous Clone Wars, often focusing on the latter, who go from brief anonymous extras to highly respectable charismatic characters. In this videogame version we can relive some of the most famous episodes of the first and second seasons, such as ~Il Covo di Grievous~ and ~Attack on Malevolence~, divided by category, or rather final ~bad guy~, and characterized by the typical, genuine humor that distinguishes the Traveller's Tales franchise. The progression is not necessarily linear and the player can take advantage of a spectacular hub, sometimes even a little dispersive, to go from one mission to another and access the various game modes and options, spending the tokens obtained in the levels to buy new ones characters or vehicles and replay the missions already played with different characters. As usual, in fact, each type of character has particular abilities that allow you to access unpublished areas or solve specific puzzles: the Jedi can use the Force, the droids can activate certain devices, other characters have special grappling hooks and so on. In this sense, LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is a natural evolution of the environmental puzzles already proposed in LEGO Harry Potter, but the result is not always convincing: often we find ourselves faced with truly inspired and ingenious puzzles but sometimes the puzzles they manage to be more abstruse and convulsive than they should be, especially considering the game's target audience, which includes even the youngest players. To do or not to do, there is no try The gameplay has remained fundamentally the same, universally suitable for all types of players and perhaps equally convincing in its intuitive simplicity. Practically a single button is enough to make your way through hordes of droids and aliens, pirouetting with the Jedi's lightsabers or the Clone Trooper's blasters: the aim is always the same, to collect as many tokens as possible, and it's funny to think how a such a simple idea in a game in which it is basically not even possible to go into ~game over~. However, gameplay of this kind gets stale after a few hours, Star Wars fan or non-fan, as previous titles have shown where repetitiveness was the overriding flaw of any package, especially after completing the main campaign, when the aim of the game becomes replay each level to unlock tons of extras. In this case, Traveller's Tales has decided to remedy the problem by alternating some decidedly particular missions to the normal levels: the shooter-style levels, aboard spacecraft, are probably the least surprising ones compared to the new mode that mimics real-time strategy for stage the conquest of a planet. The player basically finds himself having to conquer and maintain a position by cleaning it from enemy forces, and then stop to create the resources necessary to strengthen the army of the Republic and lead it to victory, conquering the following positions. This modality is really essential and does not require who knows what strategy to be tackled, sometimes resulting even excessively verbose due to the small quantity and complexity of the proposed contents; nevertheless, it turns out to be a nice oneinterlude which guarantees a certain variety of situations and perfectly captures the atmosphere of the most spectacular battles in the series. Always in motion the future is With his latest games Traveller's Tales has begun a path of technical evolution that culminates in this LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, without a doubt the artistically best game of the series. Having abandoned the LEGO-style settings, the developers have chosen this time to adopt a realistic visual rendering for the various locations, within which the LEGO models of characters, vehicles and enemies are placed. The result is bizarre but really effective. Firstly, the various settings are much more accurate and full of details, extremely faithful to those seen in the related episodes of the television series; moreover, the LEGO characters themselves enjoy much more defined textures and even more fluid and accurate animations: they complete the work of the games with truly remarkable shaders and light effects, especially as regards those produced by the lightsabers. However, what Traveller's Tales still fails to perfect is the management of the camera, once again quite imprecise, and of the collisions that make some passages truly perfidious, especially if a difficult jump is combined with an unhappy shot. The franchise's titular soundtrack doesn't even make sense to bother with it: LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars directly borrows the historical tracks of John Williams and the excellent songs of the television series related to the specific episodes proposed in the game.", "date": "2011-04-08", "grade": "8.0"}
