{"name": "Huntdown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/huntdown-recensione.html", "text": "The 80s have maintained an incredible charm and it is no coincidence that in recent times the love for that historical period has returned with overwhelming violence, so much so as to push dozens of development studios to offer us new chapters of beloved series, remasters, remakes or unpublished games with a strong inspiration. However, it is equally easy to find in this section of productions botched titles unable to give the same feeling as at the time, with a quantity of successful names in the enterprise of completely satisfying the palate of nostalgics to be counted on the fingers of one hand. Street of Rage 4 kicked open the return of 2D scrolling fighting games and now Huntdown, whose review you read, has thrown himself into the fray with a choreographed roll by shooting his cartridges and hitting the target with each of them. The nostalgic wonder Huntdown picks up liberally from the cyberpunk imagery of the 80s thanks to a rainy setting made up of megacorporations, an exploited population and gangs on the streets ready to bring violence and terror by wearing the worst clothing on Earth. In this atmosphere of wonderful nostalgia, with tears streaming down our faces hidden by the pixelated rain, we threw ourselves headlong into the adventure, in love with the protagonists that Easy Trigger has put in our hands. Anna Conda, John Sawyer and Mow Man are three bounty hunters hired by the police to put an end to the domination of four rival gangs scattered across four districts of the futuristic city in which we find ourselves. Our three favorites seem to have teleported directly from the films of the time, they could be Jena Plissken's associates or come out of some Blade Runner alley, and they seem perfect to collide with the enemies of that masterpiece of The Running Man, never acclaimed enough. We will thus enter two-dimensional levels with a horizontal construction, lacking any verticality. Perfect linear mazes to better focus on what Huntdown offers precious: a gameplay reduced to the bone but so effective as to be forgiven for any other shortcoming. We can run, jump and shoot like in the most classic of 2D scrolling shooters, with the addition of a side shot which is essential to avoid the hail of bullets that our opponents will throw at us. They will try to stop us in every way: skating quickly towards us with hockey sticks or shiny crowbars, attacking us on a motorcycle or aboard gigantic mechs or even riding jet bikes by throwing Molotov cocktails at us from the sky. To return fire, we will have a pistol with infinite shots and a throwing weapon, different equipment depending on the character chosen, the only variables of a system that keeps the timing of movement animations, invulnerability frames or hit points unchanged. With Anna Conda we will extract a fast machine gun and a throwing ax from its scabbard, John will instead have a revolver and a boomerang and our favorite robot some very precise kunai and a semi-automatic pistol with a rate of fire managed solely by our pressure speed: the 'perfect weapon to release pent-up anger. The essentiality of the gameplay puts aside the possibility of shooting vertically or at variable angles as happens in Metal Slug, limiting the game system but also allowing the developers to embroider around the player clashes that are always well balanced and never frustrating. The difficulty curve and the ability to choose between four difficulty levels allow you to customize the gameplay experience and the bosses are as beautiful to look at as they are to face. There is also that pinch of trial and error classic of these games but every single attack pattern is easily readable in advance and the game never seems unfair, giving a truly sublime overall experience. A mountain of enemies and weapons With four gangs to defeat and about twenty bosses to defeat before seeing game over you will be busy for about four or five hours depending on your shooting skills, but you can also replay the various levels looking for the collectible suitcases hidden behind destructible elements of the scenario or in the hands of special agents specialized in escape. The enemies are so many that they never give you that sense of repetitiveness common in games of this genre and, as soon as this is about to occur, the stage change arrives and you start over. Also excellent are the numerous guns with limited shots to collect from enemy corpses, from the simplest Uzi up to the assault gatling guns, all with the exact feedback that willyou'd expect both sonically and graphically. Excellent visual effects and animations and applause also for the soundtrack, capable as it is of collecting reminiscences from 8 bit and more modern pieces. This package closes with the possibility of playing in two with a practical local drop-in drop-out system, even if, unfortunately, there is no online mode: a small mole on a very high-level production.", "date": "2020-05-15", "grade": "9.0"}
