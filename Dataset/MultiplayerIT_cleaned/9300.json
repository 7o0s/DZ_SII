{"name": "Humanity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/humanity-recensione.html", "text": "Welcome to the review of Humanity, a new video game published by Enhance and developed by Tha Ltd.. The first is the creative laboratory founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, a name that maybe won't say anything to the younger ones, but which is actually a more eclectic game Japan designer. Tetsuya Mizuguchi was born professionally in Sega, where he is a producer of seminal games such as Sega Rally Championship and Manx TT Superbike, while in the Dreamcast era he is head of the UGA (United Game Artist) division which will develop the deadly Space Channel 5 and Rez. After leaving Sega, Mizuguchi creates Q Entertainment through which he will publish Lumines on PSVita and that masterpiece for Nintendo DS called Meteos, which will however be unjustly snubbed by the general public. In the case of Humanity, however, Tetsuya Mizuguchi does not hold the role of director, but rather a sort of talent scout who has made all his knowledge in the videogame field available to the true creative behind the project. Creative spark Humanity: the further we go, the more humans will increase in number The spark that led to the birth of Humanity does not come from Tetsuya Mizuguchi, but from the visual artist and designer Yugo Nakamura who several years ago created a technical demo to test how many characters he would be able to insert and manage fluidly in a digital environment at the same time. And it is during a public demonstration of this prototype that Mizuguchi and Nakamura meet. The first sees in the idea of the second, and in his creative approach, that opportunity that today, five years later, has been transformed into the irresistible Humanity, a fascinating video game born from the collaboration of Tha ltd (Nakamura's team) and Enhance. This is a game that mainly resembles two: Lemmings and Chu-Chu Rocket. Each level begins with a cascade of humans that land on the playing field from the sky and continue to move regardless of the risks along the way. The goal of each level is to get the humans to the exit by setting commands along their way, but of course things will soon get much more complicated than that. All levels also hide the Goldy: taller than normal big men covered in gold who, if taken to the exit, will unlock the golden rewards. The difficulty lies in the fact that, unlike humans who are largely infinite and losing thousands of them is not a problem, once the Goldys are dead they will remain so until we restart the level. Saving Goldy is important because the golden rewards include both minor cosmetic elements and decidedly useful functions such as fast forwarding of time, the free camera, the retry but keeping the commands inserted in the attempt that we are about to discard. There are over 150 of these rewards, so if you want to unlock everything you will have to work hard. However, if you don't like racking your brains too much, or a level turns out to be so difficult as to not be fun, each challenge proposed by Humanity will come with a video in which the solution is revealed. Be careful though, watching these tutorials will be recorded in your game statistics. A shiba for a friend Humanity: The Goldys are not essential but they are still very important and it is required to save enough of them to progress through the different chapters In Humanity the player is not an ethereal figure as in other similar games, but has his own very specific avatar: that of a dog, a Shiba, a ghost. It will therefore not be enough to move the cursor on the chosen area to place a command on it; instead we will have to move through the level until we physically reach the place where we want to place the different tools at our disposal. Luckily this Shiba is capable of great leaps and can take hold of crowds of humans and move through their multitude just like an incorporeal spirit. The figure of the Shiba is a plus that initially appears redundant: why do I have to move around the level when I could easily do everything through a more classic user interface? The explanation is in the gameplay, humans in turn become bridges that we will have to use to interact with other parts of the level, and in the sneaky synesthetic effect that Tetsuya Mizuguchi looks for in every game in which he works. By putting ourselves in the shoes of the magical Shiba, it places us directly inside the gameplay from which we will be able to enjoy every vibration: sound, tactile, logical and perceptive. When we ~fly~ through the humans, we will feel each head emerge on the pad, and other effects will enrich what will soon become a rich carpet of sensory stimulations. However, sometimes this dog confuses ideas, makes the solution of the puzzle more problematic than it should be; but aldBeyond some annoyances, the presence of the Shiba is undoubtedly positive. Lightsabers but not only Humanity: it is possible to unlock different skins for our humans Orders for humans are placed on the ground along their path. The simplest one that we will practically always have available will allow us to make them change direction, another will make them less subject to gravity, other commands will allow us to prepare humans for battle, then there is the order of the jump present in different versions: the short one, the longer one, the one that will allow humans to reach higher at the expense of other distances. Of course, new commands will be added to each chapter but these will never be present all together: each level will grant us a certain type. The elements that we will find from time to time waiting for us will also vary: propellers that support humans in the air, cubes of water to be crossed by swimming but inside which it is not possible to insert orders. Along the game, humans will be pitted against their negative versions: another mass of people, but decolored in black and white, who will try to kill our decerebrated people. This opens up new commands that will allow us to make the two sides fight with swords or laser guns, in order to allow the other humans to reach the exit safely. Always something new Humanity: Exciting logical boss fights are also hidden in the game The changes of direction of Humanity are different, new functions, new ideas are continuously introduced, and in the event that this does not happen, you will certainly find new variations of what has already been introduced in the previous levels waiting for you. In some scenarios we will have to rely on the multitude of humanity at our commands, others we will be called to divide it by sending small squads to specific tasks from which all the others will later benefit. The game is sometimes more reminiscent of a tower defense, at other times an overpowered version of Lemmings, at others it throws in memories of that classic that was Kurushi on the first PlayStation. Many of the levels present have multiple solutions, but often it will also be possible to move some elements until the turn puzzle is unsolvable. Humanity warns the player when a key piece is lost, inviting him to start the level over; it doesn't do it when the elements will remain present on the map but in unrecoverable positions, and in these cases you will have to notice it yourself even if it would not have been bad at all to have a warning even in similar situations. A symphonic gameplay Humanity: here you can see some of the available commands Humanity is fascinating to play, and fascinating to watch as well. Yes, the graphics are simple, but it's a simplicity that makes a ridiculous amount of people move around the maps at once. Witnessing and commanding this huge trail of humans, seeing them slay on the ground, dive and swim or take flight for one-kilometre leaps, all together, is a show worth watching, a choreography that finds its better half in a soundtrack as hypnotic as it is decisive, profoundly electronic but with an orchestral and cinematic breath. During its gameplay, Humanity always turns into a real deeply interactive audiovisual symphony, for a magic that we know well because it is now Tetsuya Mizuguchi's artist signature. In the construction of its metaphysical and optimistic story (together we are all, alone nobody), Humanity finds the square in a structure that closely resembles Rez, with a central nucleus to decode, bringing more and more people to safety. The levels are many, the extra challenges too, but the game will find its consecration through the editor and the exchange of levels between users. For those who would like to dramatically increase the emotions, in addition to the synesthetic effect of the game, there is also an enveloping mode for virtual reality.", "date": "2023-05-15", "grade": "8.5"}
