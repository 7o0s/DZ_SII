Pierpaolo Greco comes after him but is forced to withdraw, dissimulating indifference when his heart begins to beat when he sees a Japanese role-playing game appear on an advertising screen. Tanzen follows the leading group a short distance away, but stops to turkey with some girls in the queue for the Big Brother 32 auditions, fearing to use the surname ~Siffredi~. Andrea Rubbini is in great difficulty uphill, mysteriously abandoned by his manager, a certain Doctor Jones, apparently for a matter of 69 (but what are the Multy editors up to in private?), but Simone Tagliaferri helps him by throwing a bottle of water at him natural with a bloody sodium cell inside that does nothing but say bullshit... unfortunately it pecks him in the face and ends him in a ravine. Race over for the Bolognese. Who will win the race? Screens, screenshots and tables The Pro Cycling Manager series has been going on for years now, representing the best the video game market has to offer in terms of simulated cycling; also because they completely lack competitors of an adequate level. As happens with historical series that are renewed every season, this one too tends to resume the formula of the previous year, repeating it almost slavishly, despite the direction adjustments or, as happens not too rarely, slips. Let's say right away that Pro Cycling Manager 2009 Le Tour de France is a very complete and very complex title, which deals with every aspect of the life of a professional cycling team, giving the player the possibility to manage its entire gestation. The start is not immediate, since you have to navigate through dozens of screens and options and, except if you choose to play a quick game directly in the race, it will take some time to get ready to ride seriously. In reality, those who have already played the titles in the series will not have too much difficulty getting used to the game and understanding the logic of the new menus. A minimum of perseverance is required for the others if they want to begin to see and understand the effects of their choices on the track. The list of things to do and screens to navigate, with endless tables attached, is very long, and in fact it is not possible to list them all in the review. Know that, as usual, you will have to learn how to manage the finances of the team, look for new cyclists, coaches and sponsors, choose how to train the athletes and try to win in the one hundred and eighty competitions available, to become the strongest team in the world, which is not a small thing considering the ~climbs~ that you will have to face. Winning communities One of the aspects often overlooked in Pro Cycling Manager reviews is that of the community. Like any self-respecting niche game, this one has also managed to conquer its share of fans, who, thanks to the internet, have given life to dynamic and very active communities where it is possible to find advice on tactics and management and find serious people to challenge online (which is rare these days). A convenient editor for updating databases is also available in the game, which can also be downloaded online. The reference site of the Italian Pro Cycling Manager community is www.cycling-manager.it where you will find everything you need to enhance the gaming experience. We get on the track Satisfied with our choices in the management phase, all that remains is to get on track to put our team to the test. Here too the options are many and allow you to manage every aspect of the race. The first thing to do is set up a strategy and see how the situation on the track evolves, making decisions accordingly. Initially it is not very easy to react to unexpected sprints or to the opposing team play, also because you need to develop a minimum of expertise in the matter and the tutorial, although complete, is not enough (we are faced with one of those cases where only practice and observation can lead to worthy results). To help the player there are summary screens that allow you to examine the progress of the race translated into numbers. You have to learn to keep an eye on a vast number of different factors, from the composition of the team, to the state of the cyclists, passing through the conformation of the track, in order to be able to hit the right tactic. Errors and lightness are paid dearly. The news, also with regard to the race, are few. Having read the press releases of the game, we went in search of the phantom artificial intelligence improvements heralded by the developers. We were actually quitedisappointed in this respect. The behavior of the cyclists guided by artificial intelligence is rather homogeneous to that of the 2008 edition. There are some new attack tactics, but they are certainly not revolutionary and, certainly, they are not transcendental innovations. Likewise, there are no significant innovations even in the technical part, similar to that of last year, with only a few cosmetic tweaks brought here and there. Unfortunately, some of the bugs that plagued past editions remain.", "date": "2009-07-21", "grade": "7.5"}
