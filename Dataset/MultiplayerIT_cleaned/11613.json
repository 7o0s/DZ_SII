We are dealing with a fairly pure action game. By controlling the four protagonists of the game  Ulrich, Odd, Yumi and Aelita  one at a time, you must overcome the most classic levels of platforms infested with enemies. Each character, of course, has its own characteristics: Ulrich has a melee attack based on Katanas; Odd has a laser and the ability to climb certain walls; Yumi can lock enemies and then throw steel ~fans~ at them and finally Aelita can charge a powerful beam that compensates for her poor athletic skills. In addition to these, packcages can be recovered during the journey that unlock further abilities. Shooting: Ulrich can triple to hit enemies or destroy certain blocks; Odd can slow down time and wall jump; Yumi can balance on very narrow passages suspended in the air and use telekinesis on some blocks; Aelita can fly and ~petrify~ some enemies. These skills allow you to continue playing or recover a series of ~goodies~ - photos, drawings, etc. - scattered throughout the worlds. The control system is effective, even if underused , the character is controlled with the Joystick while shooting at the screen with the Wii pointer, Ulrich instead slashes at every shake of the Mote Each of the four directions of the directional cross is matched with a character, who can be recalled at any time, and complete the a whole series of ~gestures~ to be performed with the remote control to activate special actions - such as flapping Aelita's wings. The game is also marred by a series of sections on board a spaceship, which always moves along the identical backdrop, in a sort of shooter on rails. Here the control system turns out to be very bad, given the obscene idea of not untying the movement of the ship from the pointing. Everything is done by pointing the Wiimote and the ship basically goes where it points creating confusion and imprecision Finally, there are five monsters to kill, made on average well, pretty tough and with attention to the patterns even if not too innovative. The technical realization of the latter is also beautiful in a good cell shading that seems born to be exploited on the Wii. ...Lyoko The game is basically summarized above. There are no other frills or weird stuff. And it could also be interesting, a pity that more than half of it really turns out to be the thickness of a sheet of tissue paper... After the central part, finally, we begin to see something good and to exploit the still valid and interesting control system. If at first everything is too flat and simplistic, in the end everything becomes more complex and, while not leaving the most abused clichs, it even manages to entertain and drag you towards the end. The shuffling of the characters and some flights of fancy add spice and difficulty, with even some frustrating passages! It's a pity that everything takes place in no more than five or six settings, among other things very poor in detail and graphically disappointing, which are repeated ad nauseam, as happens in the television series on the other hand... It's strange to see that as soon as you are in the slightly more complex scenography of the Volcano, everything slows down heavily The flight sections, on the other hand, are very bad as well as repetitive and really frustrating and boring in the end, they have the bad habit of restarting from the beginning in case of death. This creates a curse loop that leads nowhere. On the other hand, the monsters mentioned earlier are good, they almost seem made by a completely different team and unrelated to the main game. The beautiful Cell Shading, exploited more, would definitely have given a few more points to a technical realization that for the rest never goes too far beyond just enough. Comment Code Lyoco is the typical game that can entertain fans of the series of the same name assuming they are not too old. It takes all the defects of a television production by weight, starting from the repetition of the same clips and the same settings, and adds all those of a Tie In, such as a series of platform jumps and mechanics already seen in thousands of titles. Too bad because the minestrone starts to work, but it does it too late, undermined in principle by too much simplicity and flatness. Just as the bare and all too essential technical realization is too flat - in line with the animated series and at times indistinguishable - The plot is nice, the ~final~ monsters are beautiful, which also change the graphic style in an apt way and which are difficult - too much? - and complex, but, believe us, the sections in flight are really horrendous! Pros Very close to the animated series Good control system On the finish it does its job wello Cons First half too flat and simplistic Technical realization just enough Sections in flight really ugly and boring", "date": "2008-02-20", "grade": null}
