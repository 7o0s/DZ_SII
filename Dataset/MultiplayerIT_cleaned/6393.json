After crossing the Shamutanti hills and the mysterious city of Khar, the player is now called to reach Mampang and kill the seven snakes under the control of the evil archmage, all following the formula already effectively proposed by the previous chapters. Sorcery! 3 confirms the excellent work done by Inkle, but it is a very niche game I'll show you the green Sorceries Our younger readers probably don't even know what we're talking about when we use the term gamebook: well, it's a very popular literary genre in the 80s and 90s that combines narrative with a playful component inspired by role-playing games paper, with the reader who had to continue the story by reading the paragraphs relating to the choices he made and also pass fights and skill tests related to the character's statistics and the roll of the dice. Inkle's fine work with Sorcery! is precisely to re-propose the stories and mechanics of the homonymous series of gamebooks in a format more suited to current users, i.e. smartphones and tablets. All this takes the form of a predominantly textual adventure, in which the plot obviously has a significant specific weight: in the case of Sorcery! 3, the player takes on the role of an adventurer charged by the king to recover the crown stolen by the cruel archmage and thus restore peace and prosperity to the lands of Analand. The quality of the narration is not that of the great classics, but Steve Jackson is a solid craftsman of fantasy and it is easy to get captured by the events narrated by the game, provided, however, that you have a more than fair knowledge of the English language, given that Sorcery! 3 is not localized in Italian. An element unfortunately destined to further limit a potential catchment area that is already particularly niche due to the nature of its play offer... Basically, playing Sorcery! 3 means reading large portions of text and then selecting one of the different choices contemplated by the story with a tap, and so on until the end of the adventure. Being a succession of crossroads, the ending is obviously open and it can happen that you reach an unhappy conclusion or even witness the protagonist's death well before his goal is achieved. Fortunately, the title offers a convenient rewind function that allows you to retrace your steps to remedy any wrong choices. Following the trend inaugurated by the previous two chapters, Sorcery! 3 does not however limit itself to representing a digital version of a classic gamebook, but also tries to make the more strictly playful components of the adventure a little more ~alive~: therefore the fights, skill tests, management of the protagonist's statistics and inventory are much closer to the standards of video games than to those of books, making the experience usable even for those who are not accustomed to this particular literary genre or paper role-playing games in general. However, there are some really angular aspects such as for example the execution of spells that can be cast by putting the three correct letters in order: the book of formulas is not easy to consult, it is not always clear which spells can be useful in certain situations and things get even more complicated when the possession of a certain object is necessary to start the operation. Finally, although it is not a fundamental component, it is undeniable that Sorcery! 3 is not a very attractive product from a cosmetic point of view, with very basic graphics that match a look of menus and screens that concede nothing to visual pleasure.", "date": "2015-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
