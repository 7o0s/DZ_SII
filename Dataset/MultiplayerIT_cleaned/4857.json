Almost five years later, the situation hasn't changed all that much, but the release of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox has at least kept the pace in the relaunch of the series, and convinced NIS America to bring back the most interesting - and best-selling - titles such as precisely Lacrimosa of Dana, which thus reaches its second conversion for Sony consoles. In our review of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana for PlayStation 5 we will give a brief overview of what the game has to offer, before focusing on the novelties of this conversion, so we refer you to our previous review for Nintendo Switch in case you want to explore the topic in detail. History Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, the dialogues are all in English The Ys series stars Adol Christin, a young adventurer who somehow always ends up shipwrecked here and there. This time, however, Adol finds himself in good company. The story begins when the ship Lombardia, carrying a colorful crew as well as our hero, passes too close to the cursed island of Seiren. Adol finds himself on the shore, alone and confused. After meeting Laxia, a surly young shipwreck like him, the two begin to explore the island in search of missing travel companions and an escape route. finding the other survivors. The island of Seiren is a huge region, divided into large spaces separated by very short loads: following the main objective of the turn, we will always go deeper, coming across new characters who will join our group or return to the base camp, putting standing a shortlist of services that includes workshops, blacksmiths and other features. It wouldn't be wrong to define Ys VIII as a kind of ~metroidvania~ since the progression system is essentially the same. Unfortunately the story does not mesh immediately. The beginning is worryingly slow, also due to a technical sector that feels the weight of the years and which frequently resorts to dialogues in English. At one point, however, the story of Ys VIII takes off with a series of interesting twists that dig deep into the mythology of the series, winking at historical fans. You have to grit your teeth for a while, but Ys VIII can easily be considered as Adol Christin's best adventure. The combat system Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, the combat system is in real time Ys VIII is an action RPG: the player has complete control, in real time, of the movements and actions of Adol or one of his traveling companions. The party can in fact be composed of up to three characters and the player can swap them at any time by pressing a simple button. The map can be explored far and wide using runs and jumps, while the combat system is centered on some simple maneuvers, in particular dodging and parrying: by pressing the keys at the right moment, power-ups called Flash Dodge and Flash Guard. The effect lasts a few seconds, but in this juncture time slows down and the player gains a significant bonus to damage inflicted and movement speed. The combat system rewards aggression, since there are no real healing spells, given that life is restored by standing still, and the player accumulates the resource from which special moves draw simply by attacking the enemy, which is why it is necessary to put in neurons also move. Each member of the party, in fact, uses a weapon that inflicts a certain type of damage against which enemies can be more or less vulnerable. For this reason, building the party based on the enemies to be faced soon becomes essential, but also studying and learning the monsters' behaviors, so as to predict their next attacks and make the most of the effects of Flash Guard and Flash Dodge, charge the indicator of super attacks and wipe out the enemies in the shortest time possible. The PlayStation 5 conversion Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, some costumes were exclusive to Japan Ys VIII is a very entertaining title, but you have to come to terms not so much with the story that takes a while to get going, but above all with an outdated graphic sector in which a generally coarse polygonal modeling stands out, even if at least the main characters enjoy a remarkable level of detail. The art direction compensates for these edginess with a sober and convincing character design, but sopall with a variety of scenarios that are a pleasure to explore on the notes of a soundtrack of the highest level, as per tradition. The PlayStation 5 version, in reality, adds absolutely nothing to the original game in terms of content, except for the DLC which are included in the price right away and also include some costumes that until now had remained a Japanese exclusive. Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, the game can now travel at 120 frames per second On the technical front, however, the improvements are quite evident. Loads have become really lightning fast, and considering that the island of Seiren is divided into ~rooms~ this is a great added value. All the shadows were then retouched, which appear much more defined and realistic than in the past, and work was done on the draw distance and on the color palette to significantly improve the visual rendering in the scenarios and in the fights. The latter benefit further from the switch to 120 frames per second, which drop to 60 if you set the resolution to 4K. The slowdowns that occasionally occurred on PlayStation 4 and much more often on Nintendo Switch have completely disappeared, of course, and moreover Nihon Falcom has also added mouse and keyboard support.", "date": "2022-11-12", "grade": "8.2"}
