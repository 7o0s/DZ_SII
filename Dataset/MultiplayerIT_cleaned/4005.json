{"name": "Eloh", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eloh-la-recensione.html", "text": "When pace meets gameplay in video games, immersive experiences often emerge, games that can be rough in some respects but hard to put down and forget, as this Eloh review demonstrates. The instinctive and enthralling charge of musical rhythm is something that moves you when you become the protagonists and creators of its flow, something that those who practice music in its various forms know well; and it is a sensation that can also find good applications in the videogame field, where it still offers wide areas to explore, beyond the now standardized coding of rhythm games. Between the synesthetic implications of Tetsuya Mizuguchi to the joyful interactive music of Masaya Matsuura, up to the now abused mechanics of Guitar Hero, the properly videogame declinations of music are not many, or at least not as many as we would like, so when you find a title that succeeds to bend the evocative power of the rhythm to a convincing game structure we are faced with a sort of event to celebrate. This is the case of Eloh, a small game by Broken Rules which, as the software house's name curiously says, manages to subvert a few rules. As a puzzle game it is actually quite simple, essentially requiring you to move square blocks on various chessboards in order to deflect beams of ~particles~, according to more or less intricate trajectories, from a starting point to the correct arrival point, but all what lies in the middle of this path is a real joy for ears and brain. In fact, everything is based on the concept of percussion, whereby the mobile blocks are sorts of tribal totems which, in contact with the particles (balls or whatever) fired by the sound sources, emit sounds similar to drums, djembes or timpani depending on the their shape, also influencing the behavior of the particle beam, although the rebound of these always follows the same physical-geometric principle of the rebound at 90 degrees, thus allowing an easy calculation of the reactions. Rhythm and geometry The story, if it exists, is extremely hermetic, with each new ~setting~ being introduced by a short and simple animation in which the various totems or masks experiment with sounds in situations whose explanation is decidedly mysterious, but this is not exactly the main point of Eloh. The game takes place on single screens, with a total of about 80 levels in which we have to make small colored spheres, shot from some sort of loudspeakers, reach their goal marked by the same color as the beam. A grid of squares is arranged on the screen, on which the various totems can be moved by simply dragging them via touch screen, therefore the mechanics provide for the correct positioning of these elements in order to exploit the rebounds of the bundles of spheres against them to go finally to hit the targets, considering that each surface deflects the beam by 90 degrees and that some boxes can be occupied by immovable blocks or that follow predefined movement patterns. Described in this way it may seem like the classic gray and brainy puzzle, but Eloh is pervaded by a musical soul that represents something more than a simple stylistic frill: just like Rez's shots, the noises of the rebounds create an irresistible rhythm, on which it is impossible to ignore. It's easy then to find yourself wasting time just trying rhythms and new sound mixtures, making the experimentation process a real joy for the ears and giving a new boost to puzzle solving. The basic concept is as simple as it is ingenious and perhaps its being extremely basic turns out to be excessive in the long run: the variations inserted from level to level don't distort the setting of the game that much with innovative elements and the difficulty is always rather docile, with demanding challenges that emerge only at times in the not too long path to the conclusion, but in both cases these are rather typical problems for a puzzle game.", "date": "2018-10-17", "grade": "8.8"}
