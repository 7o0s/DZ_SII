{"name": "Lastronauta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/147008-lastronaut-lastronauta.html", "text": "Staging an endless runner is decidedly simple, just find some motivation to justify a mad run of a character within some setting, while the success that this type of gameplay seems to continue to collect from the public easily covers any logical and narrative flaws. Lastronaut, however, appears to be quite accurate also with regard to the construction of the premises for the game, at least in terms of characterization and atmospheres. The birth of an artificial super-intelligence has led to a total war between robots and humans, the extreme consequence of which has been the escape of the latter from planet Earth, having lost any chance of victory. Humanity's last bastion against the overwhelming forces of machines is represented by a single, last astronaut, engaged in a mad race towards his rocket, within an Earth now in total destruction, while striking all the robots that shooting captain. Mind you, this is certainly not a Pulitzer Prize-winning piece, but if nothing else, the canvas allows you to insert the action in a somewhat particular and fascinating context, beyond the little animals, colorful worlds and peanuts to collect while running. The mix of atmospheres that derives from the characterization applied by Darrin Henein to his game is curious, combining the nostalgic and cartoonish stylization of 16-bit style pixel art with dark and distressing tones of an imminent apocalypse, helping to give a very particular tone to this mobile production and thus making it stand out in the midst of the real chaos of similar titles present in this sector of the market, a mission that is anything but easy. Furthermore, the game is completely free and free from intrusive ads. The mad rush to safety of the last astronaut on Earth: here is Lastronaut Two taps and go The question in this case is extremely simple: a touch on the left side of the screen makes our astronaut jump, a touch on the right side allows you to shoot with the supplied weapon. The character, as per tradition, runs automatically and inexorably by sliding the scenario to the left, thus requiring him to jump over obstacles, bombs and traps with perfect timing and at the same time to destroy various enemies and structures that stand in the way of salvation. The aim is to cover the greatest possible distance in a single endless sequence shot that basically has no end, in search of the highest score to be submitted to the online rankings. The variations on the theme are given by the rotation of the weapons and by some moments in slow motion or turbo which are activated by destroying various elements of the scenario and allow momentary gains of precious meters along the way. The various weapons have rather different effects and behaviors, somehow modifying the approach to running without offering substantial variations, the random rotation between them at each game therefore introduces an element of variation which is welcome, considering the physiological monotony of the game, preventing you from becoming stuck on a single style. It must be said that the ingredients involved are few, therefore after a few games Lastronaut has practically shown everything it has to offer, but its particular atmosphere, the simple but well-studied and clean graphics and the excellent electronic audio sector however, they make it a pleasant experience, to be tried again periodically and perhaps to be expanded with subsequent additions, if the developer decides for this solution.", "date": "2015-03-20", "grade": "7.8"}
