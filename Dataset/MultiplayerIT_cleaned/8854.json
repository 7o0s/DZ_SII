Price too high, the major titles only announced and a line up of no particular value, the stereoscopic 3D that it was not clear how much could ever really benefit the gameplay, an online shop with little stock. Result? Poor sales and a dark future, which loomed over the arrival of the next Sony handset. Then, in August, the sensational price cut, which already by itself gave a good boost to purchases; but it was only the first step of the Grande Enne strategy. A string of great games, Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 above all plus the new Monster Hunter in Japan, a major console firmware update, more collaboration with third parties and the rest, as they say, is history, which you can check in our regular sales chart updates as well as in the pockets of more and more players. If something was still missing, it was a game that alone justified the eShop, the digital delivery of Kyoto: well, from now on we can rest assured on this side too. Push Me, Pull Me Pullblox is developed by Intelligent Systems, the historic Nintendo team that gave us, let's say, Paper Mario, Advance Wars and WarioWare. And it shows, starting from the absurd and very Japanese premises: in a charming village where the main characteristic of the strange inhabitants is that they are rather rounded, as a sort of retaliation the children's favorite pastime is climbing the Pullblox, structures formed for the 'precisely from very squared blocks which can be of the most diverse shapes and sizes and which, being each of a different colour, form designs which may or may not be abstract. Building them with passion and love is Master Blox, an old man with a white beard who, having had no children, has thus practically adopted all the little ones in the village; but one bad day the unexpected happens: the blocks, which are sliding, of all the Pullblox close again, trapping the innocent little kids who were playing with them. This is where you come into play, namely Mallo, a young and vigorous aspiring sumo wrestler (he would have every right, on the other hand) who is chosen by Master Blox probably for his prowess as the savior of children from all over the world. the village. And how to save them? Pullblox is the classic very simple concept that if you see it at work you can understand it immediately, while if you try to explain it in words you risk wasting liters and liters of ink unnecessarily, but we'll try anyway: the blocks, we said , are sliding for a maximum of three ~spaces~, and Mallo can both pull and push them, placing himself in front of them and, when he can, to the side. The goal is to reach the trapped child, who is generally located on the highest part of the Pullblox, using the particular shape of each individual block as stairs and/or platforms. The problem is that at the beginning the blocks are all pushed inwards, and if there is no difficulty in pulling outwards, for all three available spaces, those that rest directly on the ground, then climbing up these spaces are reduced to two (obviously you can't ask the improbable hero to throw himself into the void to completely throw a block, and then how would he manage to get on it?) and so on until it will no longer be possible to throw a block. Unless Mallo manages to get to the side, but here too he must have at least two squares available under his feet to operate on the adjacent block. The talented young man, then, can jump high enough to pass from one step to the one immediately higher, and long enough to overcome a single empty space. This is all the core of the game, to which are added the possibility of resetting all the work done when you can no longer get to the bottom of it, or to go back a little in time to what you think was a serious mistake , and, not from the beginning, some gameplay elements such as stairs and trapdoors that lead from block to block (the trapdoors work a bit like the portals of Portal, since you cannot choose their placement). The 3D effect We were talking in the body of the review of games that arise from the need to make the most of the characteristics of a particular machine: Pullblox is a prime example, at least as regards stereoscopic 3D. It's not that you can't play without it, or that the title couldn't have been conceived, but 3D adds a dimension of total naturalness, with the simple game world literally taking shape before your eyes, making everything intuitive and a frightening immediacy, without losing in difficulty. It's a concept born for stereoscopy, try turning it off andyou will realize by yourself that it would not be the same thing. Pure genius Accustomed as we are to a market where even a pinball simulator, if it doesn't have some very complicated RPG component, is to be thrown away, it could make a bit of a light species of such a simple concept. Pullblox, in the middle of the twenty-first century, takes us back to that golden age of videogames in which designers, faced with the very limited capabilities of processors (and it's no coincidence that this game too seems to result from the careful study of the characteristics of the 3DS, as you can read in the paragraph on the 3D effect), they had to come up with really basic ideas but which could be harbingers of great fun for the players; what is surprising at the end of 2011 is how the development team came up with an absolutely new and unpublished mechanic simply by combining the fundamentals of two genres, the Puzzle and the Platform, which have been living and thriving for decades. Whole volumes could be written, taking Pullblox as a starting point, on what game design is and what makes a video game great; but obviously even a great idea is useless if it's not done well, and here too Intelligent Systems is not wrong: over two hundred levels, and there isn't one that isn't at least discreet. In pure Nintendo style, we start from the fundamentals, with Mastro Blox explaining the few concepts, and we are accompanied by the hand slowly, almost without realizing it, up to the peaks of very considerable difficulties which, however, never bury the player's will, and on the contrary, they encourage it according to the classic virtuous circle of ~one more game and then I'll stop~. Even more surprising is how in Mastro Blox's inventory there are not only abstract figures, but also very ~8-bit style~ real drawings, and among these also references to historical Nintendo icons, which work as well as and better than the Pullblox so to speak ~schematic~. As if that weren't enough, once all the puzzles are finished (we forgot the possibility that you are given, after some time spent trying to solve it, to skip one to return to it at a later time) you can also indulge yourself in creating your own via a very intuitive editor: each Pullblox thus created generates a QR Code which can then be read by any 3DS around the world, and absolutely unmissable specimens are already circulating on the web, just a few days after their release, all for virtually infinite longevity. At this point we could move on to analyze the graphics, clear, colorful, bright, ~Nintendosissima~ but perhaps a little monotonous, the music fun but honestly too few, and maybe complain about the fact that on the multiplayer side there is really nothing to report , but it would be time wasted: for only 6 Euros, Pullblox is the Killer Application of the Nintendo eShop and outclasses many full-price boxed games, for the fun it gives hands down, for the involvement, for the hours you'll spend together.", "date": "2011-12-16", "grade": "9.4"}
