A year ago the developers of Gunfire Games pulled that little gem of Remnant: From the Ashes out of the top hat, a brutal and satisfying third-person shooter, around which a large group of admirers was created within a year. Why do we talk about it again? Because it's not over. Remnant is now available for free on the Epic Games Store for a few more days, and in the meantime the development team has made available Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923, a DLC that is actually a real expansion. Something much more ambitious than Swamp of Corsus (the first DLC) and which even picks up the plot where it ended. The plot: where were we? Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923 offers the player a separate and completely new story, to access which you will have to interact with the red stone of the Ward and start a new specific campaign; obviously you will bring with you all the weapons, pieces of equipment, consumables and traits acquired up to that point. This is an opportunity that will surely be appreciated by the players: in fact, the plot of Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923 carries forward what was seen in the main narrative of the base game. The protagonist had traveled through various worlds, until he challenged the Dreamer and then the Nightmare. However, the threat linked to the Roots, and surprisingly, has not ended: they continue to invade the dimension of human beings, sowing corruption and destruction. So we're on our way again, this time to Ward Prime, where it all began, where scientists had first contact with the alien civilization, even before the Guardian of the Earth (the Dragon) was defeated by corruption. The new campaign, through a good number of hours, will guide the protagonist through new areas of the Earth, a new Ward (the Ward Prime) and the new alien world of Reisum dominated by the glacial biome. It goes without saying that the narrative intends to reveal important background: the narrative of Remnant has always been rather cryptic, and many questions were left unanswered. Most of them will find it right inside the Ward Prime, where, among other things, a new, particularly fresh approach to gameplay will also be proposed: opening the various rooms, escaping from invulnerable enemies, will require stealth tactics and the solution of some puzzles elementary. There will obviously be plenty of sessions in which you will have to get your hands on weapons at full blast, before and after. New worlds, new enemies Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923 introduces new worlds, levels and enemies that can be tackled either linearly through the main narrative or freely through one of the other game modes present (such as Survival and Adventure). The first of the new environments coincides with a rural land area completely immersed in the nocturnal haze: dotted with abandoned farmhouses and fields left to themselves, here you will be immediately attacked by the Roots and by new creatures, sorts of anthropomorphic rats equipped with lethal weapons. A very interesting new level is also the Ward Prime, by virtue of the novelties related to the gameplay and the stealth approach we have told you about; here too new types of enemies are introduced, some flying and others similar to purplish deer. Ward Prime is full of collectibles and recordings, which enrich the narrative context of Remnant: From the Ashes; and it is also a fundamental hub for reaching Reisum. Reisum probably represents the most substantial content of Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923: a completely new planet, with its biome, its enemies, its bosses (generated procedurally, so you'll have to go back several times to beat them all), and new weapons / pieces of equipment to add to your collection. The cold is an additional problem for the hero, who can end up freezing from the blows of the ice shamans; and barrels scattered across the map can be used by you or enemies as powerful explosives. Don't you dare do a somersault towards them, because you will lose a lot of life and go up in flames. All the contents we have told you about, naturally seasoned with other surprises that will require you to play and re-play the DLC to be obtained or found, are finally offered by the developers of Gunfire Games at the really honest price of 9.99 euros. In conclusion... Remnant: From the Ashes - Subject 2923 picks up the basic version of the Gunfire Games title where you left it, ignorleaving the parenthesis of Swamps of Corsus: the narrative continues, and addresses the original invasion of the Root on Earth, providing important background to finally understand the whole context. Content abounds: not only weapons, modifiers and pieces of equipment, but new areas on planet Earth, new enemies, new bosses, and even the new snow planet of Reisum to explore well. The purchase is practically mandatory for fans of Remnant: From the Ashes, especially since the introductory price of 9.99 euros for a similar expansion is truly negligible. Back to fighting the Roots and moving through the spaces of corruption, while (hopefully) the developers are already thinking about Remnant 2.", "date": "2020-08-24", "grade": null}
