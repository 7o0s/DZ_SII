So forget the anonymous silhouettes of the fighters seen at the beginning of the franchise: the characters of Shadow Fight 3 are equipped with ~unencrypted~ polygonal models, well designed and above all equipped with really valid and convincing animations, which best represent the various fighting styles available depending on the factions and the equipment used. The plot of the game takes place a few years after the events of the second chapter, but there are still many warriors willing to challenge each other to conquer the Shadow Sphere, a mysterious artifact that contains the powerful energy of the shadow. Our avatar is an expert fighter who is faced with a large number of opponents, with a view to a campaign that promises to be quite long and demanding but for the wrong reasons. In fact, already after the very first duels, the freemium setting of the game proves to be too stringent, so much so that we will not even be able to try our hand at the opponents of the first chapter in the absence of equipment of a certain level. Well, how do you get new weapons and armor? Basically through two ways: online multiplayer matches or the purchase of Item Cards through the use of virtual or real currency. Likewise, the prize boxes that you receive after each victory require long waiting times to be opened or, again, the use of hard coins. For a bunch of dollars Anyone who has been reading us for some time will certainly know that our position regarding the use of microtransactions is based exclusively on common sense, through a conscientious evaluation of their real impact. This is even more true for freemium productions, which earn only from in-game purchases that users are willing to make and which therefore legitimately adopt a series of measures to entice players to do so. However, there is a way and a way to implement this kind of strategy, and the one used by Shadow Fight 3 seemed wrong to us, given that hitting the game's paywall is a matter of minutes, not hours. The gameplay undoubtedly has a high strategic value, in which timing and the ability to take the measures of each attack mainly count, with a virtual stick on the left side of the screen and three buttons on the right side to use fists or weapons, kicks or ~shadow mode~ with its special moves; but the challenge is evidently distorted when the first enemies already manage to deprive us of disproportionate quantities of vital energy by carrying out some attacks, whereas instead our lunges prove to be ineffective. Furthermore, and this is no small defect, the virtual stick is not precise enough and we often end up jumping rather than moving forward or defending ourselves, which translates into a flood of undeserved defeats, perhaps on the razor's edge . The funny thing is that Shadow Fight 2 suffered from the exact same problems, and if the authors didn't think of solving them, it's obviously because the commercial model proved to be effective, despite everything. Well, that's really a shame, given the substantial improvement in terms of technical realization, the increased variety of different fighting styles and the abundance of weapons and items that can be unlocked throughout the campaign. Maybe in the next few weeks Nekki will realize that the current difficulty balance is off and will run for cover through some updates, but until then the Shadow Fight 3 experience remains a big unfinished one.", "date": "2017-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
