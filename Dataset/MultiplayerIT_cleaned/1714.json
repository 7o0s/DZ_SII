The ~Great Twilight~ stretches its menacing shadow, jeopardizing all the lives of the inhabitants of the world. The infamous Class VII, or rather, both Class VII, the old one and the newer one, made up of all their students, will have to be able to find the most important element of the group, the fantastic Rean, captured by Giliath Osborn, who came to the discovered as his father at the end of the epic confrontation of the previous chapter. The journey of our protagonists in the vast and full world of Trails of Cold Steel IV begins right here, where the story of the third part ended. A plague is corrupting the population, a kind of psychic curse that forces people to do certain things. Juna, Altina and Kurt awake from an already strange group nightmare, realizing that something is wrong, and that their mentor is alive and in need of help. From here you play a very long first chapter, which acts a bit as a tutorial and as an acclimatization towards the myriad of game mechanics, after which a huge world opens up, full of things to do and people to talk to . Of course, if you don't speak much English, the adventure will lose some of its beauty, but trust us if we tell you to make a little effort and try to go beyond localization. The quantity and quality of activities, mini-games and subquests, as well as the variety of settings and the depth of the gameplay and the upgrade system, will give you great satisfaction. All as already described in our original analysis, in short. The review of The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV for Switch therefore wants to understand how much the console is able to keep up with other systems and offer a level experience. Gameplay and combat Our good and dear Juna while casting a skill One of the best arrows in the quiver of The Legend of heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV is undoubtedly the combat system and character progression. The battles are not in real time, but once an enemy is encountered, the combat arena appears in which to issue commands to our protagonists, one at a time. We have eight different actions available: moving, using objects, Art, Craft, Orders, escape, character change and the basic attack. Apart from the obvious actions, we therefore have some particular commands to analyze. The Art and the Craft are the two characteristic mechanics of the series now present from the first episode; they are respectively skills that use the points that each character has available to carry out, the first, offensive and defensive actions, while the second of the characteristic skills of each character, as well as his personal special move, the S-Craft. Orders, on the other hand, are personal actions of each member of the team, passive or active, which influence the attack and defense of the entire team. The latter take advantage of another points system, the battle points, which accumulate during battles and precisely during breaks, a sort of mini-game that can be activated once the enemy has been stunned. Our initial group Each attack and defense action has a range, a zone of effect, in which the enemy or the ally must be in order to receive the effect. The Points used for the Craft can also be spent to summon the characteristic Divine Knights or the Panzer Soldats, big robots that will help us in our raids, with their personal movesets and abilities. That said, the situation seems a bit tangled, and indeed it is. There are also other advanced mechanics such as upgrading individual skills and advancing in the adventure rank which in turn unlock other things, but still, once you get the hang of the steep learning curve, you will only find joy and joy in the progression system of the game. Technique From a technical point of view, in portable mode the title unfortunately loses a little, especially for the refresh rate. The images sometimes suffer from a sort of blur due to the reduced frame rate and honestly this makes everything a lot less enjoyable. Obviously the matter changes completely with the docked mode which returns the game to its complete and most beautiful form. Of course, we are not talking about photorealism or jaw-breaking graphics, but in any case the title has a characteristic style that it has been carrying on for years now, in this latest version polished and with improved effects, decidedly pleasant. The only general negative note perhaps we can notice it in the game maps, not always of quality and with little depth. The English dub, as well as the Japanese dub, are of very good workmanship and the music also reaches very high peaks of excitement.", "date": "2021-04-08", "grade": "8.7"}
