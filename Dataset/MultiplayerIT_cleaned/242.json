The Harmonix guys have therefore wisely decided to keep the game system that has earned so much fame and glory practically intact, limiting themselves for the most part to the classic filings and marginal additions. The already mentioned guitar-controller, with its 5 keys to simulate the strings, the central one for the pick stroke and the handle for the vibrato therefore remains the absolute protagonist with which to grapple with through a new and very rich tracklist. The mechanics is as simple to understand as it is initially difficult to master, at least for those who are not very familiar with the ~real~ instrument or do not enjoy great coordination with the fingers. In practice, the keys to press to play the notes and thus reproduce the chosen song are indicated on the screen; but if the simplest pieces and the lowest levels of difficulty limit themselves to requiring basic movements, on the contrary with more consistent challenges it will be necessary to bring out the Jimi Hendrix that is in each of us with multiple string pressures and very rapid passages like a true tightrope walker. Just to give support on the occasion of the advanced levels just described, Guitar Hero II introduces an appropriate practice mode, with which you can train only in certain sections of the songs, thus avoiding having to repeat them entirely. An ideal support for those who want to get the most out of the Harmonix product, especially in view of the higher level of general difficulty compared to the first episode. The other important addition is instead to be found in the multiplayer; although playing Guitar Hero in two was undoubtedly expensive given the need to buy a second controller, the satisfactions given by the challenges with a friend were truly remarkable. This sequel not only allows you to perform different sections of the same song, but also to challenge each other within the entire song from start to finish, and beyond. In fact, the cooperative mode adds a further dose of interest to the whole, leading the 2 players to perform the piece as if they were actually playing two different instruments; one the lead guitar, and the other the rhythm guitar or bass as appropriate. Although it is difficult to say that playing the bass is as fun as the guitar, the overall sensation is fun and helps to bring playful fiction closer to sonic reality. Furthermore, the possibility of choosing different levels of difficulty for the two participants in the game represents an intelligent addition capable of favoring the joining of expert players with novice friends. I love rock'n'roll Despiteor the most important and valid aspect of Guitar Hero was certainly not the graphic one, the Harmonix programmers had managed to create a pleasant product above all for the style used, which well represented in an ironic key the rocker atmosphere of concerts in front of a more or less large audience. With this second episode everything has been improved and cleaned up, while keeping the aforementioned style intact; even on lcd tv, via component connection together with the option for progressive scan, Guitar Hero II maintains an excellent overall appearance. The ability to customize your alter-ego has also been increased, and it is now possible to choose from a list of 11 characters (8 from the start + 3 unlockable) together with your favorite tool. But obviously the fundamental component of a game of this mold is the tracklist; for the occasion, the team has chosen a list of 64 new songs (24 of these to unlock), covering different genres of rock and different periods, from the 70s to the present day. Also in this case, as with the first chapter, it is for the vast majority of covers, mostly well performed apart from a handful of sensational defaillances. However, although, as it is obvious, the list of songs represents a more or less concrete attraction based on everyone's tastes and knowledge, our opinion is that in principle the overall quality is slightly lower than that of the first Guitar Hero. Or rather, in this case the choice went on songs that were mostly more ~sectoral~ and therefore addressed to true rock enthusiasts, while last year it was much easier to see a good number of tracks with a wider appeal. Furthermore, the Guitar Hero II appears as a ~sequel~ also with regard to the aforementioned level of difficulty, since the much less gentle learning curve compared to its predecessor makes it not as accessible as a ~starting point~ for aspiring guitarists. Comment Guitar Hero II literally follows the manual dedicated to how to pack a sequel without risking anything. More options, cleaner graphics, a whole new playlist and a more full-bodied multiplayer are the cornerstones of this sequel which fully confirms the gameplay that led to the great success of the first episode. However, the less mainstream tracklist and the higher level of difficulty make it a slightly more sectoral product, a factor that could lead aspiring new digital rockers to prefer buying last year's chapter. Those who have already gutted and loved Guitar Hero can without a doubt proceed with the purchase with their eyes closed. Pros Improved in every aspect Very, very fun Great multiplayer Cons Tracklist for many but not all Steeper learning curve Surprises, in the world of modern video games, are an increasingly rare commodity. One of the most popular and pleasant of recent times has been Harmonix's Guitar Hero, a musical title which, even without reinventing the wheel, had the advantage of finding the right, if not perfect, formula: to resume a guitar-shaped controller (original idea of Konami and his Guitar Freaks), mix it with a mechanic largely borrowed from the previous Frequency and insert everything into the world of rock'n'roll with an excellent tracklist. After about a year, here comes the predictable sequel, Guitar Hero II, now available for Ps2 and soon to be published also on Xbox 360.", "date": "2006-12-01", "grade": null}
