In doing so, however, the promise of Modus Games, Dreams Uncorporated and SYCK remains to maintain a rather marked underlying originality and character. So let's find out if the initial intent has become a solid reality in the Cris Tales review. Cause and effect Cris Tales: between past, present and future Out today for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Series X/S, Cris Tales is a true reflection of the JRPGs of yesteryear, featuring turn-based combat, a strong narrative focus, and an coherent and cohesive to be actively explored. All these things will be analyzed here, but the departure is as always dedicated to the narrative premise. Crisbell is a girl who lives in an orphanage in Narim. A little girl whose childhood is, at least initially, a great mystery. The player is accompanied on a multi-faceted journey in search of Crisbell's past, but above all of a future to be written to save the hopes of a world in turmoil. We won't tell you much more regarding the plot, but we will focus on the details of a narrative that is very decisive and framed from the very first steps. Suffice it to say, however, that Crisbell is not a child like the others, the possibility of manipulating the time crystals to observe the past and the future is something that goes far beyond the simple gift entrusted to a ~chosen one~. Cris Tales: Exploring the city What you will find in front of you is a structured narrative, full of moral plots, of important repercussions on the game world related to the progress of the plot, but also to the player's choices. The idea of the developers was not to dwell on the classic clich of time shifts but on the wise use of time as a yardstick of cause and effect. What Crisbell sees in the present has a cause in the past and an effect in the future and this continuous movement between the three folds of time is a very intriguing narrative device because it is expertly used. The cast of primary characters, secondary characters, NPCs, extras and party members is also very diverse, in depth and well characterized. You will have the opportunity to use six members in total and you will be able to manage the formation to be sent into battle in a special sub-menu. The narrative is therefore a fundamental element of the gaming experience, not the only one, but one of the main ones. Between past and future Cris Tales: Crisbell grappling with a battle On a playful level, the game stands as an excellent middle ground between new ideas and tested mechanics and operations. Combat is turn-based, and user-controlled characters will almost always be in the center of the screen. The enemies can be on both sides and each player's turn is marked by a change of perspective of the characters to make it clear which one is the attacker (whoever is used then moves to the foreground in the center, replacing the one who was there before and gradually continuing). The action menu can then be used as if it were a directional cross: at the bottom the escape, at the top the actions such as defense and use of objects, while on the right and on the left the selection of attacks and skills to be used in that direction. Each character in the party then has different skills and shots based on their weapons and characteristics. What emerges is a variegated party that recalls the old school subdivision of classes: warrior, white mage, black mage, blue mage, etc. In Cris Tales there is no this nomenclature, but by analyzing the characteristics of the characters it is easy to learn to recognize them. This stratification of roles then has two implications: a classic and conservative one and a more original one linked to the peculiarities of the title. The first is clearly the differentiation of the combat system based on the characteristics of the character (a healer will always give the best of himself as a support rather than as a physical DPS). The most original implication is instead the synergy with Crisbelle. Each character in the party will in fact have two types of synergies with the powerful time sorceress: one active and one passive. The active one accumulates over time during the fights and will charge a bar, once filled by pressing a button you can create a powerful combined attack that varies according to the character chosen to pair with Crisbelle. The passive synergy, on the other hand, is the possibility of combining some of the characters' abilities together with Crisbelle's time manipulation, and it is at this juncture that the disruptive force of Cris Tales emerges.Cris Tales: the fight We have explained how each character has a predisposition to a role: in each fight Crisbelle can transport the left enemies into the past and the right ones into the future and this allows you to create great synergies with the attacks of the allies. Let's take Wilhelm, a magician capable of poisoning opponents through a Yucanda. If this Yucanda is planted in the past and then transported to the present, all enemies in the Left Zone will be poisoned. If, on the other hand, the Yucanda is thrown into the present and then transported into the future, the poison accumulated on the enemy will do huge damage because it adds up over time. The example shown here is just one of the many applications of time in fighting in Cris Tales. The element of altered status manipulation is something that makes it really satisfying to delve into the game and more than once it has surprised us in a positive way. Cris Tales: An elemental attack The playful experience of Cris Tales is then greatly influenced by two aspects: secondary missions and equipment. It will be impossible to complete Cris Tales 100% in a first game (it will still take you 40 hours to finish a complete first cycle) due to its numerous side missions. However, many quests depend on choices made and/or secondary characters. Given that the game will often put you in front of crossroads, what you will find will be a title very rich in content and also equipped with a good replayability factor. The second and last point is clearly the equipment upgrade which, like any JRPG self-respecting, allows the player to have many hours of extra content. Whether it's by exploring the length and breadth of areas or through shops, powering up is still something extremely important. You cannot choose the difficulty and therefore taking into account your level will still be important. The game will put you in front of numerous random encounters (even too many in some areas) and this will allow you to manage everything with relative ease. Although the ideas are still good and the implications satisfactory, the maximum number of strategic choices is clearly not very large, therefore going to suffer from a certain tiredness and repetitiveness in the second half. A moving painting However, where Cris Tales excels is in the technical realization. The artistic direction of the work is masterful, full of hand paintings brought to life by a diorama creation. The navigation of the locations and the open map recalls the style of some of the most famous Colombian works and the representation of the main locations of the game (from Narim, via Saint Clarity, etc.) draws inspiration from the real cities of the South American country. The most striking example is the city of Saint Clarity reconstructed on the basis of Cartagena de Indias and its duality between the old city and the new city. The artistic direction is then a means to tell different situations in synergy with the narrative: from the social condition of the Colombian favelas, to the problem of the emerald mines and so on. An important awareness-raising background therefore, which cannot go unnoticed. Together with all this, a sublime soundtrack should also be noted, one of the memorable ones and which we hope will also be released in stand-alone format.", "date": "2021-07-20", "grade": "8.5"}
