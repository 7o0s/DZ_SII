{"name": "Disc Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180930-disc-jam-sulle-orme-di-windjammers.html", "text": "High Horse Entertainment is a small studio born from the collaboration of only two developers: Jay Mattis and Timothy Rapp. The first boasts a past in the ranks of Treyarch, where he got to work on Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops, while the latter contributed to the creation of the online infrastructure of Guitar Hero, also participating in the development of Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. After years spent in contact with triple A productions, the couple preferred to veer towards new horizons, and thus Disc Jam was born, a frenetic sports arcade clearly inspired by a classic of the past like Windjammers. Those who have a few more years on their shoulders will certainly remember with nostalgia the SNK title dating back to the NEO-GEO era, which among other things will soon return to the scene, with some graphic adaptations, on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. The Disc Jam concept was born in just eight weeks and was presented for the first time with a prototype at IndieCade 2015, one of the most popular festivals on the indie scene. The feedback received from High Horse Entertainment has been so positive as to induce the study to refine the basic mechanics of the game, while implementing a multiplayer mode both locally and online for up to four players. The final version is available from March 7 on PC and PlayStation 4, at a price of 14.99 euros. However, subscribers to the PlayStation Plus service have the opportunity to download it, at no additional cost, throughout the month of March. Disc Jam is immediate and very entertaining, but for now it is still poor in content Playstation 4 trophies There are only twelve Trophies for Disc Jam and they are quite simple to unlock. Some involve completing tutorials and winning a match in singles and doubles, others involve winning at least one match as each of the four available characters. The only objective that requires a little more time to be completed, however, is the one that plans to conquer at least 50 online meetings. Alternative sport Just like the title from which it draws inspiration, Disc Jam is based on an imaginary sport, which combines tennis and air hockey in a bizarre way. Unlike what happened in Windjammers, where the camera was placed above the playing field, in this case the view is behind the player, as it happens in classic tennis games. The contenders have to throw a disc similar to a frisbee, with the aim of overcoming the opponent and hitting the wall positioned behind him; alternatively, however, it is possible to induce the other player into error, preventing him from regaining possession of the puck before it touches the ground. To win a single frame you must reach the threshold of 50 points, however the score will vary according to the duration and intensity of the exchange that has just ended. The play structure is rather immediate overall, nevertheless there are two tutorials available that allow you to become more familiar with the basic controls and more advanced attack techniques. The offensive strategies are full of solutions, since it is possible to exploit the bank game, resort to the lob or short ball, or even fall back on the unpredictable parable shots to be scored with the pressure of the right or left trigger of the pad. In addition to the attack strategy and the need to steal time from the opponent, exactly as it would happen in a tennis match, what matters most is above all the speed of releasing the puck. In fact, there are three different speeds of execution, which are marked by a trail of white, blue or pink; the latter indicates perfect timing and allows you to generate a hit with a greater probability of success. The most successful part of Disc Jam concerns the variety of possible interactions, which will be even more tangible after practicing on the field. There are, for example, the Super Throws, the charged attacks that are activated after recovering a lob with the right timing, or after parrying a blow with the help of a shield. And if offensive strategies play an important role, the defensive phase is no less thanks to the use of the slide. With due care it is in fact possible to effectively cover the entire playing area and go on to counterattack with continuity. In summary, Disc Jam enjoys a more than convincing interaction, immediate in its basic structure but with margins for refinement that pass through the correct management of advanced techniques. A further point in favor, not at all obvious, is covered by the fluidity of execution, capable ofi make every match frenetic at the right point and even more fun to experience whenever the exchanges get long and tight. Looking for variety If from the point of view of the mechanics Disc Jam proves to know his stuff, the variety of selectable game modes proved to be decidedly less convincing. With the exception of one-on-one clashes and doubles matches, which can be played both locally and in online multiplayer, there is in fact nothing else that justifies the continuation of the experience after the completion of some matches. For example, it would have been interesting to be able to take part in more structured competitions, perhaps giving the possibility of accessing a global rank based on the performances obtained online. Obvious gaps also embrace the quantity of selectable characters, for now limited to only four alternatives. From this point of view, there are also some balancing problems, since Gator and Makenna seem overall more effective to exploit than Stanton and Haruka. Unfortunately Disc Jam also lacks in terms of rewards and unlockable items. After having accumulated a sufficient amount of money, in fact, it is possible to access the slot machine and collect skins, celebrations and victory poses, but these are mostly materials of little use. The matchmaking proved to be decidedly more satisfactory which, net of some sporadic waiting, seemed to work as it should. Nothing to complain about online game sessions either, always fluid both in single matches and in doubles matches.", "date": "2017-03-14", "grade": "7.5"}
