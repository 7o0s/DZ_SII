{"name": "Road 96 Mile 0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/road-96-mile-0-recensione.html", "text": "The stories of Road 96's teenage emigrants, poised between escape and hope, have remained engraved in the hearts of many players. Produced by the French studio DigixArt, the narrative adventure set in Petria, published in 2021, had conquered the public thanks to a happy mix of roguelike dynamics and procedurality in the structure of the various game sections (with a clear inspiration from ~narrative Lego blocks~ theorized by Ken Levine). The team returns to travel the dusty roads marked by the dictatorial regime of Tyrak with a prequel focused on Zoe, well known to Road 96 players, and Kaito, familiar to those who appreciated the very first production of the Montpellier studio, Lost in Harmony. In our opinion, it was not a happy marriage: the plot of Road 96 Mile 0 soon finds itself entangled in some forced choices due to its nature as a prequel to Road 96, and the gameplay, focused on dialogue choices and sections rhythm game, cannot find a clear center of gravity around which to develop clear and coherent playful reasoning. The result is a rather confused production in terms of intent and unsuccessful from the point of view of execution, unable to catalyze the emotions and attention of the players, while presenting some high-impact choices in the direction of some of his roller and skateboard routes at music time. We tell you about all these aspects in detail in our review of Road 96 Mile 0. The strange couple Zoe and Kaito, protagonists of Road 96 Mile 0, are two old acquaintances for fans of video games produced by DigixArt Road 96 Mile 0 opens with one of the broadcasts by Sonya Sanchez, Petria's only reporter. In the episode of GNN Special shown at the beginning of the adventure, Sonya is in White Sands, an exclusive residential neighborhood that houses, among others, also her and President Tyrak, as well as the families of the various ministers. Zoe, daughter of the Oil Minister, also lives in White Sands; her friend Kaito, on the other hand, resides with his parents in Tyrak Square, destined for the homes of the working class who lead the luxurious lives of the area's more affluent inhabitants. Both Zoe and Kaito have elements ~inherited~ from their previous video game appearances developed by DigixArt: Zoe never separates from her trusty trombone (protagonist of one of the most memorable sections of Road 96), while Kaito has not yet come to terms with the loss of his friend Aya, a central character in Lost in Harmony, dead too soon for a cancer caused by the very high air pollution of Petria. Kaito, a young rebel, questions the certainties of Zoe, scion of one of the most high-ranking families in Petria: this aspect assumes prominence in a special bar, always present in the upper left corner of the screen, which shows the orientation of the protagonists towards the revolution or adherence to the totalitarian regime in force in the country. During the adventure we are often faced with narrative choices that condition some events in the game plot and lead to various endings, encouraging a new game after the completion, in about four hours, of the first run of Road 96 Mile 0: on the contrary of what happened in Road 96, however, the narrative branches are very few and remain inscribed in a very specific scheme, aimed at putting Zoe in a particular relevant condition in the Road 96 plot. Overall, this prequel fails to field a wide-ranging story: the developers' intention to create a more contained and less ambitious product from a narrative point of view is clear, but in Road 96 Mile 0 we are faced with a plot that does not excite and does not surprise. Many of the characters already seen in Road 96 return in sometimes pleasant cameos, but Zoe and Kaito remain, for the duration of their journey, two rather stereotyped and plastered characters. The unfortunate management of their points of view doesn't help: in some moments we find ourselves impersonating Zoe, in others Kaito, and if a ~mute~ protagonist worked very well in Road 96 - where we found ourselves living the adventures, in sequence, of more anonymous emigrants - the same cannot be said in this prequel, in which the alternation between the two characters leads us to the strange sensation of having to abandon, in turn, the control (albeit partial) of their emotions and reactions, returning them to the guide of the team, in a framework that overall does not always remain cohesive and coherent. Then there are some absolutely surreal narrative tricks, aimed at carrying out a very difficult mission that will be carried out by the duo towards the end of the adventure, with the price of seriously endangering the foundations of a plot that would like to mmaintain a certain suspension of disbelief. Music rides Road 96 Mile 0 is characterized above all by its rhythm game sections, aimed at bringing into play the emotions of the protagonists Zoe and Kaito As was also the case in Road 96, DigixArt brings into play various mini-games during the adventure: ranging from building a wooden ramp by hammering nails into the planks, moving on to violently throwing propaganda newspapers at passers-by, up to tampering with electrical switchboards to sabotage a soporific tai chi class. None of these activities reaches such a complexity as to engage the player in depth, and unfortunately this also applies to the rhythm game sections that bring Road 96 Mile 0 closer to Lost in Harmony. We specify, however, that in our opinion the main source of inspiration of the team was the fulminant Sayonara Wild Hearts, undoubtedly one of the most phenomenal rhythm games of recent years. Compared to the Swedish production, the title developed by DigixArt leverages more varied sounds, and the soundtrack is partly licensed (~No Brakes~ by The Offspring is one of the pieces present) and partly produced specifically for Road 96 Mile 0 We are not faced with an ~interactive album~, therefore, but with pieces aimed at expressing, according to the cases, the emotions of Zoe and Kaito - both alternately controlled by the player - in particular moments of the plot, without a red thread that connect all songs. There are also crossroads that have repercussions from a narrative point of view, going to influence the bar of the convictions of the protagonists we mentioned earlier; there is the possibility to review your choices by replaying the levels as many times as you want, selecting them directly from the main menu, also - if you want - to improve your final evaluation, based on the number of deaths and gems collected. Kaito finds himself dealing with the ghosts of his past, but the plot developed by DigixArt fails to fully leverage the emotions of the players Overall, we were disappointed with the team's work musically: the instantly recognizable and whistleable sounds of Road 96 are missing, and the amalgamation here is muddled and lacking in clear direction. The main problem of the musical levels traveled by the two teenagers (Zoe uses rollerblades, Kaito a skateboard) can be found in the frequent interruptions of the gameplay with predefined sequences that show particular events in the setting. It may be the collapse of a statue of Tyrak, or the actions of our uncontrolled supporting actor at the moment, but in any case there is a caesura that prevents the player from reaching that rhythm which is central to any self-respecting rhythm game. In this sense, Sayonara Wild Hearts is a virtuous example, not followed, however, by DigixArt in their Road 96 Mile 0. Some good aesthetic intuitions and directing solutions, and the idea of introducing, in addition to the mechanics of collecting gems moving on the path, even jumps, small quick time events and other tricks to invite an all-round interaction with the various elements of the scenario, but the execution remains excessively fragmented and, in some cases, marred by important bugs: in two sections we were unable to perform the jump (essential, in those situations, to overcome obstacles on the way) and we were forced to make use of the option to skip those portions of the level completely, a possibility presented to the player after a few deaths ( that have an impact on the final evaluation). In other words, you never reach the adrenaline and synesthetic power that is typical of the most successful rhythm games on the market. An aesthetic in continuity with Road 96 Many returning characters familiar to those who played Road 96: journalist Sonya Sanchez is among them From a graphic point of view, the production of DigixArt takes what was done in Road 96 and aims to rough it up and clean it up, with a final effect that overall can be said to be very successful. Beyond some minor graphic glitches, the improvement is perceptible, but despite this we found ourselves faced with some truly incomprehensible artistic choices: on several occasions, even the most intense dialogues take place with impassive facial expressions and with a visible of detachment, eliminating the emotional impact of conversations even relating to very delicate topics. Furthermore, the technical sector prepared by the team is certainly not one that puts the hardware of the new generation consoles to the whip, but despite this we were faced with uploads of non-negligible duration also on PlayStation 5, although they have been rethe procedural generation elements of the narrative segments seen in Road 96 have moved. Finally, we point out a discreet dubbing in English and the excellent translation into Italian.", "date": "2023-04-04", "grade": "5.5"}
