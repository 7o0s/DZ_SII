{"name": "Assalto nel buio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/116363-the-walking-dead-assault-assalto-nel-buio.html", "text": "The theme of zombies has been the protagonist for some years of a boom that shows no sign of ending and which has been ridden, among others, also by Robert Kirkman, author of the famous comic strip ~The Walking Dead~. The Skybound experience starts right from the pages of the comics, which brings to iOS devices a different tie-in from what could have been the users' expectations, not only characterized by a graphic style that strongly follows the cartoons of a graphic novel, both as regards the cinematic sequences and the in-game action, but also from a gameplay that draws heavily on the RTS genre to give us a product with a very different feeling from twin analog shooters like Dead Nation, to mention a title which shares the same setting as The Walking Dead: Assault. The characters available in the game each have different weapons and abilities, a variable range within which to spot any enemies and attack them automatically, but above all they move on the screen according to the rules of ~indirect~ control, with a long touch to move the whole group (which can consist of up to four elements) and a double tap to move only the selected unit. Against them three types of zombies: the ~walkers~, the most numerous, who move slowly and do not have particular resistance; the ~lurkers~, who generally remain stationary in a certain point on the map but, once alerted, dash at humans; the ~roamers~, who roam the streets seemingly aimlessly, but are also the hardest to bring down. Kill the dead Although in the early stages the doubt that there is something deeper in the structure of The Walking Dead: Assault creeps in, beyond sporadic variations the missions all focus on the same goal: to eliminate all zombies from the stage, flushing them out if necessary. The strategic value of the experience is combined with its degree of difficulty, on average high, but above all with a control system that leaves a lot to be desired: there were certainly better ways to manage a team or individual parts, and the solution adopted by the developers often turns out to be too slow and cumbersome to protect us from sudden sorties and eventful situations. To bring home the result, it is therefore necessary to move around the map with great caution, evaluate the presence of possible herds of undead and only then consider a direct approach, being however attentive to the different sensitivities of the characters: one of them could allow you to approach tactical, while maybe another has a large range and will start shooting, attracting more zombies. We greatly appreciated the characterization of the survivors, for once very different and therefore selectable for the team on the basis of their abilities (normal and special), as well as the implementation of a well-balanced upgrade system, which on the basis of the points collected allows you to improve power, endurance, magazine capacity and adrenaline level. The point, as already mentioned, is that maybe more valid and immediate alternatives could be found to make the experience not only difficult and fascinating, but also much less cumbersome.", "date": "2013-03-25", "grade": "7.7"}
