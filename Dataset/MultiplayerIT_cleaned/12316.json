{"name": "God of War II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-of-war-ii-recensione.html", "text": "Kratos vs. Zeus The plot played a fundamental role in the first chapter of the saga, and obviously this sequel does not want to be outdone. Those who have played and completed GOW will surely remember how the protagonist, Kratos, defeated the god of war Ares, thus taking his place on Mount Olympus alongside the other deities. Intoxicated by the thirst for power, however, Kratos follows an extremely violent conduct, leading the Spartan army to conquer every city in the known world, without mercy in the face of anything or anyone. Unable to tolerate this fate, the gods of Olympus, starting with Athena and Zeus, turn their backs on him, and with a ruse the latter finally manages to kill him. Luckily for Kratos, however, before sinking into Hades he is helped by Gaia and the people of the Titans, a race that ruled the world before being subjugated by the Greek gods. Gaia therefore suggests to the hero a method to be able to change his destiny, but obviously the path to reach this goal is destined to be long and full of dangers. This is therefore the incipit and the leitmotif of the new SCEA adventure, for a title that does not have the will to deviate particularly from the first episode as regards the game mechanics. As already stated, the focus of God of War II is the fight, in this case against a huge amount of creatures obviously inspired by Greek mythology; so here are cyclops, jellyfish, infernal dogs, minotaurs, three-headed monsters and so on with a truly enviable bestiary. At the same time the PS2 title often intersects its history with several classic characters that each of us has studied at school, such as Pegasus, Perseus, Icarus just to name a few. A choice, that of the setting, of incredible charm and extraordinary emotional grip, capable of exalting the player with practically no drop in tension from start to finish. But we said of the combat system, which has remained largely unchanged compared to what was appreciated with God of War; while using almost all the keys of the Dual Shock, including the second analog stick, the work done in this sense by the American programmers is truly excellent, guaranteeing perfect control of the character together with a more than satisfactory depth. Of course it is undoubtedly true that to a large extent everything can be traced back to a furious ~button mashing~, but frankly we find that the SCEA production has in this sense found an ideal meeting point between immediacy and authentic awareness that what the protagonist does on screen is exactly what the experienced gamer wants it to do. Button mashing yes then, but with intelligence. Obviously the violence factor has not been limited at all, but rather even amplified; the clashes, in addition to being seasoned with an abundant amount of blood, on the occasion of the toughest and most imposing enemies can be closed with scripted sequences, activated by pressing the keys suggested on the screen, which greatly enhance the extreme cruelty and rawness of the majestic Kratos. The novelties are therefore mainly to be found in the unpublished spells and weapons present in this second chapter, such as for example the enormous hammer, which is as slow as it is devastating. However, it is clear that the best result is obtained with the protagonist's basic weapon, the double blade, with which Kratos himself seems to be more comfortable; similarly the spells, while far from representing a foreign element, almost never manage to constitute a truly integral and fundamental part of the already described combat system, which evidently finds its reason for existing in hand-to-hand combat. An absolute novelty is instead represented by the -few- flight sequences riding winged creatures (and not only), which constitute an appreciable diversion to break up the action as well as yet another opportunity to allow Kratos to eliminate enemies in the bloodiest way possible . The taste of revenge Creating a great game is difficult, but being able to repeat itself on equal levels even with sequels is even more difficult. In this key for God of War II it was vitally important to be able to offer a level design that was at least as exciting and well-studied as that of the progenitor. Fortunately, that's exactly how things went, and the adventure demonstrates in every moment a cleanliness, solidity and coherence that only masterpieces are able to restore. The hours of play in the SCEA production flow away in such a sensationally fluid and satisfying way that being able to turn off the console is always a real feat; the constant supply of new stimuli, of skills and possibilities dosed to perfection is incredible, ein the same way the puzzles present, better than those of the first episode, manage in most cases to be neither so trivial as to offend the player's intelligence, nor demanding to the point of interrupting the natural progression of the adventure. The clashes with the bosses are also fundamental, which always come at the end of a climax that amplifies their impact, already more than marked in itself given the often and willingly enormous dimensions of the same. Everything in God of War II seems to be in the right place, quite simply, and even the overall length of around 12 hours is a satisfactory point of balance, without ever giving the impression of watering down passages just to increase the longevity by a few tens of minutes total. Obviously a product of such all-round quality could not fail to rest on a top-level technical component; and in fact it is easy to say that we are faced with one of the best productions ever for PS2, if not the best. The graphic engine of the first episode has been further cleaned up and improved, and above all being able to enjoy the 16:9 combination plus progressive scan at 480p (in the NTSC version), God of War II offers an aesthetic rendering that goes from excellent to incredible , so much so that on some occasions it can be doubted that everything runs on obsolete hardware like that of the Sony monolith. The goodness of textures, light effects, animations and polygonal models simply cannot lend itself to any criticism. And the sound is also colossal, with an orchestrated accompaniment that really contributes as a protagonist to the emotional involvement of the adventure. The dubbing of the American version is at the level of the best Hollywood films. The pal adaptation of the game enjoys the Italian translation both as regards texts and dubbing, generally of a good level, while unfortunately we must denote the absence of the progressive scan option, which makes the game slightly less defined and more jagged on LCD screens , while leaving the yield on the CRT ones intact. Comment All right, God of War II does not differ much from the first chapter, proposing on the contrary an almost unchanged game mechanic. Nonetheless, where it does not surprise in innovation, Sony production leaves you speechless for the absolute quality that shines through from every single aspect. Graphically stunning, with simply perfect pacing and gameplay that sets new standards for action games, God of War II is a title that anyone, without exception, should rush out to buy. Pros A game with no real flaws Perfect control system Technically incredible Cons Few substantial new features Extra Mon Amour Also from the point of view of the extras and bonuses present, God of War II is confirmed as a well-finished product to say the least. Let's start from the second DVD in the extended package, which contains a documentary capable of revealing most of the secrets and curiosities behind the project in question; so here are interviews with the developers, making of, cut scenes and levels, explanation of settings and characters and so on. An extremely interesting and welcome addition, which will please anyone who wants to find out what is ~behind~ a video game of this caliber. From the purely playful side however, completing Kratos' adventure will allow you to unlock the Challenge of the Titans, divided into 7 rooms in which to try to get the best rating to receive other bonuses. Furthermore, by respecting certain conditions, for example finishing the game at various difficulty levels but not only, it will be possible to choose different costumes (7 in total) with a function not only aesthetic but also to modify the characteristics of the hero. Lastly, the urns must be mentioned, i.e. well-hidden objects during the game and capable of offering Kratos additional particularly useful powers. SCEA's God of War was one of the most sensational and brilliant examples of a great game that hit stores ~under the radar~; little followed by the specialized press and consequently by the public, created by a team like that of Santa Monica, yes competent but not of great appeal (at the time), overshadowed during its development by other productions capable of attracting more attention, the The work directed by the brilliant David Jaffe hit the world of video games with enormous impact, offering a title with simply excellent overall quality. An action game centered around exhilarating fights but also seasoned with a good dose of puzzles, strengthened by a first-rate audiovisual component and literally imbued with a dose of violence out of the ordinary, God of War thus managed to establish itself universally as one of the bestthe titles ever for PS2. And now that the next-gen has practically passed the running-in phase and is starting to fully express its enormous potential, God of War II is entrusted with the task of closing the splendid career of Sony's black monolith in the most brilliant way possible.", "date": "2007-05-03", "grade": null}
