It is in fact a study with a fairly small staff, whose past experiences are divided between titles for Android and iOS, with an escapade on Nintendo 3DS. Impact Winter is therefore the first game that these British developers bring to our monitors, immediately aiming for a particularly inflated genre in the PC environment: that of survival. Those who have read our evidence from the past few months will know what it is: Impact Winter puts us in the shoes of a group of survivors, busy trying to keep going after a catastrophic event that put the Earth in front of an extraordinarily long and harsh winter . So put on your heaviest jacket, because where we're going it's really cold! Odds Snow, snow and more snow: surviving thirty days in Impact Winter is the stuff of real tough guys Like dinosaurs The event imagined by Mojo Bones to tell the facts of Impact Winter is the same that is supposed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs many years ago, namely the impact of an asteroid on our planet. As previously mentioned, Impact Winter is nothing more than the English name of the so-called ~impact winter~, characterized by a significant drop in temperatures accompanied by atmospheric events capable of distorting the appearance of the Earth. The place where we find ourselves is the small town of Brandon, in the Canadian province of Manitoba, to play the role of Jacob Salomon, someone who lived hand to mouth twelve months of winter before running into a group of other people who did of a church completely buried by snow their house. Thanks to the use of a special drone, which we will know shortly, the group intercepts a signal according to which the long-awaited help will arrive in thirty days, thus putting an end to a situation constantly lived on the edge of the abyss. Surviving while around everything is buried by meters of snow is not easy at all, but luckily Jacob can count on a rather valid group of misfortune colleagues. In fact, with him there is Wendy, an elderly lady with knowledge in medicine and skills in the kitchen, accompanied by Maggie, a skilled mechanic capable of building improvements for the shelter. Blane is the survival expert outside, while Christophe is the youngest of the group: a technology expert, to whom we owe the operation of the Ako-Light drone, Jacob's inseparable companion during his sorties outside the church . As leader of the quintet, the protagonist is in fact the one who carries out the tasks in what is called Void, which we will discuss later. The specializations of the non-playable characters give rise to what in Impact Winter are called ~ways~: these are quest lines, mainly linked to the procurement of materials necessary to obtain a certain improvement in one of the areas mentioned above. By helping Christophe, for example, you get a more efficient Ako-Light you can count on, while by helping Wendy she will have a better chance of being able to keep the survivors alive. Having a defined interval of time at his disposal, the player must decide what to invest his efforts in, focusing on the aspects that he thinks may be more suitable for his style of play. Regardless of the way in which one decides to get to the end, the group must naturally be fed and kept in both physical and mental health, on pain of death or abandonment by a member with all the consequences this can have on the collaboration between the characters. A fundamental aspect for success in Impact Winter, on which the player can intervene by also assigning specific roles to group members. Shorten the wait From the initial moment Ako-Light intercepts the aforementioned signal, the thirty days becomes the goal for the player to aim for in Impact Winter. Luckily for him and for us too, Jacob can accumulate Rescue Points, thanks to which he can decrease the countdown by a certain number of hours at a time, thus reducing the actual wait for rescue. These are more or less experience points, which can be accumulated by completing the missions proposed by the other people who live in the church, or by performing specific actions such as activating the radio stations present in the Void. In addition to the management of material and human resources, the gaming experience offered by Impact Winter is based on the missions carried out by Jacob outside, in a decidedly hostile environment. The matsmaterials that we can find around are really many, just as their use is often divided into several areas: walking around houses, service stations and other buildings, one soon realizes the amount of loot that it is possible to take home, however finding oneself forced to make choices dictated by a reduced inventory size. Particular improvements to Jacob's equipment promise to solve the problem, but before having them available the player has to work hard, going back and forth several times to bring everything that is needed into the church. A slightly larger inventory from the outset certainly wouldn't have hurt. In addition to supplies, in the Void it is also possible to find strangers who offer us rewards (and Rescue Points) in exchange for help, in missions that have actually proved to be quite repetitive among themselves. The so-called Nomads represent a group of particular characters, with whom it is mainly possible to trade using the currency they accept: plant seeds. When we don't find around a necessary element to build an object we need, such help can be fundamental. Crafting, as mentioned, is linked to the other characters that make up the group: Blane, for example, can equip us with various types of traps to capture animals, while a dish prepared by Wendy has a much greater impact on the parameters of the troop than yet another meal of canned beans. The external environment obviously also brings with it dangers, represented in the first place by the cold. In fact, the weather situation can change at any moment, reaching temperatures that are prohibitive for survival, which is why Jacob must soon be able to equip himself with the right countermeasures to be able to stay outdoors long enough. Thieves will also occur in the church from time to time, the effects of which may be tied to specific roles assigned to our group members. Some problems Ever since our first direct encounter with Impact Winter, among our concerns have been the issues that the builds we've seen have suffered from. The same code made available to us for review, although not one hundred percent definitive, has obvious shortcomings in technical terms, starting with a control system that is acceptable only with the use of a controller, even better if an Xbox. The sensitivity we were talking about in the last test seems to behave in a somewhat alternating way, between Jacob's involuntary movements and buttons that once pressed do not immediately activate the corresponding action. We also point out the presence of quite important loads when switching from one environment to another, and some bugs that have different impacts on the gaming experience. In fact, we happened to see a character moving around the church in a lying position, as if he were sleeping, which, in addition to eliciting a smile, does not create problems. Far more annoying was the moment in which it was not possible to interact with any member of the group, except by going out and back in the shelter, thus supporting the double loading. Same type of situation in front of one of the people who are outside, with which it was not possible to interact in any way despite the classic exclamation mark on his head. Problems aside, as far as the map is concerned, we don't have the exact dimensions, but the impression one gets is that of being in a rather large area. While it is feasible to give variety to a region covered by meters of snow, there are various activities and points of interest around, which open up to the player a series of interesting choices that can make every game of Impact Winter different. Passing the thirty days takes about ten hours, but the final account is able to vary significantly depending on the game strategy implemented and the results obtained through it. In terms of visual impact, the aspect that impresses the most is the constant blizzard that rages in the Void, represented very well by the guys from Mojo Bones. Good results also with the interiors, even if the houses that you go to explore have a certain sense of familiarity with each other.
