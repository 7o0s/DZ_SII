Talking about graphics, just to be clear, is practically an obligation in any case, and it is a main component in the overall economy of a title. Although it is certainly not the first to attempt an alternative route, the Canadian RAC7 team, made up of only two people, wanted to turn this axiom inside out by placing sound and hearing as the cornerstones of the adventure, and building on the basis of this premise a horror-tinged game among the most original and interesting to appear in the mobile sector in recent months. Dark Echo overturns the classic canons of video games by offering an original and immersive adventure Different Dark Echo is so stylized and minimal that it is initially at least perplexing. All that appears on the completely black screen is a pair of shoe prints representing the protagonist. The feet, and not the whole body or the head, because it is precisely one's steps that constitute the only tool available for navigating within the levels and for interacting with them. Each of the eighty stages is set in a kind of labyrinth, more or less complex, observed from above. Touching anywhere on the screen makes your alter ego move in that direction, and at the same time generates the release of sound waves (or rather, rays) of the noise of your footsteps. Possibly it is also possible to make a louder noise, by holding down briefly on one's footprints, so as to extend the area of action. These rays, banging and bouncing against the walls, practically allow us to understand the shape of rooms and corridors and possibly of what populates them, so as to actually allow us to have a perception (but not total awareness ) of what surrounds us. However, this perception is not only temporary but also limited, because it only concerns the points up to which the sound of one's footsteps can reach. This inevitably determines the fact that Dark Echo is an anxiety-inducing, claustrophobic and disturbing experience, since it is never possible to know what is present on one's path if not a few steps away from it. In fact, the survival horror key manifests itself with the appearance of the first evil creatures, also with unknown shapes but recognizable by the fact that they are surrounded by red rays. To say that it is best to avoid any close encounters is an understatement, since not having any type of weapon available, their contact leads to immediate death. In the total darkness of the Dark Echo levels, even these beings can however rely only on hearing, and consequently it is necessary to avoid making any noise in their presence that could alert them. That's right, just those noises you need to be able to orient yourself. In such cases it is therefore necessary to proceed with soft and light steps, with small and rapid touches on the screen, so as not to arouse any attention. And if that weren't enough, you can also try throwing a stone to act as a bait and draw their attention away from the protagonist. All this until the exit of the level is reached, a real relief which however lasts the space of an instant, or rather the time to start the next area. It is therefore easy to understand how Dark Echo is made up of just a few ingredients, but inserted within a structure studied with exceptional balance and consistency: faced in ideal conditions, perhaps in the dark and with a pair of headphones, the title of RAC7 is in fact a title of great depth, capable of involving and disturbing, in which the very few audiovisual elements available are naturally completed and compensated by the player's imagination. All in all, a natural task, because the Canadian guys have been very good at compensating with sounds for what is not openly shown visually. For example, footsteps do not always make the same noise, but reflect the surface trampled on: a cold marble floor or rather gravelly ground, or even a pond inhabited by a croaking frog, while a drop of water falls from the ceiling of a sort of cave water at a regular pace. A few less successful parentheses and some drops in pace do not however compromise the final value of the game.", "date": "2015-03-27", "grade": "8.5"}
