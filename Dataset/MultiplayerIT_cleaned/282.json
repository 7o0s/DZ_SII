{"name": "Fifa 07 Xbox 360 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-07-xbox-360-recensione.html", "text": "All-round game mode Taking a look at the game modes provided, we find the reconfirmation of the challenge, which offers a series of matches with different objectives, such as scoring with a substitute who entered the second half, reaching extra time, winning with a certain margin, and so on , guaranteeing quite a few games outside the usual schemes. There is also a Coach mode, in which we will be able to manage a team for a few seasons trying to improve the shape of our players, refine training techniques, get noticed internationally and take care of a series of typical aspects of the various football managers, reproduced in quite intuitive way. The Fifa Party mode, on the other hand, is among those that best suit the title if played together with another friend, live or not. In practice, a series of mini tournaments can be organized, with the possibility of adding interesting parameters, such as random teams, assigning various penalties or bonuses to players, for example starting with one or more yellow cards, energy that does not decrease and so on . Go-go control The control method has been confirmed with respect to the latest editions, with the possibility of choosing the new analog which in practice offers the same mapping of controls seen in Pro Evolution Soccer. Controlling the character via the left analog stick is very important when it comes to dribbling. The different pressure of the stick combined with the run button are the factors that more than any other will influence our performance in Fifa. Always playing with maximum speed, counterattack aside, is never the best solution against defenders. The right analog stick also controls the relative feints available to the best players. In Fifa 07 there are no keys dedicated to combos, but the situation is more similar to reality than you might imagine. Only players with suitable characteristics can guarantee a series of effective and personalized feints. But the game? With Fifa we are faced with a good balance between more or less realistic aspects, and their implementation more oriented towards an arcade style of play, easy to learn from the first games, rather than a more simulative rendering. The results are certainly good, thanks to the new physics management, a balancing of the controls relating to the passes, now no longer so guided and linked to pressing the button to direct the ball towards more distant teammates, and above all a new series of animations for the players. It should be noted that the effectiveness of the deep passes was limited, compared to the previous edition, in which they almost always freed the attackers from the cpu markings. The three types of shots, power, precision or lob, combined with the possibility of modifying the assistance of the cpu, are well integrated within the game, the main limitation of which is the difficulty of making powerful low shots. Other details to highlight are a more complete realization of penalties with the possibility of moving the goalkeeper on the line, making precision shots or even the spoon with relative ad hoc animation. Among the various changes in this edition there is also a different fatigue of the players, linked in particular to the resistance characteristics of the character, and whose management between the various consecutive games becomes fundamental during the seasons as a coach. Polygons and Animations. From a technical point of view, Fifa 07 does not struggle to earn the palm of the best in the sector. In both close-ups and farther shots, the comparison with other football titles is won hands down, with one exception. The modeling of the faces, however well done from a graphic point of view, on many occasions does not return the true appearance of the players. In the game there are no aliasing defects and the frame rate does not create problems during games. Obviously the latter has also been improved in the player Vs goalkeeper interlude mode, compared to the demo released on the marketplace. The realization of the audience in the stadiums and the lighting system is also decidedly improved, while not being realistic to the maximum, it returns a good graphic impact. Among the most successful new entries in the technical department is the aforementioned new animation system, which guarantees a better rendering of movements even in particular situations, such as in changes of direction, in aerial play or in recoveries from behind. The new default cameras offer a good compromise between game vision, control precision and visible graphic detail quality, obviously the wide field camera is present to offer the greatestor viewing angle possible. Polygons and Animations. The Physics exam.. The physics of the ball has been rewritten from scratch and the results can be seen, now the rebounds on the ground are much more realistic, as well as the various effects on the ball during game tackles are more accurate. As a negative side, unfortunately the sudden accelerations that can be given to the ball after some particular shots have remained. Accelerations that certainly don't belong to a regular soccer ball, but rather recall matches with the old super-teles. Furthermore, one of the most evident shortcomings is the absence of different weather conditions such as rain or snow, which could have significantly influenced the reactions of the ball or the players. World champions ! The in-game sound effects, such as the ambient ones of the choirs inside the stadium, are well implemented, like the rich series of audio tracks that form the soundtrack of Fifa 07. A small gem for the Italian version, is represented by the radio clip 102.5 which comments on the ~live~ joke of the penalties of a certain Italy VS France last July. One of the negative sides of the sound unfortunately concerns the commentary, decidedly inadequate in terms of completeness of sentences and type of realization. The voices are of the excellent Caressa and Bergomi, but there will be more wrong sentences than those inserted at the right moment of the commentary. Artificial and human intelligence. The artificial intelligence of the CPU has been improved compared to the past, while still not proving to be without defects in certain game situations. Like the management of the attack phases in single player games, which in the non-advanced difficulty levels, leads the CPU to very long personal actions, rather than seeking help from teammates. A negative side of the AI can also be found in some decisions made by the referees, which are not always consistent with the type and extent of the tackles during the matches. The controversial nature towards the referee system typical of the Italian football fan will probably continue within Fifa 07. Online support has been set at four players, with the possibility of playing 2 vs 2 co-op matches, together with our friends. During our tests we also found a good implementation of Live multiplayer, with little lag when controlling characters. Among the aspects that must be remembered regarding live support, we cannot forget the possibility of controlling the progress of our real teams, through the relative connection to the EA databases, updated almost in real time with the various statistics of the current championships. Furthermore, the possibility of updating the squads after the winter markets via Xbox Live, a feature that has not been possible to test for obvious reasons, could prove to be very apt. Goals There are 11 objectives and the classic 1000 points to be unlocked are divided. Those who assign the most, 200, are a win of 300 games, it is probably the most demanding of all, which involves being unbeaten for a whole season as a coach. The other objectives are certainly more in hand, but not easy to unlock for this. Comment Fifa 07 is the best version of EA's football in recent years. The changes introduced in the game mechanics are certainly important, unfortunately, however, like any high-level sports title, optimizations and balances are still needed. What is needed now is that EA maintains this basic structure to improve it further without other upheavals or revolutions. Overall, the Xbox 360 version, while lacking some features seen in the PC, Xbox and Ps2 editions, remains the most complete football title on Microsoft consoles, thanks to the different game modes, the well-exploited licenses, the graphic aspect and the Xbox Live support. If in the past years the comparison between PES and Fifa was clearly against the latter, this gap has largely been filled, making the EA title a good alternative Pro Appreciable new features introduced Good Graphic department Different game modes Against AI from review Some features not included in the next gen version Commentary to forget Gameplay and mechanics still to be perfected New year, new Fifa, and this time the changes introduced are many and welcome. For some time now, more or less since 1999, the various editions of Fifa have been created from an always different starting point, with the aim of redeeming the title of best football among the various platforms. Also on this occasion the philosophy has not changed, Fifa is reborn from its ashes, once again restructured in thisasi all sectors. The difference with the past lies in the result, EA has managed to find a framework worthy of competing with Konami's productions. On the other hand, as in all renovations from scratch, there are negative sides that need to be improved. The hope is that the development team realizes this and that, for the next attempts, they keep the foundations of Fifa '07 and work on its optimization. But let's go in order First of all, once Fifa 07 is loaded, you can create your own player profile with your favorite teams or leagues, as well as choosing the player during the loading time screens. Immediately afterwards you get to the mode and options selection menus which, unlike those inside the individual games, are well made and easy to navigate. All the teams present with their sponsors are reproduced using the official licenses. In total there are about 120 teams against the 500 of the old gen versions of Fifa 07. The difference is due to the different number of leagues in the Xbox360 version, due to lack of time EA had to make cuts in the modeling of the various teams, but the major leagues Europeans, like the most famous international teams, are all present, including Juventus.", "date": "2006-11-10", "grade": null}
