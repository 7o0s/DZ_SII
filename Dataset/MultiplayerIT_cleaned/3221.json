The developers of Spike Chunsoft did their best to create a title that was as faithful as possible to the starting manga and anime, and from the point of view of the idea in theory they did it: it was not easy to create an action / fighting game / RPG (all components linked to each other, as we will see) whose protagonist is invincible. The problem is that, good intentions aside, One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows becomes a forgettable production after less than an hour of play. And let's also see the reasons, then. The plot, the project, the protagonist The project revolving around One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows has been well thought out by the developers of Spike Chunsoft. Starting manga and anime have literally exploded in recent years, registering an extremely positive reception from readers: thanks to the charisma and originality of the protagonist hero, the unlikely and invincible Saitama. For the uninitiated, the Bald Mantellato is able to knock out any enemy, monster and mysterious creature who wants to threaten the Earth with a punch: a single punch, and without suffering the slightest damage. Now, you might rightly ask, how do you make a video game where the protagonist is invincible and super-powered? Even the trailers of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows immediately joked about Saitama, showing clashes in the typical fighting game interface that ended in just two seconds: the time for the hero to throw his deadly punch. Spike Chunsoft has however found a way to offer fans a product carefully studied on their needs, the first video game in the world dedicated specifically to Saitama and company. The first idea of the developers concerns the plot of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows, which follows the narration of the first season of the anime faithfully but in a parallel way, up to the clash with Scarab Asura and the House of Evolution. The player thus finds all the famous heroes of the starting work, from the unlikely to the most fitting ones within a video game that constantly oscillates between action and fighting game. And, of course, he meets Saitama himself, who rushes (but late) to save him from skirmishes with the most dangerous enemies, such as the one against Vaccine Man, and in general from the historical villains of the first season. You got it right: if Saitama runs to help the player, who is the protagonist hero of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows? An avatar. Yes, an avatar: as in Jump Force (and unfortunately the comparisons do not end there), as in Code Vein. Like the most recent titles published by Bandai Namco in recent years in which it seems that the absolute protagonist must necessarily be a creature created from scratch, the newcomer of the moment who will assert himself in the world until he becomes the hero everyone, necessarily, they need. And which, just to remain faithful, will be characterized by the annoying silence of all time. Editors and content The first twenty minutes of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows, as you may have understood, are taken away by the editor of the main character: the player can meticulously create his alter ego from scratch, customizing it in every aspect. Various side accessories will be unlocked through the main and side missions, without rushing. It is also possible to select a voice, which will then never be used except to emit guttural cries in combat: in short, the usual homework without any kind of improvement. This time, however, the editor also extends to the protagonist's home: a sort of deserted closet (at least initially) similar to that of Saitama in the anime. Even here, however, continuing in the main adventure it will be possible to obtain new furnishing objects, some particularly pretty, with which to customize it as desired. Others will be purchased in certain shops in the main city. Speaking instead of the contents, the main adventure of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows consists of a whole series of main and secondary missions. The player must complete them one at a time, moving from one to the other, and it will be impossible to lose the thread: the title, insistently and almost obsessively, will continue to send message after message and notification after notification explaining what to do, where, when and as. The most obnoxious character of all, Tutorial Man, will become your nightmare, because he will follow you everywhere like thistrying to read rivers of text, redundant messages which on balance there is no need, because the offer of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is reduced to: clashes with enemies, where it happens. By completing side quests, which include both one-time quests in the city and actual quests assigned by branches of the hero agency (in which you fight), the player unlocks the main quests of the Hero Association. These are also the so-called main quests that carry the main story forward: they allow you to face the ~real~ enemies of the franchise and generally require a little more effort than pressing all the keys at random at the same time. Approach that still allows you to get to the end credits almost always unscathed. By completing these missions, the player's hero rank will rise from C to S, offering (intention) increasingly satisfying battles. Playstation 4 trophies One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows offers a good amount of Trophies, also indicated on a special bulletin board in the main square of the game world. Getting the Platinum Trophy will require a lot of time and dedication, due to the grinding phases (friendship with secondary characters, missions to replay, experience points to earn) but not particular skills. Gameplay One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is a hybrid between action, fighting game and RPG, but you have to consider that while the first component stands out within the gameplay, the rest are limited to offering a general smattering of their mechanics Basic. When the player accepts a mission, he is launched into an arena similar to that of a fighting game, where the main aim is almost always to eliminate the opponent (or survive the timer on the screen). Commands, controls and combat system look like those of a fighting game, but a distantly simplified fighting game: in addition to sprint, defense, heavy and light attack, the heroes of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows can perform up to three powerful equipped special moves, each executable by pressing L2 + Triangle or Circle or Square. With L2 + X, on the other hand, the protagonist's aura is loaded, marked by a numerical indicator in the upper left corner. Game tutorials will often tend to emphasize the depth, the different style of each character, the many possible combinations: none of this will really help you, and even if present, don't expect the level of technicality offered by any real fighting game. Were it not for the underlying superficiality of the production, this wouldn't even be a bad thing, because it makes One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows suitable even for the little ones. A very particular positive side of the production is represented by the RPG component: each character can belong to several classes, one for each fighting style (from the balanced one of Saitama to the fighters who use weapons or specialize in brute force, and so on) ; moreover, by leveling up you get experience points to spend to enhance your alter ego, specializing it in one parameter rather than another. Even the special moves can be equipped and modified as needed, but first you will have to unlock them by continuing in the main storyline or by becoming friends (via side missions) with the other characters in the series. Silver Fang, Dolcetto Mask and Molla Mustache will be the first you will meet.", "date": "2020-02-28", "grade": "6.0"}
