{"name": "Need for Speed ProStreet - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-prostreet-recensione_a.html", "text": "If Electronic Arts has been one of the most authoritative voices in the video game market for years, the reason lies above all in its ability to renew its series over time. Need for Speed is now an integral part of the playroom of any gaming system, portable or otherwise, and is synonymous with high-speed arcade racing aboard extremely powerful racing cars. For this new episode, the developers were clearly inspired by the American underground scene, from clandestine races to extreme tuning, placing particular emphasis on the car / music combination in more than one respect. The Nintendo DS version of Need for Speed ProStreet doesn't shine in its use of the unique features of the dual-screen console, but on the other hand it offers lots and lots of substance. Gentlemen, start your engines! Once the game has started, we will be able to select the desired mode from ~Quick Race~, ~Career~, ~Multiplayer~, ~Race Day~ and ~Plumbing~. The latter is a novelty made exclusively for Nintendo DS, which is unlocked during the ~Career~ and sees us compete in a real rhythm game on the notes of the songs that make up the NFS ProStreet soundtrack. The operation is very simple: while in the background our car activates its motorized shock absorbers to ~dance~, we must press the main console buttons when the relative icon arrives in the center of the screen. Unfortunately this is not a very successful application, on the contrary it is cumbersome and quite frustrating: probably involving the touch screen (see the fantastic Elite Beat Angels) would have produced much better results. Luckily, this new Need for Speed has other modes, perhaps less original but certainly distinguished by a higher quality: the ~Fast Race~ allows us to try our hand at a quick race, without wasting time with the options, while the ~Day of Race~ sees us create from scratch a course event consisting of several races, selectable from those already unlocked. The ~Multiplayer~ mode is the last of the ~outline~ ones, but it is also the most interesting: we can organize challenges with a friend (whether or not he has a copy of the game) or access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to participate in races for up to four players, battling against opponents from all over the world. The races played in this way work perfectly, without lag phenomena even in the presence of partially occupied bandwidth. And they are really engaging. The carreer As usual, it is the ~Career~ mode that contains the thickest elements of Need for Speed ProStreet. Once a profile has been created, we will start from the bottom and with little money, moving on the map of available events (which are unlocked as you win) to find the races in which the car is provided to us by the organizers and we don't have to pay for its repairs . Once we have collected a decent nest egg, we will be able to access the garage and buy the car we like best or simply the one we can afford, in order to then be able to participate in ~mixed~ races. There are various types of races in NFS ProStreet: the classic one, where you have to cross the finish line first, but also a large number of variations on the theme. For example, sometimes we will have to try to get the best time in the various sectors of a track, or start with a handicap compared to the opponents, make our car dance in the aforementioned ~Hydraulics~ mode or even participate in ~drift~ races in which almost more the drifts of the order of arrival. And then there's the ~heads up~, which in many ways is a game in itself: you have to warm up the tires and wait for the green light, then set off at full speed (using the nitro, of course) and change gears at the moment just to cover the distance that separates us from the finish line before our direct opponent. Each event represented on the map contains six different races to do on the same track: completing the first three results in a victory with relative prizes, but you can also choose to try your hand at the remaining races to absolutely dominate the race day. The surprising thing is that there are almost forty events, for a total of over two hundred single races... Extreme tuning! In Need for Speed ProStreet, modifying your car is not only a pleasant and fun practice, but also a necessary one: without the help of extra components, we'll really struggle to win in every race. From our garage we can access the complete list of accessories and kits that can be purchased, with projections relating to the improvements that each of them can make to the various characteristics of the vehicle. Tuning isn't limited to performance, though: we'll havefull freedom to change the car's paint, apply vinyls and figures (unfortunately you can't draw them directly), change the rims and apply spoilers worthy of the worst professional truzzo. The game The NFS ProStreet's driving pattern is clearly arcade-oriented, yet it does boast some thickness. The game action takes place on the upper screen of the DS, while on the lower one we can check the track map at any time with the position of the opponents, as well as the condition of our car. The default controls see the accelerator assigned to button A and the brake to button B, while the Y and X buttons are used respectively to operate the handbrake and the nitro (when present). The d-pad controls the direction of the car and the L and R back keys allow us to downshift or change gear (if we have chosen the manual gearbox). By pressing Start, we can access quick options including choosing the view from the three available: in first person, immediately behind the car or a little further away. They are all valid, therefore opting for one or the other will only be up to our personal tastes. On the track, we can choose the approach that best suits us for tackling the bends: brake early and keep a regular and clean trend, or steer sharply by releasing the accelerator and then pushing it and therefore performing a spectacular controlled skid, to cut the hairpin speed as high as possible. The car park available is quite large even if far from boundless, but when we save money to buy a new car we also have to take into account the modifications to be applied to make it competitive, which are fundamental in ProStreet: even a car equipped with excellent performance on the track can eat the dust compared to machines modified in a certain way, so it is not the case to change vehicle without first taking the necessary precautions. Technical realization As for the technical aspect, this new Electronic Arts title looks very good. The graphics run at thirty frames per second almost always fixed, the sensation of speed is good (when the nitro is activated it is further emphasized) and the locations are full of scenic elements capable of characterizing them. Unfortunately the polygonal models of the cars are ~flat~, practically without effects on the surfaces, and are able to give a good impression only when viewed from very close. Also, sometimes you see some pop-up effects on the track, even if it's a very slight thing, which affects only contour elements and never affects the rendering of the polygons. The soundtrack is signed, as per tradition for the series, and is composed of a selection of really good songs, unfortunately not very numerous. The control system does not exploit the touch screen in any way except for truly marginal functions, but it is immediate and effective; the d-pad, in particular, goes far beyond expectations in how it makes controlling the car easy and precise. We have already talked about online multiplayer: it works really well, without any problems, and guarantees hours of fun challenges. Comment Need for Speed ProStreet tries to have its say on the subject of ~racing games for Nintendo DS~, and does so with great authority and knowledge of the facts. The previous NFS Carbon had already shown how it was possible to run excellent racers even on the dual-screen portable console, and in this new episode the Exient Limited team only confirms the considerable work done so far. NFS ProStreet is immediate, fun, engaging and extremely rich in substance: the ~Career~ alone guarantees a longevity well above the average, and if we add to this all the side modes (including the excellent online multiplayer) we find ourselves really faced with a product of great thickness, which is definitely worth buying if you want an excellent racing game for your Nintendo DS. Pros: Smooth and fast graphics Very playable and fun Extremely meaty Cons: Less than great ~Hydraulics~ mode Cars appear too ~flat~ Great but limited soundtrack", "date": "2008-01-08", "grade": null}
