The formula of PAKO 2 is the same as always: driving one of the various unlockable vehicles, with a bird's eye view, our task will be to pick up certain people and quickly bring them to an extraction area. The problem is that in all cases we are dealing with dangerous criminals, perhaps still wearing the loot from a big robbery, which means that along the way we will be chased by dozens and dozens of police cars, which at a certain point they will also add some helicopters. In short, the mission will not be easy, and we will have to be quick to be able to get the maximum reward for each single race, but we will be able to return fire from the police with the weapon equipped (which varies according to the car), unlock momentary upgrades or take advantage of the turbo bar to quickly escape from particularly complicated situations. The control system of PAKO 2 is extremely simple: relying on automatic acceleration, just press the left and right side of the screen to steer in the respective directions, in a context related to the vehicle, or press both sides of the touch screen to brake and engage reverse gear. The guide takes place from the point of view of a physical system which on the one hand guarantees a pinch of realism to our evolutions, substantially modifying the handling of the vehicle when, for example, we find ourselves driving along an icy stretch, on the other it emphasizes the impacts to make the experience more engaging and spectacular. And I pako! No, don't worry: PAKO 2 is available on the App Store in premium format at the price of only 2.29 euros, and once you've paid this sum, you'll have the peace of mind of never running into microtransactions or paywalls of any kind. The progression of the game, characterized by the unlocking of new vehicles and scenarios, is based exclusively on the money collected during the missions, which is kept at each game over and placed ~in the bank~ so that it can be spent in this way. There are a total of twenty-six different cars and (at the moment) five scenarios: although smaller than in the first episode (but we are talking about much larger maps), the many possible combinations make the game experience very varied and multifaceted, given that they can create completely different situations. For example, you could focus on the solidity and simplicity of driving a van in an intricate setting, in which you let the police cars spread on the facades of the buildings while they chase you, or maybe put yourself in control of a car snappy and opt for a location full of desolate lands, which allows you to travel on dirt roads as well as the roads proper, placing very few obstacles to your duties. It only takes a few hours to unlock all the maps, while for the vehicles the discussion is naturally longer and you will have to choose your priorities, but in all cases the result is very convincing and the yield of the weapons actually makes the difference: try to throw down a patrol with pistol shots or with a powerful shotgun, and you'll see. From a technical point of view PAKO 2 substantially improves the initial concept of the Tree Men Games series, adding elements and subtleties. We also appreciated the almost pixel art style, the attention to detail and above all the implementation of an effective physical model, perfectly functional to the action. Unfortunately, we encountered a major ~battery drain~ problem on iPhone X, but we are confident that it will be resolved quickly with an update.", "date": "2018-02-15", "grade": "8.4"}
