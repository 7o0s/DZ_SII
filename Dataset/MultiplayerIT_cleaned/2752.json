While with eFootball PES 2021 the competitor Konami has in fact decided to publish an update dedicated only to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, for FIFA 21 Electronic Arts immediately announced its intention to proceed with an upgrade for the next-gen, free for owners of the football game on old generation consoles who can thus download the new version at no additional cost from 4 December. We anticipate from the outset that to see the real next-gen FIFA we will probably have to wait for next year, but the appetizer that is now offered to us by EA Sports still deserves a separate consideration compared to the FIFA 21 that we have already got to know in the review dedicated to the old-gen. After a weekend of games, here's our opinion! Modes and gameplay: what doesn't change In terms of content, FIFA 21 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X remains identical to the one that arrived on the market in early October. Even on the next-gen consoles, the EA Sports simulation sees the return of the Volta mode, after the latter's debut a year ago, which is entrusted with the narrative component of the game through The Debut. For further details regarding Volta, the news of the Career and all the other features of the FIFA 21 modes, we refer you to the article linked at the end of the introductory paragraph. As for this new version, we just remind you that not all progress obtained on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is transferred to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X when you start FIFA 21 on the latter. In fact, EA Sports' decision was to transfer from one generation to the next only what was obtained by the player within Volta and Ultimate Team, thus allowing FUT fans to find the team built in what is next-gen the main mode of FIFA for a long time now. Any seasons made in Career mode will not be carried with their save on FIFA 21 next-gen, thus leaving the player the choice between continuing his game on the old consoles or starting one from scratch on the new ones. The speech just made for the modes is valid broadly speaking also for the gameplay of FIFA 21 next-gen. Although some of the differences we are about to see with the old-gen version are also felt when the action starts on the pitch, the feeling is in all respects that of having to do with the football simulation already tested on PlayStation 4. Also in this case, it is therefore useless to repeat the assessments made about two months ago on this occasion. Graphics and uploads: what changes In the transition from the old to the new generation of FIFA 21 it is therefore the graphics that play a fundamental role. In fact, EA Sports football on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X turns out to be mainly an upgrade from a technical point of view compared to the package we already knew, thus allowing us to appreciate a part of what the game will be starting from the next edition. Since the new introductory movie, the intention of the developers to focus on the outline of the match, which has always been one of the most engaging aspects of the FIFA series, is evident. The various matches are now anticipated by new scenes in which the spectators take their seats in the stands, eliminating, among other things, the passage from the arena that was done previously. The player models go one step further towards photorealism, at least in the case of the most famous ones. The possibilities opened up by the new platforms have allowed EA Sports to manage the lights on the faces and bodies of the players in a more convincing way, with facial expressions very close to reality but above all with a renewed visual rendering of beard and hair. Stopping the game to focus the replay frame on the faces of the players is undoubtedly the best way to realize all this. The downside consists of an even more accentuated gap between the virtual reproduction of the various Ronaldos and company and that of the less famous footballers, on which as already mentioned in the old-gen review EA Sports certainly has something to learn from the competition. Returning to the fans, the developers have also added a new series of celebrations between the field and the stands, which can be activated in the event of a particularly heavy goalanti as the one that allows us to win a game on the ninetieth. Also noteworthy is a new shot called GameCam, designed by the developers to enhance the spectacular action and take full advantage of the new hardware. After a few tests, however, we returned to the classic wide shot, preferring it to a non-optimal perspective management by the GameCam. We must say at this point that the impact of the new generation consoles can be seen mainly on everything that accompanies the game, a little less when it comes time to take the field. Controller in hand, the gaming experience offered by FIFA 21 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X also remains in visual terms almost identical to that on the old consoles. The only exceptions are represented by a perfect rendering in 4K resolution with sixty frames per second, as well as a slightly greater fluidity in player movements thanks to an improved system between animations. However, these are very minimal differences, which EA Sports has decided to address by preventing cross-play between the old and new generations for safety but which in practice prove to have a very slight impact, almost imperceptible in the immediate future. clearly distinguishable in the new FIFA 21 is the complete elimination of uploads. Between the start of the game and the start of a match, practically the minimum time necessary to navigate the menus and prepare your formation passes, allowing the player to get straight onto the field without wasting a moment. The extreme loading speed even allows you to see with difficulty all the opposing formation in the screen that precedes the Ultimate Team matches. Playing with DualSense In terms of gameplay, the only real novelty of FIFA 21 is at least on PlayStation 5 the use made by the football simulation of DualSense. The support guaranteed by EA Sports for the new Sony-branded controller allows you to ~feel~ more in your hands everything that happens during the game, experiencing different vibrations not only with passes and shots, but also for everything that makes up the part football emotion. Up to the triple whistle with which the referee ends the match. Talking about it alone, this aspect may seem secondary, but we assure you that once you have taken the DualSense in hand and started a game, the level of involvement benefits from it considerably. The use that FIFA 21 makes is instead a little less effective. of the adaptive triggers of the controller for PS5, activating the resistance of the R2 key when we go to make a speed sprint with a tired player. Unlike the dynamic vibrations guaranteed by haptic feedback, the way the adaptive triggers behave does not guarantee a greater level of involvement, on the contrary it often ends up annoying the player in the crucial phases that accompany the end of the game.", "date": "2020-12-07", "grade": "8.0"}
