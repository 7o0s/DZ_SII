Would you have ever thought that Suzuki would end up on Kickstarter begging the children of the 80s, to develop the sequel to one of the highest-budget games in the history of video games? It's as if Rockstar is relying on the next crowdfunding service to make Grand Theft Auto VI in fifteen years. Or Nagoshi forced, by now clearly economic reasons, to get involved in the development of the usual semi-annual property? Suzuki's prodigal son, the man of Daytona, Virtua Striker, Virtua Racing, today reduced to a ~copy and paste~ producer without flashes. Naka had promised us the ideal fusion between Sonic and Nights Into Dreams, but instead? Instead it presents itself with a product that is not only already dead and buried on a technical level, but even well below the sufficiency in terms of gameplay. He, the programmer who conceived, directed and produced those intellectual properties and playful models many years ago. That's not how it was supposed to go. Rodea The Sky Soldier is a rather unhappy return of Naka in the landscape of historical developers Black clouds Rodea's story is perhaps the prettiest aspect, that evergreen narrative spiral - akin to anime - in which a hero rebels against the despotic ruler amidst excellent artwork and computer graphics films. The realm of action, coincidentally, is the sky, part of that setting above the clouds hand-in-hand with the Japanese tradition, synonymous with freedom, colours, solar reflections and a bright chromatic range. At least that is today. Rodea's problematic gestation appears on Wii U as the ominous epilogue of a product born on Wii and then forcibly (and stubbornly) brought by publisher Kadokawa Games to Wii U (retail includes the old-gen version) and Nintendo 3DS . You pass the portable version, where at least the bad technical aspect is filtered by the shell screens of the console, but we don't really understand the sense of forcing the team into a high definition port with assets from the old one, which is also sold at full price. And to think that - irony of fate - Naka himself advised a few days ago to go to the old-gen version, which appears to be the final paradox. Wii U is light years ahead of Wii in terms of computational power, yet from the very first moments the polygonal poverty, the textures of two generations ago and the absurd drops in frame rate hit like a punch in the face. Just one question: why? Never mind the small team size and the inability to redesign the engine to fit the minimum visual standards of high definition, but the frame rate is a really crazy lack of optimization problem. There are no excuses: this is an incredible lack of respect for a user who does not deserve even one iota of this treatment. Gamepads The Wii U GamePad is merely a pad to control Rodea's evolutions. No use of the second screen for functional gameplay purposes or sensors. The Wii U port is a pretty dry one. Old glories? From the very first bars, Naka's will is clear: to bring his historical DNA into the gameplay, allowing him to jump, glide and fight, drawing inspiration from the collection and flight mechanics of Sonic and Nights. Rodea has some merits: the boss fights are able to entertain as well as some level design micro-sections in which things turn out as they should. The rest of the trip, however, is absolutely sub-standard. The camera is poorly timed, with various moments where the character will be out of view, resulting in unwanted deaths. The controls are fragmented, poorly set, the feedback of both the parts in flight and those on the ground is unable to guarantee a worthy response to the commands. When it works, we repeat, you can see light at the end of the tunnel: there are many collectibles, the RPG-style advancement function offers some extra stimulation and the still singular ability to fly refers with a wink to a forgotten era , a sort of applause to all those fans of the past who still have the strength to cling to this now feeble dream called the video game market. It would have at least gone a little better if Naka had allowed us to enjoy the thrill at our leisure, but this was not the case: a ring bar around the protagonist introduces an element of urgency which, if exhausted, brings him back to the ground, often bringing the gameplay to break up. Playing it, you'll understand why the developer recommended the Wii version: designed with the motion sensor in mind, analog is by no means the best way to control Rodea's viewfinder. Slowness, imprecision, camera dancer make itdifficult not only the approach but also the continuation of the adventure in the clouds. Double sin: the plot has its own charm, it is also fairly long and on an artistic level islands, mountains and caves refer to an aesthetic and management style of the 3D environments of the past. It is that everything else is missing.", "date": "2015-11-16", "grade": "5.0"}
