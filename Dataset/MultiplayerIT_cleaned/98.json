{"name": "Gangstar: Crime City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gangstar-crime-city.html", "text": "Gangstaz on from mobile phonez Without great pretensions to originality or innovation, Gangstar simply stands as a serious attempt to bring the gameplay and criminal atmosphere of GTA to mobile phones, a feat that is far from simple but possible if the name behind the project is that by the talented Gameloft team. Gangstar: Crime City immediately recalls the first two-dimensional titles of the Rockstar series, both for the graphic design and for the almost total absence of narrative framing: the protagonist is therefore an unnamed character, recently released from prison with the firm intention of wipe out the various gangs that crowd the city and become the undisputed king of crime. As per tradition, the path that leads to such a goal is dotted with enemies, firefights, various missions (the game has over 60) and obviously cars to drive. It must immediately be said that Gangstar offers two modes for managing vehicles, the so-called ~easy~ and ~expert~, with the second paradoxically much more comfortable and intuitive than the first: in any case, getting around the city on four wheels is all in all quite easy, thanks also to a road network with little traffic and composed almost exclusively of cross intersections. But you don't live by driving alone, as GTA fans well know, and Gangstar offers the user the possibility to settle scores with rival gangs using an arsenal of pistols, rifles, uzis and more: the obliteration of a lens is facilitated by the presence of an automatic lock-on system that is quite comfortable, and which nevertheless tends to reduce firefights to a mechanical and not very exciting activity. Gangstaz on from mobile phonez However, the Gameloft developers have taken care to include all the features that have made the fortune of GTA within their product: therefore, there are the classic stars that sanction one's level of crime, the shops where you can buy weapons and power-ups , bonuses to be collected on the street and even some premises that can be taken over and managed in order to obtain profits. Gangstar: Crime City is therefore undoubtedly a complete title, but a bit cumbersome and substantially devoid of personality, also as regards the objectives of the various missions, where there is nothing that goes beyond a merciless ~already seen~. That said, credit must be given to Gameloft for having managed to bring a playful structure of considerable thickness to the mobile phone with good fidelity, moreover topped off with a discreetly made cosmetics. The two-dimensional graphics of Gagstar are in fact clean and colorful, also embellished by some small touches of class such as the succession of day and night and the light effects of traffic lights, headlights and illuminated signs. The city scenario is also decidedly rich, made up of a succession of palm trees, beaches, swimming pools, shops and buildings of various types; the animations are also notable, quite numerous and well done.

This simple sentence contains the strengths and weaknesses of the Gameloft product, appreciable because it manages to compress a decidedly complex structure within the limited mobile technology, but at the same time not very incisive as a mere copy - limited in several respects - of a gameplay certainly not innovative. In short, Gangstar is a title suitable for those who want to be a criminal even on mobile phones (by turning a blind eye here and there), while all the others could welcome the Gameloft product a little coldly. Pros Technically remarkable Good longevity Complex play structure Cons Slightly cumbersome controls Poor personality With mobile video games increasingly approaching the level of complexity of console games, it was inevitable that titles inspired by the world's major franchises would one day arrive on mobile support. And when it comes to big names, one cannot help but think of Grand Theft Auto, to which Gameloft ~borrows~ more than a few ideas for its Gangstar: Crime City, the first valid GTA clone available for mobile phones.
