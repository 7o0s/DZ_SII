The game takes place according to the most classic canons of console RPGs, taking us through a series of streamlined and light dialogues which, initially, even leave us perplexed if an atmosphere with epic tones was expected. In reality Atelier Iris subtly captures, after the first hours of the game we find ourselves literally entangled in the swamp of the narrative and continuing to find out how the story unfolds becomes essential, chaining us in front of the screen and forcing us to try to find out every detail of the events introduce us. As in any self-respecting role-playing game, progress throughout the story will be entrusted to a series of missions that we will obtain by going from city to city and thus unlocking the various locations gradually. Obviously, in all this we go around like mad tops, chasing characters to talk to to get clues in a city, which will inevitably send us back to seek dialogue with characters who will find themselves on the diametrically opposite side of the known (or unknown, that it is) we will not be able to stumble upon a varied series of hostile creatures who will try to block our path. Forging items and spirits of Mana The combat system, while also respecting the classic canons of the turn-based system, brings with it a series of interesting innovations, which make the title playable with greater interest even by veterans of the genre, now accustomed to a certain type of automatism and frustrated, more and more often, by the absence of real flashes of novelty in the titles on the market. What sets the game apart is, in this case, mana management. In fact, if we have said that we are alchemists, our ability will be to build a series of objects that vary from simple food to potions to recover mana or health during battles. There are an infinite number of such objects to discover and forge thanks to our skills, which will lead us to occupy a lot of time in the shops to try to put together a potion. Obviously, we are a young alchemist in training, let's not forget that. This means that we do not have all the skills necessary to forge tools immediately available, skills that we will acquire during the game, unlocking chests that will allow us to learn our new skills. Not only that: there are also ~world mana~ that will support us when we are not in battle. Once this sort of spirits have been summoned, they will be useful for destroying objects along the way, clearing the way, or allowing us to reach otherwise inaccessible locations, for example. There's a turn for everything Returning to the fights, the number of characters participating in a battle will be limited to three. Note the introduction of the cost in turns necessary to perform certain actions. More powerful attacks will take two turns to launch, compared to standard attacks that can be expended in a single turn of combat. This type of system, as can be guessed, makes us find ourselves in front of a combat system that is only apparently simple and mechanical as we are often forced to detect in these cases, but requires the study, above all going forward in the game, of a series of strategies that are anything but superficial, if we are to successfully emerge from the clashes we will have to face. In addition to the management of shifts, we must of course not forget to consider the specific skills and characteristics of each character. One's skills may not work against certain targets, while being essential to take down other monsters, thus creating an interchangeability and a complementarity between the members of the group that we will have to learn to manage well. Puff, pant, how far to go Not all is rosy, however, on the road to mana. The game, in fact, while remaining constantly at a rather high level of enjoyment, is not without its flaws. As in any RPG, our characters will ~grow~ as the game progresses, as previously mentioned. The leveling up system that we encounter in Atelier Iris is, to the disappointment of enthusiasts and purists of the genre, rather linear and superficial. Each character has eight unique skills that must be unlocked in order to be used in battle. The control we have over this process is, unfortunately, very limited. Another demerit point is certainly represented by the need to continuously go back and forth between one location and another, an aspect which can be rather boring after a certain time. Fortunately a teleportation system that will become available a little later in the game will lighten the transports, even if limited to a series of limited areas. However, the game remains quite long-lived, and this certainly plays a big point in its favor. If we only want to finish the main storyline, we'll get away with about twenty hours of gameplay. If, on the other hand, we decide to unlock all the unlockables, playing the side missions and trying to make bonuses such as movies and galleries accessible, we can easily put into account fifty hours of effort. To an approximate calculation, then, if you consider that the writer really did not have the necessary dedication to extinguish a large amount of gambling of this magnitude. Retro taste for a modern game As for the graphic sector of the game, we are faced with a retro-classic choice, which Nintendo fans will remember for having enjoyed it on the old SNES. Of course, with today's eyes we are a little behind the visual standards, but it must be said that the atmospheres evoked by the classically isometric two-dimensional choice and the anime aspect of the game are anything but unpleasant, thanks to the excellent rendering of details and the large number of particulars, which give us a clean game with an even nostalgic flavor. A welcome tribute to the days of 16bit, with the quality of today. The audio is quite pleasant throughout the game, even if it sometimes suffers from some overlap between voice and background sounds. Atelier Iris presents itself as a solid, enjoyable RPG, containing enough innovations to make it engaging even for fans of the genre. The main adventure won't engage the player for more than 25 hours of gameplay, but a large number of unlockable bonuses and sub-missions can take the longevity of the title to much higher figures. Unfortunately, the title suffers from a series of more or less venial sins, including the slowness and sometimes the fragmentation with which the story unfolds and the need to wander perhaps too much so as not to test the player's patience. A game that still remains worthy of being played, in the best Japanese RPG tradition, with a retro flavor that cannot leave old fans indifferent. Pros Innovative alchemy system Simple turn-based combat that requires in-depth strategies Light-hearted and entertaining dialogue Retro-style, detailed and pleasant graphics Cons Sometimes tedious world travel Sometimes frustrating side quests Unraveling initially confusing plot Traveling through Regallzine Thanks to KOEI, which has already brought titles such as La Pucelle and Phantom Brave to Europe, we finally have the opportunity to play Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana, the sixth chapter of a series that until now had never crossed the Japanese border . Here we are, therefore, finally in Regallzine, the land of mana, a world made up of three different territories populated by the spirits of mana and recently nice monsters that we will meet more often on our way. These spirits of mana performed the function, in times past, of allowing an elite bloodline to use alchemical powers to produce magical items, at least until alchemical knowledge was gradually forgotten. From everyone except us, of course, protagonists of an adventure that will make us take on the role of the young Klein. Our opponent will be an evil alchemist named Mull, from whose clutches we will have to save the world as usual. The young Lita, whom we will come across at the beginning of the game, will accompany us further on, playing a significant role in the story.", "date": "2006-06-21", "grade": null}
