{"name": "Er Magnone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/er-magnone.html", "text": "Released in English-speaking countries under the name of Critter Crunch, Er Magnone is in fact without mincing words, one of the best puzzle games ever available on mobile phones. Such an important statement might seem risky to many, but it would be enough to spend a few hours with the bizarre protagonist of the Disney Mobile product to understand that it is not an exaggeration at all. From the beginning, Er Magnone intrigues the player by offering a mechanic that is finally different from the much abused formula of ~join 3 things of the same color to eliminate them from the screen~. The programmers have shown that they don't want to choose the easy way out, but rather that they want to commit themselves to trying to create something original and with personality. And the result was undoubtedly successful in the best way, since Er Magnone really has a lot of personality; the protagonist is Biggs, a furry creature with a voracious appetite and a very long tongue, which he uses as a tool to get the better of the wave of critters that are invading his jungle. The gameplay is based on a very simple concept, except to expand it by finally offering a truly remarkable depth. In summary, the critters descend from above through 6 vertical columns, and it is essential to prevent them from reaching the bottom of the screen to avoid game over. To do this, Biggs can pick up any of the animals in the front row with his tongue, and then spit it out in another column. The reason is obvious: each critter feeds on the smaller one, and so it is possible to start food chains thus trying to empty the screen of bulky presences. In fact, this operation not only eliminates the eaten creature, but also leads to the explosion of the larger one in the event that it eats twice. Furthermore, by exploding, the latter also explodes all those of the same color that are next to it, thus creating particularly effective and useful combos. Once Biggs' ~hunger~ gauge is filled, the level is completed. But that is not all! The programmers of Capybara Games, already authors of the excellent Pillowfight and the underrated Pirates of the Caribbean, have added a series of bonuses capable of giving further freshness and variety to the gameplay; the beauty is that these variations are proposed in a progressive and gradual way, one level after another, thus allowing us to find ourselves faced with often new and stimulating situations. Already up to this point, Er Magnone would have all the credentials to become at least a game to try; but the graphic component takes care of making it a must, truly among the most accurate and well-designed to appear on mobile phones. Without letting go of the premature and immature fashion of 3D, the Disney Mobile production is in fact based entirely on the two dimensions, first of all bringing with it an incredibly inspired character design, and secondly a simply splendid use of colors. The care taken by the team is also evident by observing the goodness of the animations, the effects, and even more the variety of the backdrops that accompany each level. The sound is also excellent, which accompanies the action with discretion and intelligence. Sorry for the absence of any multiplayer mode, which would really have made a game almost perfect that already remains an essential purchase for any lover of puzzle games on mobile phones.
