Ours is a market that has only recently dared to appear seriously on the balcony, as if out of the perennial fear of not being able to handle its vertigo. In France, on the other hand, it's quite another story. In the land of cousins across the Alps, games are developed and even published, giving each other a hand despite results that are not always exciting. Of Orcs and Men was not a rampant success, and neither was Faery: Legends of Avalon nor the old-gen port of Sherlock Holmes. Little communication, little media push, more or less questionable quality, sales that are not exciting but evidently sufficient to make them advance. The results may not be that amazing, but at least they try. We don't struggle to think that the thirty elements of the Spiders team are a group passionate about fantasy; they have always produced and Bound by Flame is the latest example. Focus Home Interactive once again seizes the opportunity to present a not atypical role-playing game, drawing liberally from the most recent industry giants such as Dragon Age and The Witcher, proposing its own vision in which the legacy of our choices affects the story . A new contender for the Western RPG scepter? Press and squeeze Spiders cannot be criticized for the choice of gameplay infrastructure: the French have decided to rely on a well-known system, refining it and roughing it out with some little-oiled mechanics. Drawing on a fluid action style that harks back to that kind of seamless real-time gameplay between one enemy and another, the team provides a combat system that is not complex but solid if nothing else. The problem is that Spiders adds nothing new to what has already been seen in the past: a grid interface on which to associate keys with actions (pad or keyboard changes little), a very - too much - accentuated emphasis on the need to parry and counterattack , three types of fighting styles to choose from, a typical progression in which to develop the tree of skills and talents. On the Bound by Flame card it leaves no points uncovered but it is the substance that suffers, especially in the long term. A medium-sized learning curve reserves a good dose of fun in the first phase, without immediately placing too much emphasis on magic: the player is thus free to study patterns and choose his style - heavy (sword, hammer and axe), fast and distance - which best suits the situation. All with a discreet focus on performing certain actions to unlock talents linked and connected to a relative action counter, while perhaps being dragged by an initially fascinating and boundless plot and setting. Only once you have entered the mechanics do you discover that the limited range of actions offered by the combat system shrinks even more, making magic, if well developed, a real extra gear with which to devastate enemies, also thanks to a energy and mana bar that recharge quickly. The clashes thus become, after a few hours, directed to a pre-established pattern in which the balance will think heavily on the parry-magic combination, leaving less and less space for weapons, superfluous in most cases. Bound by Flame provides players with the ability to craft items from non-consumables scattered across the maps, as well as the ability to socket additional abilities into weapon slots; a good way to customize your loadout, but - again - the upgrades have very little variety. If we add up a rather limited growth tree in terms of characterization, personality and statistics to unlock, the panorama can be summarized in a missed opportunity on the gameplay side. Unfortunately not the only side. Shallow and rather short, Bound by Flame ends just when things get interesting Playstation 4 trophies The title offers trophies based on progress, unlocking of dialogues and data sheet. You go from beating bosses to completing quests, maximizing styles and concluding the line of dialogue with the various NPCs. To conclude the list the usual counters of using skills, killings with weapons, performing skills and completely playing the game in the various difficulty levels. Budget cuts? Inside Bound by Flame has a profound flaw: for all the meat that the plot puts on the fire, the product is decidedly too short. Advancing in the title and climbing more and more in the tree of growth reaching the top, one gets the impression of feeling displaced. On the one hand a withI keep amassing promises of an epic and boundless plot, enriched by an oft-cited enemy park that puts the player in continuous curiosity to find out who the protagonists of the narrated evil really are and what they look like; on the other, an advance that seems to burn the stages of the plot and which will lead, with more or less basic coherence, to a set of barely sketched endings. The land of Vertiel has been on the edge of the abyss since the Lords of Frost began their advance: seven necromancers, each at the head of his own army of undead. With these assumptions begin the exploits of the mercenary Vulcan (whether you choose to be a man or a woman, the name does not change), which will lead him to advance in the plot, make choices and surround himself, each time, with a companion chosen from among the five PNGs available. Too bad that Spiders has chosen to create a plot artifice that brings the title to an end quickly: all the psychological / political assumptions related to the Lords of the Cold have gradually dissolved in discovering that the end was just around the corner. An unpleasant aspect that leads the title to be finished, including quests, in just over fifteen hours, with a huge flavor of missed opportunity. Yes, there are four levels of difficulty, but the story changes little. A decidedly nuanced opportunity that leaves an incomplete, approximate, sketchy taste; very few settings, few explorable environments, few enemies, weapons, talents, skills. All this would not have weighed if we had been faced with a low percentage of completion, with a new phase to be discovered. But no: the title ends, playfully speaking. One wonders: why present an inspired, studied, politically potentially profound setting when, of all this, nothing will ever be explored? Perhaps the limited budget, the fact is that it's a pity, because there is no shortage of ideas and the desire to create something connected. The narration is sometimes even original, with some unexpected twists, but at the end of the day it seems to always be faced with a climax, capable of opening up the game world, which however does not arrive. Fiery choices The fulcrum of the system of choices proposed by Spiders is immediate right from the start: when our hero is possessed by a demonic power, it is not difficult to imagine that this force will place the protagonist at the center of the events and, consequently, faced with choices . Decisions not only concerning the non-player characters but also the willingness or otherwise to leave the demon with aesthetic changes that will - in reality, little - affect the data sheet. A nice technique to carry on the narrative except that the influence of our choices changes some relationship between characters, but not the plot. The result, in the final bars, actually appears rather superfluous and sometimes forced, capable of giving little bite to a coherent network of relationships. To help the sense of emotional superficiality intervenes a graphic aspect of a good level but which progressively loses interest as the story progresses. Initially able to give good sensations thanks to a chromatic palette and bright and gaudy environments, the settings of the second half of the game are much more dull, with a consequent loss of glance in the long term. The Spiders game engine - also used in the past for other titles - does a good job overall but fails to amaze specifically, thanks also to a not exactly excellent character modeling and not very exciting animations; instead, the lighting in the initial rooms is good, able to raise the technical and atmospheric perception with little effort.", "date": "2014-05-09", "grade": "7.0"}
