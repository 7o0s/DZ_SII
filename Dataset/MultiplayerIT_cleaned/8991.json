{"name": "Gelatine da difesa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94894-jelly-defense-gelatine-da-difesa.html", "text": "Tested version: iPad To justify yet another Tower Defense title on the iOS platform, a genre that has literally exploded on Apple's portable devices, objectively all colors have been seen: from the most serious and disturbing approach, perhaps set in a dangerous future invaded by aliens , to the historical one, with knights in armour, horses, witches and wizards, ending up with the most improbable and paradoxical cases, perhaps starring funny little beings whose existence appears substantially meaningless. Wanting to dwell on this cataloguing, surely Jelly Defense belongs to the latter group, which nevertheless manages the difficult task of creating almost a sort of subset within it: among all the improbable creatures protagonists of a video game, in fact, it would rarely occur to one developer to choose just these... Red or blue, I like you! The planet Diploglobe, a gray sphere with a plastic look, is at the mercy of the heaviest alien attack ever seen in the history of the Jellys, the local population. This incipit, inflated and rather trivial, takes on a particular meaning once you realize the real nature of the inhabitants of the planet: in fact, in Jelly Defense you will not have to fiddle around between imposing stone towers or articulated war machines, but on the contrary the only way to keep the alien threat away is to place along the route of the enemy troops none other than soft (but certainly not harmless) colored jellies. However, the mistake that a user could make, perhaps deceived by the playful aspect of the rubbery structures and (above all) by the absurd and almost hypnotic musical theme that accompanies the action, is to exchange the title of Infinite Dreams for an almost childish or otherwise shallow; in reality, as will be seen shortly, the strategic component is not only very present but is even fundamental. The enemies to be faced along the usual pre-set paths belong in fact to two main macro-groups, distinguished by color: the reds, more numerous but generally less resistant, and the blues, on the contrary more difficult to kill but present in fewer numbers. Consequently, even the gelatinous turrets to be placed in the focal points must take into account this chromatic difference: in fact, the weapons are in turn divided into red / blue, capable of hitting both types of enemies indifferently, only red and only blue, specific for the same color but with a greater intensity of fire. The economic resources, indispensable for erecting the towers, are collected from time to time following the destruction of the enemies but, at the (random) appearance of a particular bonus to be ~tapped~ on the fly, numerous other (and very useful) ones will literally fall from the sky golden spheres. However, the classic scheme for collecting money in some situations can change, for example by proposing a situation in which you will have to start with a pre-set budget to sip, except for some extra bonuses, until the end of the level. The final objective of the invaders, the ~more concrete~ one compared to the generic one of the occupation of the planet, is to grab the green crystals present in a specific area of the different stages. The precious minerals, which after each positively rejected attack are embedded by the nice Jelly directly in their firmament, also provide additional points and bonuses if saved. However, the basic towers alone could not guarantee the safety of the coveted site, especially in the presence of increasingly powerful enemies and bosses: therefore the welcome upgrade system for the turrets intervenes, which allows you to exponentially increase the damage inflicted and the range. In addition to the aforementioned extra that increases the economic resources available, other upgrades can be released by killed enemies, such as electric shocks, earthquakes or generic upgrades valid for all structures simultaneously; the tree of inventions, which looks more like a large broccoli, is then assigned the task of creating new types of defense from scratch (such as the very useful gelatin which slows down enemies with poisonous gas). Alternating with the normal levels of defense, some amusing mini-games also appear, useful for breaking the rhythm and in general for avoiding excessive repetitiveness. Graphically speaking, Jelly Defense is pleasant, with good color rendering (despite the basic gray for the settings) but above all fluid and well animated; as already mentioned, an honorable mention goes to the soundtrack sung and obsessively repeated in all levels (however fortunately it can be deactivated), which willy-nilly cannot help but enter the players' brain after just a few games.
