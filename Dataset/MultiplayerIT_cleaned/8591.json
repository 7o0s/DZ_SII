The introduction of the Skylanders universe, with many new characters in addition to the little purple dragon, and the interesting cross-platform elements of the game, which brings together toys and video games in an original way for the first time, convinced audiences and critics, giving the start of a new course which, we hope, will not fail to surprise us in the future as well. Given the popularity of the iOS platform, the arrival of the franchise on the App Store was also obvious, and so the developers of Frima Studio have created an immediate, fun touch shooter full of objects and characters to unlock. The latter are precisely the Skylanders, thirty heroes belonging to eight different elemental categories that we can ~purchase~ and use in the game by spending the gems earned up to that moment, or by using the web codes of the toys we referred to previously. Unfortunately the gameplay of Skylanders Cloud Patrol doesn't change one iota if we use one hero instead of another, beyond a score multiplier that changes daily based on the element: if we own a Skylander associated with water and that's the element of the day, checking it will allow us to earn a greater number of points and therefore proceed more quickly to obtain the various extras. Clouds and bullets It is automatic to associate the genre of touch shooters with casual users, after all it is enough to touch a target on the screen to eliminate it and it is therefore an experience with which everyone is able to try their hand. In reality, fortunately, the mechanics of Skylanders Cloud Patrol are a moment more complex and bring into play the ability to carry out combos, the timing necessary to avoid bombs (you hit one and it's game over), the sessions dedicated to collecting bonuses, and so on. The only discordant note, in an otherwise more than successful picture, seemed to us to be the ~survival~ setting, i.e. the same game that repeats itself every time we press play, without a subdivision into levels that add substance and progression to the game, simply a ~dry attempt~ to get as far as possible, perhaps by taking advantage of unlockable bonuses such as the elixir that allows you to continue after being hit. For the rest, the prize system with coins and gems proves to be effective and functional, and above all it rewards skill and not luck: to multiply earnings you have to ring combo after combo, aiming the targets and releasing the projectiles in a sort of missile ~lock on~ that hides more pitfalls than one might think, and which therefore must be executed quickly, after a quick glance. The gameplay is accompanied by graphics that are up to the task, with a good variety of trolls to eliminate, always very colorful scenarios and a series of pleasant and nice solutions. The sound sector is less brilliant, unable to stand out.", "date": "2012-04-18", "grade": "7.7"}
