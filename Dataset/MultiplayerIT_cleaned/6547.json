If you have already read our review of Kirby Fighters Deluxe, however, you will know that Nintendo has not particularly undertaken to enrich the original proposal, and so the brawler starring Kirby has proved to be a fun pastime and little more. We were worried that history would repeat itself for King Dedede's rhythm game, but we soon discovered that a much better job was done here. Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe is a great stand-alone minigame version of Kirby: Triple Deluxe The 3D effect Pleasant but not particularly significant: although it can make some passages a little easier when you need to evaluate distances, in the frenzy of the action you don't even notice it. Drumroll Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe is a rhythm game that is anything but trivial. Usually in music games you have to press the right button at the right time, following the rhythm of the music and that's it, but in this case Nintendo has well thought of implementing platform mechanics to liven up the action, creating a fun hybrid that challenges not only only the player's eardrums, but also his reflexes. The basic mechanics are very simple: you have to reach the end of a horizontally scrolling stage by making Dedede jump from one drum to another, following the rhythm of the music, but at the top of each jump you also have to press a key to make the drum play to our iconic penguin, and always following the rhythm because by hitting the right times we will also increase our score in view of the final evaluation. If this dynamic already adds a lot of pepper, we also add that of jumps, the elevation of which depends on the player. If Dedede lands on a drum normally, it will just bounce to the next, but if the player hits the button at the right time then the next jump will be higher. And if you press the button again when Dedede lands from a high jump, you can make one that will land even higher. At that point, the player must manage three mechanics simultaneously and individually: he must control Dedede, decide the elevation of the jumps to collect coins and avoid enemies and obstacles, and beat the drum at the apex of each jump to accumulate points. In another case it could probably have been too much meat in the fire for such a simple game, but the excellent level design and the very precise control system make the experience anything but complex even in the most frenetic moments, proposing a level of challenge always spot on and never frustrating. For example, it is no longer enough to fall on deaf ears or make a mistake to fail, and the hearts have been replaced by an indicator that is slowly consumed with each mistake, sending us directly to the nearest checkpoint. At some point, completely new mechanics will start to take over from the original minigame, such as moving platforms, coins to be collected in a specific order, and more. In short, each new level offers a new obstacle to overcome, keeping the player's interest high and increasingly distancing itself from the essence of a simple mini-game of the original A Rhythm with Dedede. This is further demonstrated by the addition of an extra mode entitled Remix, which allows us to review our last game and modify it by adding more sounds by pressing the front buttons of the console. It's a shame that these ~creations~ can't be shared with other players, which makes replays a bit of an end in themselves. On the other hand, Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe is not a perfect game, and the catch lies in its duration: it is possible to complete each level in less than a couple of hours, depending on the skill of the player. After that, all that remains is to hunt for record times and little else. Too bad, because the game includes not only the songs from Kirby: Triple Deluxe, but also those from the latest Kirby games, such as Return to Dreamland and Air Ride: very pleasant, amusing tunes that buzz in your head for hours, but which unfortunately are a little bit.", "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "7.8"}
