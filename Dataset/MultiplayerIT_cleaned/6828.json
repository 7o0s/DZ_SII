However, the authors of the game were not discouraged by an uninspiring initial feedback, and in the months following the announcement they did their utmost to disclose all the innovations made with respect to the second chapter, working hard to convince users of the dignity of the project and thus trying to limit as much as possible the risk that it could really be perceived as a sort of mere Borderlands 2 data disk. Now that the title is finally out in stores, let's try to understand if these efforts were motivated or if the first impression is was the most truthful... Army of four The bizarre name chosen by 2K Australia actually sums up the position of Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel in the narrative continuum of the series in a very effective way: the game opens with a sequence that sees the Lilith of the second episode busy interrogating Athena (one of the four protagonists of this new adventure) on his involvement in the rise to power of Handsome Jack, president of Hyperion as well as the final bad guy of Borderlands 2. From here starts a flashback which in fact constitutes the scenario in which you play, playing the role of one of the mercenaries enlisted by Jack when he was still a simple employee of the company of which he would later become the absolute leader. Without wanting to reveal too many details of the plot, we can say that Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel is undoubtedly capable of taking away some satisfaction from the fans of the series, with its references to the previous chapters and above all thanks to the fact that the plot sheds light on the background of the story of Borderlands 2. However, a creative impetus evidently lower than that of Gearbox with the past episodes is perceived, which translates into an unexciting plot and in much less charismatic secondary characters, who address the player with dialogues that they flow away without leaving a mark apart from a few sporadic climaxes. It must also be said that you certainly don't approach a title like Borderlands to be able to enjoy an Oscar-worthy plot, but rather to shoot everything that moves and throw yourself in search of the most valuable loot. In this context, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel diligently follows the outline developed by Gearbox, starting with a set of protagonists that guarantees a nice variety of play styles. There is the aforementioned Athena, a warrior equipped with a Captain America-style shield that she can use both to absorb damage and as a throwing weapon; Instead, Willhelm is accompanied by two drones that assist him in battle, one healing his wounds and the other attacking enemies; Nisha is the gunslinger of the group, and uses her aim with a special ability that allows her to automatically aim at enemies and increase her attack stats; finally there is the Claptrap, which keeps faith with its tradition of ridiculous character thanks to an irrepressible verbosity and above all to the VaultHunter.exe program with which it scans the surrounding area and chooses the most suitable upgrade to use among those available , obviously one more absurd than the other. As per the tradition of the series, the four protagonists each have three well-matched skill branches, which will allow anyone to make them evolve according to their preferences on the battlefield. Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel is fun, but struggles to establish itself as a real new chapter Gravity hurts me I know The aspect in which the developers of 2K Australia have concentrated the greatest dose of novelty is certainly that of the scenario: Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel is in fact set in Elpis, one of the moons of Pandora, and this choice has profound consequences on the gameplay . The satellite's atmosphere is not breathable, and the protagonists (with the exception of the Claptrap) must keep an eye on their oxygen supplies, making sure that the appropriate indicator is always full, otherwise the progressive loss of vital energy caused by suffocation. The Oz - as it is called in the game - can be recovered by activating special machinery, collecting the cylinders left by killed enemies or walking over the natural springs that emerge from the ground, and it also serves to activate thrusters which allow you to increase the range of the jumps . While it undoubtedly adds a new variable to the equation, the inclusion of this new resource does notconvinces to the end, mainly because it ends up distorting a fundamental component of Borderlands such as exploration: with the worry of always having to keep the respirator working, the user does not have the freedom to face the game at the desired pace, having to submit to the more frenetic one established by the developers. The other main novelty, namely the low gravity of Elpis, is also a potentially very divisive element. There are those who will appreciate the possibility of floating in the air, flying over enemies and perhaps hitting them with a powerful dunk that can be performed by pressing the crouch button in flight: however, for the writer, this is an aspect that makes shooting less dynamic, giving to them a ~floating~ effect which frankly did not feel the need at all. However, these design choices also have consequences on the behavior of enemies, who often choose to attack from above by exploiting Elpis's low gravity, becoming more difficult to detect but also remaining at the mercy of the player's blows when they are suspended in the air: moreover, human opponents are also connected to a respirator, and by destroying their helmets they can be seen gasping as they progressively lose vital points. Playstation 3 trophies Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel offers 51 trophies, including one platinum that is unlocked by conquering all the others, two gold, nine silver and the remaining bronze. 20 trophies are secret, most of which are linked to the completion of specific missions, while several others can be obtained with the natural progression in the adventure. The real challenge for those aiming for 100% will be some trophies relating to rather demanding skill tests and above all those that reward the intensive use of each individual character's special moves. Nostalgia for Pandora However, the experimentation of 2K Australia has not touched the basics of the game structure, which remains substantially identical to that of the previous two episodes: therefore the progression system based on primary and secondary missions that can be obtained from non-player characters and bulletin boards remains, and above all unchanged the true beating heart of Borderlands, namely the spasmodic drive to search for new and more powerful equipment for your character. In this sense, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel does not miss anything, making large quantities of new loot available to crypt hunters, adding to the already very rich offer of the second chapter the new laser weapons and an unprecedented elemental effect that allows you to freeze enemies and smash them to smithereens with a melee attack. There are therefore contents in more than enough quantity to guarantee fans of the series numerous hours of adventure, however playing Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel is an experience that struggles a lot to get close to the fun factor of the two previous chapters made by Gearbox. Part of the blame must be attributed to the questionable design choices made by the developers of 2K Australia: in addition to the mechanics related to oxygen and gravity we have already talked about, the title does not shine either for the contents of the missions which generally do not prove too inspired , nor for the construction of the settings, extensive but much emptier than the offer of Borderlands 2. All these elements, combined with an unnecessarily drawn-out tutorial phase, mean that the first hours in the company of the game can turn out to be downright boring : fortunately, later the gears begin to turn and things tend to a moderate improvement, but without ever reaching particularly high peaks. It must also be said that Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel is a victim of its very nature as a product released at the end of a generation of consoles, therefore unable to detach itself too much from the stylistic code of the previous chapter, with which it shares the identical appearance of the interface and an almost indistinguishable visual realization. It is therefore difficult to be amazed in front of a title that inevitably appears a bit old, even if 2K Australia has put its effort into making everything even less exciting, proposing a few constantly repeated graphic elements and exaggerating in the use of the various shades of blue and gray, giving the various scenarios a decidedly monotonous look. Our test on PlayStation 3 also highlighted more than a few technical problems in terms of texture loading and frame rate stability, all things that are difficult to overlook after the console's life cycle is now over.", "date": "2014-10-18", "grade": "7.0"}
