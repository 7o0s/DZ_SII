Everything revolves around the appearance of Aletheia, a projection of an Isu whose consciousness has been transferred to the Piece of Eden which our character acquires at the end of the game. The woman has a new mission for us, a task that involves the interaction between the Shadow of the Eagle and Layla Hassan: both must go, albeit in different historical periods, to three dungeons where as many symbols are hidden. The combination of these signs can open the passage to a secret area and start a new adventure that begins in the Elysian Fields. Atmosphere and characters Assassin's Creed Odyssey: Campi Elisi confirms the strengths and weaknesses of the Ubisoft title, and does so due to a series of somewhat shaky narrative and design solutions. We are convinced that the exceptional lore created over the years by the French house deserves a story that is more attentive to detail, to pauses, in short, to the cinematic times, along the lines of some Sony exclusives: the lack of a quality direction ends up belittling moments of great pathos, and it's sincerely a shame. There are basic campaign sequences, primarily the disappearance of some characters, that deserved better treatment; and the same happened in the first story arc, Legacy of the First Blade. History repeats itself in the new DLC, with a somewhat limping and hasty start which, however, makes up for it as it serves as a simple expedient to guarantee us access to Elysium. The new scenario offers a brand new map, of moderate size but above all enchanting from an aesthetic point of view: it is an otherworldly place which however shares many features with the Greek landscapes, surrounded by enormous waterfalls and improbable architectures, enriched by enormous expanses of flowers and from mountains on which strongholds full of potential enemies are often found. A kingdom dominated by Persephone, Hades' wife, who doesn't give us the best possible welcome (she immediately tries to get us killed by her guards) and clarifies what the balance of power is in that suggestive and fascinating land. The meeting with Hermes and other supporting actors enlightens us on what we must do in order to pass this new test and go to the underworld, in a mix of missions that are not very varied but full of crossroads and interesting ideas, which can keep us company for a ten hours in case you decide to go through everything. Gameplay and structure The setting changes, also divided into regions to be revealed and synchronization points, but the assumptions do not change in Assassin's Creed Odyssey: Campi Elisi. In an attempt to weaken Persephone's rule, in fact, one of our main objectives will be to destroy certain statues and storm fortresses to burn stocks, blow up special altars, steal treasures and of course eliminate the queen's army commanders. However, the fighters of the underworld are not ordinary soldiers, and in addition to possessing above-average strength and resistance, they can also call lightning, explosions and shock waves which must be avoided in order not to suffer serious damage. To these are added statues that come to life if you fight in front of them, and which are able to offer really intense and complex fights, to be solved possibly by resorting to the most devastating maneuvers in our repertoire. In short, the challenge is not lacking, hence the obligation to face this new adventure with a character of level 50 or higher; but on the exploration front, more than one perplexity emerges. Being dotted with very high peaks, Elysium has a very particular geography and it becomes complicated to move quickly from one area to another: if you are on one of these mountains, you must first return to the ground, then cover a certain distance on foot or on horseback, and finally engage in a long climb. We therefore hoped that the Wings of Hermes introduced at the beginning of the DLC would be a pair of magical boots that would allow Kassandra and/or Alexios to ~glide~ in the air to shorten the distances between one peak and another, but yes trats instead of simple teleportation points that are not common in the area. The need to descend rapidly from the mountains also reveals a simplistic solution adopted by the developers when the character reaches a certain level, i.e. his invulnerability to falls, which however is not justified in a credible way (for example, it would have been possible to involve the spear of Leonidas to ~dampen~ the impact with the ground) and gives rise to frankly absurd situations, in which we fall for hundreds of meters without being affected in any way. In conclusion Campi Elisi is only the first part of the new narrative arc of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, therefore it is possible that the events narrated acquire depth and further facets starting from the second DLC. However, the novelties of the package are sufficient to justify the purchase of The Destiny of Atlantis, which costs 24.99 euros, or even more so of the entire Season Pass, which for 39.99 euros includes both expansions and remasters of Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed Liberation: a price / content ratio that we find extraordinary. The Elysium map is very fascinating, although difficult to explore due to the frequent vertical development and the lack of ~shortcuts~ between one peak and another, and the new enemies offer a consistent challenge, which in fact forces you to face the adventure with a level 50 or higher character. The new experience gained also allows you to improve certain skills beyond the traditional third level, while on the RPG elements front there are several choices that can affect the events and the fate of some supporting characters. Also considering the implications in the ~present~ of Layla Hassan, those who enjoyed the story of Odyssey should not miss this new episode.", "date": "2019-05-05", "grade": null}
