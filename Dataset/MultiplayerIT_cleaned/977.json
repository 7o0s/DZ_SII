{"name": "Mario Party 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-party-6.html", "text": "The multiplayer board game Back in 1999, the idea behind Mario Party was not entirely original. Transpositions of board games in electronic version had already known the monitors of home computers and consoles many years earlier. However, Nintendo and Hudson didn't just make this model as playable as possible: they merged it with a series of intuitive, fast and exciting pick and play games, alternating progress on the boards with furious multiplayer sessions in order to collect stars on the board , conquer more mini-games to resume then at will, unlock more bonuses and other modes. Since then, nothing  or little  has changed in the series. The mechanics of Mario Party 6 remain, with some modifications, those of its predecessors. As always, the fulcrum of the game is the Party Mode: having chosen one of the boards, the aim is to advance by ~rolling the dice~ towards the stars to be collected, paying for them with coins won in the mini-games. These are activated at the end of each player's turn, or when they pass through special boxes that can activate various types of events, even in the form of animations and special events on the board. The mini-games can consist of free-for-all, one-on-three or pairs challenges, and involve types of interaction ranging from repeated button presses to elementary platforming mechanics, to imaginative interactive inventions of all kinds and pseudo-sports simulations , passing through the citation of classic games and the mnemonic quiz. As is clear, the Mario Party series has always explicitly focused on multiplayer: if playing single-player isn't simply a waste of the game's possibilities but even seems to violate its vocation, the Nintendo party game has always been capable of playing in four people to entertain, amuse, excite, even lead to boisterous disputes. The saga continues Mario Party 6 presents absolute continuity with all the previous chapters, with changes that can be defined as annual and routine. The traditional mode, the one with the roll of the dice on the game board, is almost completely unchanged. It is good that Nintendo and Hudson have finally speeded up the ~downtime~ of the game: the bonuses (mushrooms that double the roll of the dice, nuisance elements thrown at other players) are now collected en passant, non-stop with attached dialogue - and always the same - at the useless distributors of previous episodes; players move faster on the board; the dialogues are leaner and faster, and you can skip the introductions and explanations to the individual mini-games with a special option to make the game more fluid. The stars to collect are now slightly easier to collect, thanks to the ~cosmic~ narrative device that contrasts the sun Brighton and the moon Twila. The reason that drives the world of Mario Party is an astral challenge to be solved with the unspecified use of collecting stars. Beyond the narrative aspect, in terms of gameplay this is resolved in the change of active elements and game modes on the board, depending on whether it is day or night. To obtain a star, ten coins may then be enough or thirty may become necessary, instead of the canonical twenty necessary during the day. This is reflected in the gameplay in a basically insignificant way compared to the expedients, typical of the other episodes, to make the last rounds on the board more unpredictable and make the game varied. The newly introduced single player mode is then a simple variation on the main theme. Instead of waiting for four players to take turns, you proceed alone on a very narrow table, in which each box corresponds to a mini-game to be played and conquered for use at will in the Mini-Games mode. However, the game must be abandoned before reaching the final square: passing it with a roll of the dice would be equivalent to falling off the edge of the board, losing all the accumulated bonuses. Consequently, all normally negative events and objects  mushrooms that halve the number rolled, events that bring one back on the board  become positive, because they delay the voluntary moment in which the game is stopped and, therefore, to accumulate bonuses. But, you know, in Mario Party what matters is the multiplayer, and proceeding alone to earn stars soon becomes not very exciting. Microphone and new games between novelty and repetitiveness The real, only novelty is the microphone. By means of this peripheral it is possible to issue voice commands that the game recognizes in different situations (even in the menus) and in a special category of mini-games that are self-activated if the console recognizes the device connected to the second memory socketto. A new game mode is then entirely manageable by voice. The microphone recognizes simple preset commands (in various languages, including Italian) that replace the controller, which can still be used instead of voice commands. For example, some mini-games allow the player controlling the microphone to attack opposing players by giving his big robot commands such as ~missiles!~, ~lasers!~ or drop bombs!. Or, in a mode that feels like a sort of Excitebike reworked for voice commands, the player commands the character to ~move up~, ~run~ or ~jump~ to get him through a course full of obstacles and rescue a star beyond a goal. In these cases, the game mechanics are nice diversions, but little more. The repetitiveness of the actions quickly replaces the appeal of the novelty. However, the most evident limits of this interaction are at the level of the audio interface, of the microphone itself: the recognition is not of a very high level and foresees not very short intervals between one command and another, sporadic errors in word recognition and, indifferent, a cable with a length that is too little generous, which obliges a certain lack of movement both with respect to the monitor and in the passages from hand to hand. The slight recognition problems do not affect the most successful vocal mode too much, a sort of imitation of a quiz show with characters to recognize, animations with subsequent questions on details to remember and small trivia which, at increasing levels of difficulty, with the microphone passing from hand to hand and the interference and cackling of human opponents, makes this pleasant addition decidedly fun. Some of the voice quizzes are disarmingly simple, sometimes almost offensive to an average-aged audience. The microphone, however, does not recognize the words of children under eight years of age, probably due to inaccuracy in spelling or excessive shouting. Strange, given that the difficulty of the game has plummeted clearly. Even the main game on the boards is decidedly less demanding, with a ~normal~ difficulty level that is equivalent to Mario Party 5's ~easy~, stars that are easier to reach and mini-games with practically stationary opponents. Luckily, a more challenging difficulty can be purchased as a bonus in the Star Bank section. Microphone and new games between novelty and repetitiveness The stars earned are collected in the Star Bank, in the form of the sum of the points at the end of the game sessions which can be reinvested to purchase bonuses of various kinds: mini-games, an extra character and small chapters of a narrative extra which has the form of a beautiful book with cardboard figures that open in relief from the pages, complete with animation that simulates pulling the cardboard tabs. Whatever the choice of target for the game, it is certain that Mario Party 6 has not enjoyed the same level of productive and creative attention as the previous chapters on central aspects such as that of mini games. Many of these are fun and original in their presentation, but they hardly go beyond identical interactive mechanics and are still less successful and lashing than those of Mario Party 5 or with levels of interaction between players that are never as complex and fun as those of the fourth installment of the series. Many of the mini-games, which have always been the core of gaming, are created with less imagination and care than ever before. This is reflected in the graphic aspect of the game, especially with regard to the scoreboards. Not only does it not go beyond one model too much, too similar to the graphics engines for the Nintendo 64, but it goes backwards. For colours, animations and clean and graphic richness, Mario Party 6 is inferior to the fifth episode, and this clashes particularly with the results obtained by games such as Mario Tennis, as well as revealing that the microphone, rather than a potential transformation of the saga, is a superficial repainting for a sequel put together with productive miserliness. Like its prequels, Mario Party 6 is a fun and exciting multiplayer game. The single player modes and extras to unlock, however expanded, are just simple extras. This sixth episode introduces the use of the microphone: interesting, but with a short-lived attraction. In the meantime, however, not only does it lose every last trace of originality left in the saga, but it presents its very core - the mini-games - with variations that are more graphic than in substance. A certain creative stagnation accompanies a mediocre aesthetic presentation. How can a sound quiz be completely silent, except for the usual little voices? How can the boards look like they sometimes come out of a Nintendo64? Whereand are they, in this sixth episode contemporary with the beautiful graphic display of Mario Power Tennis, beautiful animations, a perspective from the table and rapid and functional spoken dialogues, different according to the situations? And wouldn't some nice animated buttons with minimal indications be better than the usual long questions about each action? Wouldn't a nice artistic representation of the board game a la Paper Mario be much more enjoyable than this realization left creatively in the middle, and made with anonymous scenarios? Maybe it's time for Nintendo to skip the next annual episode and get to work for a couple of years: the series is always capable of entertaining, but it is desperate for real news. If not, children and adults alike would be better off buying better pick and play games in the future, or dusting off traditional board games. For now, fans can decide whether to embark on the novelty of the microphone or return to the fifth and most successful episode. Pros: Four player multiplayer is excellent Mini games are as many and fun as ever The addition of the microphone is captivating The new single player mode makes solo play less boring Cons: The novelty of the microphone loses its bite very soon The care in the game mechanics is poor, they get repetitive Interface and audio-visual presentation needs revamping Challenge level has plummeted Mic aside, it's a step down from Mario Party 4 and 5 New year, new Mario Party. The winning formula does not change and the series inaugurated in 1999 on Nintendo 64 reaches its sixth, very traditional episode on GameCube. As always, in multiplayer by vocation. Voice commands, day / night alternation and a new single player mode stand out in this chapter. Elements that significantly change the interaction? Negative. For better or for worse, Mario Party's raw material doesn't change. As always, it is a vast series of multiplayer mini-games, alternated and merged with an electronic version of the board game. The microphone and the vocal mode are an interesting introduction, but not brave enough and which also seems to have led to a certain lowering of the difficulty and a presentation, if possible, even more suitable for a very young audience. Mario Party therefore remains a simple upgrade of the previous chapters, and does not offer any reason to conquer new portions of the public. What's worse is that, although in this new repainted version the multiplayer remains top-level to the delight of fans, even the latter could find fault with many aspects of a sixth episode and a series in which the lack of innovation begins to weigh a lot.", "date": "2005-04-06", "grade": null}
