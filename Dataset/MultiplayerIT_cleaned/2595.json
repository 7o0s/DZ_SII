{"name": "Deus Ex", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deus-ex_a.html", "text": "Past and present: from System Shock 2 to Deus Ex Criticized precisely for this aspect (many have refused to consider it an RPG precisely because of its first-person setting and action-style and real-time combat), SS2 excelled in the reconstruction of a distressing atmosphere and in the characterization of the character, offering to the gamer the most complete customization of the style of play as well as a unique gaming experience, but he was not really able to gather the same opinions from the critics among the public. Masterpiece or not, System Shock2 has been able to bring action game enthusiasts closer to RPGs, thanks to its dynamism and tension: today, Deus Ex takes up its legacy, bringing the game model to still more excellent peaks; first-person view, game action linked to character development, deep interaction with the game world (and with the plot itself) and with the numerous non-player characters, weapon and character customization: all winning features of Ss2 che Deus Ex reworks and amplifies, achieving a result capable of standing as a new benchmark for future role-playing games. Not only from that incredible Sci-fi adventure Deus Ex collects the stealth approach (i.e. the need to avoid open confrontations with multiple enemies as much as possible, which would lead to the elimination of the character in a short amount of time), but also from another game, which likewise garnered less acclaim than it probably should have, namely Thief. As in it, in fact, we will often find ourselves listening to the speeches of enemy guards and civilians, trying to snatch important information that could reveal fundamental clues about the plot (which will really reserve many surprises, and which depends - up to half to be precise - entirely from the choices we will make during the adventure), or indications on places otherwise accessible only through the manipulation of doors (in this case it would cost us lockpicks, really precious in many cases, to force the locks of buildings or drawers) or security systems (that can be hacked thanks to the presence of some multitools that can be collected during the game); and here too the choice to bypass the enemy guards instead of facing them openly (or alternatively killing them silently with the many different ways that are proposed to us) is more a necessity than a possibility. But... let's take it easy. Don't believe anything America, near future. The world is on the verge of collapse, bent by the actions of a terrorist group (NSF), capable of spreading a terrible virus across the globe capable of exterminating more than half of the world's population, with particular reference to the poorest populations and destitute: here we come into play, taking control of J.C. Denton, an agent of Unatco (the world's defensive force) with a rather mysterious past and cybernetic grafts, and we will have the task, under the supervision of our brother, of investigating the terrorist activities of the NSF, trying to recover the stocks of viruses still in the their hands. If this is only the initial incipit of the plot, soon we will be enveloped, thanks to a truly cinematographic plot cut, by the many events that will involve us in a story with a thousand implications, where the truth will become the lie, and where what it is presented how what is to be destroyed will soon be different in our eyes... even if everything will depend on what we want to believe and who we agree with. In fact, at different points in the game we will be offered different alternatives of action, and based on our choice, the plot will develop accordingly: who will we believe, our superior or the enemy, who will we kill, our comrade or the terrorist, what will we do? , we will steal what has been asked of us but to whom will we deliver it? The sense of involvement that a design choice of this type manages to give is truly remarkable, since as we progress with the game, it seems that it shapes itself under our choices and our decisions, giving an atmosphere and a immersiveness rarely seen in other titles. Believe me Leaving aside any other detail of the plot (since the strength of the title also lies in the different twists and turns that you encounter, and which sometimes force you to direct your actions in one direction or another), what really strikes you about Deus Ex it is the impression that the game world is realmliving entity, that the many non-player characters with whom you will interact have their own existence, sometimes depending on your choices and your behaviors: approach them and listen to their speeches (thus catching information that can prove to be important for really understanding the game world , to understand who pushes you to do what), try to exchange goods or get them to sell you something that you otherwise won't find during the game, interrogate them several times to acquire more information, kill them or let them live... and every choice we will make ( especially in the first two thirds of the game, while in the last one, when the main plot has taken over, the plot will unravel in a rather linear way, at least until the end, when we will even be faced with three different endings - and our choice will decree the end of the adventure -) it will influence subsequent events. The search for details is even enhanced in the less relevant ones: at a certain point during the game I entered a women's bathroom and found myself in front of an upset lady who asked me ~What are you doing, do you want a show ?~, and once I went out I continued on my way; after about half an hour the head of operations called me (again, I try to reveal as little of the plot as possible) and after the debriefing he said ~Hey, Denton, stop going to the women's rooms, these are things that are not there here they like~. And, finally, after about 10 hours of play I returned to the place and approached a couple who was chatting: after listening to their conversation for a while, I intervened, but the woman rudely told me ~What you want, can't you see we're talking?~, to which her conversationalist immediately asked her ~Darling, is there something wrong?~ and she, annoyed, ~Nothing... it's just Denton, the one from the women's bathroom that I told you about...~. Now take this example and with a little imagination extend it to the main plot: Deus Ex reserves many surprises in this sense. If the interaction with the numerous non-player characters, who very often will entrust us with sub-quests (perhaps in the form of assassination, the search for some objects or simple information) undoubtedly proves to be one of the cornerstones of the game, giving the world that surrounds us an aura of reality (actually one can almost speak of Virtual Word) and unprecedented dynamism, the same can be said for the numerous objects that populate the rooms and environments that we will encounter: is there a lamp? certainly you can turn it on to have some light (and thus save the energy of our reserve); is there a closed door? we can try to break in to open it....; there is a book? let's read it to see what is written; is there an electronic journal or a memo? let's open it to look for some information, perhaps on defensive codes or to raise some money; is there a fridge? inside there will be food that can come in handy; are we in front of a computer? let's hack it, disable the defense systems or look at some camera; an ATM? there is money waiting for us; is there a cupboard or a drawer? surely there is something inside, we must hope that it is worth the three lockpicks that we will have to use......... and so on. As regards the general setting of the game, as mentioned before, it clearly refers to SS2 and Thief, since throughout the game it will be necessary to avoid open clashes with multiple enemies or to be discovered by a security camera (the same noise of steps attracts the attention of enemies, and there is a special key to walk silently), because once some guard gets suspicious they will start looking for us (and complain, until they say ~Bah, it's just a little wind~ or maybe, I don't wish it ~Hey, it's Denton, remember the Briefing!~) and as soon as it spots us, it won't waste time facing us, but will run to immediately activate the nearest alarm... provided that no one has already disabled it before with an unrepentant hacker maneuver. Forget the unbridled action of Doom, this is not the title: strike silently from a distance (many weapons allow it), perhaps put to sleep with a poisoned dart or stun the guard behind with an electric shock, then load the body onto the shoulders and hide it in a dark street, or alternatively leave it in the sunlight to use it as bait for other guards; while such a setup certainly requires a great deal of patience, the satisfaction that comes from killing an enemy from a distance is greater than that experienced in many pure-action titles. Advice But how to set up the game? Kill with a weaponwhite, try to sneak through grates protected by bypassable security systems or strike with energy weapons? Building a character capable of using rifles, pistols, or simply very skilled at hacking any protection? All of this will depend on your choices, and each choice you make will have a different effect on the action of the game; in fact, if you choose to increase your ability to use pistols, when you use one the sight will remain more stationary than when you use a rifle or a large caliber weapon, and your percentage (as well as the distance with which it will be lethal) of being able to hit the target will increase based on your specialization in the use of the weapon. Do you prefer to kill from a distance? Concentrate your improvements in the use of the shotgun, and after a while the crosshair will no longer move wildly (which will prevent you from aiming - this is the first time it has been implemented, only in Thief we have seen something like this - and you will be forced to rely more on chance than on your ability) but it will remain stationary ... as far as possible, of course. But how to improve the character, how to increase characteristics? Like any self-respecting rpg (and Deus Ex is a Mr. Rpg) you will have to earn skill points with actions, which unlike classic rpg, are really of a different kind: pick up an object, explore an area, kill someone, save them, collect information, process data on the computer...: moreover, not only the main objectives of the mission (which are generally assigned to us by our superiors, whether they are good or bad) will bring experience points, but also every small subquest entrusted to us by the most insignificant of NPC characters (explanatory the one requested at a certain point by a homeless man who is met only if one explores a secondary area). The points will thus be distributable in the characteristics of the character: ability to use the computer, to break open doors, to use pistols, rifles, heavy weapons, energy weapons, ability to heal, swim, resist electric discharges... Furthermore, during the adventure it is possible to install some ~ augmentations ~ in our body, capable of temporarily increasing (until we channel the electric energy of our body, rechargeable through cells scattered around the game or through the maintenance robots of many electrical systems) some of our abilities, or even to give us new abilities: seeing through walls, running faster, becoming invisible to the human or robotic eye, being able to resist any mechanical attack for a certain time, being able to self-generate life points...; also in this case, every time we find these ~ augmentations ~, we will be called to make choices, since each of them can give us two powers, but each one is unique and will occupy a single place in our body. This is perhaps one of the few critical aspects of the game: it is true that these abilities make the character truly powerful, but the choice to leave them active only as long as we use energy (which thus becomes the second source of life to monitor after health ) is partly unacceptable, even if, to tell the truth, it is rather suited to the general setting of the game, i.e. the reconstruction of reality. Whenever we choose to increase one characteristic or another, we will thus indelibly mark our style of play, and we will specialize in the use of some weapons: however, the same weapons that we will meet in the course of the adventure will in turn be modifiable thanks to the use of some modifiers scattered (rather hidden, actually) in the levels: some of them will allow us to decrease the weapon's reload time, others to increase its clip capacity, others to increase the accuracy percentage. .: unlike Ss2 in this case the weapons will not be (fortunately, or unfortunately) degradable, and so we will be able to dedicate ourselves to perfecting some weapons that we will carry with us until the end of our adventure, which will gradually become more and more lethal: but. .. is it worth upgrading a simple gun when at the end of the game we will meet a lot of robotic enemies? Is upgrading this pulse weapon really going to be a good deal? Should I use this mod now to free up inventory space (which is limited) or save it for later in hopes of finding a more powerful weapon? Also in this case Deus Ex leaves every possible decision to you... You can find the touch of genius, of total immersion in what appears to be a living world, and it remains", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
