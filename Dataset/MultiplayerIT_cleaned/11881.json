{"name": "Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/company-of-heroes-opposing-fronts-recensione.html", "text": "However you look at it, there are very few software houses that manage to churn out excellent titles on repeat in the modern video game industry, almost never missing a beat. Among this small group is certainly Relic Entertainment, which last year embellished its tradition of real-time strategy with the masterpiece Company of Heroes. Twelve months later, this provoked enthusiasm has not yet subsided, causing us to approach this premiere with great curiosity ... well, understanding the nature of Opposing Fronts is necessary and not trivial. The definition that could best fit is stand alone expansion, presenting new content created on the past basis, without however requiring you to have installed the original. In reality, the goodness of the product almost elevates it to a real following, making it attractive to old and new admirers. The setting taken from the Second World War has been retained in its entirety, however the focus has been shifted to the events that have distinguished the German and mixed sides, made up of British and Canadians. The efforts of the programmers have therefore been aimed at guaranteeing a certain continuity, so as not to distort the functioning basic structure and innovating only where strictly necessary. It is with these premises that Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts launches the challenge for the palm of the best RTS between now and the upcoming Christmas holidays, clashing with as many valid games, above all the incredible World in Conflict. Sauerkraut and pudding The gameplay, for those not aware of it, offers an interesting alternative to the classic mass battles on a very large scale: rather than favoring this structure, in fact, it was decided to give the user the command of a more limited number of units , equipped with a good amount of personalized elements and for whose upgrades - as well as for the request for fresh new forces - it is necessary to conquer predefined portions of the map, to be possessed consecutively, so as to create a sort of imaginary ~bridge supplies~. Obviously there is no shortage of objectives, primary and secondary, almost always linked to the conquest of specific areas or to their defense. By satisfying the former, the completion of the mission is guaranteed, while with the latter, medals and awards are earned which can then be spent to replenish the war potential and one's ego. There are also a couple of additions that cannot fail to be appreciated: climatic changes influence the clashes, just think of a crawler that moves in the middle of the mud, while the so-called ~persistent missions~ have been increased, i.e. those where the changes made by the user to the battlefield through the exploitation of the physics engine, will remain visible and will affect the experience even in subsequent vicissitudes. The Anglo-Canadian campaign takes place during the bloody battle for the conquest of Caen, with long attack sessions alternating with other maintenance sessions. The troops in question prove to be particularly skilled in the construction of trenches and in the creation of weapons from a distance - mortars above all - so as to make their use rather strategic and thoughtful. Also very interesting is the introduction of the figure of the captain, whose influence will make the results obtained by the other soldiers more effective, both temporally and qualitatively. The Teutonic fights will instead take place during the famous Market Garden, an operation that saw the Panzer Elite forces clash with the allied ones for the dominance of some road junctions of fundamental importance. More attention will be paid here to the means, being any simple grenadier capable of repairing or improving the war equipment of tanks and off-road vehicles; an enormous firepower, therefore, which however risks clouding less reflective minds, leading to excessive exposure which often ends up having disastrous consequences. Easier to master, on the other hand, is the ability to place traps and facilitate ambushes inside or near buildings, obviously hoping that the enemy does not eat the leaf, making the long preparations made in vain. All this manages to glue to the monitor for several hours and makes this single player experience more full-bodied and lasting than the one seen in the original Company of Heroes. Challenges to the death and the rebirth of the senses Obviously could not miss a good multiplayer support, online and via Lan, which will allow up to eight players to clash divided into two teams. The modalities are those already tested in the original, but the two new forces in the field drastically expand the number of possible scenarios. From this point of view, one can only praise the work doneor in the balancing phase, which does not seem to have major flaws and will let only the individual's skills and his knowledge of the maps make the difference between a victory and a defeat. Even on the mod front, it is more than reasonable to expect a significant surge in productions after the release of this Opposing Fronts. Technically, the beauty of buildings, units and landscapes does not seem to have undergone the passage of time, once again placing themselves at the top offered by the genre: seeing a dozen wagons in movement that break down in a credible way - also thanks to the splendid physics - houses and walls , to then collide between flashes of lights and thunderous explosions, is all the more believable and galvanizing. If then you were in possession of a graphics card that supports DirectX 10 and Windows Vista installed on your computer, the already very good light effects and volumetric smoke will undergo a further improvement. The audio is also more than positive which, musical themes excluded, does not seem to have undergone significant changes from what has been heard in the past.

Comment Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a game in its own right in all respects that shares the backbone with the original, however offering an even deeper and more long-lived single player sector. Both German and Anglo-Canadian forces have unique quirks, requiring attention and study to master, with missions that are tailored perfectly around their strengths and weaknesses. An always valid multiplayer and a sumptuous audio-visual system conclude a flattering, convenient and unmissable picture for old fans and new curious ones. To be taken without reservations if you are a fan of the genre, otherwise it still deserves a thorough test. Pros Two completely new campaigns Excellent balance and variety of the two factions introduced Technically valuable Cons Few innovations to the gameplay To run at its best it requires a very performing computer", "date": "2007-10-30", "grade": null}
