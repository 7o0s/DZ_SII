{"name": "NinjaTown - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninjatown-recensione.html", "text": "Obviously we're joking, the enemies par excellence of ninjas can be of any type depending on the various interpretations... NinjaTown, however, offers us a situation that we have never seen before: very sweet, very chubby and very cute ninjas who beat like savages, grappling with an army of devils led by the evil Mr. Demon, all in a singular combination of strategy, management and action. Both main components of the game (gameplay and ~personality~) have very specific sources of inspiration, the first of which we immediately analyze. Valiant defenders Are you familiar with Tower Defense? This is a very lucky freeware game, that is to say to download and play at will on your PC without paying a penny, all focused on the management, in real time, of the defenses of a tower from the assaults of the invading armies. Basically, the player has resources at his disposal and uses them to build and/or upgrade training buildings, which in turn produce knights; these will then automatically take care of eliminating any enemy, whose attacks occur in waves of variable but always quite substantial numbers, should be found nearby. The more enemies you eliminate, the more resources you collect and the more buildings you can build and upgrade; without forgetting that just as there is not a single type of enemy there is not even a single type of soldier in one's army, but there are several, each suitable for a different situation, and so complicating things more and more with special buildings , particular powers... All this, don't forget it, in real time, ie without the possibility of stopping the opposing waves to reorganize the defences. Well, NinjaTown is exactly this: not a single novelty has been made to the concept (the variants and additions are different, as we will see), but this is not said to be a bad thing given the fortune of the progenitor and the stylus / Touch interface Screen of the Nintendo DS, perhaps even more suitable than the mouse for this new genre. This time, however, we find ourselves defending an entire city, the NinjaTown of the title, inhabited exclusively by - guess what - ninjas, from the assaults of Mr. Demon's army, intent on stealing the very precious and very secret recipe for Ninja Sweets, heart button of the NinjaTown economy and also the only resource through which Ol' Master Ninja, who would then be the head of the city defenses, as well as the character you play, can build and upgrade the various buildings. Ninja vs. Devils The city is divided into nine neighborhoods, each of which in turn into four different zones, levels. The first seven to eight levels run smoothly, giving you the opportunity to practice the concept of the game and perhaps the illusion that the whole title is ultimately very easy. There would be no greater mistake: already from the third district NinjaTown shows what it is made of, with the developers who use all the means at their disposal to complicate your life with great ease. For example, while in the first levels the roads on which the demons to be driven away pass are one-way, later we will have crossroads, double meanings, parallels in such a way as to have to find a point on the map by building on which the whole level is kept at bay, or even keep an eye on two or more centers at the same time; again, if at the beginning the sequences of enemies will be slow and all in all rather predictable, in the long run, in addition to the obvious increase in speed, there will also be combinations of enemies that are difficult to manage if not memorizing them by preparing in advance to know which huts Ninjas to build, and maybe even which ones to break down once their task is done to recover precious Treats, which always seem too few. And yes, because there are a large number of different types of Ninja, each more suitable for one of the equally numerous types of enemy; add special buildings that modify the characteristics of your soldiers, and the special powers with which the Ol' Master Ninja enters the field directly and you have the complete picture of a very rich and profound game, with a fundamentally strategic thinking but with an essential Action component: it is precisely the fact of being in real time, without being able to really stop and think between one wave and another, which will often and willingly lead you to have to start over. But without ever getting frustrated because, and this is one of the strengths of the game, the desire to go back to the level is always great: in fact, NT has the ability to be deep and complicated while seeming very light, thanks also to the duration of each level which never exceeds 15, maximum 20 minutes; you will start each game thinking of dedicating yourself to a simple onepastime and then end up entangled without realizing it in the most multitasking strategic thinking possible and in the classic mechanism of ~one more game and then I'll stop!~ Ninja style Like the Shawnimals product line from which it is inspired, NinjaTown features that now classic childish-stylized-cool design that is all the rage in US television animation today: the ninjas and devils are so smurfy and cute, as well as characterization of the characters and history are adorably light, insubstantial, so stupid as to become almost unconsciously intelligent and ~Simpson-esque demented~. Technically, however, we don't record anything significant, apart from the fact that the 2D engine seems made to handle a large amount of sprites simultaneously on the screen, a situation in which missed shots are few; all this is paid for with only average details and colors, but all in all it's okay. Even the music falls perfectly into the ~stupid~ category, techno-Japanese enough to get into your head without having any particular merit. A game, in short, which at first sight seems like a child's game, but which upon closer inspection as a child isn't that much, first of all because all the humour, as always happens in similar cases, is a bit wasted with a audience of infants, but above all for the already mentioned difficulty: difficulty that among other things, together with the number of levels and the wireless multiplayer mode for two players (even with a single card, however having to give up many maps in this case), helps make NinjaTown a very long-lived game. Comment A very pleasant surprise, this NinjaTown! The guys from Venan Games have succeeded in the not easy aim of combining lightness and complexity, not only giving a humorous ~dress~ to a very deep, frenetic and demanding game, but really managing to make the player forget this complexity that every time he starts the game to face a fast and fun experience, when maybe five minutes earlier he had turned off the DS cursing all the saints on the calendar. In fact NinjaTown is not really to be recommended to those of you who find yourself having very little patience, because in these cases the commitment can turn into frustration, but otherwise it has no particular contraindications and if the challenge doesn't scare you, buy it without reserves! Pros Extremely smart game Challenging, deep and frenetic but never heavy Insane, ironic, stylish! Against Technically, more could have been done Maybe even too difficult...", "date": "2009-01-08", "grade": null}
