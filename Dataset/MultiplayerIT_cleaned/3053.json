{"name": "Towers of Everland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/towers-of-everland-recensione.html", "text": "The Towers of Everland review puts us in front of a traditional-style dungeon crawler, with a fantasy setting and a grid-based movement system that is nevertheless characterized by real-time movement and combat mechanisms. Our goal in the game is naturally that to explore places full of pitfalls but also of treasures, in this case not underground but increasingly higher towers, on top of which there is an airship that we can use from time to time to escape. Will we still be good enough to get there alive? Available free exclusively for Apple Arcade subscribers, the new Cobra Mobile title first of all asks you to choose your hero from among four different characters: the Villain, shrewd and quick; the Wizard, frail but able to attack from a distance with his spells; the Guardian of the City, a skilled and poised armored knight; and finally the Stone Golem, a rocky creature that makes raw power its main advantage. For our tests we have selected this last class, making it grow from expedition to expedition and equipping it in order to transform it into a real war. Gameplay: one step here, one step there The first impact with Towers of Everland is unfortunately spoiled by a small obstacle: the game supports Bluetooth controllers and there is no doubt that using physical commands the gameplay appears more immediate and engaging, but at the same time navigating through the menus is cumbersome and is done by touching the screen. On the other hand, by opting only for the touch controls, you come across a whole series of inaccuracies and difficulties in the middle of the action, generally lateral swerves that are mistaken for rotations and which weigh down the experience a lot, making it frustrating when these shortcomings lead us to an undeserved game over. In short, a combination of controller and touch, pending updates, is the best solution for playing with this dungeon crawler, whose structure immediately appears rather simple and linear: you gradually access more complex missions, with more strong and resistant, and at the same time we obtain treasures and objects capable not only of making us level up but also of composing increasingly effective and even versatile equipment. Warriors can in fact choose whether to use a main weapon (sword, hammer, axe, scimitar, etc.) and a shield or two weapons to switch between, perhaps one slow and one fast (a dagger?), opting for rapid movements in order to avoid the enemy's blows rather than parry them. However, the combat system is not very thick, and this inevitably ends up making the game repetitive. we buy new ones and upgrade the guilds to offer us a greater number of services (including tasks and challenges), after a while this whole system reveals its limitations and the inability to propose new situations, net of a bestiary quite rich and varied. Technical realization The graphic style of Towers of Everland is somewhat reminiscent of Sea of Thieves, with some low poly contamination and, in general, the tendency to characterize the settings mainly based on the colors. However, the interior of the dungeons is generated by a procedural system and this implies inevitable limitations on the design front, with sometimes inexplicable architectures and a lot of barriers and obstacles in our way. As just mentioned, the enemies are divided into numerous types and offer therefore a fairly varied show, but they have a very limited set of animations. Finally, little to report as regards the music, which could have made a difference but is limited to accompanying the action in a functional way.", "date": "2020-06-06", "grade": "7.0"}
