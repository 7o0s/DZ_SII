{"name": "Skul: The Hero Slayer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skul-the-hero-slayer-recensione.html", "text": "We are long gone from the ~dark period~ in which the triple-A world was afflicted with such a creative plague that it led to a renaissance of indie titles. Today, for an indie to be able to break through, a perfect storm is needed, usually represented by a successful mix of word of mouth and wildfire on the most popular channels. Even when the quality of the game is high, however, it takes a lot of luck because all the factors line up perfectly, and even more if the video game in question comes from markets very distant from ours such as the Asian one. Yet a small skeleton has emerged from the pile of titles made in Korea (which often don't even arrive in the West) and magically managed to make itself known after facing a long Early Access. The review of Skul: The Hero Slayer therefore speaks of a small phenomenon in the roguelike genre, which has been able to distinguish itself thanks to a plethora of positive reviews on Steam, and a truly exciting atypical formula. Here's what we think. Little undead heroes As we have already said in the introduction, Skul is a roguelike, even if to be exact it should be placed in the roguelite subgenre, since despite the fact that in this game you lose the progression of the campaign when you die (it's all over in one go, basically, and there are no internal checkpoints), both the stat increase and the specific (and useful) NPCs released in the various chapters are kept. Obviously this takes less than an hour in total if you never die, but don't think this is a short game: before finishing it you will have to replay the chapters dozens and dozens of times, since only the most monstrously skilled players will be able to able to close the adventure in a handful of attempts without the necessary upgrades. The narrative, for its part, is designed to be a pleasant side dish to the action and nothing more, and is gutted through short films (moreover dubbed in Korean) after the defeat of the main bosses. Everything revolves around the minute protagonist, Skul, who finds himself having to save the lord of demons after his capture and defeat at the hands of the most powerful hero of the kingdom of Carleon. Certainly not unforgettable as a premise, but if nothing else less trivial than it seems, due to a couple of pleasant twists. Not that we expected much better: as a roguelite Skul is not a game based on history, but on gameplay and replayability; a video game basically designed to be enjoyable even when it has been gutted to the maximum limit and you only want to aim for speed runs. And in this, fortunately, Southpaw's work is extremely good. Skills for skulls At first glance, Skul's structure would seem largely borrowed from that of Dead Cells, with the protagonist able to significantly enhance himself and obtain new abilities through the discovery of multiple objects from picture to picture. This happens, however, without the procedural levels with fixed elements that brought that title closer to a strange mix between a roguelite and a metroidvania, in favor of much more basic frameworks with a repeated conformation (even if their appearance during a game remains random). This simplification should make Skul a more meager and repetitive title, but here the gem that distinguishes it from the crowd takes over: the ability of the little protagonist to change class by replacing his head with those found in the various maps. Skul can in fact choose which reward to find at the end of a map by entering doors with clear decorations (they are of three types, and only one or two are available at a time); if you select those related to skulls, you can randomly find an impressive number of different classes, divided by rarity, and all equipped with unique passive powers and abilities. Seriously, we start from four differentiated soldier classes, and we get to ninjas, liches, ghost rider emulators, rock stars, alchemists, spinning barbarians, or dark paladins, for a truly laudable final variety. The only problem? The general balance: the rarest classes are, more often than not, monstrously stronger than the common skulls, and even if in the game it is possible to sacrifice the less desirable heads to obtain bone fragments and bring every single specialization to legendary level before the end of a run (although doing so really requires a lot of destroyed skulls), a handful of these choices are extraordinarily more exaggerated than others - Reaper and Archlich above all - to the point of allowing you to reach advanced stages of the game even with very limited power-ups. And we assure you that it is no small matter, given the difficultygeneral age of the work. Easy to learn hard not to crack In fact, although mechanically the game is not particularly complex - we are talking about a basic system that has two skills at most per class, a multiple dodge (not always), a double jump and very simple attack combos - the presence of numerous enemies and rather diversified, of traps on the ground, and of bosses that are anything but relaxed, makes Skul an experience at times brutal, and focused on quick reflexes and on the study of enemy patterns until the protagonist develops enough to be able to get around the obstacles of the game. This is absolutely welcome, mind you: if it were a too simple roguelite it would get boring quickly, and the presence of skills that can be used when changing class (up to two can be equipped at a time), as well as a long series of other modifiers, it only adds to the fun. At the same time, however, the high level of challenge underlines even more the imbalances of the game when facing a particularly unfortunate or sun-kissed game, since a terrifying boss can be canceled in a matter of seconds with the right combination of bonuses and powers. The random element further increases when analyzing the passives linked to each individual object, which at a certain point lead to accumulating such a number of additional effects as to be almost overwhelming. For heaven's sake, a little experience still allows you to ~control~ everything at least partially, yet there are roguelites with very clever expedients to limit the delirium of dice rolls, and Skul does not seem to want to worry about it in the same way. Paradoxically, these excesses manage to be part of the charm of the game, which in addition to being a blast also boasts very inspired pixel art and a remarkable overall care. Balanced or not, we find it really difficult not to recommend it.", "date": "2021-02-03", "grade": "8.2"}
