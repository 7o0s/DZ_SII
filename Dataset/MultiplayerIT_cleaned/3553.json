{"name": "Street Kart Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-kart-racing-recensione.html", "text": "Street Kart Racing, the subject of this review, targets a specific sub-genre, that of kart racers on mobile, and sets itself the clear goal of dominating it in every aspect: from the driving model to the rendering of the physics, from the precision of the controls to the multiplayer integration, passing through a progression system that undoubtedly represents the most interesting and engaging part of the experience. The small development team behind this project literally took years to arrive at the final version, available on the App Store at the price of 5.49 euros, and made use of the collaboration of various professional pilots, actually present among the verified accounts and possibly ready to challenge you on the game tracks. After creating a profile and completing a short tutorial, we will be able to make our debut in the rookies' championship and gradually increase our score and experience, ringing victories and completing challenges to overcome the rivals of the moment, unlock sponsorship and finally get to the promotion in the next category. The structure, with its multiple possibilities, follows our progress hand in hand, opening new sections of the menu (Race, Missions, Sponsorship, Garage, Crew, Showroom and Apparel Store) when we have assimilated the basics of the experience and are ready to take another step, whether it's accessing the clothing store or the kart store. All elements are subject to wear and this invariably leads us to think about microtransactions, given that everything has to be paid for: the action energy that determines the possibility of racing, the vehicle's fuel, the replacement of worn tires and even the rider accessories, subject to gradual wear and tear with consequences that produce disadvantages on the track. Let's say that this possibility exists, but it seems limited to any extras: for the rest, it is enough to compete normally to have the virtual credits necessary to pay for everything we need to support our career. Furthermore, even the hard currency is given with discreet generosity, and if you want it is possible to watch advertising trailers to collect more. Gameplay and structure Beyond the possible controversies regarding the business model chosen for Street Kart Racing, there is one aspect of the experience that certainly matters more than the others and which pushes us to appreciate the Fat Cigar Productions title without hesitation: the gameplay. Plain and simple. It is possible to choose between two different types of controls, touch or tilt, but the first option for the moment is very limited and doesn't hold a candle to the comparison with the second, which instead allows you to paint the curves, measure the accelerator and brake surprisingly well (with quick taps of the second to avoid wheel lockup) and, in general, having fun once you hit the track. Everything works very well, the strictly first person view keeps the involvement high and with practice you get real improvements in the times on the track, even in view of specific challenges. There are interesting and appreciable facets, for example jumping on the curb can in some cases be an advantage but in others it can lead to collapse, making the kart uncontrollable for one instant too long. In the same way, off-piste can be fatal: if you recover quickly it is possible to return to the asphalt, otherwise it is the game itself that pushes us off and in this case the only thing to do is to call a match referee to recover us from the quagmire, inevitably losing a few seconds. In short, the system is very solid and the few blunders still present, such as an unrealistic rendering of collisions, do not in any way affect the enjoyment of the experience. After that, as already mentioned, there is a rich and interesting progression system that always keeps the interest alive, and which constantly sets new objectives: rivalry with other pilots, virtual or real, or specific achievements to unlock to get more points . Within a single category there is a tendency to repeat the same tracks over and over again, but the possibility of participating in races with AI opponents or human players in online multiplayer (which becomes the norm in higher leagues) increases just enough variety. From a technical point of view, a good job has been done, although the limits of the independent production are very clearly visible: the simplistic and dated realization of the sky, some not exactly sophisticated geometries, basic effects and a good audio sectorna quality, but with some sounds decidedly out of place.", "date": "2019-08-11", "grade": "8.0"}
