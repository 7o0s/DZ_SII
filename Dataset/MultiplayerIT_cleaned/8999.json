By now we know everything about the new, gigantic DICE project, but only now thanks to a copy that has arrived in the editorial office we have been able to test the entire game offer. Battlefield 3 is made up of three distinct and separate sectors: the single player campaign, a real novelty for the franchise, the six cooperative missions for two online players and obviously the multiplayer, the true heart of the product. Without too many words it is possible to state immediately that the campaign and co-op are not up to the competitive part of the game, but they represent just a little homework not too well done, graced only by a cosmetic that has no equal on PC, and that manages to push us to go beyond the obvious problems. But let's go in order. Burning Persia The campaign is pure political fantasy delirium and narrates, choosing a game of joints and flashbacks, the story of the marine Blackburn, who from a simple soldier will find himself the arbiter of world destiny. We are in northern Iraq, a hot spot grappling with the pro-independence pushes of the PLR led by Faruck Al Bashir. During a ~simple~ mission in the city, an earthquake devastates the whole region, setting the stage for a coup d'tat in Iran that will bring Al Bashir to power in the Persian country. The American response is obvious: having abandoned the defensive phase in Iraq, it throws itself headlong into the invasion of its powerful neighbour. This in summary is the casus belli of the game, but instead of choosing a ~linear~ setting in staging the battlefield, the Swedish boys decided to shuffle the cards on the table, starting from the last moments of the game and going back telling the action through multiple points of view, which often converge almost as we have already seen in Danger Close's Medal of Honor. By doing so, the story makes us get to know and impersonate different characters but, thanks to the skimpy cutscenes and real holes and far too daring script leaps, everything appears decidedly disconnected and not very intelligible, immediately pushing us into the middle of the action, without however, no regard for the ~emotional~ preparation of it. Obviously this is Battlefield and not Bad Company, ~strong~ characters to empathize with are not required, but for this reason it is not permissible to limit yourself to making simple extras who enter and leave the scene and who do not have an iota of charisma even when they should be stealing the scene in the climax of the progression. The villain Solomon is the emblem of the narrative defeat of the title in this sense. In short, everything remains very cold and told in a very superficial way, even if to be honest, some sections are interesting for how they accelerate the precipitation of events by dragging us for a few moments into what is happening around us. Unfortunately, a weak narrative part also corresponds to a gameplay that fails, except in rare cases, to detach itself from a mediocrity that is saved only for the amazing cosmetics. The twelve missions that make up the title, for a total of about five hours of gameplay at a normal level, confirmed the impressions we had during the last press tour. Meanwhile, there has been no repentance, here too we are on the same wavelength as Bad Company 2 and the American competition, or linearity and scripting to mark the roadmap, let's forget open spaces and freedom of movement. But just like for the spin-off of the franchise, the bite is completely missing, the missions in fact continue one after the other without any flicker with zero pathos and memorable moments reduced to a flicker, and only in some situations, to the grandeur of the part technique are counterbalanced by well-orchestrated events that make us shout ~what a show!~, as during the long night battle in Tehran or the breakneck race of the Russians (with straw tails) in Paris. Furthermore, it is impossible to overlook the flaws related to artificial intelligence often guided by invisible directives that lead enemies to keep going without even looking at us, not even trying to avoid a grenade or always passing through the same point. Fortunately, in some situations the enemy's crossfire can put us in difficulty, but there are too few moments built with care and too many that expose the defects of behavioral routines. The light of death To this we must add sections on vehicles that are little more than a tired target practice, with the negative vertex of bombing missions in which you do nothing but keep ground targets locked, ~just reward~ for having shot down enemy MIGs without even having piloted the plane. Good instead the second part of the missione on a tank, in which DICE lets us experience the entrance to Tehran by re-enacting the American capture of Baghdad in 2003, between ambushes from overpasses and car bombs on a collision course. There is no shortage of spectacular moments, but one gets the impression that everything is due more to the graphics engine than to the actual gameplay, which is enhanced by a credible construction of the environments, faithfully reproduced down to the smallest detail, with a vast visual horizon - the sniper's night mission is emblematic in this sense - and which manages to make light (or its absence) the true protagonist of the game. The lighting system is not only perfect and realistic in coloring the scene, but manages to make the flaws of the campaign less marked. The lights of the torches that blind us will remain imprinted, as well as the red targeting lasers, as lethal as they are useful in making the enemies who shoot at us visible in the dark, perhaps even made indistinguishable by smoke, or hidden by the dust raised by shots and explosions. A real fog of war, as per tradition one of the strengths of the Frostbyte 2 engine. Ultimately, this campaign has left a bad taste in our mouths, because DICE basically has not been able to reconcile, or rather has been able to do only partially, realism and spectacularity, keeping the pace low on balance, not pushing the accelerator on destructibility (present in massive quantities only on the covers or in some ~controlled~ moments), not developing potentially explosive situations properly. It's a pity because the different missions that make up the campaign have several decidedly good moments, on the other hand there is a lot of stolen portable nuclear bombs involved, but when it comes to pulling the winning paw, Bach and his associates have given the 'impression of having pulled the brake, letting it all end without a pyrotechnic (and memorable) ending to close the situation. With a lot of recourse to quick time events to underline, negatively, the drama of the events. Beauty has a cost Battlefield 3 was tested on two different PCs, one high-end and one mid-range, just to establish clear macro-parameters. The GeForce GTX 570 GLH, flanked by a medium-low range quad core, allows you to play the entire campaign in Ultra quality, at 1080p, without ever falling below 30 FPS. The title however, it remains fully enjoyable, from an aesthetic point of view, too with the quality set to Low. In this case the game travels with an average of 65 frames per second on the 570 and it is without a doubt digestible by any mid-range DX11 card. The same thing it applies to almost all multiplayer maps even if at the maximum quality, in certain particularly agitated circumstances, is It is possible to see some slowdown even with a GTX 570 overclocked. By lowering the configuration, the frame rate and fluidity also dropped dramatically. By setting everything to Ultra at 1080p, with an I7 860 2.80ghz under the hood, 4 gigs of ram and an ATI Radeon HD 5870, the average frame rate on a demanding level like Operation Guillottine it stopped at 37 frames, with peaks negative and positive oscillating between 19 and 37, but not without showy slowdowns. In Medium and High the situation has definitely improved with averages that are between 46 FPS in the first and 40 in the second case, rather high values without losing too much graphic quality. Two is better As written at the beginning, the game offer also consists of a cooperative part, or (only) six missions along the lines of Modern Warfare's Spec Ops, to be played strictly online in two, therefore without the possibility of having a bot as a companion. Testing them we had rather positive sensations, and above all their variety is to be appreciated, in some ways ~superior~ to that of the campaign and more similar to multiplayer, but they are certainly not the main dish of the menu proposed by DICE. We have said variety, which includes pure stealth as in Exfiltration, in which we have to save a defector from the PLR in Tehran, between killings with silenced sniper rifles, security cameras to avoid and sudden shootings to face. Instead, quite the opposite happens in Hit and Run where it is immediately a 9-gauge concert, in which we have to keep several waves of enemies at bay while we try to take the precious ~intel~ away from a building, setting Claymore sights and dividing ourselves as necessary, cleaning floor by floor until you get to the garage where you run away by climbing into a car, killing other enemies and looking for the way out in the maze of the parking lot. Also interesting is the Fire from the Sky mission, aboard a helicopter, or the first, called Operation Exodus, in which you have to defend the propback to base during a general evacuation. Ultimately nothing to tear your clothes off about (with the same artificial intelligence problems of the campaign), but not even a game mode hastily inserted as an extra due in function of the competition, and with the plus of the (possible) replayability given by the score prominently displayed on Battlelog. Novelty The time has come to evaluate what is the heart of the game, namely the competitive multiplayer. The news, abundantly covered in the headquarters of preview, they are many, and they are not limited to inclusion only of the planes. The first change is the classes, different, or rather redesigned than those of Bad Company. The ~simple~ soldier, in short, the one equipped with an assault rifle will also have the role of doctor, there is no special class therefore, whoever plays on the front line he will also have the task of helping his comrades in difficulty by reviving them with the defibrillator or by releasing medkits. The engineer will continue to do what he was trained to do, i.e. blow up enemy vehicles with RPG shots and repair those of his own team. It is also equipped with a flashlight, useful in dark areas, which in the title DICE are really dark, but what above all it is an all-round weapon because it is capable of blinding opponents as if it were a moving flashbang, like the campaign sign. A good job has also been done for the machine gunner who now, using the right mouse button, can use the tripod to support the weapon, making the bursts more precise, thus being able to carry out suppressive fire, capable of immobilizing opponents and making their counterattacks less effective, as if it were some sort of ~negative buff~. To close the classes the inevitable sniper, with his gadgets, such as those to designate targets and to detect enemy movements, particularly useful in very large maps. Many will be on the alert thinking about possible ~imbalances~ compared to what was played on Bad Company and instead everything goes smoothly, enhancing team play, as never before, in which each specialization must play its role to achieve victory by coordinating perfectly , both in Corsa and Conquest. From this point of view, the deathmatch definitely loses importance compared to reasoned game modes, remaining only a small ~pastime~ useful as training for the heart of the game. Returning to the bomb on the vehicles, those made available by DICE are really many, all of which can be upgraded, as if they were simple firearms, including planes, the real flagship of the game. Alongside attack and transport helicopters, we can sit in the narrow cockpit of the F-18 and the highly armored one of the A-10 and of course their Russian counterparts, namely the Flanker and Frogfoot, to seek air supremacy with the first and launch fearsome CAS, also called ground attacks, with the second. At first glance, jets are terribly difficult to keep in the air, they are so sensitive, but you just need to have (a lot of) experience to become protagonists on the scene, changing the course of an attack or a defense. And, even more importantly, in maps where they are not provided, it is almost difficult not to look obsessively at the sky, looking for help or afraid to listen to the dull roar of the on-board cannon. Finally, yet another applause goes to the enormous number of unlockable objects and upgrades, from optics to new weapons, passing through highly advanced specializations and gadgets. In fact, Battlefield 3 really allows us to tailor our style of play, perfectly balancing every single change to the equipment of our alter ego. By the sea or in the city? But what do maps offer? Battlefield 3 offers nine maps on day one, a not very high number, but map packs are obviously already planned starting from the imminent Back To Karkand and in any case, thanks to the different modes and the breadth of the locations, the variety of situations is guaranteed. But let's go in order. Kharg Island will not be new to players of Battlefield. Like the famous Wake Island, this island oil clearinghouse is in fact entirely controlled, in Conquest mode, by a single faction. The opposing one is therefore engaged in a landing for the control of a beach. It is therefore a decidedly open map, although populated by some structures of the Iranian navy, which enhances the use of air vehicles and enhances snipers in the defensive phase. In Nosharh Canals, containers and moorings in profusion allow soldiers to proceed step by step to reach the nodal points, avoiding the fire of heavy weapons and snipers. It is no coincidence that the team chose indestructible structures and not too large spaces to keep the run & stop gameplay balanced", "date": "2011-10-24", "grade": "9.0"}
