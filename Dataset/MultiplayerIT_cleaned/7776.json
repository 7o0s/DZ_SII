{"name": "La gelida Russia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120369-company-of-heroes-2-la-gelida-russia.html", "text": "In 2006, the real-time strategy was largely anchored in styles imposed years earlier and successfully iterated through sequels and mountains of aftermarket products. As early as 2005, store shelves had been invaded by Age of Empires III, certainly not a revolution, and in England Creative Assembly had for some time invented a completely new formula to have its say in the complex genre straddling real time and shifts. Relic Entertainment, which has earned crowds of adoring fans in a few years above all thanks to the sensational space epic of Homeworld, was however almost ready to emerge from the icy snow of Vancouver to say something new. The Canadian team intended to stage the battles of '39-'45 on the screens, a scenario where there were no workers or drones intent on collecting resources, only brutal clashes with hundreds of lives left on the ground, armored vehicles and a battlefield to dominate with cunning. Action and fine micro-management of troops within highly interactive environments: is it possible to make such a leap towards an unexpected modernity in one fell swoop? Possible yes, to the point that Company of Heroes immediately becomes one of the best videogame products of that season, a success that earns two official expansions and the immediate countdown of fans, who will however have to wait until the summer of seven years later to start an official sequel. A second chapter that does not try to take a new photograph of the kind, rather prefers to recover the negative of the time and return to the darkroom to develop it in the light of progress and ideas that have emerged over time. The result is successful, to play and fun even if not perfect. Mother Russia Completing a partial version of the campaign of Company of Heroes 2, a beta with a handful of missions, a couple of months ago we had come to the conclusion that this time not only the title would have a rewarding gameplay and an important technical component, but also of a narrative structure and a playful coherence between the missions that really gave the impression of playing an epic adventure set during the Second World War. After having retraced the stories of Lev Abramovich Isakovich, the protagonist imprisoned in Siberia and the leitmotif of a campaign taking place on the Russian front, on the Soviet side, we must admit that the expectation was met only at times. The fourteen missions that make up the backbone of the single player experience are interspersed with cutscenes of less than thrilling quality, but that's only a small fraction of our partial disappointment. The game fails to satisfactorily introduce certain mechanics and the quality of the missions alternates exhilarating moments, such as the night hunt for a German Tiger tank or a brutal assault on the gates of Poznan, with others designed in a lazy way, as if they had been worked on for make wood and reach fifteen hours of duration. However, it is important to note that this qualitative swing concerns the variety of objectives and the diversity of situations, not the strategic gameplay itself. From that point of view Company of Heroes 2 is solid and firmly anchored in the philosophy that inspired the original. The resources available should be used to create the mix of simple soldiers, specialists and means necessary to control the maps, not to assemble huge armies to be launched carelessly against the opponent. Each cover is decisive and the relatively staid rhythm suggests choosing carefully where to place each fixed position or behind which wall to shelter your mortars. Being able to take a column of enemy tanks by surprise, perhaps by blowing up the thin ice under their tracks, means calling into question the inertia of an already lost game and thus being able to regain the meters and control points essential to have the best. Certain innovations, such as the so-called Cold Tech and the presence during some missions of extreme climatic conditions to protect against, are less effective than expected. But others, especially the ability to jump cover and a better simulation of the field of view, do their part to make the fight plausible. Unrealistic, given that the series has never claimed simulation claims. The title, like its predecessor, rather manages to transform typical suggestions of the time and of the conflict into strategic options. Having several means at your disposal requires you to walk around engineers, necessary to repair the very expensive war machines, while lethal solutions such as artillerymen and snipers require time and space to be preparedpositioned by the textbook, suggesting to blindly send young recruits ready to die. One of the pillars of the Russian army that left nearly nine million lives on the battlefield. All of this moving control groups, recruiting units and holding off different fronts is done - even practically through the interface and commands - by systems that are largely carbon copies of those of the original, of which Company of Heroes 2 is reveals a loyal following. Calling hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of fans, also meant creating an experience for the single player that at first will not make it easy for newbies to approach the title, but the effort will soon pay off. The three difficulty levels give a very good margin of customization, making commitment, gratification and even a pinch of frustration go hand in hand. The explosion Together with many of the characteristics typical of the series and of the genre, such as the creation of buildings and the development of upgrades or the need to impose one's dominion over the control points scattered around the map, in Company of Heroes 2 the ambitious use of an advanced technical component, exploited to say something significant even in playful terms. Depending on the composition of one's army, here more numerous than in the past, the clashes in the streets of a tormented Stalingrad can suggest taking advantage of the buildings to hide or tearing them down, minimizing the risks of ambushes and cul-de-sacs, lethal for the clumsy heavy forces on wheels and tracks. Explosions and shots then shape the playing field, blow up the covers and burn or demolish houses, walls and buildings. There is no other strategic with the same feedback and there are moments that amaze how well the dramatic implications of the conflict on the lives of soldiers are represented. The impact of the weather conditions on the gameplay, we said in the previous paragraph, has not been overturning but is mixed with other interactive elements of the scenario, such as the different properties of the surfaces trampled on, to reinforce a quality that very few real-time strategists can say they have , or that of making certain mechanics disappear from under the eyes, usually cold and calculated, and integrate them into the context of the game and the characters, therefore to the story told by each battle. Unfortunately, these undeniable qualities, which enhance the drama of each game, are compounded by problems, for example, related to path finding that is not always perfect, which in particular during single player missions, often set in denser maps than multiplayer ones, creates situations that are not pleasant. Even the menus and the interface, although reworked over the months, are still a bit too confusing and inelegant. On the purely visual side, the Essence Engine 3.0 derives directly from the previous versions. In fact Company of Heroes 2 does not move away from the past chapters for technical performance, limiting itself to improving the variety of environments and units. Here we go from lush woods to snowy expanses, cities razed to the ground and others just waiting for our passage to be put to the test, in a constant change of setting that always offers something new to discover. Unfortunately if in 2006 Company of Heroes brought several systems to their knees thanks to its advanced cosmetics, today its successor marks a decidedly less marked detachment, with evident qualitative drops involving certain surfaces and occasionally animations. Endless War Although it partially betrays the promises of a more orchestrated progression and fails to mark a marked technical step forward, we liked the single player campaign of Company of Heroes 2 and represents a valid starting point. We are not experts on the Eastern Front, but the scenarios, from Operation Barbarossa to the battle for Berlin, are credible and succeed in evoking the peculiarities of that bloody conflict, often fought below freezing. The long-term appeal is instead entrusted to two distinct methods. On the one hand there is Theater of War, a package that combines single player and cooperative maps, adding a considerable amount of useful hours especially for those who, having little experience with the genre or series, want other challenges before jumping into the multiplayer arena. The maps designed for Theater of War, which involves both the Russian protagonists of the campaign and the Germans, are about ten on each side and there is plenty to enjoy for a while. The competitive component is the definitive landing place for those who feel ready to spend the coming months on Company of Heroes 2 and, as with the rest of the title, the feeling of being in the presence ofof an updated multiplayer version of the original. Certainly not a negative aspect, given the quality of the same. In reality there are some innovations, for example the possibility of ~specializing~ control points by having resource accumulation nodes built on them, but the skeleton has remained unchanged. You challenge each other to the last point or to the last soldier standing, depending on the options, in battles of considerable dynamism and strategic breadth. To keep up with the times - and partly also to keep an open door for DLC - Relic has developed a meta progression that accompanies each mode and through the accumulation of points it unlocks aesthetic customizations, passive perks called Bulletins but above all new Commanders . Before each challenge, you can select a maximum of three Commanders - out of five available at launch, of which two to unlock - and once you have accumulated enough Battle Points, you choose one, which provides five active and passive skills. Depending on how you play the game and what tactics you adopt, one choice will be better than the other. The impact of the Commanders, which replace the concept of Doctrines, may appear marginal at first but the more you play, the more it becomes evident how much a careful choice can be worth winning the match. During the beta and the various phases that characterized the year, there were balancing and matchmaking problems, which in part still remain, but as always in this type of product, you need to be patient a little and wait for the inevitable post-launch adjustments to be implemented. In short, a product in the making as it should be. Company of Heroes 2 transports the original to the freezing conflict fought on the Russian front", "date": "2013-06-24", "grade": "8.8"}
