{"name": "The Lord of the Rings: Two towers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-lord-of-the-rings-two-towers.html", "text": "One Ring to rule them all and in the dark bind them. Anyone who has seen the two films ~The Fellowship of the Rings~ and ~The Two Towers~, respectively taken from the first two books of the trilogy, will surely know the fundamental parts of the plot which for the occasion have been transformed into levels, starting from locations from the first book and then end up in the battlefields of the second novel. By inserting the DVD into the tray, the FMV story I mentioned at the beginning will start immediately with images of the first revolt by Elves and Humans against the hordes of cruel orcs led by the evil Sauron, while you will see the video scroll through the filmed images will give way to their digital counterparts thanks to a masterfully created effect. Immediately after having attended the introductory part, you will magically and suddenly find yourself in the role of the one who defeated Sauron, Lord of the human race King Isildur. This first part will mainly serve to familiarize yourself with the basic attack and defense commands, after which you will be able to enjoy the end of the introduction and then begin the adventure. In the actual game, the first character you can use will be Aragorn son of Isildur heir to the throne of Condor, but, during the game according to your strategy, you can also choose Legolas the elf of Rivendell and Gimli the dwarf of Moria . Clearly, as expected, the choice of character will be made according to the level in which you will find yourself, in fact some levels require melee clashes, while others long-range clashes. At the end of each level a score will be given on the fighting style, this will give you a series of points that will give you the opportunity to add new lethal moves to defeat your enemies. The adventure is divided into twelve missions, including Helm's Deep, plus a secret one that you will unlock at the end of the game. Digital miracle? The graphic sector of this eagerly awaited Xbox title does not present many graphic differences from the PlayStation 2 version. As already made clear in the introduction, the graphic splendor of this game can be understood immediately from the CG movies, whose only flaw, if you will to be picky, it is found in some inaccuracies of the faces and on some textures, for the rest everything is impeccable. The fusion of footage taken from the film and digital animation takes place with a glissando effect that makes the passage slide perfectly, under the incredulous eyes of the players. The settings are varied and perfectly recreated, everything moves while maintaining a constant frame rate even in crowded situations, guaranteeing fluidity and a first-rate graphic impact. The animations of the characters are perfectly recreated and natural, the movements of the body in combat are made with painstaking care and sometimes it will seem like you are looking at the real counterpart. The controls may seem too easy but surely if you try to make more complex moves you will find bread for your teeth. The longevity of this title turns out to be well studied, in fact in the 12 levels you can choose who to use and finishing the game with all three characters will not be a simple thing, then of course you can repeat the adventure using the secret character, Isildur. Unfortunately the game does not provide that the single player mode. The sound relies as you can imagine on the original soundtrack of the film, the ambient effects and the voices of the other characters are well done, Dolby Digital ensures unparalleled immersion in the battle phases, you will notice how all the minimums noises have been transported in this video game version. In the middle ground Objectively, we are faced with a little gem of a video game that perhaps not everyone will understand. After countless licensed, poorly made, or underused titles, comes this little EA gem and it's not hard to predict that fans of the Tolkien film saga won't be disappointed. The only flaw perhaps, the possibility of playing only in single player, when the implementation of a cooperative multiplayer mode would have been welcome. In conclusion, I strongly advise everyone to at least try this title, which will not fail to excite you, whether you are a fan of the series or not, you will be kidnapped by the Middle-earth saga. Pros: Great graphics 2 levels of intense combat Three playable characters Cons: Some inaccurate textures Only single player option The world has changed, I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I feel it in the air. Much of what was has been lost, because now, no one lives who remembers it. All isbegan with the forging of the great rings, three were given to the Elves, immortal beings and wisest of all, seven to the kings of the Dwarves, great miners and builders of cities in the mountains, and nine, nine rings were given to the race of men, who more than anything else desire power. For in these rings were sealed the strength and will to rule all races, but all were deceived, for another ring was made, in the lands of Mordor in the flames of Mount Doom the dark lord secretly forged a sovereign ring , to control all the others and in this ring, he poured his cruelty, his wickedness and his will to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all... With these words begins the film version, taken from the trilogy, of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, perhaps the novel that started what is defined as the Fantasy literary genre.", "date": "2003-05-09", "grade": null}
