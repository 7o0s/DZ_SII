It has never happened that the soundtrack of a Final Fantasy has disappointed expectations: there may be more or less beautiful songs, more or less skilled composers, but it is impossible not to find at least one track in Final Fantasy that does not touch our heartstrings . In short, the idea of making a rhythm game out of it wasn't so crazy, and the indieszero developer has already won this bet two years ago with a title that, despite being decidedly low budget, despite the brand, has also made inroads in the skeptics, making them immediately fall in love with its simplicity and richness of content. The success of Theatrhythm was such that Square Enix also produced an iOS version of it, surrounding it with DLC, to then announce a sequel which, from the first news, was anticipated to be nothing short of majestic. And even in this case, it did not disappoint. Curtain Call is simply much bigger, richer and more fun than the first Theatrhythm The music goes, for the valleys in bloom There is only one thing that has left us a little dumbfounded about this second Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, and it is hand in glove with the new contents that differentiate it from the original. All in all it is a reflection on the market, rather than an intrinsic problem of the game: in practice, once you have purchased Curtain Call, you could as well put away the old cartridge and never touch it again. In fact, the new title of the indieszero boys incorporates all the songs offered in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, including those published as paid DLC. Only Somnus from Final Fantasy XV is missing; on the other hand there is everything else, plus the new songs taken from the Final Fantasy already proposed in the original and from the spin-offs that have appeared in the list: Final Fantasy Tactics, Dissidia, Mystic Quest, Crystal Chronicles, Type-0, the direct sequels like Final Fantasy X-2 or Lightning Returns. In total, Curtain Call offers more than two hundred and twenty songs between the old and new ones already contained in the cartridge and the unreleased ones downloadable as paid DLC, together with some extra characters: an impressive number, if compared with the seventy songs of the previous Theatrhythm. In this sense, Curtain Call reminded us of Capcom's strategy with its Street Fighters: each new revision makes the previous one obsolete, with all due respect to the fans who had invested time and money in it. In short, players who had purchased the DLC of the first Theatrhythm could feel rather burned by Square Enix's choice, but the truth is that Curtain Call is so rich in content, music and options that it makes the first one appear a simple low-cost experiment . The new Theatrhythm offers over sixty characters from various Final Fantasy series, and not only the protagonists but also some of the supporting characters much loved by fans: each of them has different stats and a pool of skills, some exclusive and some not, which make them sufficiently different from each other. Indieszero once again shows off the ~puccioso~ and caricatured character design also for the new monsters, including bosses and historical enemies of the saga: some sprites are simply of a different color, but this did not disturb us too much because the variety is not lacking, thanks also to the greater number of settings in which the combat and exploration stages take place. More music, more characters, more enemies, more scenarios... but how does Curtain Call fare on the gameplay front? The 3D effect As in the case of the first Theatrhythm, once again the 3D effect has a marginal importance because it limits itself to ~stratifying~ the image without having any impact on the gameplay. However, it has been implemented better and, in addition to making the sprites a little more defined, it affects the frame rate and the fluidity of the animations much less. The music goes, across the sky Curtain Call is played exactly like the previous Theatrhythm, or almost, in the sense that indieszero has also implemented an alternative control system with the analog stick and keys to accommodate those who are not comfortable only with the touch screen. Having chosen the method you prefer, pardon the pun but the music has not changed: there are still three types of internships, namely BMS, FMS and EMS. The first are those in which our party faces one enemy at a time, defeating them in time to the music while we interact with the three different types of notes that follow one another on the screen (touch, scroll and pressure). FMS depict our heroes on the road, some on foot and some chocobo or airship. the EMS,finally, they take place with a film in the background which makes it more difficult to follow the interweaving of notes. We won't hide from you that we would have liked to see at least one completely new type of challenge to associate with the BMS and FMS, given that the EMS have been a bit neglected: you have to unlock them for each title and they practically never appear in the Quest Medley mode, also because they are the most confusing and risky challenges where it seemed to us that the game interpreted our inputs less correctly. Everything else, however, works as and better than before. Indieszero has capitalized on the criticisms received for the first Theatrhythm and has adjusted the shot on the RPG component, which in the prequel was barely sketched: the Chaos Temple was therefore replaced by the aforementioned Quest Medley mode, the real heart of the experience. The basic concept is more or less the same: the game offers ~random~ missions that differ in length and difficulty. Each of them consists of multiple stages that will be tackled in sequence, just like in the old Chaos Temple, but this time we will have to decide the path to follow, perhaps preferring one mission rather than another based on the reward or the special event of turn, as can be the activation of an Aetheryte (basically a checkpoint) or the battle with a miniboss who holds a rare loot or a colored key that can unlock another path in the same mission or another. In the case of the Quest Medley, the RPG element is not limited to the structure of the missions themselves, but also to the management of the party which this time is much more important and, especially in the more difficult stages, requires some preparation as regards the choice of skills and items to equip. It should also be specified that initially we will be able to use only four characters, choosing them from a limited list (marginally expanded if the Curtain Call demo has been downloaded and played at least once). At that point all the others will be unlocked by accumulating colored gems that you receive by defeating the bosses in the Quest Medley or by reaching certain Rhythmia thresholds: every time you collect a certain amount of gems you can choose a new character and then you will have to start the process again from the beginning. In short, to unlock them all, it will take a long time. And everything will be, like a song of happiness We have just mentioned the Rhythmia, which will certainly not be new to the players of the previous Theatrhythm: newbies know that they are essentially points, accumulated on the basis of our ability and other factors, which add up after each game and, once certain thresholds are reached, unlock new content that can be characters, songs, cards, and even alternate sound effects. In fact, the cards are back, divided by rarity and listed in a convenient virtual binder where we can admire them at any time. And there's also a little twist: this time we'll be able to ~consume~ them to improve the characters' stats, keeping an eye on their category and the game they belong to to unlock special bonuses. This is an interesting addition, even if it will be several hours before you feel the need to exploit it: although the strategy in party composition is very important, especially in the longer and more difficult missions of the Quest Medley mode, the game seemed to us significantly less ~severe~ than the previous one, especially as regards the evaluation of our performances and the assignment of grades from S to go up. The first hours with Curtain Call are a continuous surprise: Rhythmia points really unlock everything and more , from the Museum mode that allows you to review the kinematics or freely listen to the music, to the StreetPass options to customize our ~business card~ with which it is possible to exchange the missions completed in the Quest Medley. Another very interesting and surprisingly pleasant mode is the competitive one; Curtain Call, in fact, allows you to challenge the CPU or another player, locally or via the Internet, in real musical battles commented by a moogle referee. Whoever reaches the highest score wins, of course, but each player's progress jeopardizes that of the opponent thanks to the triggering of special attacks that alter the gameplay, speeding up or slowing down the scrolling of notes, for example, or making them appear all last minute or forcing scrolling ones to whirl around. In short, the Versus mode is another game within the game, complete with ranks to climb, and appropriate rewards, in case you play alone against the artificial intelligence. They close the circle lin free mode (you choose a song, one of the three difficulty levels, and off you go with a quick game!) and the ninety-six trophies to unlock by achieving particular objectives.", "date": "2014-09-11", "grade": "9.0"}
