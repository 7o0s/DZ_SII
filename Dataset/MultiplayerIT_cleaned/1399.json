{"name": "Destruction Derby Arenas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destruction-derby-arenas.html", "text": "Shall we make a friendly observation? Obviously from the time of the first Destruction Derby to today, things have changed enormously; the graphics capabilities can't even be compared, the user base has become more savvy, Ps2 has a software park full of excellent value automotive titles and, above all, Psygnosis no longer exists. The work was then entrusted to Studio 33, one of Sony's internal teams in the Old Continent, specialized in 4-wheel titles (including Destruction Derby Raw); the goal was clearly to create a product that was faithful to the tradition of the series, but at the same time able to fit into the current panorama without appearing dated. In the face of the result, however, the doubt arises that the British team has executed these directives in reverse, creating what can undoubtedly be defined as an anachronistic game and in many respects far from the characteristics that made the series famous. Destruction Derby Arenas, this is the name of the product in question, struggles in fact to find a reason to exist in the year 2004 for a whole series of defects that start right from the foundations and from the most basic aspects. Let's start from the control system: it is clear that an arcade title, a trend to which the series in question undoubtedly belongs, must be based on immediate playability, giving a feeling with the car as quickly as possible. However, this does not mean that driving a car, even in a game of this type, must necessarily be a satisfying and credible experience. The model adopted on the contrary by Studio 33 is disarmingly small: the cars do not seem to have any weight, so rapid and sudden can be the changes of direction. The physicality and power of the cars, so appreciable in the first 2 episodes, have left room for a demeaning control system that strips and bones these excellent premises, leaving the player with an experience so basic and convoluted that it leaves you speechless. But arguably the biggest flaw in Destruction Derby Arenas is its ridiculous car warping algorithm, several hands short of its 32-bit predecessors. In a game of this kind, which makes clashes the cornerstone, one would in fact expect complex deformations, multiple dents, loss of parts, broken windshields, wheels that abandon their location to roam freely on the track... On the contrary, in the work of Studio 33 is already a lot to see the bumpers retract and the doors fold; suffice it to say that before having the bonnet detached from its seat, such a number of rear-end collisions are needed to make this event a real rarity. This factor, absurd and unacceptable from our point of view: if the cars are not destroyed in a game called Destruction Derby... To complete the picture, there is also a physics of collisions which to define as simplistic seems an understatement, due to the where accidents do not lead to the expected results, but are resolved in most cases in a disheartening ~pinball machine effect~. Mario Destruction Derby Kart As far as the graphics are concerned, Sony production can count on a valid technical component: while not surprising in terms of the number of polygons on the screen or the presence of details, the game is strong in appreciable graphic cleanliness, thanks to clear textures , anti-aliasing that definitely gets the job done, and a pretty solid frame rate. Unfortunately all this is drowned by a really tacky and cheesy style: abandoning the realistic colors and settings that have distinguished the series, the programmers have preferred to adopt bright colors accompanied by levels halfway between an amusement park and San Francisco Rush (old title Midway of little value). The same goes for the available pilots, characterized by a trait devoid of personality and extremely banal and stereotyped. The sound is seriously insufficient, which in the Italian edition accompanies useless music to meaningless background phrases and recited in a way that makes your skin crawl. Not even the game structure is able to testify to a commitment from Studio 33; the single mode is in fact limited to a championship of 16 races divided into 4 competitions, in which it is necessary to obtain the best score both by placing in the leading positions and by causing spectacular accidents. If, on the other hand, the race takes place in an arena and not on a track, everything will revolve solely around the bumps, in a sort of devastating bumper car. The British game designers then had the questionable idea of adopting a power up systemMario Kart-like, scattering boosts, extra points and repair kits throughout the courses. Completing this mode has been a matter of a couple of hours, and the only incentives to repeat the experience are resolved in unlocking all the drivers and upgrading the cars. In fact, the latter, at the end of each competition, gain a touch-up both from the point of view of performance and from an aesthetic one, gradually becoming more tattered and exaggerated until they reach the appearance of an undrivable 4-wheeled rocket. The online component doesn't help much, while providing a couple of exclusive game modes: despite the 20 simultaneous players that Destruction Derby Arenas is able to handle, the paucity of gameplay makes everything extremely limited, if not downright boring. Comment Destruction Derby Arenas is a product destined to disappoint fans of the first episodes of the series in no uncertain terms; the programmers have in fact distorted the original concept in practically every aspect, effectively going to create a title that has only the name in common with its predecessors. The end result is a very trivial and poorly made arcade, poorly cared for, full of imperfections, devoid of the slightest depth and which -in the software park available to Ps2 at the beginning of 2004-, has no reason to exist. Pros: clean textures and appreciable fluidity discrete amount of extras to be unlocked immediately Cons: completely inadequate physics and driving model non-existent depth very banal and cheesy graphic style In the first months of Psone's life, when the Sony console was still viewed with suspicion and ill-concealed skepticism by a large part of public opinion, a software house came to the fore which more than any other was able to ~push~ the sales of the creature of Kutaragi towards the real sales boom. This softco was Psygnosis, and among the spearheads of the first wave of productions there was undoubtedly Destruction Derby; a frenetic, fun title, in which you were called to take on the role of a car driver in the midst of competitions based on fronts, doors and bonnets in the wind. After two sequels of good quality always for the gray 32-bit, the series has finally decided to take the plunge on the new generation consoles, with Ps2.", "date": "2004-02-04", "grade": null}
