{"name": "Lost Odyssey - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-odyssey-recensione.html", "text": "Immortal hero But the fulcrum of the adventure is not only this, the attention is focused on a precise distinction, the one that divides ordinary beings, mortals, from those who carry the heavy burden of an endless existence, and memories. Just like our protagonist Kaim, and not only him, since during the adventure we will meet others, willing to compose an eclectic party at least. The player is immediately urged to manage the two types of characters, taking advantage of an arrangement on the battlefield structured in two distinct rows (wall system). The fighters placed in the rear enjoy a protection represented on the screen by a bar, called guard condition. This is calculated based on the health points of the characters placed in the front row. It is therefore up to the player to set up a personal strategy that makes the most of the characteristics of the various members of the group. Immortals are unable to learn new techniques, but they can acquire them from the mortals with whom they take the field, through a system of links in the preparation menus. On the other hand, predictably, they cannot actually die once their life points are zeroed, but remain in a state of catalepsy which resolves itself after a few turns, with a slight recovery of life points. It's a simple and challenging system, which adds a certain strategic depth to the battle system. The fights are proposed randomly, therefore without giving the player the possibility to identify enemies on the map. A fairly anachronistic choice, which brings us back to the jrpg of ten years ago. Fortunately they are not too frequent, even if the inevitable interruption of the exploratory phase leads to a rather fragmented and potentially frustrating experience. The tradition does not stop even once you go into battle, as demonstrated by the canonical turn-based setting, marked by a viewer who establishes the order. The choice, to say the least nostalgic, to remain anchored in the past does not prevent the desire to improve, and Mistwalker demonstrates this with some new elements. Starting with physical blows, which were solved by exploiting a truly brilliant playful intuition: holding down the right trigger displays a circle, when the character has a ring equipped, which overlaps that of the enemy target. By releasing the key when the two figures match, we will activate a series of effects based on the ring equipped during the attack. In essence it is a real minigame, which can have three distinct outcomes and allow three different levels of damage, which wards off the passivity congeniality of the turn-based system, and which proves to be stimulating even after having mastered it properly. The aforementioned rings can be assembled using a series of objects that can be found during the adventure and which constitute a rudimentary and satisfying crafting system. Equally effective and courageous is the experience point limiter, which prevents the characters from leveling beyond the maximum established for the exploration area, so as to guarantee an always heated challenge. To benefit most are the clashes with the bosses, of high tactical depth, which force the total exploitation of the resources at our disposal. The result is a challenging gameplay, but able to offer enormous satisfaction. On the other hand, the typical sense of omnipotence acquired by the player in the advanced adventure is lacking, therefore it is necessary to never lose concentration and plan all the clashes thoroughly. Four DVDs! Kaim's epic requires the beauty of four DVDs to be told, even through a long and spectacular series of computer graphics films, just like at the dawn of three-dimensional jrpg. The story is long and exciting, although rather canonical (all genre clichs are re-proposed), and is developed in perfect Sakaguchi style, with dilated rhythms, over a period of time that settles on 40 hours only by dedicating yourself to the main quest. Technically Mistwalker has used the Unreal Engine to visualize evocative scenarios, both citizens and natural, not without details of exquisite workmanship. However, the feeling remains that the ambition of the project cannot always be reconciled with the resources employed. The results are often exciting, other times just passable, with a somewhat fluctuating overall picture. Similar consideration for the carachter design, not always inspired and coherent, a defect that materializes on some characters with questionable rendering (Gongora is a perfect example). On the other hand, compared to the beta we received some time ago, we found a significancevo improvement in uploads, which remain quite frequent anyway. The soundtrack makes use of the legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, icon of Final Fantasy, here in the difficult task of repeating the emotional impact. Sakaguchi wanted it badly, as well as in the previous Blue Dragon, and the results rewarded his obstinacy. It is probably one of his best compositions, still characterized by the typical eclecticism, able to reconcile rock, avant-garde and symphonic sounds with rare mastery. The greatest advantage is that of keeping the spirit of the concept soundtrack high, with the exceptional main theme proposed as the glue of the entire adventure. Regardless of musical tastes, it is difficult not to be carried away by the artist's melodies, able to make the most of the situations of great emotional impact set up by the game. The quantity of spoken dialogues is impressive, especially the Italian version which enjoys a complete high quality localization, an indisputable added value. Be prepared to recognize many familiar voiceovers, especially in Japanese anime! Multiplayer.it has published the Italian edition of the official Lost Odyssey guide. The guide is in A4 format, with 277 full-color pages, and reveals all the secrets of this exclusive Microsoft for Xbox 360. To discover the strategies to beat each boss of the game, test all the skills of the characters and find the secret objects hidden in the game universe created by Hironobu Sakaguchi. The guide is on sale from February 29 at the price of 14.90 Euros. Here is the cover of the English version! Comment Lost Odyssey is a project of great caliber that deserves all the attention of every jrpg enthusiast. While not without its flaws, it represents a golden opportunity to savor, in the splendor of HD, all the taste of the old school of Sakaguchi. A school that pays a heavy price for its stubborn anachronistic approach to the genre, albeit adding some pleasant elements, but which never loses the gift of genuineness and a sense of wonder, establishing an ideal connection with the seventh, unforgettable Final Fantasy for PSX. A product therefore mainly aimed at fans of times gone by, but also for those who want to rediscover today a genre that has made history. A ride on the Mistwalker roller coaster that we can't help but recommend. Pros: Long and challenging adventure The ring system is a great gimmick Great soundtrack Cons: A bit too traditional Technically up-and-down Quite challenging for newbies Xbox 360 - Goals Compared to the difficult Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey rewards the efforts of the players with greater generosity, leading to achieving most of the 1000 points available at the end of the adventure, again if one also dedicates oneself to the subquests.", "date": "2008-03-10", "grade": null}
