Yet we offered it to you a few weeks ago in preview and today we return to talk about it in the review, because the new production by Daedalic Entertainment really hides an avalanche of interesting ideas. To discover them all, however, a handful of hours will certainly not be enough and this journey into the galaxy promises to be difficult and particularly punishing, so much so that it requires commitment and absolute dedication to be completed. The will of the developers is in fact to offer a multitude of different gaming experiences, to create a dialogue between the players present in the community to bring out as many hidden secrets as possible, a noble and mammoth intent but also particularly difficult to complete. We have heard dozens of promises of this type in recent months and even just thinking about No Man's Sky should give you the idea of how fragile the balance of titles are ready to give you boundless space in your hand by promising infinite variables. Will The Long Journey Home have succeeded instead in the enterprise? Sweet Home Alabama A jump into hyperspace gone wrong, a spacecraft that gets lost among the galaxies and a crew of four who must find the way back to Earth on their own, with the little knowledge available. Three simple elements that represent everything you need to know to start this new space adventure. In fact, The Long Journey Home does not get lost in preambles and, with the exception of a minute tutorial, quickly abandons you in deep space hoping you know how to get by on your own: trust us if we tell you that you will not be. The information in your possession before starting to play is in fact few and confusing. You will be allowed to take on board four specialists among the dozen available but you will have no way of knowing how these can be useful to you during the adventure and, on closer inspection, this situation will also repeat itself for all your other games. Speaking of your crew, it is interesting to discover the behaviors of the various protagonists, their interactions and their wishes, but everything is inexplicably hidden and hidden under a carpet. A feature that is often guiltily lost, taken as you will be looking for the next refueling point. In fact, The Long Journey Home procedurally creates a star map at each of your restarts, hides unprecedented pitfalls at each jump between one system and another and will pit you against different civilizations, with different desires from time to time. Like any self-respecting roguelike, the difficulty therefore cannot be assessed at all because, essentially, it changes depending on your luck. If lady luck assists you then your crew members may have the skills needed to complete the missions, otherwise you will find yourself limping right away in a hostile space and determined to crush you. Randomness, in other words, is the master once again. There are only two other factors under your control before departure which essentially concern the spaceship you will drive and the landing probe, which you can select from a short list of aircraft (a few more ships would not have been bad actually) and that will direct you towards a specific style of play. On the one hand there are cargo ships made to travel slowly and collect large quantities of resources and on the other hand ships made to be able to make fewer but longer jumps in hyperspace, obviously requiring fewer resources for survival. Whatever option you choose, the interstellar map will then let you know if you've had a good idea or if yours will prove to be a rash move. To try to limit the random factor, Daedalic then thought of inserting a unique code for the creation of the universe, a string inextricably linked to your game world so you can try again to travel in a known galaxy, slightly removing the taste for discovery but making a title that often shows an exacerbating difficulty more accessible, especially if taken lightly in the initial stages. But had I parked that far away? You will die often and in the most excruciating ways: your crew will be torn apart, will be showered with radiation, will suffocate, will suffer broken bones, will catch fatal alien diseases and will meet any other terrible fate you can think of, time and time again. To prevent this from happening you will be called upon to calmly explore the galaxy, collect resources from planets and make alliances withthe hundreds of alien species that populate your universe. You will meet peaceful and friendly peoples and other ferocious and bloodthirsty races in a continuous succession of events that will make your expedition a real nightmare. When things get really bad, you can't avoid arming your cannons and opening fire with extremely simplified combat mechanics by exploiting the portions of the astral map as an arena. The game system will provide you with many tools for dialogue, it will provide you with options to decide what to do and how to behave and your actions could also have consequences in the long run, or perhaps go completely unnoticed. Once you are alone at the controls of your ship you will have to establish the route by using the gravity of the planets as a whip to save fuel during the movements but also to perfectly calibrate the docking curve to put you in orbit. In this case the autopilot system will meet you but it is not so complex to steer the ship and the intuitive controls facilitate a task that could have become really traumatic given the amount of times you will be called to repeat it. Thus you will find yourself jumping from one planet to another with ease, dodging meteorites while floating among the stars, with one eye on the hull armor and another on the fuel tank. However, it is only the first galaxies that are really interesting, after which all the good ideas mentioned up to now are diluted, due to a marked repetitiveness of the actions which unfortunately and inevitably leads to boredom, despite the fact that a game will take you about six hours on average. Thus one travels from planet to planet looking only for those that can be useful for the mission, deliberately avoiding those that are dangerous or uninviting and their appearance, also procedurally generated, is put into the background, becoming a mere display of colors while the player chase after resource deposits or alien structures to explore as a text adventure. Each planet then has its own gravity, its temperature and various other peculiarities that modify the methods of approach but in the long run, when you drive the lander to touch the ground and extract the minerals, you will find yourself always acting in the same way. The Unreal Engine 4 used to bring The Long Journey Home to life seems almost wasted given the many hours you'll spend scrutinizing star maps in 2D without particular effects. The polygonal models of the ships, on the other hand, are more than excellent, you can only view them during the mini transition screens between travel and exploration, tedious and repeated moments until you drop. On the other hand, the inventiveness for the alien races and their vessels is good, present in very large quantities and varieties. The music is also excellent, capable of cradling the player in the endless hours of exploration of the galaxies. One last note is the complete lack of Italian, if you want to try your hand at this space adventure, you'll need to know at least one other alien language.", "date": "2017-06-05", "grade": "7.0"}
