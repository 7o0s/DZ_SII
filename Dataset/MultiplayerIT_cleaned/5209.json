{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization VI", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175639-sid-meiers-civilization-vi-sesta-era.html", "text": "The first moments of the game seem like those already experienced. It begins with a settler who must establish the first city of a new civilization. With the unit selected, you look around to find the best hex to build on. What resources does the randomly generated map offer? Do we build further north to have horses immediately, or further south in a more rugged but mineral-rich area? Even in Sid Meier's Civilization VI, as has always happened from Civilization, released in the now distant 1991, the first rounds are fundamental. The famous Colosseum of Sezze Wrong positioning of the capital means a slower start of the game which will force us to recover in the following rounds. Many game turns will pass before you can found a second city, unless you have a big stroke of luck, and having some vital resources right away can really make a difference. After all, hasn't the same happened to many real civilizations? How many peoples have failed to develop because they were founded in hostile areas? On the other hand, how much luck have peoples like those of the Mediterranean who could count on an optimal climate, fertile land and lots of building materials? In the game creation screen we chose to lead the Roman civilization, i.e. to play the role of Emperor Trajan. Our capital is Rome. Luckily there was a river near the starting point and we settled there. Some boxes with resources far from the city center can be purchased later. The first rounds have passed and we have managed to build an explorer with which we have begun to discover the map, finding other resources, including friendly villages, which when occupied offer gifts of various kinds, and barbarian villages, which must be conquered after having eliminated the aggressive occupiers (if you don't do it, you spend the beginning of the game rejecting them, with the risk that they will conquer us). In short, if you have already tried a title from the Civilization series you will surely have noticed that up to now there are no major differences compared to the previous ones. But never as in this case is it better not to be fooled by first impressions. We reviewed Sid Meier's Civilization VI, Firaxis' new masterpiece, which didn't disappoint One hundred cities The first big change in Civilization VI comes along with builders. Do you remember that in the other chapters of the series, even in spin-offs such as Alpha Centauri or Beyond Earth, it has always been necessary to create units that work the various boxes to make better use of their resources? The same happens here too, but with a big difference. What would Rome be without the Eiffel Tower? Builders are no longer units like any other, but deplete with use. At the beginning they have only three actions to perform, but as the game progresses they can obtain more thanks to some discoveries and the adoption of specific policies. We'll talk about research later, meanwhile let's go back to our unit and its specificities. We confess that as soon as we discovered the manufacturers' limits, we turned up a bit. After all, we were used to making them work even for millennia. Of course, the new builders create any improvement in a single turn, where in the past it took several just to build a mountain road, but this forces them to spend a lot of resources to improve the surroundings of the city (each unit must be rebuilt from scratch ). In reality it is not so and playing you understand that the profound changes made to this key unit have become necessary to introduce the new concept of city, which is no longer an urban nucleus with resources around it, but a territory that can be developed in many different ways. If you remember in the other Civilization everything you build stays inside the city. In Civilization VI, however, this is not the case. Firaxis has introduced the concept of district, which radically changes the cards on the table, introducing strong elements of urban micro-management. Districts, divided by specialization (you can build military bases, commercial hubs, university campuses, entertainment areas, sacred places, and so on), occupy an entire tile. Each district gives some bonuses and brings about improvements for the whole civilization. For example, building a trade hub increases the number of trade routes for merchants, useful for establishing economic relations with city-states or other civilizations (these also give bonuses, which vary depending on the chosen destination). The undiscovered part of the map is represented as an ancient map A military district, on the other hand, makes built troops more efficient and acts as a second line of defense for the city. In short, everyDistrict has its own function and has its own related buildings, such as the bank that can only be built in a commercial hub or the library that can be built on a campus. Too bad that the system does not allow you to create all districts in all cities, but imposes precise limits dictated by the number of inhabitants and other factors (for example, some districts must be built in the boxes adjacent to the city, while others must be spaced out). Only in the later stages of the game can larger cities have almost all districts, but in general you need to do some urban planning and think in terms of territorial specialization. Thus, unlike what happened in the other chapters, in Civilization VI each city ends up having its own specific function that characterizes it compared to the others. This strong customization is reaffirmed by the wonders, which work much like districts, but with differences. In short: they also occupy an entire tile and have requirements that make it impossible to build them indiscriminately. For example, to build the Colosseum, the city must have an entertainment district, while to build the Great Library, there must be a campus. From here it's easy to go back to our builders and understand why they're perfect in their new form: if Firaxis had maintained a unit similar to that of the past, the player would have been led to think less about the value of a single square. As it stands now, however, it imposes construction choices that must also be made in consideration of the general direction that one wishes to give to the city. Perhaps this aspect is not very clear during the first game, also because the districts come after the builders, but from the second onwards there will be no problems. In any case, to better understand the new mechanics, we advise you to start with the tutorial, which is really complete. War and peace Let's go back to our civilization. In addition to the capital we have founded other cities by expanding our borders. In the meantime, we got to know other nations and discovered city states (they're great for trade and are the official purveyors of missions like ~Build Musket Units~ and the like). Works in progress By exploiting trade routes and our influence, we have established profitable trade relationships with some, while with others the relationship has remained cold. For example, Russia has shown itself to be particularly friendly towards us and with a little effort we have declared friendship between our peoples, while the Chinese emperor cannot bear the fact that we have more marvels than he does and points this out to us in any way (and at all times). By sending our emissaries we have taken de facto control of some city-states, thus being able to access their troops as needed. In short, everything seems to be going well and the road to the future seems to be paved but events don't always turn out as we would like. We soon find ourselves embroiled in a surprise war declared by the Chinese emperor himself. A newly created border town of ours is conquered, infuriating us quite a bit. We start a massive arms race, producing some war units and buying up the rest. After bitter battles and a few too many losses we take back the city. We are not satisfied. We are still at war and start marching against Chinese cities. Having destroyed various units of the opponent, who is now in the minority, we receive a peace proposal. We reject it. The offense must be paid at least with one city. The legions, a special unit of the Romans, are very good in the open field, but are not very effective in sieges. Luckily we also have two catapults and three archers, so we soon reach our goal (the Chinese are exhausted by the failed invasion). At that point it is we who open the diplomatic panel and send a peace proposal to the Chinese emperor, obviously on our terms: one hundred gold coins on the nail, ten gold coins in turn for thirty turns, and a supply of silk. The nagging head of state accepts against his will. There will be more wars with China in the future, but this one went well and we won across the board. Diplomacy Civilization VI is a complex title that cannot be exhausted with the text of a review. The only way to fully understand it is to play it and we have little doubt about that. If you have already played the fifth chapter, you will have noticed even just from the summary description that we have made of it so far that most of the mechanics introduced with the different expansions have been maintained, which is a good thing since some things were really excellent and we are talking about of a title that is still very much played today. Therediplomacy works, but it is always woody If you have noticed the live story of the previous paragraph was focused on two elements: the combat system, the least renewed part, and diplomacy, the latter revised but always identical to itself. Now by accessing the diplomacy screen and selecting a head of state it is much easier to understand what he doesn't like about our behavior, since it is explicitly said. For the rest, however, the system remained very similar to that seen in the previous chapters, with all the limitations of the case. Relations with other civilizations are determined by where we build our cities (building too close to their borders makes them nervous), by the wonders we own, by the number of troops we have, by the gifts we give, the trades we accept, and so on. Street. Sometimes the CPU acts opportunistically, declaring war on us to attack isolated cities or to take some resources, but in general the system appears lumbering as always, with some reactions from the various leaders who leave the time they find. Nothing tragic, but the aforementioned Chinese emperor who scolds us every two shifts because we have more wonders than him makes us smile. Who knows if one day we will be able to have a more dynamic diplomacy. Meanwhile, while not wonderful, that of Civilization VI can be defined as the best that passes the 4x genre, so there is little to complain about. Research, religion and more What would a Civilization be without research? Civilization VI also has its own beautiful scientific discovery tree, which has been joined by a tree dedicated to cultural development. Let's say that the two are intertwined in several ways, determining the evolution of all fields of our civilization, from the military to the economic one, passing through the political one. The pyramids could not be missing among the wonders Cultural discoveries in particular are very important for the management of the political/social order, which has been given particular weight and which must be taken care of in order to achieve the intended victory (cultural, military, scientific and so on). Each type of government allows you to select one or more economic, military, cultural or special policies (they are linked to the creation of the personalities of the various fields of human knowledge), which are represented by cards. These give bonuses, which can be a lower cost in the production of certain units, or a greater amount of money received from trade routes (just to name two of the many examples available). Cultural quests unlock advanced governments and new policy cards. Still looking back to Civilization V, Firaxis has maintained the importance of religion, which enjoys special units. Founding a religion and having places of worship allows the construction of special units that go around the world to proselytise. When they meet exponents of other religions they can face them in a theological debate, which if won gives great advantages in terms of faith. The latter is a real currency. What cannot be bought with base money can, under certain conditions, be bought by spending the accumulated faith. If you want to achieve a religious victory, you have to be able to convert the whole world to your religion (almost a game within a game, since it makes the games very different from those dedicated to achieving other global goals). Master music It will sound strange, but Civilization VI deserves the expense of a few words even on its technical side. Meanwhile, you'll be happy to know that it's perfectly optimized and doesn't cause fluidity problems even in the advanced stages of the game, that is, when there are many units on the screen. Coastal cities are the only ones that can have ports Being a turn-based strategy, few would have worried about some uncertainty of the graphics engine, but it's better this way, don't you think? Of course, don't expect Firaxis's title to put your GTX 1080 under pressure, because that's not its goal. Some might also dislike the cartoon-style graphics, but that's really a matter of taste. The important thing is to know that the models of the various buildings are well made, the units are well animated and characterized and the game world is full of details, while always remaining very legible and despite being the highly configurable interface. The music deserves special praise. We never would have guessed it before playing Civilization VI, but even a 4x strategy can be enriched by clever use of the soundtrack. We're not talking about the beauty of the songs themselves, some of the simple rearrangements of classic songs, but how they have been integrated into the gameplay: the", "date": "2016-10-26", "grade": "9.5"}
