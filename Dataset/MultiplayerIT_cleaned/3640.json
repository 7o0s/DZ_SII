The first-person role-playing game from Atlus represents, in a certain sense, the history of the Nintendo handheld in various aspects, for better or for worse: it is the return of a great franchise, albeit in the form of a spin-off that However, it uses the lower screen of the console in an exemplary way, a feature inaugurated by Nintendo DS years ago and which only a few titles have been able to squeeze out intelligently. Persona Q2 is also the latest exponent of a category, that of Etrian Odyssey, which has found its niche of maximum expression on this console. And at the same time, Persona Q2 also represents missed opportunities: that unattainable horizon, because it is the spin-off of a series that was born and raised on a competing platform, and that highly controversial technology, because the Etrian Odyssey and the previous Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth used the stereoscopic effect beautifully, although Persona Q2 didn't implement it. In short, a kind of digital nonsense, but also a RPG that is a little jewel, as you will read in our review. New Cinema Labyrinth It's important to note that Persona Q2 is a game in its own right: while it's a sequel to Persona Q, you don't need to have played that first spin-off to understand the story, and likewise it doesn't fit into any specific narrative space. Walking the thin line of fanservice, Persona Q2 brings together in a single game the casts of three different titles, set in different eras - i.e. Persona 3, Persona 4 and Persona 5 - for a total of twenty-seven playable characters, to which is added the protagonist of Persona 3P. The doubt that the screenplay would not have been able to enhance such a large roster had come to us, we admit it, and instead Atlus surprised us with a delightful and at times disturbing story that not only respects the bizarre atmospheres of the reference titles, but also manages to give enough space to each character through dialogues full of irony, written in English and dubbed in Japanese. The writers have succeeded in the difficult undertaking with a simple trick, and that is by diluting the introduction of the cast more slowly: while in Persona Q we chose which team to start with and within a dungeon we found ourselves controlling all the characters, Persona Q2 prefers a more reasoned approach that goes better with the narrative. In fact, the game begins with a new adventure of the Phantom Thieves in the Mementos: the protagonists of Persona 5 suddenly find themselves catapulted into a strange world where an old rival of theirs has become a kind of superhero and the police are hunting them. Having taken refuge in a disturbing cinema, our heroes meet Hikari and Nagi, two spectators around whom the whole mystery of New Cinema Labyrinth revolves. Dialogue drives the narrative quite frequently, especially between dungeons, and while it's introduced a bit slowly to allow for the interactions between the colorful cast of Personas, the plot lives up to all the standards of the original series. Obviously it must be considered that Persona Q2 is a first-person RPG that is mainly aimed at fans and that you play for the pleasure of seeing all these characters interact in a single adventure. In this sense, Persona Q2 does an excellent job thanks also and above all to the secondary missions, focused on the relationships between the characters, which put the characteristics of our favorites under pressure in an often hilarious and sometimes even moving way. The guys from Atlus have made an effort to stage their misadventures, when possible, through short cinematic cartoons or that make use of the game's polygonal engine: needless to remind you that we are talking about a Nintendo 3DS and we shouldn't expect sparks, but style ~ chibi~ used by Hanako Oribe to represent the characters seemed even more successful than in the prequel, since it goes well with the atmosphere of the game and also creates an interesting contrast when breathing a darker air. The merit is also of the soundtrack composed by Atsushi Kitajo which has nothing to envy to the titles of the mother series. The 3D effect Not received: too bad, in Persona Q it was splendid and it is not the same thing to explore the dungeons in first person without the stereoscopic effect. Fighting and mapping in Q2 The decision to gradually introduce the twenty-eight protagonists also influences the gameplay: although it greatly limits our freedom in the first hours of the game, especially if we compare Persona Q2 with any Etrian Odyssey where it is even possible to choose the specsific roles of the characters, this solution facilitates the learning of the different mechanics and allows you to experiment with the skills and uniqueness of the various party members before deciding in a more prudent way how we want to compose it. It will be important, as in the prequel, to configure the formation so that characters who can only attack in melee fight in the front row and who can protect the rear, where it will be better to place experts in ranged attacks and healing spells. It's possible to switch formations at any time, however, and sometimes swapping the position of two characters could allow us to catch the breath of someone who was risking their pens on the front lines. The combat system has remained almost the same as the first Persona Q, although Atlus has updated it with the introduction of some mechanics such as the Baton Pass already seen in Persona 5 and a series of spectacular combined attacks that are unlocked by completing side missions . Basically it is still a turn-based combat system focused on the peculiar Boost mechanic already seen in the various Personas: each enemy - and party member, watch out - is weak to one or more elements, but if one of our characters exploits the weakness in question , he will act faster than normal next turn and will not consume SP to use his Persona's abilities. In fact, each character can use his default Persona and another Persona, captured in the dungeons or fused in the usual Velvet Room: it will be essential to try various combinations to complement the skills of our heroes. Occasionally, when all enemies are stunned, it's possible to resort to All-Out Attacks that deal massive amounts of damage, but most of the time you'll have to resort to abilities that inflict abnormal conditions and other more sophisticated strategies. We had the impression that Atlus has raised the difficulty bar and that some bosses and minibosses - the infamous FOE already seen in Persona Q and in the various Etrian Odyssey - are a bit too tough. Fortunately it is still possible to change the difficulty level among the four available, even if setting the highest level it will no longer be possible to decrease it: if the lowest level allows you to face the adventure with great serenity, thanks to a whole series of advantages that they make life a lot easier, and to finish it in about thirty hours, the second level already requires some healthy grinding sessions and a careful choice of protagonists to bring to the battlefield. The complexity of the clashes compensates for the greater linearity of the dungeons, compared to the past: don't get us wrong, they continue to be imaginative and articulated, but in Persona Q2 they are easier to navigate, there are much fewer traps to avoid and in general it seemed to us that the level design was a bit less inspired. Despite this, it's always a pleasure to draw maps on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS, marking points of interest and taking an integral part in the adventure in this respect too. It is one of those unique features that will be missed and raises many questions about the possible future of Etrian Odyssey on Nintendo Switch. Don't use autofill if you decide to play Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth. Take the stylus and draw the map, it will be an even more rewarding experience.", "date": "2019-06-04", "grade": "8.6"}
