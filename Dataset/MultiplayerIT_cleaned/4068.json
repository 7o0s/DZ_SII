{"name": "Super Seducer 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-seducer-2-recensione.html", "text": "Super Seducer is one of Alessio Pianesani's most loved games... and this alone should make you understand something (I'm sure the complaint is triggered here). Like all bad things, but not too serious, it had a great success, so as to convince the author, the improbable Richard La Ruina, to produce not one, but two sequels. Yes, in addition to Super Seducer 2, the subject of this review, Super Seducer 3 has also been announced, which will be launched in March 2019. But let's not rush too much, also because talking about two Super Seducers in the same article could be lethal. Game mechanics Super Seducer 2 is exactly what Super Seducer was, but with more money. By selecting one of the available chapters (three immediately, seven more will be released post-launch) the usual roundup of videos begins, showing the good La Ruina's towing attempts. From time to time the player is asked to choose how the protagonist should behave. In the event that the right choices are greater than 90% of the total, you receive the title of Super Seducer of the chapter, i.e. you get the best ending. Obviously the choices are right or wrong according to the logic of La Ruina, who between one sequence and another will give us valuable boarding advice, or scold us in case of ramshackle decisions. The novelty of Super Seducer 2 is that to give us suggestions there will also be a girl who, in the intentions of the authors, should express the female point of view on the art of seduction. Each story has many branches and can lead to five different endings: in this way replayability is ensured. Fortunately, the cutscenes are skippable, so you don't have to rewatch the ones you've already seen every time. Obviously it's impossible to lose: at most you can reach a negative ending or you can incur the wrath of La Ruina and his partner, who, however, will always give us the opportunity to make a second attempt. Gameplay But let's take an example. In the chapter ~Cunt of good family vs top model~ (that's her name) La Ruina arrives in an open-air venue aboard a tank and has to be able to tow a sophisticated blonde lady who got off a luxurious yacht, resembling Giorgia Meloni (let's not joke, he really looks like her), or he has to try it with an attractive Russian model. In the meantime he has to manage not to put his hand down his pants to get a finger out of the zip like a penis, he has to avoid being caught red-handed by telling lies that are too big, he has to help an old lady who has decided to pass out in front of her table and he must avoid the wrath of an ex who could ruin his attempt at seduction by telling not too edifying stories about his reproductive system. In Super Seducer 2, as in the first chapter, there is no shortage of controversial and vulgar choices, which never have positive implications (at least in the chapters available at launch). For example, in ~Capo & Segretaria~ you can ask the unfortunate woman on duty to collect some papers to be able to look at her lower back comfortably, or you can masturbate during a telephone conversation, while in ~Mixed attendance~, in which the protagonist is a Chinese man friend of La Ruina, you can try to impress by explicitly describing sexual acts or talking about Fortnite. To be honest, in Super Seducer 2 it is better to screw up the conversations than to get the answers right, because in their being heavy, the failure skits are by far the best and every now and then they manage to elicit a few smiles. For the rest, from a strictly production point of view we are dealing with one of the most popular heirs of the games full of full motion video footage of the nineties, between bad actors (first of all La Ruina) poor locations and a flat general management banal. The ingredients to make it a cult series are all there. Having said that, it will seem paradoxical to you but we do not feel like completely condemning Super Seducer 2: like the first episode, this one does exactly what it promises, without ever trying to exceed the limits it has set itself. After all, it's just a series of bizarre advice that leave the time they find, given by an unlikely character in exchange for money... What did we write about not condemning him?", "date": "2018-09-12", "grade": "6.0"}
