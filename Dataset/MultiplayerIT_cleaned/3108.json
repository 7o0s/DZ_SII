{"name": "Area F2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/area-f2-recensione.html", "text": "The Area F2 review obviously cannot do without a precise comparison, the one with Rainbow Six: Siege, the famous Ubisoft tactical shooter to which the mobile game for iOS and Android developed by Qookka Games is clearly and clearly inspired. mechanics are in fact the same, as well as the undoubted potential of an experience that boasts convincing numbers (especially in terms of Operators: there are twenty to unlock), two modes and four maps but adopts quite questionable solutions as regards touch controls. In fact, Bluetooth controllers are not supported, as was to be expected, but we cannot explain why the authors chose to use a layout with manual rather than automatic fire, which substantially degrades the quality of the gunplay, making it slow and cumbersome. We thought that this plague was now a distant memory, after all Shadowgun War Games and Call of Duty: Mobile have shown how effective autofire is to make the experience with mobile shooters more immediate, reactive and even precise. The manual alternative, on the other hand, proves to be a disaster, as it is impossible to aim and shoot at the same time, especially at speed, and this translates into clashes that appear ridiculous when seen from the outside, with the characters losing several seconds to score shots . Structure In the hope that the developers of Area F2 will consider enabling automatic fire with one of the next updates, it must be recognized that the game has a certain personality (although it is, in practice, a portable imitation of the aforementioned Rainbow Six: Siege) and a fairly elastic freemium model, with no constraints as regards the duration of the games and the possibility of trying all the matches we want. The microtransactions obviously revolve around the unlocking of the Operators, which cost around 3 euros each but which, however, can also be obtained simply by playing and scraping together virtual currency, although it takes a (good) bit of patience to do so. Adjusted the various sensitivities (you have to set them practically to the maximum to avoid having to drag the screen several times to turn around or simply aim) and slightly modified the layout of the controls (moving the precision aim button, too close to the right virtual stick), the game becomes substantially less wooden and allows us to face tutorials, base camps, customized and classified games (starting from the fifth level onwards) in the context of two different modes and on a total of four maps, as already mentioned. main stipulation we will find ourselves operating within a team made up of five agents: in the offensive phase our objective will be to penetrate a building and neutralize threats and/or take control of a device, while in the defensive phase we will have to maintain the position and repel the attack. We will have the possibility to select one of the unlocked Operators (each equipped with different special abilities) and to modify its equipment to better match our style, for example preferring a nice shotgun to an assault rifle and so on. We will also be able to take advantage of the few seconds of the prelude to identify enemies with a wheeled drone or, in the defensive phase, close the doors with barriers or place turrets and electronic devices. From a technical point of view, unfortunately, Area F2 does not shine: the polygonal modeling appears dated, both as regards the scenarios and the characters and related animations. It is possible to set some parameters to increase or decrease the smoothness of the frame rate in case your device can afford it, but beyond this the whole project would need a substantial graphical improvement to be able to compete with the best shooters currently available on iOS and android.", "date": "2020-05-05", "grade": "7.5"}
