{"name": "Pokemon Ranger: Ombre su Almia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-ranger-ombre-su-almia-recensione.html", "text": "It's hard to deny that the Nintendo little monsters have lost a bit of their glamor in the Italian peninsula: it would almost seem that fashion has faded, cartoons are broadcast more rarely, advertisements are much less invasive. But in Japan the little creatures of the big N between ups and downs still enjoy enormous, boundless popularity, also thanks to the much more incisive media bombardment. It is also true that Nintendo makes bangs with each new episode of the main series, climbing the sales charts, but something is always needed, in the years that pass between one Pokmon and another, that does not disperse the interest of the players. The spin-offs of the Pokmon series are probably used for this: Pokmon Ranger is certainly the most captivating one, especially for the original gameplay, and Nintendo could not miss the opportunity to squeeze the tested concept a little more  Rangers, pokmon and villains The plot of Pokmon Ranger is once again a simple pretext: once again in the role of a novice Ranger, the player will carry out this profession occasionally stumbling upon the shady plots of the delinquent Team on duty, intending to take control of the pokmon of the Almia region to then exploit them in his criminal activities. A story with a simple and predictable development, as usual for the series, which surrounds the heart of the game: the capture of pokmon. In the Ranger series, however, things work a little differently. The collecting mentality does not concern these brave defenders of nature, who in fact do not use the canonical Pok-balls to catch the various little creatures, but a sort of energy snare which metaphorically expresses their friendship towards the target. The lasso is nothing more than a ploy to apply the main feature of Pokmon Ranger to the gameplay, i.e. the fundamental use of the touch-screen: in fact, the player will have to draw circles around the pokmon he wants to capture in a number that varies according to the difficulty of the challenge. Once the process is completed, the pokmon on duty will accompany our ranger alter-ego in his wanderings, and can be used if necessary to overcome certain obstacles, based on the powers it has: a fire pokmon can burn trees and brushwood , a water pokmon will allow you to cross rivers and lakes, and so on. However, there are some differences compared to the prequel, which proposed more or less the same mechanics: instead of having to draw continuous circles around the pokmon during the capture phase, in Shadows over Almia we will be able to stop between one and the other to avoid the attacks and the abilities of the little creature that if they hit our lasso would interrupt it forcing us to repeat the procedure all over again. In reality, Creatures has introduced a simple indicator that must be filled with each circle traced to capture the pokmon and that will discharge during our breaks: the player must therefore carefully evaluate when to stop and when to start again to trace the circles, perhaps with the help of the other pokmon in the team. In short, although simplified, the capture mechanism in Shadows over Almia requires a little more strategy, and it will be necessary to carefully evaluate which pokmon to capture and which to free in order to proceed with the exploration and solve the missions entrusted to us at the headquarters: this does not it takes away from the fact that the system, however intelligent and fun thanks also to the variety of creatures and the challenges proposed by their offensive and defensive abilities, tends to become physically tiring within a few hours. Years go by but pokmon don't change their voice... Technically Shadows over Almia proposes practically the same sprites seen almost two years ago. In short, Nintendo recycles a little too much: in the course of a two-year period we could try harder, instead of presenting the same two-dimensional graphics, the same development of the story and the puzzles, as well as the same basic play mechanics. And unfortunately the pokmon continue to maintain that unbearable squeak heard since the 90s on the Game Boy, far from the funny and clear verses of the cartoon. And yet the technical sector certainly cannot be defined as unpleasant, made up of large and very colorful animated sprites, large and detailed locations that well characterize this unprecedented region of Almia, graceful and carefree music. Pokmon Ranger is a simple but well-finished product, unlike the less than mediocre Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: sorry, however, to see that the famous proverb about winning teams tends to get too confused with the laziness of the developers and a good two years of development for so few playful improvements - and virtually no approxgraphic change - there are just too many. Comment Among the myriads of pokmon-based productions, the Ranger series definitely seemed the most original and well-finished one. Not that this sequel isn't, but unfortunately the recycling philosophy has struck again: Shadows over Almia is really identical to its predecessor, only with a few more improvements in terms of gameplay. Same graphics, same melodies, same concept repeated for the ten hours needed to complete the game... and same pokmon as a prize: Manaphy. And as with its predecessor, new missions can be downloaded by connecting to the Internet. It almost seems that the two games should have been released at the same time and this has been kept to squeeze the proverbial goose that lays golden eggs. If you played the first one, just fly over it. If, on the other hand, you like pokmon and have never played Pokmon Ranger, it is an excellent opportunity to fill this gap. Pro Concept still original and intriguing Technically good The capture system has been improved Cons They recycled the graphics... ... and they recycled the gameplay... ... and they recycled the bonuses too...", "date": "2008-12-04", "grade": null}
