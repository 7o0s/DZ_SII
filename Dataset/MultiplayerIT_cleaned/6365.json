In Spermination you wear the clothes that we have all worn at least once in a lifetime. Those who have seen us enter the ovum of the woman we call mother victorious, to the detriment of millions of other fellow travelers. Spermatozoa that fight with laser shots Yes, we are a sperm racing inside a vagina. We confess that, although not exactly orthodox, the topic dealt with had intrigued us a lot. After all, even if for human reproduction, we are always talking about a race. Unfortunately we are faced with the classic early coitus, something that is immediately understood to be really wrong and that cannot be remedied even by a good therapist. That the situation is not good is evident right from the title screen, with the menu which, graphically speaking, seems to have come out of an HTML template from a few decades ago. The keys are so ugly that you only want to click on the exit one, but you have to resist. Once the game has started, you feel like someone is enjoying it and off we go, we're ready to go... together with another thousand competitors swirling in front of us. The goal is to run towards the egg, climbing position after position to finish first. Meanwhile you have to kill the other sperm with laser shots. The circuit, if we want to call it that, is procedurally generated and changes from game to game. The graphics are so bad that it's hard to understand why mankind hasn't become extinct. Did we really run into that stuff? Let's hope that in reality the textures are better, otherwise we would have to admit that sperms have no aesthetic sense. That would be really sad. Did we really hope that a game called Spermination would contain something good? Coitus interruptus Now, from a race, even if only between sperms, one would expect a minimum sense of speed and to feel the taste of competition. In Spermination there is none of this. The pace of the game is very slow, despite the competitors whirling in front of our eyes with a certain fury. It is true that you can shoot, but it is equally true that it is almost useless to do so: the targets are too many and too small. When you are in the final stages of the race, with few opponents ahead, trying to hit them is really frustrating. However the game is all here, there is nothing else. In reality there is something, but it is nothing beautiful. For example, it is not clear why this woman's cervix is full of turrets that shoot at us, just as it is not clear why sperms should collect dollars to buy extra weapons, weapons which are worse than the standard laser. Better to invest in engines (???) and bonuses that increase speed, so as to have a better chance of finishing first... but why? Does anyone really want to buy this stuff? We're not kidding. Spermination runs out in half an hour, if you really want to see everything, and we assure you that it is not a pleasant half hour. It took us longer to write the review than to finish it, with the blank page of the word processor feeling less agonizing than usual after playing it.", "date": "2015-05-04", "grade": "2.0"}
