{"name": "The Sims Bowling", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-bowling_a.html", "text": "The Sims Bowling was born with the declared intention of combining the mechanics of personalization and growth of the character typical of the EA series with a bit of healthy pinball, which has always been one of the most popular genres on mobile phones. Too bad, however, that the game is unable to fully hit either of the two objectives, finally revealing itself to be a substantially inferior play experience to many others. Let's see why in detail. First of all, The Sims Bowling immediately betrays its primary intention, offering a barely sketched simulation component: after creating your own character (choosing among rather limited parameters, however), all you have to do is select an aspiration that is almost completely irrelevant in the continuation of your career, and then try to ring victories and see the relative popularity index increase accordingly. In short, the growth component of The Sims Bowling stops at a couple of extremely elementary variables: the greater the number of successes and strikes, the greater one's ascendancy over the public. That's all. Very little for a product that bears this name, a defect that joins with serious consequences the dramatic absence of content from the EA Mobile title. In fact, there are no tournaments of any kind, nor rankings of opponents, only random games to be faced without any stimulus, given the already mentioned absence of thickness of the sim component. A choice probably the result of the desire to make the title as ~hit and run~ as possible, but which literally cuts the legs off longevity. The Sims Bowling fails to redeem itself completely even in terms of pure and simple bowling, due to an alternately cumbersome and unrealistic digital reproduction. There are three stages necessary to throw the ball, including relative indicators: first you move on a horizontal axis to choose a position, then you define the trajectory and finally the power of the shot, according to the classic system of pressing the key at the most appropriate moment. Short but annoying loadings occur between all the steps of the operation, which once completed proves to be unsatisfactory: the physics of the ball and pins are completely improbable, to the point that it is not at all difficult to make one strike after another. It goes without saying that the first element to be affected by all this is the level of challenge, practically non-existent. The only aspect of the EA Mobile production that is not openly contestable is the graphic one, which can boast a good use of colors and a convincing two-dimensional rendering of the setting, even if limited to a single scenario.
