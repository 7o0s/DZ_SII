Classic shooters were far from the basic simplicity that some reinterpretations of the genre want to suggest nowadays: just think of titles like ThunderForce, Super Aleste or R-Type to understand how behind an elementary premise there could be tactics, readiness of reflexes, stamina, style and a sense of constant challenge. In a word, the entire videogame in a broad sense underlies this videogame archetype, therefore the reductions to the minimum terms of its characteristics can be pertinent, but always bearing in mind the great respect that shoot'em up deserves even in the current era . Guns of Mercy on the one hand presents itself as a sort of chaotic parody of the shooter, essentially focusing only on shooting around at everything that moves, however it also pays homage to the great tradition of the genre through its retro graphic style, which incorporates some classic between sprites and animations, and also introducing deeper features in the gameplay, which does not disdain the study of attack patterns and a certain tactical approach, in the most difficult situations. Obviously the level design is completely missing, since it is a substantially fixed screen in which the protagonist is constantly attacked by enemies without being able to move much. It is not a small shortcoming, but for this very reason Guns of Mercy should be considered as a separate experience with respect to the canons of the shooter and perhaps something closer to a ~shooting gallery~, in the style of Cabal or Nam 75, in a certain sense. Warm your fingers because you never stop shooting in Guns of Mercy One ranger, many enemies The protagonist is a ranger armed to the teeth, forced to continuously shoot waves of enemies that crowd the screen until the pre-set amount of kills is reached in order to ~pacify~ the various levels. The screen is fixed and the controls only allow you to move left and right on the horizontal axis and rotate the weapon 180 degrees so that you can hit enemies from different angles. There is no energy and one shot is enough to kill our hero, who can however count on ample firepower, the support of occasional combat exoskeletons and the use of temporary shields to try to keep himself alive until the end of the internships, fortunately short enough to balance the constant threat of elimination. The bonuses earned in battle can be invested in purchasing and upgrading the soldier's weapons and characteristics, the management of which emerges in the intermission phases between one level and another, which take place inside an elevator. Guns of Mercy is free-to-play and we know what this entails: various in-app purchases allow you to speed up upgrades or revive your character thus continuing from the level in which we arrived, instead of always having to start from the first on the roguelike style, but in general the mechanics are not too biased towards purchases. The game is represented with large pixelated 2D graphics that recall the classics of the genre, and its large sprites and animations help to enhance the action helping to make the good old act of ~blasting~ everything that you find particularly enjoyable. moves on the screen.", "date": "2017-05-12", "grade": "7.8"}
