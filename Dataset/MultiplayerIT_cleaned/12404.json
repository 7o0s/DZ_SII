Inaugurated by Ghosts and Goblins and continued by Ghouls 'n Ghosts, of which the Super NES episode is not a simple conversion, the saga has only experienced new remakes very recently (including the mobile remake and the excellent one for Playstation portable). The basic formula of Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts for SuperNES is faithful to that of arcade titles. The player is in control of Sir Arthur, in search of his beautiful kidnapped by the evil gothic monster of the moment in a gaming world of extreme difficulty, which does not forgive the single mistake or distraction. The universe of the game is populated by a mixed horror-macabre fairy tale-gothic universe fauna that includes zombies, reborn skeletons, crows and other murderous animals, freaks of nature, demonic ogres with the second face on their stomach just to name a few. What was it yesterday The platforming environments with steps, platforms and elements typical of the genre, include the haunted graveyard, the stormy ocean on the galleon and the crumbling lifeboats, the hellish dungeons, and peaks like a huge horror intestine full of fangs and deadly creatures in which to wander almost like helpless tapeworms. However, as in the arcade games, in the SuperNES episode you jump a little and very carefully, and mostly you shoot enemies in bursts, collecting weapons with very different characteristics from range (from knives to the scythe, from the rotating axe, from the simple spear to incendiary torch). It's all about avoiding lethal contact with deadly enemies and elements. One touch and Arthur's armor will disintegrate, leaving him in his underwear. In the chests it is possible to upgrade the armor from the traditional model to the green one (weapons become decidedly more lethal) and subsequently to the golden one (one is provided with a devastating and different loading shot depending on the weapon supplied). What is it today Today as yesterday, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is an original game that fascinates with a very high-class aesthetic, musical and artistic guise, capable of being appreciated even fifteen years later. The Super NES game deviates slightly from the formula of its arcade predecessors, but keeps another feature unchanged since those times: the very high difficulty, the seriousness of the commitment required and, with these, the frustration that the game can bring to less patient player. Let's take an element of differentiation from the arcades, the elimination of the vertical shot and the addition of a double jump to be performed at any time in mid-air. As a consequence of this, the levels feel a little more platforming and a little less shooter-like, and more like Ghosts 'n Goblins than Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Yet these are vastly revisited so that the double jump becomes an element to be used strategically to survive attacks and ravines in turn redesigned to do harm. What is it today For example, since Arthur's jump direction doesn't change while running, the only way to avoid an enemy that has appeared in the meantime will be to use the second mid-air jump. The same will also be true for negotiating platforms that are impossible to reach with a single jump or for navigating the ravines below and thorns above. And so in Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts the admiration for the backdrops, the music, the horror full of humor go hand in hand with the frustration for the difficulty of the game, for the rage of this against the player. Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is an experience out of time, but it is recommended for hardcore and very patient players, who will be able to accept its challenge with the right patience and tenacity. Patience, in particular, will have to be a lot. By way of example, suffice it to mention this. Arrived for the first time in the presence of the last boss, after seven levels of suffering (unless a cheat mode has been used) the kidnapped girl will send Arthur back to find a missing pendant before facing him, starting again ~alone~. from the first level. Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is one of the absolute classics of the sixteen-bit era and one of the most important titles in the first generation Super NES catalog, when the war between Nintendo and Sega was fought with the sound of conversions and exclusives. The Capcom title is mainly remembered for the excellent music sector, for the gothic and horror aesthetics with the right touch of humor and for the extreme commitment required of the player. All these characteristics have remained intact after about fifteen years: those who buy the game from the Virtual Console today for 800 Wii Points will only know the same fascination and the same frustration already experienced by longtime players.", "date": "2007-03-28", "grade": null}
