We refer you to the same article for everything concerning the broadest explanation of the contents of the product in question, since the vast majority of them are common to all the versions published by the French house. Specifically in these lines we will focus instead on the Xbox One edition, the new Microsoft console which is taking the very first steps of its long and - hopefully - glorious future existence. Even on Xbox One with the new Kinect Just Dance 2014 works and is fun All on track For those who have taken a vacation on Mars in recent years, it is enough to know that Just Dance is a game in which you dance in front of the TV to the rhythm of very famous pop songs following more or less complex choreographies. The formula has had enormous success, especially on Nintendo consoles, thanks to an apt combination of factors, starting with a gameplay that sacrifices rigor and severity in favor of extreme accessibility capable of not posing any entry barrier even for those who don't know nothing video games or dance. Because, unlike much more demanding proposals such as Dance Central, in Just Dance there are no punishments if your coordination is not very good: at worst, you will find yourself having collected fewer points than your companions in the final evaluation. In fact, despite the fact that this last episode tries with a reasonable profit to strengthen the single player component thanks to the new pleasant online mode, it is clear how the Ubisoft production is destined to give its best when sharing the ~stage~ of the same living room with other friends . In this context, the Xbox One version of Just Dance 2014 shows off the main addition compared to the other editions, namely the exclusive possibility of managing 6 players simultaneously against the standard 4. In hindsight, it is a solution destined to interest in all likelihood a very small group of users equipped with a room large enough to accommodate six people and the relative space for movement, but more than anything else this addition constitutes a clear testimony of the superior capabilities of the new Kinect with which every - it should be remembered - single Xbox One is equipped. In our specific experience we had to limit ourselves to trying the game with four participants, with a pinch of envy thinking about who will be able to make the most of the possibility offered. Therefore, the analysis of the behavior of Kinect deserves a few lines, engaged on this occasion in one of the very first strictly playful roles after the widely described integration with the console dashboard. Certainly it must be said that Just Dance 2014 cannot be defined as the ideal and most demanding test bed for verifying the effective improvements of the new motion detection sensor from Microsoft: as already mentioned, Ubisoft's casual game has never put the precise analysis of the movements of the aspiring dancers slowly, preferring rather an intelligent general indulgence. To this must also be added the fact that very first generation games, and not even exclusively made ones, certainly cannot be perfect witnesses of the potential of the hardware in the months to come. That said, our experience was quite positive, albeit not perfect; in fact, some well-executed steps were occasionally deemed invalid, with more than 3 people in the game we identified some tracking problems, and similarly navigating the menus by waving the hands was soon sidelined in favor of the faster and more precise controller, or alternatively the related companion app on Smartglass. The latter convinced us by offering a useful integration with the menus, additional information and the possibility of being used to manage the Party Master mode, in which a player is called to decide the dance steps that the unfortunate companions will have to perform. For the rest, Just Dance 2014 is practically the same game that we analyzed on Wii U, both in terms of methods and in the contents available, including the online store with which to expand - for a fee - the not particularly exciting initial tracklist. It is therefore an excellent party game, ideal for involving anyone who agrees to exchange a little dignity for a good dose of fun. It's certainly not a product capable of flexing Xbox One muscles, but potentially inInteresting for a certain type of player and for those who want to use the Kinect not only in the system menus. One last note on the installation size, which is close to 23 GB to which any additional content you want to buy must then be added.", "date": "2013-11-29", "grade": "8.0"}
