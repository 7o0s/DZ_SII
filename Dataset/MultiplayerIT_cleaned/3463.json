{"name": "Maelstrom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maelstrom-la-recensione.html", "text": "There is a new battle royale that is enjoying great public approval on Steam, although it is still in the beta phase: it is Maelstrom, not to be confused with the RTS of the same name published in 2007 by Codemasters. Rather, there is talk of a title that takes inspiration from the naval battles of Sid Meier's Pirates! and Assassin's Creed IV, with a graphic style that vaguely recalls Sea Of Thieves and World Of WarCraft and mixes it with the mechanics that are so fashionable in recent months. The production of Gunpowder's Games (software house in its first work, but full of industry veterans), able to collect only $ 16,000 during the Kickstarter campaign launched in March last year (in any case more than enough to break through the minimum threshold $10,000), has just exited Early Access and is now free to play. All those who had contributed with hard cash (to the backers of the crowdfunding platform are added those who paid out about 20 dollars for the Early Access version) are guaranteed a series of bonuses which, as always happens in free-to-play, can be purchased as well as obtained, more slowly, with experience in the field. Three races in eternal conflict Before setting sail you have to choose a boat from the nine available: there are three for each race, i.e. humans, orcs and dwarves. The choice of ship changes the approach to battles, given that a greater tonnage usually corresponds to heavier armor but also slower maneuvering speeds. Although they can be traced back to three macrogroups, depending on the size, each has unique characteristics. By accumulating experience, the vessels improve their statistics, divided into five categories, up to the maximum level set at 10. The one relating to the player is instead 50: progress does not guarantee specific bonuses, but at each increase you are rewarded with currency of the various gameplay and power-ups. This level is then reset to zero at the end of each season to avoid vicious circles in which the strongest continue to dominate. Remaining on the economic theme, Maelstrom recognizes two types of currency: gold, which is earned by sinking ships and completing daily missions and which is used to unlock improvements, and gunpowder (purchasable with physical money) whose use is delegated to aesthetic embellishments, thus avoiding that the title can be transformed into a pay-to-win. Basics of the game The essence of the game is simple: the game takes place within an archipelago whose borders progressively shrink over time. In addition to open sea areas, there are cliffs and caves in which to slip to escape enemies, perhaps taking advantage of the currents that provide considerable acceleration. There is no shortage of phenomena that give the title its name, namely the Maelstroms: lethal whirlpools of water in which to push enemies to quickly get the better of it. The battles see sixteen players challenge each other in a free-for-all or divided into teams of three boats. In addition to other flesh-and-blood opponents, there are decidedly affordable AI-controlled enemies: cannon fodder that is used to collect gold and other bonuses with which to temporarily enhance your vessel. To mess up the cards on the table there are terrible sea monsters that appear more or less randomly and that strike anyone who gets too close; Of course, the last one alive wins. In Gunpowder battle royale, tactics matter more than brute force. Of course, ram an opposing ship, launching yourself at full speed to starboard or port side is always a very strong temptation, but more often than not it proves harmful, given that the vessels are protected by armor highlighted by a white bar on the sides of the boat and in order to KO them, you must first make them vulnerable. It soon becomes clear that the most important thing is to avoid always offering the same flank to the enemy's cannon fire, in order to minimize the damage suffered. Following the same logic, due to the very long reload times of the cannons, it is important not only to land your shots, but above all to identify the areas that have already been hit. There are three types of attack: one that reduces the armour, one that damages the sails (limiting the maneuvering speed) and one that directly affects the crew: in fact, it is possible to sink the opponent even by killing the captain. One of the biggest problems is that the tutorial does not sufficiently explain the importance of the various types of attack and the loot dropped by AI-controlled enemies: the risk is that the latest arrivals take a few games too many to learn the dynamics with the riresult of spending more time on the seabed than on the surface. Fast paces If this description makes you think of an extremely slow and tactical game, you are very wrong: battles often turn into real carnage that last a few seconds, since it happens that the computer ~gives birth~ to a good part of the ships at the same point. This causes furious ~all against all~ from which you can also decide to slip away to face the last remaining ship, perhaps ~stealing~ the loot left by the opponents and taking advantage of the put to the test defenses. The battles are much faster than the average of titles belonging to this genre: at most in a quarter of an hour you will find yourself on the home screen ready to start a new game. This is due both to the size of the maps and to the absence of a management part: you simply collect everything possible regardless of the boat's load capacity. The mathmaking system works quite well, as it tries to put players of similar level into the same game; unlike blockbusters such as PUBG or Fortnite, the times to populate the seas, despite the much lower numbers of players (just over a dozen at the same time), can be slightly longer: in some cases we had to wait even a couple of minutes (a bit too many considering the average duration of a match). We have noticed that solo matches are more popular than team matches, perhaps because there is no reward system for the team: in fact, the loot collected by a player is not shared with the other two members, nor is there the possibility of helping those in difficulty. Technically we are facing a game that combines an all in all original and pleasant style with popular hardware requirements, in order to embrace the largest possible user base. Maybe something could have been done on the audio front, a bit repetitive, but it's a mole that can be overlooked also considering the free nature of Maelstrom.", "date": "2019-10-02", "grade": "7.0"}
