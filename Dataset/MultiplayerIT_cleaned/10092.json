The success of the first Runaway then led to the creation of two new chapters: the first adventure of Brian and Gina was followed in 2006 by Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle, however received with less enthusiasm than the first game of the series, while still maintaining the interest of those who had enjoyed A Road Adventure high. Four years later we find ourselves with Runaway: A Twist of Fate to definitively close the trilogy of the story of Brian and Gina, in a graphic adventure with a classic point and click mold intending to have its say again in a genre always given for doomed but never definitively shipwrecked in today's gaming market. Goodbye Brian? Runaway 3 begins exactly where the second chapter of the series ended, with Brian accused of murder and locked up in the Happy Dale psychiatric hospital for having declared during the trial that he does not remember anything of what he was asked during interrogations. In the same hospital, however, Brian ends up being involved in an accident and dies, and this is exactly where Runaway: A Twist of Fate begins: in a cemetery during the funeral of the game's protagonist, who will soon turn out to be an obvious fake conspired to escape from the bad guys with the help of Gina, the only person present at the fake ceremony. From now on you will have to discover the story for yourself since we have already said too much and will not reveal anything else: just know that the plot remains at fairly high levels, always offering the player a reason to go on also thanks to a series of very well thought out twists, among which we also find historical characters from the Runaway series. The choices made by the Pndulos demonstrate how the player's interest can be kept alive without inventing who knows what, but simply giving a touch of unpredictability not only to the story itself, but also to the way it is told, without losing the linearity of what is narrated. It won't be an adventure Runaway 3 fits perfectly within the most classic canons of its genre, where the point and click control system essentially concerns a few keyboard shortcuts (help, inventory, saves) plus the two mouse buttons: with the right you scroll through the various actions that can be performed on an object or a person to interact with, while the action is performed with the left. While not enjoying original novelties in its game mechanics, Runaway 3 successfully aims to improve the less appreciated points in the previous chapters, starting from the possibility of highlighting the hotspots on the screen with the simple push of a button, thus eliminating the annoying pixel hunting problem present in the first two chapters: something that we can only appreciate and appreciate. The progressive help system to turn to in case you have to get stuck completes the picture, always offering a way to avoid the frustration of having to rack your brains for hours behind a puzzle, even if ten-twenty-year-old graphic adventure lovers ago they might turn up their noses: this is the price of progress. Another welcome novelty is constituted for the first time by the presence of another playable main character other than Brian: it is Gina herself, in the role of which we find ourselves initially in the first of the six chapters that make up Runaway: A Twist of Fate , during which Brian's funeral is celebrated. The alternation between the two protagonists makes us bind more to the beautiful presence of Gina, at the same time giving a touch of variety that certainly does not displease. Living in a cartoon The graphic style of Runaway 3 maintains the one chosen by the developers for the first two chapters of the series unchanged and is characterized by a colorful and cartoonish trait in which the good Brian took his first steps overwhelmed by the irrepressible Gina, clothes definitively abandoned during the adventure to become the worthy companion of the woman. From a strictly technical point of view, the approximately ten years that have passed since the first chapter have made it necessary to give the design of the characters and environments a good rinse, which now appear in 2.5D thanks to the use of cel shading forthe moving figures: the result is pleasant and in any case linked to the past of the series, which in this way has not been distorted but rather reaches the maximum level of maturity thanks to an excellent use of colours. Everything concerning the sound sector is also of the first level, which can boast a very respectable dubbing in English (with subtitles in Italian) plus the voice of the usual Vera Dominguez to compose part of the soundtrack of the game, in itself always present and guessed to tell at best the various moments that make up the story.", "date": "2010-04-07", "grade": "8.2"}
