{"name": "One Piece: World Seeker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/one-piece-world-seeker-recensione.html", "text": "With over ninety active volumes, One Piece is today the latest manga to be published among the so-called Big Three that have redefined Japanese shonen comics in recent years. While Dragon Ball and Naruto continue between spin-offs and sequels, One Piece continues its run thanks to the tireless imagination of its author Eiichiro Oda, representing one of the main pillars of Japanese publishing. As such, it could not escape the tape marketing of tie-ins on video game tie-ins of fluctuating quality, often entrusted to the developer Ganbarion to satisfy the palates of the fans. Maybe that's why we were waiting for One Piece: World Seeker, whose review you are reading, with a certain curiosity. It's a game that tries to reinvent the overused beat 'em up and musou and RPG formula with an open world approach that fits well with Oda's whimsical and imaginative universe. Too bad that a series of slips compromised the final result, as you can read in the following lines. An out-of-canon story One Piece: World Seeker is placed out of continuity in the long history of the series. Consider it a kind of filler, like a feature film that has no repercussions on the future of Luffy and his band of pirates. This means that you could play it even without knowing the series at all, but at that point it would make little sense because you would lose all the fanservice on which the plot is based. In fact, our heroes are shipwrecked on a completely new island at the beginning of the game, where the navy has been established for some time, splitting the population in two. There are those who are in favor of the navy and those who are against: in particular, the young Jeanne leads a sort of resistance in the name of her deceased mother. Jeanne is a bit the engine of the whole story and the story of World Seeker revolves around her and her complicated family situation. At first distrustful, Jeanne will ask Luffy and his crew for help to restore peace on the island: our task, as Straw Hat, will therefore be to reunite the dispersed band and then help the inhabitants solve their problems. The story, in fact, is divided into various chapters or main missions, but the game displays a very generous amount of secondary missions - not always optional - which are divided into various categories. After accepting an assignment, we will have to reach a certain place and collect objects, defeat some enemies and so on. The variety is not very much, but there are some more particular missions in which we will have to find characters or places within a certain time limit or by following visual clues; sometimes we'll even have to play in stealth, even if these missions are often frustrating and out of place. The most important missions are more articulated and focus on the small events of the inhabitants, relying on somewhat verbose and rarely dubbed dialogues in Japanese, even if mostly the characters limit themselves to saying a word or two expressing their moods. soul. If it is true that the story missions are the juiciest, often also linked by cinematics of a certain impact, it is still essential to try your hand at the secondary ones for various reasons. First, they're pretty much the only thing there is to do in the game. Secondly, they increase Karma with the various supporting actors: it is a kind of bond that grows by completing tasks or reaching certain objectives and which increases Luffy's popularity, unlocking skits, costumes and more. Finally, the missions reward us with materials and skill points that serve to increase the power of our hero. I fight-meh-nti Gabarion has found an intriguing, albeit obvious, way to bring together on the island practically all the supporting characters and the most important enemies that Luffy has known in twenty-two years of publication. Characters such as Smoker, Kuzan, Crocodile, and so on appear in the form of bosses or minibosses, often occupying a position on Luffy's Karma page. Unfortunately, the fights against these enemies are far from exciting, not so much because they are designed in a banal and anticlimactic way, but because it is the combat system that disappoints on all fronts. It must be understood, in fact, that One Piece: World Seeker is a game focused mainly on exploration, but Ganbarion could have squeezed a little more to make the clashes - which exist and are also quite frequent - more interesting. Without inconveniencing the fact that you only control Luffy - we'll come back to it later - for practically the entire game you are left with a combat system essentially centered on two fighting styles that each haveof a single combo. By spending the skill points earned, the player can actually expand Luffy's resources, but it's very little stuff. The idea of the two styles isn't bad either: Busoshoku is slower but allows you to parry, take shots better and break through the opponent's defenses; the Kenbunshoku guarantees greater speed, the possibility of dodging and taking enemies from behind. The problem is that the controls remain woody and unresponsive, so it's also inconvenient to change style in the middle of a fight - Luffy must first finish the combo - or simply interpret the animations of the enemies to dodge or parry at the right time, triggering some additional abilities that mimic the most sophisticated action games. In short, we are not playing Bayonetta or Dark Souls, of course, but a little more substance would have been welcome. It must be said that the points are earned quite quickly and therefore skills are unlocked from the very beginning, expanding the repertoire of special shots - they consume an indicator that fills up during the clashes - but also improving the vital parameters and the Luffy's movement ability. The fact remains, however, that the variety of enemies is extremely low and that their disposition leaves you dumbfounded in most cases. One Piece: World Seeker, in this respect, is simply not drawn well. There are enemies who take you from miles away or who perceive your presence in a completely random way, while the strongest roam together with the weakest, taking you out with two shots to very delicately suggest that you are not yet ready to face them. Luffy's power, in fact, grows with Karma and with the accessories he equips: the latter are found in the boxes scattered around the island, or can be manufactured on the Thousand Sunny. Playstation 4 trophies The 44 trophies are divided into 28 bronze, 12 silver and 3 gold, to which obviously the platinum trophy must be added. They are earned by completing missions, unlocking various abilities, defeating enemies under certain conditions, and exploring the entire island. An empty world Once the crew is reunited, Luffy can access the Thousand Sunny, but don't get me wrong: you can't navigate, since the ship is moored, and we can only talk to our companions. We will be able to send them on a mission to recover materials on our own, consuming the ones we have collected so that Sanji can prepare travel delicacies; in addition, Franky and Usopp will allow us to manufacture accessories and outfits that can improve Luffy's parameters and, in some cases, even change his appearance. Collecting collectibles is very important: they appear as bright dots on the map and are also needed in many missions. Unfortunately, the exploration element of One Piece: World Seeker is essentially limited to finding crates and materials around the world, which is a shame because the island designed by Ganbarion is really beautiful. More than anything else it is faithful to the style of Eiichiro Oda, while not guaranteeing a huge variety of settings and locales. It is mostly a verdant island in which villages, mountains and more sophisticated cities alternate, but the Unreal Engine 4 showcases bright colors, many details and a very pleasant glance. The problem is that this ~open world~, which opens up almost immediately, is almost completely empty. Except for the inhabitants who wander around the city - however in a decidedly small number compared to the size of the environments - and for the enemies scattered almost everywhere, the island of One Piece: World Seeker is deserted. There are no animals, monsters or creatures that give it any semblance of vitality, there is not even a day/night cycle or an alternation of atmospheric effects. In short, the initial positive impact soon runs out to give way to boredom and repetitiveness also due to a soundtrack that must be manually customized to be more present: an original feature but of dubious utility. Exploring the island, fortunately, is quite fun, once you unlock the right skills. Luffy can run faster, float temporarily but, above all, project himself from one ledge to another using the characteristic Gom Gom Rocket as if he were Insomniac's Spider-Man. Unfortunately, some sketchy collisions and a camera that is too close complicate things, but in general it is a lot of fun to jump here and there, always being very careful not to end up in the water otherwise you will start again from the nearest checkpoint after an annoying loading. It is clear that Ganbarion has centered the entire game on Luffy precisely because of his rubbery ability to move around an environmentvery vast action: it wouldn't have been as much fun doing it in the shoes of his companions, even if the combat would certainly have gained in variety and depth. Too bad, therefore, that you spend all the time playing as Straw Hat, also because visually One Piece: World Seeker respects the sources with a polygonal modeling and a cel shading that do justice to the style of Oda and his famous characters .", "date": "2019-03-14", "grade": "6.0"}
