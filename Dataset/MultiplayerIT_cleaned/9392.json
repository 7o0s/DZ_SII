A title that leads us to defeat a new destroyer that threatens the city of New York, the evil Dumazu. The Ghostbusters music immediately puts us at ease and the strips that illustrate the plot aren't bad. The dialogues are in line with the feeling of the films and the four original protagonists also appear in the story as well as the cowardly and weak Janosz, who once again cannot keep his hands in his pockets. But when it comes to action, the ball passes to the recruits in a sort of a priori citation of what we will probably find in the third cinematic chapter of the saga. Forbidden to colorblind Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime is a top-down action game that sees four young ghostbusters grappling with yet another crisis in the psychic world. A room-based shoot'em up that guides us along 12 levels largely inspired by the locations of the two films. During the first three missions, the weapons are unlocked, which are 3 and are the basis of the main mechanics of the game which asks us to match the right weapon to the correct ghost, avoiding the enemies who crowd under. In short, a concept like any other but made in a very simplistic and unattractive way. In fact, the models of the ghosts are few, poor and continually reproposed and they do not differ in their abilities, perhaps calling us to choose a weapon after having observed them, but they arrive already dyed with the color of the weapon that can damage them. Thus it happens to be attacked by hundreds of zombies, bats or red, blue and yellow skulls that synthesize the fantasy and inspiration spent to create the ectoplasms of Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime. Among other things, in addition to being few and badly made, the enemies limit themselves to always doing the same thing or running into our necks or throwing something at us without adopting any tactics other than some pre-established laps. For the bosses, however, the classic rounds make more sense since we are facing a single opponent who causes a lot of damage and must be blocked with the famous proton flows until the trap icon appears. Then, once the capture device is thrown, a minigame is triggered that asks you to rapidly press a sequence of keys to capture the ectoplasmic entity. But even in this case the experience is rather limited and the gameplay remains decidedly flat. There is obviously no shortage of power ups which are a classic of this genre and are double damage, resistance and double points. In terms of gameplay, choosing between double damage and double score doesn't make much sense since these are bonuses that have completely different purposes, and it doesn't even make much sense to insert collectible Marshmallow puppets inside destructible objects in a game completely devoid of exploration. In fact, in addition to being forced to move from anonymous room to anonymous room according to a pre-established order, we are also forced to destroy every single piece of furniture, prolonging an experience that is already not very exciting in itself. On the other hand, the presence of Slimer, the famous tuber abortion, is less senseless, which when knocked down gives a power up and adds a little color, perhaps having one of the best models, apart from perhaps the enormous psychokinetic robot that awaits the players at the end of the second stage . The profession of ghostbuster During the single player campaign we are joined by three other ghostbusters managed by the CPU and one of the fundamental mechanics of the title concerns the need to heal fallen comrades. Too bad that the artificial intelligence of the allies is not so much better than that of the enemies, leading our companions to try desperate cures without attacking the opponents anymore. And if this behavior is initially of little influence, given that the ghosts are few and do not attack often, in the more advanced levels it becomes a real plague capable of leading to game over dozens and dozens of times. Returning to the 3 weapons available, the proton backpack shoots the famous beam that can block enemies, the fermion rifle launches a sort of electromagnetic wave and the plasma fires projectiles that are strengthened when they bounce off the wall. Well, the plasma inductor represents the peak of Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime playability as it requires a minimum of triangulation from us. For the rest, the title is limited to making us run shooting at random with the only foresight to equip the right weapon based on the color of the enemies. In short, someone must have thought that simple gameplay and seasoned with hordes of nemici is always a winner. Well, as many know the question is decidedly more complex. When there is a simple gameplay, the detail, the balance and the collisions become fundamental to make a title interesting and attractive and these elements seem to be missing altogether from the Behavior Studios title. As for the controls, there are no particular differences between the pad and the keyboard. In fact, despite using a pointer to aim, the speed of movement of the ghostbusters is contented and the pad is more than sufficient to manage it. Among other things, the response of the commands is too slow and often imprecise and this, in an arcade title based on manual skill, is another boulder on a production already lacking in several respects. Who doesn't play together Ghostbuster: Sanctum of Slime can be played in co-op for up to four players and unfortunately we were disappointed to discover that the PC version does not offer online co-op, which forced us to limit the experience to two players. But they were enough to see that the title in the company works better. In fact, it becomes possible to coordinate with the various types of weapon and better manage the treatments when the companions fall and also this mode gives us someone to distract us with when waves of enemies all the same keep us nailed in almost always similar rooms for periods of time that seem infinite . In fact, over the long distance, repetitiveness, defects and poor gameplay are felt anyway. Furthermore, the difficulty towards the ninth scene becomes another cause of irritation turning into a nightmare and not thanks to a tight balance, but due to the chaos and the impossibility of understanding whether an enemy bullet is hitting us or not. And even the sessions on board the Ecto 1 in the off-road version do not improve the general picture and get lost in the most total chaos, as well as losing even that minimal feeling represented by the spartan but film-inspired locations. Anonymous streets and non-existent playability certainly don't bring to mind the New York of the films and instead of distracting from the basic formula they end up turning into obstacles to be overcome in a hurry. The most interesting part of the title, apart from the first few minutes grappling with a proton beam that are always exciting for a fan of ghostbusters, is represented by the Ghostbuster objects that can be purchased for the Xbox Live avatar. The five gadgets are the baseball cap (80 MS points), the uniform (240 MS points), the remote-controlled version of the Ecto Mobile in 4WD version (320 MS points), the Marshmallow Stay Puft mascot (320 MS points) and Slimer in pet version (320 MS points).", "date": "2011-03-28", "grade": "4.5"}
