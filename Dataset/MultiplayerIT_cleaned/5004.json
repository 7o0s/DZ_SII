While the shooter of Respawn Entertainment is updated with free but not very full-bodied content, DICE instead follows a more classic path, being able to rely on a decidedly superior player base. We therefore flew to Stockholm to the offices of the Swedish developers to play and thoroughly test They Shall not Pass, the first of four DLC packs that will arrive on the game servers during the year. Taking a quick look at the contents, you immediately notice how DICE has not held back in the least, bringing with it four new maps, a new game mode, two operations, six new guns and four other melee weapons, plus a new armored behemoth and an elite class. An unmissable content for lovers of Battlefield 1, the DICE shooter You can not pass! ~On ne passe pas~, as the French would say. It is precisely with this war cry used during the battle of Verdun in the First World War that the French army charged to push back the German army. DICE draws heavily from the great conflict and brings back to our screens some of the most significant battles of the French campaign. For us gamers this means being able to relive the most evocative and bloody battles of the period in a fictionalized way, and taking the first steps in the new DLC it is precisely the atmosphere that leaves you impressed. The Swedish developers have capitalized on the criticisms made by the community, further raising the bar of emotional involvement while playing. The endless poppy fields of the Breccia map, the burning heights of Verdun, the impregnable fortress of Fort Vaux and the now abandoned village in the center of Soissons are just some of the elements that envelop anyone who sets foot in the new maps, leaving them stunned in front of an attention to detail certainly not new for the series, but which in this case increases even more the clear separation between the beauty of the settings and the cruelty of the battle. Many had complained that Battlefield 1 took little advantage of trench warfare, the real distinctive element of the First World War and this DLC seems to want to fill that gap. As you approach the heart of the battle the beauty of the landscape fades into the background, the screams of the burning enemies and the hiss of bullets quickly bring you back to the stark reality and in no time at all you will find yourself surrounded and besieged on all sides of the map, with little chance of spotting enemies in the distance. Verdun and Fort Vaux have been specially designed to make hand-to-hand combat the core of the game, with soldiers crossing and colliding suddenly around a blind curve, stabbing with makeshift weapons, impaling each other with bayonets or exchanging deadly pistol shots at close range. It is impressive to see two large groups of enemies face each other and to see fellow soldiers and opponents dropping like flies in a cloud of smoke and dust. They are exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping and exceptional battles to both watch and play, in all classic modes. Snipers still find their place and can target players who attempt to recklessly venture out of the trenches as they move to reach a capture point or to control a more favorable position. On the other hand, in these two maps, there is not even the shadow of means and the infantry is once again put under the magnifying glass for a game that changes, turns into something much more intimate and personal than the immense open spaces of the original title. A change and variety that will accompany Battlefield 1 throughout the course of the four DLCs, which in the future will also lead you to face naval battles and assaults on well-defended strongholds. There is also space for some more classic maps, with greater breadth and where land and air vehicles reappear, attacks on horseback and, above all, a new armored behemoth built on the model of the CHAR 2C tank, which in 1917 was mainly used as a means of propaganda by the army French but here manages to easily turn the tide of battle thanks to its devastating firepower. Forward without fear! The new Frontline mode doesn't do anything really new in the Battlefield 1 landscape, fusing together Rush and Conquest but at the same time giving a solid and effective game system. nouninitially the players will have to conquer control points and push back the opposing defensive line, until they reach two telegraphs placed on the edge of the map and make them explode. It is not a one-way battle, however, since the defense will be able to push the attackers back to their base and destroy it through the same mechanics. It is a continuous push and pull that can end furiously in a few minutes, in the event of supremacy of one of the two formations, or even continue for over fifty minutes when the two factions are equal. As we said, it is nothing particularly original but it does its job properly, managing to give always very close fights. The telegraphs are placed in strategic positions that are not particularly easy to defend, which often gives rise to furious gun-cotton battles with the two sides massacring each other on the last conquered point with incendiary and smoke grenade shots. In addition to a new mode, new weapons could not be missing, which try to differentiate themselves from the existing ones while not going to break the fragile balance of power created so far. The same goes for the new vehicle and the fixed artillery emplacements placed on the larger maps, thanks to which to rain bombs with indirect hits on the poor unfortunates. An important note instead for the new elite class created specifically to fit perfectly with the design of these maps. We find ourselves in the hands of a front-line soldier capable of absorbing a huge amount of blows and taking out opponents with a single blow of his spiked club. In narrow spaces and corridors it becomes an insurmountable wall to take shelter behind and we can guarantee you that its added value during assaults is immediately perceived as soon as the Trench Raider takes the field. To garnish a truly full-bodied first package there are also two new operations for forty and sixty-four players, which enhance the whole classic game system. The first few minutes of the assault on Devil's Anvil alone could already be worth the price of admission, with infantry up to their necks in mud and particle effects of flames licking the player's chamber. Surprising as always also the sound effects that complete the whole by giving enveloping and particularly realistic noises. The voice of war will echo in your ears for a long time to come, thanks to a package capable of guaranteeing you dozens of new hours of gameplay, obviously waiting for the other three expansions already planned. Unfortunately there will be no expansions of the single player campaign, as Lars Gustaffson confirmed to us, even if given the good feedback received in recent months it could be an interesting addition for the next chapters of the series. For now, you can safely continue to focus on the indiscriminate slaughter in the virtual French countryside.", "date": "2017-03-13", "grade": null}
