Well, here comes Futurama: Game of Drones on iOS and Android, which is characterized by a rather different approach compared to the titles related to similar television series. Instead of building the game around the well-known world of cartoons, Wooga decided to create an essentially independent video game and take advantage of Futurama to give a particular characterization to the whole. The positive note is that we are not dealing with a product that makes self-referentiality its main feature, but rather with a game structured according to solid (albeit standardized) and convincing mechanics, which exploits the important license only for mostly aesthetic. However, this courageous choice can also be a defect of Game of Drones, which for fans of the series may seem like a rare wasted opportunity to immerse themselves again in the Futurama universe, two years after the final closure of the series. A matter of points of view, therefore, but what is certain is that it is a well-constructed game, a puzzle game that expands the mechanics of the classic match-3 by presenting to all intents and purposes what a match-4 is, i.e. a title based on the association of four elements with the same characteristics within a variable grid, in an attempt to free it in the least number of moves possible. The mechanism is therefore old and well run-in, but the introduced variants also manage to make it innovative and captivating, obviously enriched by all the colorful surroundings provided by the world of Futurama. Not quite a full immersion in the world of Futurama, but Game of Drones proves to be a good puzzle The war of drones It does not change much compared to a classic match-3, but since it is a match-4 the extra element to take into consideration still helps to deepen the game mechanics and the strategy underlying the achievement of the various objectives. Basically it is a question of placing four or more transport drones of the same color side by side, taking up the theme of interplanetary deliveries that characterizes the whole cartoon, but as you advance beyond the first levels you notice how the game tries to vary the action by entering different situations in the gameplay and moving the mechanics from that of a simple match game to a real objective puzzle. In addition to supporting drones, we therefore find ourselves cleaning up levels of slime or enemies, getting pizzas to the bottom of the grids or even fighting against bosses, with which it is necessary to vary the strategy significantly and try to exploit the drones to fight. Each level places a limited amount of moves available to the player, after which a life is lost and this is the element that most connects to the free-to-play structure, given that at the end of the available lives there is a need to interrupt the action or access the micro-transactions to continue. In any case, it is a rather fair system as it tends to reward the skill of the player. Also present are the inevitable advertisements but also in this case these are not too invasive elements, so all in all the free-to-play model is adopted here in a rather positive way. Like any self-respecting match-3 (or match-4), also in this case the action is based on reasoning but also on the speed of execution, with the possibility of ringing combos and obtaining power-ups capable of freeing the playing area or otherwise help in achieving the goal by speeding up the pace. In all this, the characters and the graphic style of Futurama above all represent an aesthetic element of the outfit but there is no doubt that the original voices, the classic jokes and also a certain narrative support between the levels (obviously tending to the insane) manage to to characterize in a strong and fun way a game that otherwise could get lost in the flood of similar titles, despite its excellent qualities.", "date": "2016-03-04", "grade": "8.0"}
