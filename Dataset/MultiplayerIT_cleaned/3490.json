At first glance it is a game for smartphones based on Holly and Benji, but on closer inspection it brings with it the inevitable need to recover old ideas to fill the gaps in current production on the one hand, and the automation craze on the other of the gameplay that is becoming almost worrying. Let's start from the first question: Captain Tsubasa Zero: Miracle Shot is based on a new animated series by David Production which is in effect a remake of the first original series, consisting of 52 episodes and focused on the famous characters of Tsubasa (Holly), Genzo (Benji), Kojiro (Mark) and the others as they face the elementary and middle school soccer championships. Nothing new under the sun, but really a lot of healthy nostalgia that can easily be enough to launch with all good intentions in this new mobile title, moreover the second dedicated to the series, after Captain Tsubasa: Dream Team, perhaps the most successful game overall. At this point the second question intervenes, that is the total automation of the gameplay, which has now become almost a standard for many mobile titles and which is also establishing itself in the more classic areas, as demonstrated by the success of Auto Chess and the like on PC. Because in fact in Captain Tsubasa Zero we limit ourselves to watching the games and pressing a key every now and then to activate tactics or special moves. A clarification must be made: this is not a football game but a sort of role-playing game based on the use of characters and cards, therefore the normal dynamics of a football simulation cannot be expected. That said, the interaction is so limited, even compared to the rhythms of the game - which in any case forces you to watch entire matches almost as spectators - as to easily lead to a rejection even before understanding exactly how everything works, given that it also requires a certain dedication. Gameplay: decks of cards and football players Captain Tsubasa Zero should therefore be considered as a kind of strategy with RPG elements, almost like a hybrid management rather than a standard football game, this is an indispensable premise in order not to incur an otherwise inevitable disappointment. In terms of character management, the game in fact demonstrates a certain depth, even if everything can always be traced back to the typical setting of mobile RPGs with gacha implementations, therefore it is a matter of dedicating oneself to grinding in a rather obsessive way to obtain significant evolutions, after a first period of equilibrium in the balance. Much of the game therefore takes place in the preparation of the team: it is a question of selecting the players and strengthening them, applying skill cards, which allow you to use special moves and techniques in the game and support cards, which instead permanently modify the statistics of the characters. To deepen everything, there is also the possibility of evolving and enhancing both the cards and the characters themselves, thus arriving at a considerable variety of possible combinations, in terms of special techniques that can be used in the match and different characteristics for each player. Each operation obviously has a cost but the most expensive is the ~transfer~, which corresponds to the classic summoning of the characters and fully incorporates the traditional gacha dynamic, with the need to invest gems that are rarely collected during the game but can be purchased with real money through in-app purchases (with packages up to 90 euros in value). It must be said that the need to resort to evolutions is less felt here, from the point of view of gameplay, compared to other titles that are based on this mechanic, but given the license in question it is natural that the collecting spirit of historical characters, therefore the ~trap~ of the gacha is always ready to spring. Compared with all team management, the part of playing on the field, during real football matches, is very little, yet it still takes up several minutes (despite the possibility of speeding it up) during which we limit ourselves to watching what happens, recalling vague game tactics (concentration on defense or attack or balanced approach) and pressing the button for the special combos, which are in any case automatic in their execution and are affected by artificial intelligence, therefore the impression is of being practically cutsstay out of the game during matches. This is a problem that unfortunately dominates the scene when playing Captain Tsubasa Zero and also recurs within the various modes present. The presence of various game options manages to enliven the experience a bit by proposing interesting alternatives: the main mode is Story, which retraces that of the anime with images and animations taken directly from it and is therefore the best way to face the game for fans of the series, even if obviously it has the limit of duration. To broaden the possibilities there are then the asynchronous PvP multiplayer with ranked matches (in which obviously the gap is created between ~free~ players and those who pay to get more advanced characters and bonuses) and another story-focused mode, but in this case with original characters and events and all set to women, a decidedly interesting option.", "date": "2019-09-18", "grade": "S.V."}
