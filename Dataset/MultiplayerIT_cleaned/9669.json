Some military forces decide to create an alliance to restore order, but it is clear that this goal can only be achieved with force. In Star Battalion we take on the role of Sonan, a skilled and determined pilot whose destiny is to overturn the tide of the conflict, leading to victory an army that is numerically inferior and less prepared than the overwhelming forces of Atrusia. Through a series of increasingly complex missions, set on different planets, we will therefore have to face entire enemy squadrons and hit Taros in the hardest way possible, gaining ground while awaiting the inevitable final confrontation. We'll board different vehicles, some more oriented towards exploration and others designed for firefights, and we'll have to quickly learn how to govern them to avoid defeat. If the first fights are simple enough and show us opponents who are not accustomed to personal initiative, in fact, things will gradually become more complicated and at a certain point we will face shrewd and resistant enemies, truly capable of getting us into serious difficulty. Space cowboys In its default configuration, the Star Battalion control system shows us an effective combination of accelerometer and touch screen. Our spacecraft turns by tilting the iPhone, and this solution proves to be quite precise and reliable right from the start, while speed management (adjustable on three levels), weapons and evasive maneuvers are activated by touching the screen with your fingers. In this sense, an excellent job has been done, and it only takes a few minutes to govern the vehicle perfectly. The weapons equipment generally includes a beam cannon and a certain number of homing missiles (which can be restored by collecting a bonus), the latter being very effective against the most elusive opponents. If the targets on the ground are often very simple to eliminate, the situation can change radically if the enemy is on board a spaceship and can respond blow by blow to our offensive. Already after the first stages we will find ourselves facing difficult situations, clearly outnumbered and against opponents who constantly engage us with their homing missiles, forcing us to resort to rapid lateral swerves or ~loops of death~ to avoid being affected. The structure of the missions is quite varied, but in the end the dynamics that regulate the fights end up repeating themselves and make the action sometimes limited. In short, while clearly sensing the potential of the Gameloft product, one does not feel that typical feeling that leads to continuing the game and going on with enthusiasm until the end of the game. The problem also arises due to a series of rather annoying shortcomings: the too obvious script, some slowdowns in the most agitated phases and a sometimes hasty direction where greater attention to detail would have been needed. Apart from this, Star Battalion certainly presents itself with a high-level technical sector, with a remarkable visual impact (especially on the iPhone 4) and a very pleasant graphic style. The sound accompanies the action effectively, and finally the presence of a cooperative online multiplayer mode (which supports both the Gameloft Live system and Apple's GameCenter) certainly contributes to the longevity of the title.
