{"name": "Onimusha Warlords", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-warlords-2.html", "text": "Once upon a time Onimusha leads us by the hand in the Japanese feudal Middle Ages of the 16th century and in the epic and brutal battles with white weapons between brave armies in order to appease the thirst for power of the mythical ~Warlords~, valiant leaders in search of absolute domination in the country of the rising sun. The grandeur and the effort (even economic!) put into the creation of this game are enclosed and explicit as soon as we insert the disc: an impressive opening sequence, in which the eyes are literally glued to the screen, bewitched by the magic of the presentation in computer graphics (I remember the parallelism made in my preview with the cinema of Kurosawa, for the mass movements, and of John Woo, for the fight scenes). There are 5 minutes of absolute graphic-stylistic perfection: the soldiers face each other and collide in a leaden valley studded with pouring rain, the sound effects intertwined with the majestic accompanying music are absolutely worthy of a collector's DVD and the story unfolds quickly outlining the profiles of the main characters. The mighty figure of Nobunaga Oda, fresh winner of the bloody battle of Okehazama, rejoices in success after a lightning surprise attack on his bitter rival Yoshimoto Imagawa, but suddenly succumbs to an arrow piercing his throat. The involuntary spectator of the scene is Samanosuke Akechi, a valiant warrior unbeatable in the art of the sword, who will be the main actor of this adventure and who will have the mission of freeing Princess Yuki, kidnapped by a demonic Nobunaga, resurrected from the underworld and more powerful before Made in Capcom To the adepts of Resident Evil and Dino Crisis, Onimusha will undoubtedly be familiar to commands and basic settings. Samanosuke moves quickly moved in every direction by digital control, interacts-opens objects and doors with the ~X~, attacks with the ~square~, absorbs souls with the ~circle~ and carries out the magic attack with the ~ triangle (which also acts as a cancel key in the various menus). The R2 button makes a 180 rotation and the L1 button parries blows. Even the inventory is a ~dj-vu~, with its single or modular elements to increase its effectiveness; and guess with which element our darling recharges his vital forces? With a green grass (reminds you of something?). However, the innovations and improvements made are also notable: first of all, much more action and variety of fights and enemies to defeat than the time wasted in the puzzles, however fun and never so hard as to lessen the tension and therefore the player's involvement. The movements of the protagonists have never been so realistic (motion capture?) and incisive and we appreciate a very high precision and speed of response combined with immediacy in the commands. By holding down the R1 key, for example, the closest enemy is automatically attacked, no matter if in front of us or behind us (and when the attacks are simultaneous and multiple this is a real panacea!) When the enemy is lying gasping on the ground it's time for the coup de grace: a sharp and violent blow straight to the heart of the demon and subsequent extraction of the weapon (pivoting with the foot on the body of the bi-corpse) will cause arterial blood to spread everywhere. It may seem cruel and creepy (actually it is a bit) but this move also ensures a subtle and perverse pleasure, thinking about how many times we would like to roam free in the rooms to free Princess Yuki without worries. When the enemy returns (but will it be forever?) in the world of most, his little soul comes out and begins to float: this is the time to absorb it thanks to the magical glove, given to the predestined by the Ogres, benign spirits in eternal struggle with the demons . Thanks to this injection of spirituality, Samanosuke will acquire new skills (open sealed doors, transform herbs into more restorative potions, etc.), greater strength and ever more powerful swords with ever more devastating magical attacks, necessary to face the enemies who will face each other later . This expedient also ensures an original character and weapon ~upgrading~ system which, together with the system of modular magic spheres with Samanosuke's glove, give a pleasant role-playing patina. In addition to the powerful and elegant moves of the protagonist warrior, our controller also directs Samanosuke's travel companion in some sections of the game, the sexy Kaede who delights us with feline movements and exquisitely ninja attacks, such as cutting the jugular of the unfortunate people surprised from behindor the throwing of sharp boxcutters. The game essentially takes place inside the Inabayama castle, but there are some visits to the outside and once we have acquired a certain experience and combat power, we are given the opportunity to enter the Kingdom of the Dead, an internal mini-game in which sink level after level into the underworld, fighting with gradually more and more difficult enemies: ranging from semi-lobotomized zombies, to demons with long prehensile limbs with a predilection for the neck of our samurai, to the increasingly unnerving combination of enemies with intelligence and from weapons that are more and more problematic. This mini-game has multiple purposes: it makes you ~relax~ (so to speak) and detach from the main game, it makes you acquire great experience, number of souls and therefore magical power and it is a cathartic and mysterious experience....~but how many do I have to slicing again? Game makers or artists? In addition to the aforementioned introduction (I'll be repetitive but it's really the most beautiful and poetic CG sequence I've come across so far) also the various internal videos and the game itself represent a real avant-garde and very high-performance graphics laboratory level. The characterization of the characters is absolutely meticulous: the armor, the clothes, the facial expressions and the movements of all the ~actors~ are all to scream and for the entire duration of the adventure we are faced with an infinite collection of special effects ~ cinematographic~ at the highest level. Suffice it to mention the realism of the raindrops, the fog in the swamp, the hundreds of fireflies animated with a life of their own among the fronds in the woods, or the fantastic play of light and the transparencies obtained and one could go on for hours. Also on the musical level it cannot be said that Capcom has been stingy, contacting the New Philharmonic of Japan, an orchestra composed of 200 elements of international level, which manages to create very special atmospheres and moods also thanks to the use of ancient and (especially for us) obsolete instruments with unique sounds (who can play Ohdaiko, Hichiriki or Biwa raise your hand!) in a unique and perfect mix with natural sounds of wind, water and creaking woods. The future is in the past... Is Onimusha the perfect game? If we want to be picky, we can find some flaws: the game is rather short (despite the minigame); the story, extremely accurate in particular points, disappoints in the end by not considering (voluntarily?) many questions found during our trip; the age-old problem of variable camera angles has not yet been solved, presenting the frustrating situation of invisible attacks from hidden angles or sudden changes of view that can often disorient. Despite these fussiness... maybe we're here!! With Onimusha we begin to see the great progress, in all aspects, from graphics, to playability, from involvement to the commitment made to the realization of the game, which for more than a year we PS2 owners have been waiting anxiously. It must be said that Capcom is becoming a real trademark for top-level games and once again the target has been masterfully hit: if this game was only to be a first experiment of the potential of the new console, well then let's expect playful experiences in the future phantasmagorical. Pros: Enthralling like few others Exceptional technical realization Stunning computer graphics movies! Cons: A little short Some problems with shots Capcom's first PS2 gift - Ready Home Capcom? - Yes please!!!!!!!! In theory, this phone call could already be a complete and exhaustive review of Onimusha  Warlords, the new action-adventure game produced by Capcom, mother of the Resident Evil and Dino Crisis cult series, but let's not limit ourselves to so little and let's delve into a just a little bit It is undeniable that we PS2 owners had been waiting for a long time..in a sort of limbo we were waiting for a real game for the new console, with all the right attributes to define it as such, from the graphics to the care details, from emotional involvement to attention to detail, from enveloping sound to entertainment for its own sake well, the wait is over. Onimusha can certainly represent an important first step in the fascinating journey (still very, very long, we hope!) to discover the potential of our favorite gaming machine.", "date": "2001-07-26", "grade": null}
