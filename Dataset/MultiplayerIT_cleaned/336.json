The credit obviously goes to those who are investing in this sense, specifically Apple with its Arcade platform and Netflix with projects reserved for their subscribers; just like this new roguelike-style action RPG made by Ubisoft, which in many ways is a sort of miniature Diablo Immortal but, unlike the much-criticized Blizzard title, is completely devoid of microtransactions. Is this aspect enough to elevate the experience of the game? Or is there something more hidden among the mazes of the fantasy world that we will be able to visit? We reveal it to you in the review of Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace. History and structure of Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, the first character at our disposal Introduced by a short animated sequence, the story of Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace tells of a kingdom in crisis since the sovereign fell into a mysterious sleep, which grips him keeping him imprisoned. The only way to break the curse is to enter the king's mental palace and knock down the evil creatures that populate it, in the meantime collecting all the loot possible. A mechanic that in the case of the Ubisoft title is not an end in itself: the game allows you to unlock twenty characters, but to be able to use them (and consequently opt for different paths within the ~dream~ map) we will have to find their weapons and pieces of their armor, so as to be able to extract them from the dark dimension in which they were trapped. Naturally, the collection of these objects also has a precise function in the context of our expeditions, regulated by a roguelike structure: we will advance from dungeon to dungeon, eliminating all the enemies inside them and finally winning the indicated prize (a weapon, a , a helmet, gloves or boots) to add it to our equipment to replace components of lower quality, or to tear it apart and collect its fragments. The latter act as currency for upgrades at the blacksmiths, while the coins gold are to be used with merchants. Along the way, however, we will also find other alternative boxes, such as the campfire for a partial restoration of health (which obviously we will have to make do with until the end of the expedition, otherwise what a roguelike it would be) or special places where we can meet mysterious figures ready to deliver us something in exchange for gold, blood or agreeing to an early game over. Gameplay: a little Diablo Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, Balthazar's Magic Staff strikes from a distance and offers great advantages Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace uses an isometric action RPG formula basically identical to the one we talked about in the Diablo Immortal review, although on the combat system front there are some differences. In fact, our character can move, perform a basic attack and a limited amount of actions subject to reloading: sprinting / dodging, essential for avoiding enemy blows, the special linked to the main weapon and that of the secondary weapon (if you have it), as well as changing weapons. There are no potions, there are no consumables in general, everything is very direct and immediate: what goes beyond these mechanics finds its place in the specifications of the equipment we are using, and which can include passive special abilities that can make some difference in battle. After that, having completed certain dungeons, we will be given an extra reward to increase strength, defense, the ability to obtain resources and so on, while at the end of the boss fights we will have to choose between improvements that sometimes involve heavy compromises. Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, a boss fight based on giant spiders The way in which the character develops along the way is obviously the central node of Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, although at the end of each expedition (usually due to a defeat) you can return to the camp and spend the essence obtained for permanently improve the basic skills of all heroes: a very interesting progression, but damn slow considering the mobile nature of the experience. Whether you play using touch controls or a Bluetooth controller (but the supportis only partial), the gameplay turns out to be solid and fun, albeit slightly repetitive after a few hours. This despite the scenarios change and with them the enemies, which have a rather abundant amount of different types and in some cases manage to create really mangy situations, from which it is difficult to get out alive unless making very precise use of dodging. Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, navigation on the map allows you to choose your own route In the most chaotic and demanding sequences, the physical commands actually make the difference in terms of precision and reliability, while the touch ones sometimes tend to ~get stuck~. In all cases, the response to the inputs is unfortunately not always punctual, indeed it often happens that you have to press a button several times to make the game understand that yes, we want to run that blessed special: a problem that we hope will be resolved quickly with an update, since it can make the difference between victory and defeat. But let's go back to talking about bosses because a really great job has been done in this sense: the creatures that we will face at the end of each ~segment~ are distinguished by attack routine well differentiated, which must be memorized in order to be able to respond better and take advantage of the moments of ~rest~ to sink one's shots. Naturally the weapons are fundamental and change our approach to the action, also and above all because of the connected special moves. Technical realization: cartoonish and interesting Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace boasts well-represented cartoonish atmospheres The graphics of Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace make use of a comic style for characters, settings and enemies: an effective and pleasant solution, although in terms of animations not everything always goes the right way and there are some somewhat controversial solutions, such as, for example, the ~fragmenting~ of the screen to manage transparency and some effects, which at first seemed to us to be a defect and which tends to dangerously distract from the action. The interface is hardly legible on the iPhone, with very tiny and , in general, the need to keep the screen quite close to the eyes in order to better distinguish everything that is happening. It goes without saying that playing the Ubisoft title on a tablet, perhaps using a controller, is the best choice where you don't have mobility needs. Fortunately we are talking about an option and not an obligation, because otherwise the experience would make little sense. Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace, a furious clash Here, speaking of little sense things, we believe it is not normal that on an iPhone 14 Pro, which is still the top of the range from Apple, the game is unable to run with the best settings and maintain 60 frames per second: to ensure constant fluidity, essential for the reactivity of the touch controls, some compromises have to be made and this annoyed us a bit: here too we hope that the updates will fix things. Finally, a few words for the sound, which manages to be actually ~epic~ as expected, accompanying our battles with perhaps not very original but engaging and well-crafted orchestral pieces, which end up compensating for the audio effects, which, despite being good, don't affect that much.", "date": "2023-04-18", "grade": "8.5"}
