{"name": "Viaggio al Centro della Luna - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viaggio-al-centro-della-luna-recensione.html", "text": "Journey to the Center of the Moon is loosely based on the stories of Around the Moon and From the Earth to the Moon. Verne and the digital age As mentioned, the guys from Kheops Studio started from the idea of a daring trip to the Moon organized in the second half of the 1800s, also borrowing some of Verne's characters, and made it into a ~point and click~ adventure in subjective full of logic puzzles and deadly brain teasers. Although the most loyal readers of the French author will find much more than a quote, the story of the video game will develop independently, starting from the assumption that the capsule imagined by Verne and fired from the Earth with a huge cannon has actually managed to reach our satellite. Unlike what happens in the novel, therefore, the daring scientist Michel Ardan will be able to explore the Moon and reveal its arcane secrets, beating Neil Armstrong on time ... and one thing is certain: his experience will be very different from that of the first American on the moon! On the far side of the moon Michel Ardan wakes up aboard the capsule. After a practically absent introductory movie, our virtual alter ego wakes up inside a supposed giant adrift in space, low on oxygen and in the company of two corpses: a very bad situation. He begins to look around to find his way around and, collecting clues here and there, he discovers not only that he is that Michel Ardan mentioned above but also that he has scandalous tastes in clothes. The inside of the capsule looks like everything except the cabin of a space rocket: judging by the red velvet living room furniture, the upholstery, the portholes and the brass fittings, one has rather the impression of being on board an ocean liner old fashioned luxury! With what he has available, however, the scientist will have to attempt an improbable crash landing on the moon. And it is here that the rest of the game will take place: to his (and above all our) great surprise, Ardan will discover that the surface of the satellite is covered by thick and luxuriant vegetation and that this actually hides the traces of an ancient extraterrestrial civilization . Our virtual alter ego awakens inside a giant suppository adrift in space, low on oxygen and in the company of two corpses. On the far side of the moon The first nasty surprise... The story unfolds slowly through a sort of vintage-flavored comic strips, just like in Return to the Mysterious Island but with a pleasant patina of illustrations from old books, and the first phase of the game to discover the antecedents of the journey is tinged of yellow and it is quite intriguing. Unfortunately, however, after a promising start that gives us hope for an unprecedented combination of mystery and adventure, we find ourselves faced with the well-established Adventure Company-style game mechanics: in fact, the whole adventure boils down to a maniacal analysis of the surrounding environment and a sequence of puzzles without interruption and without any apparent purpose, other than the study of the Selenite culture. And, when I say study, I mean literally: we will find ourselves deciphering the abstruse ideograms of the written Selenite language and the inscrutable sounds of the spoken one, understanding their numerical system by trying our hand at calculations based on twenty, playing at little lunar gardeners creating hybrid alien plants and even to learn the secrets of the local cuisine (if it is true that men are tempting, the same goes for the Selenites)! We find ourselves in front of the well-established Adventure Company-style game mechanics. Although the cultural background of the Selenites may be relatively credible and exciting to investigate, it is certainly not enough to make up for the almost total absence of a story and the only interesting question that the player asks himself - what happened to this advanced alien civilization - does not find a satisfactory answer even at the end of the adventure! In short, without revealing anything in this regard, we limit ourselves to recommending you not to wait for great revelations: the ultimate goal of Ardan's journey is still that of returning home, with the memory of a beautiful trip for its own sake! The strength of this title lies entirely in the taste for exploration and discovery: those who enjoy extrapolating the functioning of bizarre and complex mechanisms or like to challenge their logical and deductive skills for the sheer pleasure of doing so will appreciate the work of Kheops Studio , passing over the poor immersion. The game is also pervaded by a subtle and eccentric vein of humor, which makes its way from the main menu, from which an irreverent Ardan and a funny sneer wink.elenita. More than once you will find yourself laughing heartily at ~jokes~ so absurd that they cannot elicit another reaction... the result is that you laugh anyway, so the developers' purpose has been achieved one way or another! One example above all: just before landing, a rooster suddenly jumps out and our Michel Ardan confesses with ill-concealed satisfaction that he hid it on board to play a joke on his travel companions; in his imagination, the unfortunates would have been amazed to see the animal on a lunar peak at the time of landing (see central figure below). What a nice prankster! [C] So we are told the story of the game. Our hero has his own sense of humor! The supposed giant takes Ardan to the lunar surface. [/C] Puzzles beyond human understanding The inventory, with its flexible assembly system. Journey to the Center of the Moon basically presents two types of puzzles, those related to the association of objects in the inventory and the actual puzzles, but also some ~dexterity tests~ (basically, arcade mini-games). The inventory is the protagonist: this is an adventure in the name of ~extreme bricolage~, since the manufacture of custom-made tools is essential for overcoming most of the puzzles, although many objects can be purchased or recovered by the back door. The assembly system is identical to the one introduced in Return to the Mysterious Island and offers infinite possibilities, thanks to an interesting mechanism for managing and combining the collected items: if two objects can be combined to create a third, this automatically adds to those already in our possession; if instead the combination is missing one or more ingredients, these are signaled with question marks and it will be up to the player to discover them. Although some combinations are rather curious, most are not at all illogical and fortunately Ardan writes down all the combinations made, so that they can be easily reproduced if necessary. The inventory is the protagonist: this is an adventure dedicated to extreme bricolage. Puzzles beyond human understanding Selenite ideograms will become your worst nightmare! Die-hard puzzle lovers will find something for their teeth: mechanical, logical, deductive, mnemonic, mathematical and sound puzzles, ranging from the elementary to the impossible with a single common requirement, a superhuman spirit of observation and patience! Only sliding puzzles and labyrinths are missing, which have made way for short arcade sequences aimed at testing reflexes and coordination, but purists should not be alarmed because they are truly disarmingly simple: in the first, for example, we will find ourselves to chase potassium bubbles inside the space capsule in the absence of gravity and later we will have to calculate the time well to jump from one lunar peak to another. The more traditionalist adventurers could also be somewhat displaced by the need to collect points and money to achieve certain objectives: lunar coins can be recovered on the street or by selling objects and inventions but, to advance in some stages of the game or tackle certain puzzles, we will have to demonstrate have acquired sufficient knowledge of the Selenite culture, quantified in points. Die-hard puzzle lovers will find something for their teeth. Puzzles beyond human understanding Arcade phase: we will have to give ourselves the right momentum to jump from one peak to another. The overall level of difficulty is relatively high and the non-linearity of the adventure is often a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it limits the possibility of finding yourself irreparably stuck by offering more ways to solve a problem or, if nothing else, the possibility to devote himself to a different play area until the elements necessary to overcome the impasse have been collected; on the other hand, all this freedom inevitably ends up disorienting and pushes us to try the most improbable things even when the solution is perhaps at hand or simply depends on an overlooked detail. Then there are other factors that exacerbate the feeling of frustration in the player: the fact that the puzzles rarely appear in the order in which they are to be solved and the initial impenetrability of many puzzles require a scrupulous examination of each single setting in search of clues and grueling journeys between. The presence of annoying timed sequences and the possibility of dying prematurely, which does not penalize the player in any way, but noIt certainly helps to alleviate their impatience! A realization that is anything but spatial There isn't much to say about the Journey to the Center of the Moon interface, as it reflects the most classic formula of point-and-click adventures: we find the now ubiquitous cursor that changes shape based on the type of interaction possible on the screen, we each operation with a simple click of the left mouse button and we access the inventory and menus by pressing the right button. The assembly system inherited from Return to the Mysterious Island is flexible and intuitive, but the overabundance of slots and tabs for managing inventory items is more of a hindrance than anything else: there being a limit of three items per type, in reality it is difficult to fill all available inventory space, even in the hottest stages of the game. The original interface adopted to illustrate Ardan's discoveries in the investigations at the beginning of the game deserves a special mention: every clue discovered on the mysterious death of his travel companions is added in the form of a memory or story to a grid made up of sixteen tiles . After collecting them all, we will be able to reconstruct the order of the facts: a decidedly exciting expedient to tell what happened, involving the player in the first person. A realization that is anything but spatial The graphic sector holds no surprises, either bad or good: since this is a subjective adventure, like almost all The Adventure Company products, we will play through a 360 panoramic view and, to move within the settings, we will go from a default node to another. The lunar landscapes are surreal and colorful, the starry backdrops quite suggestive, but the level of detail is certainly not excellent and the extravagant design is not completely convincing. The character models and animations aren't bad, but you see far too few of them. Overall, it must be admitted that the dreamlike graphic transposition of Verne's Moon effectively reflects the spirit of his writings and their fantastic aura, but the settings appear hopelessly static and lifeless, not to mention the fact that it is often difficult to orient oneself to their interior, although they are by no means vast. Movies are scarce and story developments are mainly represented with static images accompanied by the narrator's voice. The audio sector gets along a little better: the musical background is barely perceptible and decidedly subdued, despite an appreciable main reason. The localization and dubbing are impeccable, the sound effects more than fair. Final comment By burning a potentially interesting starting point and relying on a mediocre technical realization, this Journey to the Center of the Moon is reduced to a marathon of puzzles, which seem to have been brought together in a completely random order and specially designed to test the resistance of hardcore adventurers. More than an adventure, a class assignment! No one will be impressed too much by the settings, nor will they be able to become attached to the hero of the game or any other character. Reflection and patience will be your only travel companions: recommended only to fans of the puzzle week, in whose name it manages to win a sufficiency stretched. Pros Simple and intuitive interface Ingenious inventory management system Complex and complex logic puzzles (even too much) Cons Monotonous succession of puzzles Poor immersion Technically mediocre Verne and the digital age It takes imagination to imagine the Moon as our ancestors had to dream of it in the 19th century, now that since the early years of school it has been described to us as a barren rock that revolves around our planet! Yet visionaries like Julius Verne, who today make us smile for some at least naive gamble, still manage to surprise us with their ability to see into the future, sketching inventions that now seem obvious to us but which at the time were pure science fiction. This is why your novels have fascinated entire generations, ours included, so much so that they even inspired video games and what genre would lend itself better to similar subjects, if not that of graphic adventures? In fact, this Journey to the Center of the Moon, loosely based on the stories of ~Around the Moon~ and ~From the Earth to the Moon~, is certainly not the first videogame title that revisits Verne's universe: the same developer, Kheops Studio, tells us recently offered the original Return to the Mysterious Island and Frogwares, after Journey to the Center of the Earth, is preparing to launch Around the World in 80 Days. Not to mention a flood of other games that, for", "date": "2005-11-24", "grade": null}
