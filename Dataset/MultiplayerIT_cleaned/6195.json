In the modern world made up of profound reinterpretations of classic titles, in reality, it still works great and not all the most important names have converted to three dimensions, but have wanted to keep their stylistic origins from the first half of the nineties. This game appeared in 2007 in Japanese cabinets, with the idea of arousing in the general public of the Rising Sun that sort of melancholy of the past. In reality, Arc System Works had deluded herself that someone had appreciated her work so much as to carry out a conversion for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 the following year, but the commercial results only partially proved her right. Today that same work, in a partially revised and corrected version, arrives on Steam, a platform that by now seems to be increasingly active also on the Japanese vintage catalog front. Someone, at the announcement of an Arc System Works title coming to PC, hoped for the latest incarnation of Guilty Gear, but for the moment it seems that we will have to settle  It all looks greatuntil you start playing Enter the arena As soon as you start Battle Fantasia - Revisited Edition - we are asked to set the desired resolution and the type of controller we want to use. We would like to underline this aspect because in the first case, even if we were to choose a common Full HD, we note that the result does not seem native, just observe the jaggedness around the characters and the elements that form the background to realize this. On the side of choosing the controller, an inexplicable fact, if you have not set it from the initial menu you will not be able to use it during the game. In fact, having started everything hastily, we wondered why the pad was not supported, but in reality it was all due to this lack of initial decision. The keyboard is then exploited in a bad way, asking you to memorize which keys are associated with the strokes and even how to activate the menu, otherwise you will have to press all the buttons, looking for the right one even just to return to the main screen. That said it's fair to say that once you've made your choice correctly, both Xbox 360 and One pads are supported. This version released on Steam also includes the release of the soundtrack as free DLC, as well as a general balance of the style of the fighters that has been revised after the release of the product for the past generation of hardware. The AI also feels like it's been rewritten and is now slightly more responsive, offering a more interesting level of challenge, although it's nearly impossible to add depth where there wasn't before, otherwise having to rewrite everything from scratch. In fact, the attacks are the classic four strokes to be combined with the movement of the analog that takes care of the movement, even if to help better understand how it works, it is good to know that with a keyboard and a wild ~smashing button~ you can perform especially devastating random moves, once you get the ~rhythm~ right. Even those who still want to follow the ~path of honesty~, which involves learning the correct sequences, will have no difficulty, since one always has the perception that the opponents are playing a game of their own, proving to be ineffective in countering our assaults. The style we like Battle Fantasia - Revisited Edition - is a Japanese game and as such exudes all its lore. The cartoon style includes very soft pastel colors, linked to the autumn season, without excesses and always adequate to underline the characters who, on the exact opposite, are over the top, like their costumes, interchangeable and unlockable during the story mode. The twenty-four scenarios present are all animated, even if it is clearly noticeable how the textures and colors are flat, as well as having really minimal movements. The music is well-kept and deservedly included in a collection to be listened to. The ~Story~ mode provides for the narration of the events of unlikely beings from all over the world, committed to challenge each other. One of these, for example, is called Donvalve Du Don, a king who has abdicated, invented a steampunk machine and is always drunk, just to give you the madness meter of whoever you will find in front of you. The other unlikely members bear the name of Marco Van de Land, Freed Velez, Cedric Ward, Face, Watson Livingston, Deathbringer, Odile & Dokurod, Urs Van de Land, Coyori, Ashley Loveless, Olivia Von Roselia. As in any other similar production avretand way to practice the moves in a specific section, as well as having a gallery in which to admire the models that are gradually unlocked in computer graphics. There is also the possibility of challenging each other online, even if at the moment there are not many players. Every single time we managed to start a game, among other things, the connection fell brutally and certainly not due to errors due to a lack of bandwidth and not even for the fear of a defeat, given that the precipitous falls almost always occurred after a few moments he set foot in the arena.", "date": "2015-07-15", "grade": "6.0"}
