{"name": "Freestyle Moto-X II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freestyle-moto-x-ii.html", "text": "The best video game developers stand out for their ability to make the most of the systems they have to work with, and the discussion is not limited to the purely technical aspect of each production but also to the type of use of the same in relation to the device for which it is destined. In this specific case, Xendex Entertainment proves to have a truly clear and effective idea of wireless gaming. Freestyle Moto-X II, in fact, stands as a successful title in every respect, with particular regard to the dynamics that underlie electronic entertainment via mobile phone: technically well done, rich in facets yet terribly immediate, equipped with a considerable level of challenge. But let's go in order... The game sees us in the role of a driver who has to grapple with numerous races through four major cities (New York, Seattle, Phoenix, Denver), unlocking new challenges with each success. The structure of the races is therefore variable, and we will be able to find ourselves faced with a timed challenge (in which you have to cross the finish line respecting a timer) or compete in an acrobatic contest (with mandatory tricks in order to win). The game structure is very intuitive, immediate and ~comprehensive~, in the sense that it allows you to immediately restart a race where the objective has not been achieved, trying to find a solution to the problem until you understand which is the best approach. Before leaving, it is also possible to attend a demonstration. In any case, the extent of success will result in the conquest of a bronze, silver or gold cup, with only the latter giving us access to replacement parts for the bike. The latter can be mounted as desired before each race, carefully evaluating their impact on what you're going to do on the track: a more powerful engine ensures a better shot, but its weight can make stunts more problematic, for one thing. The technical realization of Freestyle Moto-X II, as mentioned above, is really of a good standard. Basically the tracks are similar in the context of the same city, therefore there are four different locations in all, which sometimes show some valuable parallax scrolling effects and which in their simplicity manage not to give an idea of repetitive or sparse. Motorcycle and motorcyclist are quite detailed and the animations of the little man are smooth and well done, with the addition of the inertial system producing hilarious results in their tragedy when a trick is performed at the wrong time, resulting in a spectacular fall. The control system is organized in a rather simple way: the joystick is responsible for accelerating (up), braking (down) as well as tilting the bike forward or backwards, tilt which is in fact the key to avoid falls and to make every jump better. Tricks can be performed by pressing certain buttons on the number pad or the joystick forward or backward while in mid-air. To make things easier, there is the possibility to set the accelerator to automatic. PRO Very funny Lots of races Good technical realization AGAINST At first it can take you aback Depending on the sensitivity of the joystick... ...may be more or less playable", "date": "2007-07-12", "grade": "S.V."}
