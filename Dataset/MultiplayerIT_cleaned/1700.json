{"name": "International Superstar Soccer 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/international-superstar-soccer-3.html", "text": "The premises Once the console is turned on and the Italian language chosen, the selector for 50/60 Hz and a spectacular introduction topped off with a ~punkish~ piece of music are immediately appreciated. The options menu is very rich, let's analyze it precisely. The first possible choice is Friendly Match which together with International Cup and World Championship are pretty self explanatory. The most interesting diversion in the ISS saga has always resided in the Mission Mode in which the player is required to achieve particular objectives, for example winning a game starting from a passive of a zero network having only a few minutes available. The training will allow you to practice with the controls (see box) while the personalized championship is the ideal choice to create the ultimate challenge with your friends in just a few seconds. The KCEO title supports multiplayer for up to four players and the teams at your disposal, at the beginning of your ISS3 adventure, will be the most famous national teams in the world. Dulcis in fundo here is the Catalog option, thanks to which you can spend all the points earned during the game. You can earn them by winning a match in the international cup or by completing a mission mode objective. The catalog is really very rich and you can find everything: hidden teams, shorts, shirts, socks, stadium pieces for customization and more. Too bad that this option, after all, turns out to be a way to artificially increase the low longevity for the single player otherwise offered by this title. On the field Once on the pitch, the introduction to the match is, as is the tradition of all the latest videogame-football productions, highly spectacular. National anthems, group photos, smoke bombs and thunderous applause perfectly recreate the atmosphere of the great national team matches. Apart from the first technical defects, which I will examine in the dedicated paragraph, the problem that immediately catches the eye is the incredible woodiness of the players. In addition to struggling to turn and run on the tracks, the players move behind the orders given by us with the joypad. This also happens in Pes2 in a much less marked way but, above all, once the shutter button is released, depending on the statistics of our champion, the movement in PES appears natural and the response to commands prompt. ISS3, on the other hand, is the festival of players who continue on their own path, a feature that brought to mind the not too intelligent footballers of Sega's Virtua Striker series. Another very penalizing flaw is the artificial intelligence of teammates and opponents. Seldom will you find players who follow your action (to give a couple of concrete examples: when you are on the opponent's three-quarters and you have the ball at your foot, nobody will sprint on the wing to free himself and in the same way, if you sprint on the wing with the ball foot, the attackers will enter the area only when the ball is already in flight) and too often you will witness defensive gaffes worthy of the famous column ~International football~ of the late Mai dire Gol. All of this would be fully compensated if dribbling was easier. Too bad that individual sorties are almost impossible to carry out. Each footballer is characterized by his statistics and, at least numerically, the skills and characteristics of real players are correctly transported into the game. Beyond these far from light criticisms, the game is fairly immediate and controllable even by gamers completely unfamiliar with our national sport. Speaking of innovations, the close-up is certainly worth mentioning. When you approach the opponent's area, in the area of the sidelines and in the vicinity of an opponent, the [L1] symbol will appear above the head of the player you control. By pressing the Dual Shock button of the same name, the shot will zoom in on the player in possession of the ball and it will be possible to feint, try to discard the player or perform other actions of various types. It may seem strange but this aspect is one of the funniest and most spectacular of the game: getting rid of the defender in this way and then crossing and seeing one of your teammates score a point by hitting the ball with his head will excite you a lot. The camera will also rotate if particularly effective shots are made: try to hit the ball on the fly with a full neck after a cross and magically the game view will change into a fantastic shot that will take up close your atl gestureethical. The controls Here is a quick rundown of the basic moves available (the setup of these moves is identical to that of Pes2/WE). The d-pad or left analog stick will move your player; Cross: low pass - contrast; Circle: high pass - cross - slide; Square - shot; Triangle: deep pass; L1: change player; A1: I shoot. The L1 will also be used to switch to the ~close up~ mode discussed in the review. The advanced movements and combinations available in each case are many more... to be discovered in the game. But the graphics and sound? As previously announced, you will notice the first technical defect as soon as you enter the field. If Totti is easily recognizable, the same cannot be said for the anonymous Vieri, Del Piero, Zambrotta, Maldini and company; in essence, the faces of the footballers are not at all faithful to their flesh and blood counterparts. The animations of the players are of high and low quality at the same time: the run and the other game movements are absolutely unnatural, but the animations in the spectacular shots, in the close-ups and all those surrounding the actual match (introduction of game, changes, protests, etc.) are excellently made. The ground textures are excellent and have a three-dimensional effect that you will only notice when zooming during replays, the audience is flat as usual, but this is a minor flaw. The commentary in Italian is unfortunately scandalous! If with PES2, apart from certain sentences that arouse hilarity and the tendency of the two commentators to speak at the same time, at least a decent commentary had been achieved, even if not of a high level, ISS3 presents all possible and imaginable defects: few sentences, little pertinence of the same with the game actions, funny and incoherent speeches as useless but above all the funereal tone of the voice of the commentators who seem absent and decidedly unable to ~play~ their part in the right way. The noise of the fans is normal, the national anthems are a very welcome plus and the speaker of the stadium (who speaks English) is very precise and increases the level of spectacularity of the game. The complete localization in Italian, the selector for 60 Hz and the option to center the screen conclude our discussion on the technical package presented by the latest effort by the guys from KCE Osaka. Comment It seems that over the years in Osaka they have progressively forgotten how to code fun soccer games. International Superstar Soccer 3 is another misstep by Konami in the world that it has dominated for several years with the Winning Eleven/Pro evolution soccer series. For heaven's sake, ISS3 is certainly not the worst of its kind but still ranks on the same level as the various Fifa and This is Football. The advice can only be the following: if you are looking for an excellent football game, buy PES2 with your eyes closed, in case you have already bought PES2 in due time and are interested in buying a second football title ... well, to be honest the best thing to do would be to change your mind. Pros: Easy to learn game mechanics National anthems exalt High level of spectacularity Lots of cool things to unlock by collecting points Cons: Poor Artificial Intelligence Fluctuating quality graphics and animations Innovations of little relevance Apart from rare cases, players are unrecognizable compared to to real counterparts Poor comment Let's retrace the history of International Superstar Soccer a bit. The genesis of this famous football saga dates back to the times of Super Nintendo on which ~International Superstar Soccer~ saw the light, subsequently revised and corrected in the deluxe version, again for SNES but this time also for Megadrive. At the time of 32/64 bits, the series moved to Nintendo 64 and the many episodes of that Perfect Striker that also arrived here in Europe are famous, always under the name of ISS. With the advent of PS2, things have changed radically and during the launch period of the monolith in Japan, the ISS for PS2 appears in stores, the sequel of which will land on all new generation consoles (Xbox and Gamecube). What we're going to analyze is the third episode of this ~new course~ of the Konami saga, also expected on the PC platform.", "date": "2003-03-29", "grade": null}
