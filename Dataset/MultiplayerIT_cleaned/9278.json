Just the latter will find bread for their teeth in Aeterna Noctis, a Spanish game that exudes a lot of passion for metroidvania structures with dry combat, punitive level design and lots of backtracking. We once again point out a certainty: when a genre is capable of summarizing so many playful characteristics, each of its exponents must be greeted with applause because creating a metroidvania capable of standing out is complex. We live in a time when developing is easier and many, old gamers from the 90s, today video game creators, have those traits so dear to Konami of yesteryear in their blood. Aeterna Noctis doesn't dare much, but adds a lot of body to the equation, enlarging in an ambitious and not always flawless way a world and a setting that tries to have its say humbly, trying to dye itself with uniqueness without however particularly succeeding. It's okay anyway, mind you, you don't need to excel in everything, only that sometimes you get lost in a glass of water and the general experience of use loses out. But let's get there calmly in this Aterna Noctis review. Light and shadow Some clashes of Aterna Noctis are very spectacular The king of darkness and the queen of light are the protagonists of this story in an imaginary, dark land, with fairly typical gothic and fantasy features, well-crafted enemies, but not particularly numerous, towers and dungeons full of dangers. The playful cauldron of Aeterna Noctis amazes with the amount of material to explore, places to return to, skills to take and above all sections of pure platforming to conquer. If light and shadow are the quintessence of the characters who tell their own story, the pad in hand Aeterna Noctis reflects this antithesis well, alternating simpler sections with others with a decidedly complex execution.Strong of inspiring models that not only do not hide their hardcore essence , but rather they are proud of it, Aeterna Noctis enters that circle of metroidvanias that require a lot of physical and mental effort to be slowly completed: this is a game that reflects the great passion and ambition of its team, but cannot hide get some lack of experience packing a map that, alas, is easily readable. With a geography that is revealed with progress, the Spanish boys have opted for an interlocking of doors and platforms that is too fluid: not a system of watertight compartments and rooms made into simple rectangles, but a map that shows the progress centimeter by centimeter leave dark all that is beyond. It is a correct gimmick for those who appreciate visual backtracking, but it is a system that inevitably uses a much more precise, almost millimeter proportion of the map, bringing with it a huge need for space to show it all. And here we are at the age-old problem: the map of Aeterna Noctis is huge because it shows practically every dungeon, which makes it quite chaotic to understand and navigate. Solutions such as those already seen in similar independent titles such as Hollow Knight and Ender Lilies make a certain map minimalism their workhorse, Aeterna Noctis on the other hand is not, it is there to show every piece and even every platform. Unfortunately, the result is confusing, difficult to read, but above all difficult to amalgamate in terms of geographical coherence. Between jumps and swords The platforming sections of Aeterna Noctis are a lot of fun Like many metroidvanias, this too mixes with relative wisdom the presence of enemies - therefore fights - with situations of jumping between platforms, shots, calculations of vaults to wander in harmony between gates, walls to climb and checkpoints. The level design of the title is good, at times very good: some towers are really small platform design manuals that add nothing, but perform the task very well. Speed, skill, eye all want their share, giving points in which the dance of analogs a lot of fun. In the middle there is also fighting, not even a little: the bestiary offered by Aeterna Noctis is not the richest, it must be said, and it of particular technicalities its playful strength. It is therefore not a question of difficulty, but of number: sometimes the enemies will be many, or they will be flying and you will have no other weapons than the sword, at least at the beginning. It is a type of hostile population that inhabits the gameplay with dignity, but does not turn it on more than necessary: it stands there, fights, it annoys us, but without shining for who knows what reason. Surely, between combat and shigh between platforms, the second wins: the speed or climbing sections of Aeterna Noctis give satisfaction, especially with the acquisition of a couple of skills that fit the playful patterns. The thing that certainly keeps the pace going is the growth of the character , acquiring new weapons and abilities, expanding the range of opportunities that every Metroidvania hides within to galvanize every little discovery. The sense of exploration of Aeterna Noctis is there and satisfies, especially in areas where the achievement of chests and collectibles is the pure prerogative of skill on the pad. In those moments the game shines well, certainly more than the menus it presents, which just like the map are a bit confusing and not too stylish in terms of navigation quality and user experience. A world that would like to say more Aeterna Noctis is well presented artistically, especially some parts where the team opts for warm colors Thanks to a valuable visual proposal, the setting of Aterna Noctis is told well, it has its own basic charm that is reflected in the ecosystem created by the Spanish boys. The narration is carried on with interlude scenes and dialogues in an invented language, the environments do not shine with details, but they work, the general visual and audio offer accompanies with discretion, knowing however that they can give the best to those who are already knows that kind of gaming genre. And who doesn't chew bread and Metroidvania instead? For all of them, this is certainly not the first title to recommend. The atmosphere of the game is melancholy, solitary, austere, constantly winking at gothic masterpieces of the less recent past reproposed in a fantastic dark key, almost fairytale, which manages in its own way to keep everything together and propose a world that is in some ways coherent with its own ethereal essence, lost in this good / bad contrast revised with interesting personifications of characters. After several hours spent wandering left and right, intent on welcoming another title that makes us leave the experience around when we die (and it will happen often), we can say that the team has been able to insert many details and elements into the setting , but without being able to tame them with the due mastery. However, the commitment and the attempt must be rewarded, in the light of some rather successful ideas, even well implemented, and some boss fights of the right length and decidedly memorable.", "date": "2021-12-24", "grade": "7.5"}
