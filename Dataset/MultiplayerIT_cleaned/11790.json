{"name": "Tabula Rasa - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tabula-rasa-recensione.html", "text": "Inauguration without clogging problems Once the game has started, you have to choose one of the four official servers to register the avatar: if the selected one is excessively busy, the program prevents access. Naturally, given the origin of the production, the European host is the most popular, even if personally we preferred Cassiopeia, located on the west coast of the United States of America, currently sparsely populated and with acceptable latency times (a round of applause to NCsoft for avoiding the classic opening jams despite the warm reception from the audience). At this point you can proceed to register a maximum of sixteen avatars. The creation of one's alter ego, probably the most important moment of a role-playing game, could disappoint a slice of enthusiasts as it boils down to the choice of gender and physiognomy of the protagonist, without the possibility of selecting races other than human or of specializing in certain professions. The deeply arcade spirit of Tabula Rasa is thus immediately betrayed in the first seconds of the game: the character, like games like Titan Quest or Two Worlds (to mention the most recent) takes shape as the player decides how to spend the three points characteristic and two skill points that are earned with each level advancement. Inauguration without clogging problems The former serve to increase, from time to time, the number of hit points and concentration (the equivalent of mana in fantasy RPGs) and the speed with which they regenerate, while the latter allow you to specialize in powerful disciplines (now magical, now physical) called Logos which, in order to be used, must first be learned at special altars. The acquired Logos are drawn in the Tabula (initially Rasa) which gives the game its name. Levels 5, 15 and 30 are real critical points because the player, in order to progress, must first choose which class to specialize in, following a tree that reaches eight branches at the thirtieth level: four of a more military nature (grenadier, warden, sniper and spy), four plus support (wrecker, engineer, medic and biologist); naturally, each of them corresponds to unique and peculiar abilities. Those who fear having to put up with the entire growth process all over again in order to use a more suitable class can breathe a sigh of relief thanks to an innovation introduced by Tabula Rasa: it is the cloning system that allows you to create an exact copy of the character original, with related achievements and completed quests, whose skill points, however, are still to be distributed. The arsenal is not transferred but it is possible to store it in special lockers in order to interchange it with the other avatars of the same family. In order to carry out this operation, specific ~cards~ are required, which are provided upon completion of certain objectives. System requirements Minimum Requirements Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP Intel Pentium 4 at 2.5 GHz or equivalent AMD 512 MByte RAM ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForceFX 5700 with 128MB RAM DVD-ROM 2x 5 GB free hard disk space High speed internet connection Wide Recommended Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP/Vista 3.5 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or AMD equivalent 2 GByte RAM ATI Radeon x1800 or NVIDIA GeForce 7800 Test Configuration AMD Athlon FX-55 (2.6 GHz) 2 GByte of RAM NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GTX video card Butchery meat The tutorial that accompanies the recruits in the first few minutes of the game is sufficiently intuitive but not entirely exhaustive: there are too many aspects left out, such as PvP and crafting, which can therefore only be mastered with experience on the battlefield. The third-person view can be zoomed in until the avatar's shoulders are framed, but there is also a mode similar to that of Gears of War in which the character occupies the lower left corner of the monitor, allowing a more precise view of the target. The action is frenetic and recalls that of an FPS: the carnage begins right from the first levels favored above all by the dynamic nature of the enemies, who are not limited to being mere street furniture objects, but actively patrol some strategic areas of the map, realizing quickly of unwelcome presences (and it's not just humans, but also harmless grazing animals or other aliens who are nearby). A very interesting, albeit non-innovative, feature is the existence of ~free~ outposts, periodically attacked by swarms of Bane who can even conquer them, thus making traders and giv quests unavailableers within them. The ensuing furious battles for liberation and garrison probably represent the flagship of Tabula Rasa, which reaches exciting levels with the use (strongly encouraged by a not very fast text system) of the voice chat: never as in these cases in fact it is necessary to organize with other players to reach the objective. Relative to the MMORPG genre, the artificial intelligence proves to be one of the best ever seen even if sometimes the computer-controlled aliens appear excessively aided by an aim that allows them to hit the player even when he is behind rocks or walls. Frustrating situations sometimes due to lag but also to real bugs that the programmers are doing their utmost to resolve. Economy in crisis There is no shortage of action even for those who prefer solo missions. Dozens of quests are presented at each camp and although not all of them can be completed immediately by a single player (even in Tabula Rasa cooperation between users is clearly favored) you will almost never find yourself with the worry of where to go or what to do, also because exploring on foot (paradoxically there are only teleportation portals, but no motorized vehicles) the vast areas that make up the game maps, you will always find some alien to disintegrate or some less experienced user to help out. Some of these even have moral implications (delivering the young shaman apprentice to justice for the damage done or helping him escape and cultivate his passion?), but it is a pity that there are no repercussions except in the reward. You fight mainly with firearms and bombs, as well as with special abilities: obviously it goes without saying that there are dozens of variants of rifles, pistols and the like and that all of them must be periodically repaired to avoid jamming or excessive overheating. Finding yourself in front of a group of Thrax with the machine gun broken down or worse still without ammunition is not nice at all and even a desperate escape sometimes won't be enough to save your own skin. Fortunately, the penalties related to the passing are limited to lowering (sometimes even drastically) the characteristics of the avatar for five minutes. This situation in itself is not very annoying in the main maps but creates big problems in the instances (i.e. those small areas of the game created exclusively for the player and his group) where it can be frustrating to wait to fully recover the attributes without being forced to interrupt halfway through a quest. Economy in crisis What is missing instead are PvP and a robust economy that cannot stand alone on the fragile crafting system implemented in Tabula Rasa, very complicated and left completely at the mercy of the players' curiosity, given that the only indications present in the paper guide really leave it to desire. The battles against other users have also been put far to the side and are basically about the clans. Even those who are not registered in a guild can challenge another player but this is certainly not the strong point of Tabula Rasa, at least in this run-in phase of the title, even if there is talk of course changes in the coming months, as well as the introduction of an auction house. A Sci-Fantasy Speaking of the settings of Tabula Rasa one remains dumbfounded: a sensation similar to the one brilliantly drawn just a week ago by our Paolo Simonazzi in one of his pungent cartoons. If they replaced the guns of the spears, the outposts of the castles and the alien ships of the mounted armies, the differences with a fantasy RPG would probably be minimized. The maps are so vast and numerous (there are currently around twenty main ones) that they do not feel the lack of any type of landscape: from wooded expanses to snowy glades, passing through canyons and savannahs, dams and trenches, none of which, however, is really well characterized and after a while you will have the impression of visiting places that are too similar to each other. It could be a subjective question, but from such a game we would have expected an urban guerrilla atmosphere that can only be breathed at times. The limits with which these were made certainly go beyond personal considerations, which sometimes ends up making the player lose orientation. It will take a while to extricate yourself in some caves that have a labyrinthine feel or to reach particularly inaccessible points, not always well displayed by the mini-map at the bottom right. A Sci-Fantasy The graphic realization of Lord British's game leaves us dumbfounded in the same way.In the face of not exactly popular system requirements, despite the game's target, the levels achieved are fluctuating. Some glimpses definitely deserve a positive note, as well as certain monsters (especially the more imposing ones), but in most cases you will have to deal with clumsy pixelated big boys who are anything but fearful. To be able to enjoy the maximum level of detail it is necessary to have a good quantity of system RAM (at least 2 GByte) and video (at least 512 MByte): those who do not have it will have to lower the visual quality to avoid continuous and annoying uploads from disk. The music, often anonymous, verges on repetitiveness during the firefights, proving in any case not suitable for the pyrotechnic show of special effects (very accurate) that light up the monitor. The game interface is a bit cumbersome and can create some difficulties during the first few bars, also because, as mentioned, the tutorial doesn't help much in this sense. The paper version isn't very useful either, and it's a serious flaw to point out because, given the price of the client, we would have expected something more comprehensive (the standard editions of Tabula Rasa contain only an abridged version of the 130-page booklet bundled in the deluxe). The game is afflicted by numerous bugs and by a net code still to be fixed: it often happened that we were unable to finish some quests due to the lack of enemies to eliminate; many times rifle shots fired at point-blank range didn't even make a scratch on the helpless alien sniper lying on the ground; finally, on a couple of occasions we literally got stuck with our avatar between two rocks being mercilessly eliminated by the enemies who flocked from everywhere. Since the official release of the game, dated November 2nd, two patches have already been released for a total of almost half a gigabyte (practically 15% of Tabula Rasa) which testify how fast they are working at NCsoft; unfortunately, however, there are still many flaws to be fixed that penalize the gaming experience. No credit card? Don't party! As written in the text of the review there are numerous bugs in Tabula Rasa, most of which concern the quests that sometimes ~break~ in the middle. In this box we want to report a problem that goes beyond the actual game and concerns the NCsoft servers. In fact, during the registration phase of Tabula Rasa it was not possible to activate the game using only the ~time trial~, i.e. the month of time made available by the code contained in the package: in order to continue we were forced to indicate the number of a card credit, on which the amount necessary to automatically extend the life of the account is debited. However, the Italian distributor DDE is able to provide assistance to customers until the problem is resolved by NCsoft. In any case, this is not a malicious procedure: once the game has been activated, it is possible to revoke the automatic debit provision without being charged any expense at the end of the first month, which is still free. Comment We at Multiplayer.it know how it is absolutely pretentious and unfair to judge an MMORPG after just two weeks of play, especially if it is a production by a team that has practically unlimited economic and creative potential. The number reported in these pages is actually the result of the first impressions derived from about forty hours of gameplay, and these impressions tell us that Tabula Rasa is a good game but not the masterpiece we would have expected from the genius of Garriott. The development of the avatar is certainly well thought out as is the vaguely hack 'n' slash style which makes the games very fast and engaging, even if sometimes a little repetitive. The PvE is equally well cared for, and ranks at the top of the category; moreover, some ingenious inventions (such as cloning) will certainly be taken up by future productions. However there are several aspects that undermine the overall experience, and these are not mere bugs that can be solved over time: too immature PvP and largely underdeveloped crafting risk not giving the right emphasis to interaction between users (despite the deriving gratification from the reconquest of an outpost that fell into Bane hands) and above all they cast shadows on what will happen once the maximum level is reached. The road map promised by NCsoft is promising and that's why we will return to our reflections in the coming months, when we evaluate the development of things: currently Tabula Rasa remains a recommended game but with reservations.
