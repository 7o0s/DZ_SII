{"name": "System Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/system-rush.html", "text": "People who look like things And the very nature and extent of the storyline are the very first striking elements of the Nokia production, both for the atypical nature of the subject in relation to the playful genre, and above all for the -even excessive- attention paid to the story: passing over the questionable Italian translation of the subtitles, the static images that describe the unfolding of events soon turn out to be rather boring, especially thanks to plots and not exactly captivating characters. Praise the skip function, which allows you to reach the heart of the Ideaworks 3D title in zero time, or a futuristic racing game clearly inspired by masters such as F-Zero and Wipeout but also the bearer of some interesting elements. Basically, the running phase represents the hacker's entry into the computer system of the multinational on duty, a wireframe environment stylistically similar to Tron or the more recent Rez. The fifteen tracks included in the play package are therefore the festival of the bare polygon, but they are striking in terms of variety and quality: in particular, noteworthy are the characterizations of each single track in relation to the host country, with the American one peppered with dollar symbols and of statues of liberty, the Russian one imbued with red stars, and so on. Graphically, System Rush is a remarkable product, which does not even spare some valuable special effects while maintaining an absolutely good frame rate. The design of the cars is also convincing, which again in the bizarre optics of the Nokia product would be nothing more than a visual representation of the hacking programs. The picture of a technical sector of sure impact is completed by a sound part that is a bit poor in terms of effects but truly appreciable as regards the music, which falls within the typical ~unz unz~ vein but is definitely spot on and adrenaline-pumping. Run cyber boy over there Promoted without too many reservations in its audiovisual aspect, System Rush proves to be a valid product also from a purely playful point of view, without ever reaching particularly high qualitative peaks. In essence, the Ideaworks 3D title is played as a vaguely simplified Wipeout, considered as the control system only contemplates the functions of jumping (useful for avoiding obstacles) and using the power up in addition to the basic ones of acceleration, braking and steering . Everything works quite well, and it takes very little to make your ship whiz along the paths offered by the game: and we use the term ~wizz~ not by chance, given the good sensation of speed provided by the Nokia product. The opportunity offered to the user to upgrade their cars following the victories in the races further increases the enjoyment of System Rush, but mercilessly highlights its biggest limitation, i.e. a really low level of difficulty. Thanks to a track design that is anything but severe and a decidedly docile AI of the opponents (which, moreover, can be eliminated without particular difficulties), winning in System Rush is never difficult, much less when you have upgraded ships available. Also noteworthy is a certain brevity of the tracks, which would certainly have benefited from a few more virtual kilometers each. Fortunately, the longevity of the Nokia product is not affected too much by these aspects, thanks above all to the good mix of modes available in single player (Story Mode, GP Mode and Free Hack) and the inevitable multiplayer section via Bluetooth, unfortunately limited to only two players but however appreciable and implemented in a convincing way. No gameplay instead through the N-Gage Arena service, which however has some interesting functions, such as the Hack TV which allows you to observe the races of other users and to upload your own, or the Shadow Racing, or a challenge with the performance ghosts best of players around the world. Comment System Rush, while evidently following in the footsteps of Wipeout, is a rather original product, which combines a convincing action on the track with a decidedly atypical setting for a racing game. Stylistic choices aside, however, the Ideaworks 3D title turns out to be fun and enjoyable, fast enough but decidedly penalized by a too low level of difficulty and a somewhat skimpy track design. All in all, venal sins, which, also compensated for by a truly remarkable technical realization, do not prevent System Rush from carving out a space of absolute importance within the N-Gage.Pro playful panorama Convincing design and technical realization Fast and enjoyable at the right point Good number of single and multiplayer modes Cons Difficulty level basso Track design a little lacking Storyline too heavy Imagine a not too distant future, in which the planet is entirely controlled by multinational corporations. Imagine that you are a hacker, belonging to an outlaw movement that aims to break down the foundations of corporate power. Certainly it would not be a truly original scenario, already exploited by films and adventure games: but the matter becomes more interesting in the case of System Rush, considering how this same narrative matrix forms the backdrop for a racing game...", "date": "2005-12-22", "grade": null}
