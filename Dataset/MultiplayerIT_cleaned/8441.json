In fact, the cute and super clean alligator Swampy gives way to the improbable agent Perry, an anthropomorphic platypus on a super secret mission coming directly from the Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb. While completely changing both the scenario and the protagonist, in Where's my Perry all the fun mechanics that have endeared the many players on iOS and Android are re-proposed in full; however, as you will see, there are some small but fun new features that can spice up the gameplay and tackle some levels with a little more variety. Flushed Where in the previous chapter the excuse for conveying the water to its destination was to allow Swampy, the sewer alligator, to bathe, in Where's My Perry the indispensable element instead serves a much nobler purpose, namely to save Life for Agent Perry. The young platypus is in fact a spy, summoned by his direct superior, Major Monogram, to receive a very delicate assignment; for the good of the country it is therefore essential that it reaches its destination in the shortest possible time. The evil and unpronounceable Dr. Doofenshmirtz however intends to block the action of the brave agent and therefore decides to sabotage the intricate but rapid transport system used by the agency, i.e. the water pipes. From this moment on all the mechanics already seen in Where's my water are current again: the control system and the behavior of the terrain and fluids are in fact completely borrowed from this great success, making the player try again the usual pleasant sensations. However, as explained in the introduction, there are some significant differences and innovations, starting right from the final destination of the water which, in this case, activates the electricity meters located under a sort of lift so as to continue the run of Perry along the communication pipes. In addition to the physics of fluids, based on the movements of water and sludge of various kinds, this time there is also a lot of play with the changes of state that the precious liquid inevitably assumes based on the temperatures. To solve the puzzles it will not therefore be enough to have liquid water but in some cases water vapor or ice may be needed. Scattered throughout the levels are machines that are useful for intervening on the operating temperature, such as the ~hot-inator~ lasers, which transform water into steam but also ice into water, and the ~cold-inator~ lasers which, as can easily be understood, carry out the task opposite changing the vapor into water and the latter into ice. In addition to the two types of laser just listed, in some diagrams there is a mocking machine called ~celebrator~ which on one side sucks up the liquid and on the other transforms it, no one knows exactly how, into paper festoons and decorations. It is clearly a nuisance element, which can be circumvented with suitable interventions on the surrounding soil or, better yet, by making it explode by introducing the dense and odious black sludge into the suction nozzle. This compound plays part of the role that the poisonous liquid did in Where's My Water; as on that occasion, however, it can sometimes prove useful, for example when it is necessary to plug the slits of a grate in order to accumulate water. It should be noted that, continuing with Where's my Perry, the taps and lasers can be activated manually; other compounds with particular properties will also appear, such as a sort of ~lava~ which instantly turns it into steam when it comes into contact with water. The scoring system is also already seen and is based on the speed of solving the puzzles and the number of garden gnomes saved by making them cross by water or steam (a bit like the ducks for Swampy). Finally, scattered in the dirt are numerous secret dossiers and bonus items to collect. Finally, nothing new from a technical point of view: the style, always pleasant, is the same as the previous title and there is absolutely nothing else to ask for. As usual, the developers have promised maximum support and, given the previous ones, we are sure that these promises will certainly be kept.", "date": "2012-07-09", "grade": "8.7"}
