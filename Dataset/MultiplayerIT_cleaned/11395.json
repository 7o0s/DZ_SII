{"name": "Dots & Boxes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dots-boxes.html", "text": "We've already talked about it, yet the theme forcefully returns to the fore every time a new title belonging to the puzzle game genre comes out: is it better to rely on classic mechanics, perhaps by cloning already well-tested structures, or think of something new? It is clear that opting for one or the other path can produce diametrically opposed results. We recently saw that it is possible to clone a classic like Puzzle Bubble, even adding depth to the original through a structure that varies from level to level. Attempts to imitate products such as Tetris, then, are wasted, along with a series of alternative but ~official~ versions of the same game. In short, in the field of puzzle games it remains really difficult to invent something new that can rival what already exists, reiterated over the years. Yet there are those who try, in this case LemonQuest with its Dots & Boxes... From the start screen we can choose whether to play a quick game or try our hand at the tournament. In the first case we will be able to choose one of the six characters available (at the beginning there are only two, the others must be unlocked gradually) and start immediately with a game; in the second case, after choosing our alter ego we will face a sequence of increasingly cunning opponents, able to make us eat the dust after a few moves. But how does it all work? In turn, we will have to select one of the dots on the board (which varies in shape with each game) and light a line that reaches another one. The aim is to complete a square, in this case by drawing the fourth side even if all the others have been drawn by our opponent: in doing so, the table closes with a point of our color inside, and the opponent suffers damage depending on the number of tables that close as a result (all adjacent ones, in this case). Both we and the enemy on duty will have an energy indicator, which empties a little with each attack suffered and which decrees the game over once empty. The most significant combos are graphically represented by a series of energy flows that cross the board and then project themselves onto the victim's energy bar, and this is sometimes accompanied by a short animation that translates into physical terms (a punch, a football) the action. The control system is very simple and immediate, with the joystick that allows us to move the cursor and the 5 key to select the desired dot. It cannot be said that the game itself is equally simple: although the rules of the game are clear and can be counted on the fingers of one hand, being able to defeat the opponent will never be an easy task. Indeed, very often the matches result in an infinite exchange of ~half moves~ waiting for the enemy to make a false step, so that he can be hit several times in sequence. The mechanics of Dots & Boxes, in fact, immediately appear very limited, and often whoever scores the first shot is likely to win the contest in the end. Apart from classic elements such as the board and colored dots, the game's graphics leverage a manga-inspired character design for the characters, who are revealed in their entirety during the short animations that follow the most powerful combos. Unfortunately the drawing style is anything but brilliant, and gives the product a somewhat rough, almost amateurish feel. The sound sector does not improve the situation, given that it relies on a modest quality MIDI music, which can be largely deactivated.
