{"name": "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2 - The Phantom Fortress", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ultimate-ninja-heroes-2-the-phantom-fortress.html", "text": "Naruto's popularity continues unabated, and the manga created by Masashi Kishimoto now boasts transpositions for all gaming systems. The most interesting thing is that these are not conversions of the same product, but of different series, designed specifically for the consoles they run on. If on PlayStation 2 we have Naruto: Ultimate Ninja and Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles, on PlayStation 3 the promising Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm is about to arrive and on Xbox 360 the saga that will soon lead to the sequel to Naruto: Rise of a Ninja seems well underway. on the Sony portable console we can enjoy the ~King of Fighters~ style fights of Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes. The first episode of the series, released last year exclusively for PSP, had the merit of translating the spectacular ninja fights already seen on PS2 into a portable environment, applying some changes to the gameplay to differentiate the experience. The major change concerned precisely the substance of the clashes, no longer between just two characters but between two teams of two or three elements. The developers of Namco Bandai did not want to make revolutions, choosing to re-propose the elements that made the success of the first episode. More of the same? For Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2 - The Phantom Fortress, the developers of Namco Bandai did not want to make revolutions, choosing to reproduce the elements that made the success of the first episode but enriching them wherever possible. So the Hero Mode returns, in which we will have to choose the characters that make up our group and then face a sequence of different opponents depending on the difficulty level available, with a total of three paths to unlock and complete. We can select one of the ready-made teams, whose alliances refer to the plot of the cartoon, or create one from scratch, observing which special abilities will arise from the combination: each ninja has an extra ability that can be ~spent~ before a fight to wear down enemies, seal their chakra, or recover from wounds. To these is added a ~group~ ability, a sort of synthesis of the talent of the individual characters, well defined in the case of pre-established groups but unpredictable if we want to create a team from scratch. Just like in the first episode, the strategic component is important: the residual energy of each character must be taken into consideration before deciding the order of appearance, therefore the hidden objects in the stages are collected to obtain momentary advantages. It is clear that the higher the difficulty level, the more cautious it will be. Once in action, the gameplay appears unchanged from the first Ultimate Ninja Heroes: the combos are performed with a combination of d-pad and Circle, while the Square is used to throw the shurikens, the X to jump and the Triangle to use the chakra . The Ghost Fortress The most consistent novelty introduced in this sequel is represented by a sort of ~story mode~ in which Naruto and his friends must investigate the appearance of a mysterious floating fortress that overlooks the Leaf Village. The building, one hundred floors high, was evoked by enemies of all time and has a cursed aura, which historically has led to the destruction of all the villages where it has appeared. Having penetrated the fortress, the group of ninjas led by the usual Shikimaru finds themselves exploring rooms full of an unnatural mist, which hide more than one pitfall. The exploration phases are represented on the screen via an avatar and a simple box map, where each box represents a room and has its own value or can take on one based on the rolls we have available, where it appears as an ~unstable room~ . We will therefore be able to deal with a simple pre-calculated sequence, or face a fight, or even overcome a series of different tests: tree climbing, the clone recognition test, the quiz on the animated series, training with Shikimaru , etc. You have to complete each floor and reach the stairs that lead to the next one, while trying to reach all the treasure rooms to earn extra items. To do this, we will often have to resort to special skills limited in number, capable of paving a path studded with obstacles or not very visible. Finally, occasionally we will be able to stop in ~regenerating~ rooms, capable of putting our group back on track, where we will also have the possibility of modifying the formation as happens in role-playing games (given and considered that new characters will be added to the expedition as we proceed). Technical realization On a technical level, the differencesdifferences between this sequel and the first Ultimate Ninja Heroes are frankly difficult to identify: the polygonal models of the characters have not undergone improvements, nor are there any differences in the excellent two-dimensional representations of the same. The locations have no variations, boasting the usual subdivision on two floors of depth as well as a large number of interactable elements, which can be destroyed to obtain extra items. It must be said that the quality of the textures seems to have improved compared to the first episode, or perhaps certain details have been better ~hidden~, the fact is that the graphics always appear well defined and in no case are there any slowdowns or drops in frame rate. As regards the sound, however, there is very little to say: music and effects have not changed one iota, therefore the accompaniment remains valid (with the usual imperative of changing the horrible voices in English with those in Japanese) but it has already been abundantly heard. The game features wireless multiplayer, even with just one UMD, for up to sixteen people. Unfortunately, there is no online multiplayer. Comment Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2 - The Phantom Fortress looks like an ~enhanced~ version of the first episode, but without those innovations and elements that usually characterize a completely new chapter. There are the same characters, there is the same technical sector (perhaps slightly improved) and the gameplay hasn't changed one iota, while an interesting ~story mode~ has been added to the usual Heroes Mode, at times original and really full of substance (to explore the hundred floors of the Ghost Fortress, in fact, it will take quite a bit of time). A mix of old and new, therefore, definitely recommended for those who haven't had the opportunity to try the first Ultimate Ninja Heroes and want to relive Naruto's adventures on their PSP. For the eventual third episode, however, it will be reasonable to expect a substantial change... Pros Two ~weighty~ modes Widely tested gameplay Well done graphics... Cons ...but it remained the same, in practice Few changes compared to the prequel Still missing online", "date": "2008-08-11", "grade": null}
