Since the first images shown last February, it was clear that Japan Studio's work was not a real benchmark. However, today, after testing it thoroughly, it is clear that the title is a simple filler towards other products, newer and more convincing both in purely technical terms and in terms of pure gameplay. In short, an action platform with few pretensions, decidedly ~long~ (we are around ten hours of play) but plagued by numerous problems that affect the general goodness of the realization. Knack is a strange little being composed of relics, a material of various shapes and colors held up by a dark force. It goes without saying that the more they are found in the levels, the stronger, bigger and healthier the protagonist will become, with obvious repercussions when it comes to beating hands. The story, a mere fil rouge to stage the usual world tour, sees the protagonist and his companions try to eradicate the goblin revolt, who suddenly switched from bows and arrows to tanks, planes and laser weapons. A decidedly too fast technological shot, and for this we need to investigate. Together with us, in addition to the faithful Doc and his nephew, there is also the billionaire scientist Victor. From the very beginning, thanks to his mellifluous gaze and his unfriendly robots, we understand that he hides a secret, for a double game that appears to be sent to the player by registered mail with return receipt rather than a telephone call. Knack is certainly not the best calling card for PlayStation 4 I fight, I fight, I fight... From here begin the adventures of Knack that lead us to explore places that are too varied and varied, which even give the idea of being little related to each other. Huge Goblin wooden forts, castles, high-tech labs, snow-capped mountains, caves, mines, coastal towns and windy peaks, virtually seamless. Pad in hand everything revolves around a slim combat system. In fact, Knack only has two close range attacks: a series of punches and the classic (double) jump with relative somersault on the enemies' heads. There is no parry, this lack is compensated for by dodging, with little ~stretch~: more than to catch our breath and take us out of the fighting, it is to be understood as a real ~counter move~, in fact it is used to hit the enemies after they have they attacked us, to overcome their armor and the most powerful blows. To corroborate this opinion there is the appearance of short quick time events when the toughest opponents use their most effective weapons and which nine times out of ten have the power to kill us with a single blow. The combat mechanics are all here, it must be added however that we can use area attacks and from afar using the solar stones scattered throughout the levels, but they are to be understood as real ~smart bombs~, to be launched only in extreme cases, therefore to be used with extreme parsimony. Everything is played on timing, in getting the short windows of time to dodge and to counterattack, but since you only fight with your fists you must always stay in the heart of the action, exposing yourself to the blows of the enemies. Of course we can use the somersault from above, but being devoid of target lock most of the time there is the possibility of landing in the wrong place or at the very moment in which a goblin is throwing a mine or loading a slash with the mace. In fact, it is necessary to carefully understand who to hit first, in a sort of ~trial and error~ when the situation becomes more chaotic, especially when our Knack is in mignon format and cannot tolerate more than one or two hits. The situation improves when the protagonist gets bigger or when he doubles the health bar by engulfing metal, wood or snow: in this case the attacks are the same, there are no different ~powers~, but only a greater force that can knock out. enemies on the fly. Ultimately, the lack of real shots from a distance is felt: dodging and punches are a well-implemented combo in themselves, but in the long run, given the extreme repetitiveness of the action and the great chaotic nature of the fights in the advanced levels, a greater variety of attacks would have been really welcome. But Knack's real problem isn't so much the scarcity of different types of shots, but - as written above - the great repetitiveness, level after level. The layout is simple: corridor (or path), room with enemies, corridor (or path), larger room with more enemies, corridor (or path), arena with everything you fought before, and maybe a new intermediate boss . We continueso, for about ten hours. That's all, with a few variations of this pattern. What changes, therefore, is the number of enemies on stage and the paraphernalia supplied. The opponents, indeed few as models (starting with simple spiders and cockroaches and ending with goblins, robots, soldiers and golems), are however very rich in terms of offensive tools. The arsenal is really vast: bow, spear, mace, laser rifles, boomerang halberds, grenades, grenade launcher, huge hammers, energy area shots, homing missiles, walls of projectiles fired from planes and so on. A lot of variety in this sense and that engages us a lot in action, but after the umpteenth stanza in which the result does not change when the addends change, one feels a decided sense of boredom. Even the numerous purely platform phases that break up the action several times, not to mention the various boss fights, fail to mitigate this pressing sense of boredom. Without forgetting that from the middle of the game onwards, tanks enter the scene in large numbers to complicate things, with ~arenas~ where their number increases from time to time as you progress. In short, a lot of boredom and repetitiveness and zero topical moments. It is a real pity that Japan Studio has not been able to make the combat phases richer, less mechanical, woody and listless, amalgamating them better with the progression, deviating from an iron setting that makes everything a long and tedious sequence of clashes. The combat system in itself would not be bad, and net of the reduced sample of moves, it forces us to play differently depending on the size and power of the protagonist (in any case established a priori by the game): more reckless, when we will be become enormous, slow and clumsy, but unstoppable, and more ~cunning~, more ~on tiptoe~ when we are small, fast and agile, but also fragile and with a shortcrust pastry fist. A wasted opportunity, in short, because the bases for an honest product - perhaps not particularly original, but effective - were all there. However, there is not only to be beaten, defeat bosses and overcome short platform phases. Knack also pushes the player to a minimum of ~exploration~ to find secret doors to break down to find all sorts of collectibles. Perhaps the term exploration is exaggerated, it is simply a question of sharpening the view to find that backdrop that is clearly different from the others which can hide relics, solar stones or better still pieces of contraptions which can give the protagonist bonuses once built. From a technical point of view Knack offers very little to all those who want to feast their eyes on the potential of PlayStation 4. Beyond the 1080p resolution there is little else. The protagonist, with his body made up of dozens of relics, is undoubtedly the best part of the game, well animated and capable of credibly portraying the physical differences between his transformations. From the polygonal mass, to the not exactly dynamic lighting, passing through the flat textures, nothing struck us, only the detail and cleanliness bring us almost to the next gen area, like some shaders applied to metal surfaces and backdrops. It just looks like a polished game from a past generation and nothing more. Perhaps it will be the fault of the cartoon style which prefers ~flat~ colors and models to ~full~ gradations but the look is in some ways really poor. So while it's not exactly a ~heavy~ title that can put PlayStation 4 to the whip, we have to report drops in frame rates when the situation gets more chaotic. Towards the end of the game we will be faced with successive fights in which tanks, mechs, planes and various infantry appear on the scene at the same time. When missiles, bullets and rotating blades start flying, the frames have often sometimes reached very low figures, which in fact means certain death. Obviously we are not talking about recurring problems but certainly not sporadic.", "date": "2013-11-13", "grade": "5.0"}
