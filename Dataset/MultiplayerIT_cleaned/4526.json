Released in June 2006 by Iron Lore, a development studio formed by ex-Ensemble Studios (Age of Empires), it was expanded the following year with Immortal Throne. At the time it didn't sell very many copies and Iron Lore was forced to close in 2008: from its ashes Crate Entertainment was born, to whom we owe the excellent Grim Dawm, also recently expanded. Meanwhile Titan Quest had taken another road, that of oblivion. Except that, launched on Steam (when Steam was still a shop and not a landfill) it managed to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, convincing the new publisher THQ Nordic, who acquired the rights in 2013, to remaster it by launching the Titan Quest Anniversary Edition in 2016, and surprisingly produce a second expansion: Ragnark, released a few days ago, more than eleven years after the launch of the original. As the title suggests, this time our hero leaves ancient Greece to pay a visit to the cold lands of the north, where there are many creatures from Nordic mythology in the company of the Celtic peoples who are waiting to be slaughtered in joy. Translated in terms of content, Ragnark includes a new campaign, a new mastery (Rune Master), raises the level limit to 85 and adds a large number of items and powers, retouching where necessary the material already included in the base game, which however, its essence is not affected in the least. It's Titan Quest In fact, the novelties of Titan Quest Ragnark end in the list of its contents, given that the game remains essentially the one we have learned to love over the years. The mechanics are exactly the same, while the gameplay is dedicated to the most seasoned players, since to be enjoyed it requires a high-level character who has first completed Immortal Throne. The story is not linked in a very organic way to that of the previous chapters, even if it must be said that Titan Quest has never shone from a narrative point of view: however, the pretext given for the change of scenery is not even as bad as it seems in a first joke. After all, the important thing is to have new creatures to beat and new levels to overcome, perhaps learning to exploit the runes, which essentially transform the protagonist into a warrior mage, with melee attacks mixed with various spells. Again, nothing you haven't already seen. Unfortunately, it is precisely the new levels that show very evident ups and downs. The best maps are the outdoor ones, as indeed it has always been for Titan Quest even in the absence of Ragnark: as usual, the natural landscapes perform particularly well, especially in the wilder. In our opinion, the interiors are less successful, appearing very anonymous. We are thinking in particular of the dungeons of the dwarves, which are really poor in characterizing elements, but also of some advanced levels, of which we will not reveal anything to not give you too many previews, but which theoretically should have been much more powerful from the point of view of representation than they are, inhabited as they are by creatures of a certain type. In short, many maps have the flavor of large arenas even when they are pretended to be something else and end up penalizing the immersion a little. Moreover, even the villages that can be visited, where as always you can take quests and restock on potions and equipment, are less alive than those of the original Titan Quest. That they are smaller is also normal, given the different scenario, but sometimes they lack their own identity that goes beyond Nordic folklore. Of course, we are not talking about a mega production and in any case there are many other elements that will make fans happy, such as a large number of enemies, including Celtic warriors, animals typical of the northern lands and creatures from Norse mythology. Obviously there is no shortage of big bosses, capable of hitting really hard and which will put a strain on your ability to consume healing potions or mana. Too bad that, except for some AoE attacks, they are basically normal bigger and more resistant enemies, which do not require specific tactics to be faced. It must also be said that some 3D models are not exactly exceptional, but on the other hand we must consider that a great deal of work has been done to improve the special effects, in particular those of spells and abilities, and that we are still in line with the Titan Quest original in terms of overall graphics quality (aside from some really ugly new weapon icons). Unfortunately the years feel, despite the excellent remastering work, mit was inevitable that it should be so.", "date": "2017-11-27", "grade": "6.5"}
