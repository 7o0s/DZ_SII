{"name": "Ankh - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ankh-recensione.html", "text": "History revised and corrected Cairo. The young Assil, son of the pharaoh's architect, has seen fit to invite his friends to drink a beer in the new pyramid built by his father, whose keys he has stolen: after having recklessly ventured into the King Scarab's funeral hall, he ends up with profane it by massacring canopic jars and arousing the wrath of the mummy, who inflicts a mortal curse on him in response. By chance, Assil finds himself in possession of what he believes to be the king's bottle opener and which will soon turn out to be quite another thing: the Ankh, precisely. To save his life, he will have to ask for help from none other than the Pharaoh and Osiris, god of the kingdom of the dead, but first he will have to overcome the copious pitfalls of the desert, ravenous crocodiles, merchants of dubious morality and a very alternative group of revolutionaries. Not to mention the fact that, after discovering him in the act of committing a crime, his father mercilessly punished him and doesn't want to hear any reason. Among a thousand vicissitudes, our hero will come across a whole series of bizarre characters, including the fascinating and mysterious daughter of the Arab ambassador, Thara, who will accompany him in the second part of the adventure and with whom he will never miss an opportunity to make a fuss. the settings are rendered with a colorful and humorous cartoon style, in perfect harmony with the light-hearted and light-hearted spirit of the story History revised and corrected Any references to other adventures are not included. purely random! Although the plot does not shine for its originality and ability to involve, the game has to offer a few hours of healthy fun and a couple of really hilarious gimmicks: you grind one puzzle after another for the simple sake of meeting new characters and finding out which ones demented jokes reserve for us the next conversations. In fact, the lively characterization is also reflected in the dialogues, which are always fresh and amusing. The settings are rendered in a colorful and humorous cartoon style, in perfect harmony with the light-hearted and light-hearted spirit of the story. However, Ankh does not limit itself to offering a nice parody of ancient Egypt and cinematic stereotypes: it does not even spare the tradition of graphic adventures itself, peppering conversations and game situations with videogame quotations and self-deprecating references, such as those on the quality of the mourned past adventures or on the controversial innovations introduced in more recent titles to rejuvenate the genre (Assil's reaction to the appearance of an energy bar on the screen is priceless!). A chat and a little DIY The fun multiple-choice dialogues are the highlight of the game. intriguing of the game. If you're wondering how you can help Assil get rid of the uncomfortable curse that hit him, the answer is simple: extorting any useful information and solving a fair number of puzzles based on the most unthinkable object associations. The game mechanic is based exclusively on dialogues and inventory, so mini-games, logical-mechanical puzzles, action or stealth phases are not contemplated. Some puzzles also involve the collaboration between Assil and Thara but none stands out in a particular way for their originality. Although it is a linear and relatively easy adventure overall, the level of difficulty can oscillate between ridiculous and unattainable in a completely arbitrary way: even the most experienced will be hopelessly blocked by the impenetrability of some far from intuitive enigma , finding yourself trying every possible combination of items in hopes of hitting the right one, and it's a shame that many of the final puzzles are some of the simplest in the game! Another reason why frustration is always lurking comes from the fact that some of the objects essential to the continuation of the adventure are really well hidden and you find yourself exploring each scenario in detail: get ready for jokes of wild pixel-hunting. Barring a few hitches potentially due to the aforementioned problems, a seasoned adventurer will still be able to finish the game in a few hours, in his spare time on a weekend for example. Joys and sorrows of the three dimensions A beautiful cruise on the Nile awaits us. The interface is essential and intuitive: it can't help but recall the old LucasArts titles, with a status bar at the bottom of the screen that signals all the objects and interactive areas over which the cursor passes, also indicating the possible actions to to execute. Assil's movements are controlled with the left mouse button (one click to walk and two to run), which is also used to examine objects both in the environments and in the'inventory. With the right button, the commands available from time to time are given depending on the game context and the items collected are combined. The only peculiarity is the use of the Tab key to display a list of objectives: an excellent idea which unfortunately has not been developed in the best way, since the indications provided are always too general and succinct (it is like not having them, in short). It is curious that only for one of the two main scenarios, the desert, a button is provided to return directly to the starting point, i.e. a boat waiting for us at the pier: curious because it is the other scenario, that of the city, to give more trouble and require exhausting trips back and forth! At least a map would have been nice. The dialogue engine always offers multiple choices but, for once, it is not necessary to exhaust them all to continue the adventure: some are necessary for solving the puzzles, while others are purely decorative and often genuinely fun. However, it is not possible to make irreparable mistakes during conversations and, in the worst case scenario, it will be enough to start them again and select a different option. the interface is essential and intuitive: it can't help but remember the old LucasArts titles Joys and sorrows of the three dimensions The market, an inexhaustible source of information. As for the visual sector, Ankh defends itself quite well with its three-dimensional engine and offers pleasant and colorful graphics, even if not exactly breathtaking. The advantages offered by the three dimensions have been exploited satisfactorily, despite some small path-finding problems which sometimes make it difficult for the main character to move. Being a comic adventure, the choice of the cartoon style is particularly happy and, while not boasting an infinite number of polygons or the best textures ever seen, the game maintains an interesting cut and is not without noteworthy artistic choices, such as the cinematic shots aimed at always providing the best point of view on the action and nice close-ups on the characters during conversations. In this regard, it is necessary to underline the care with which the facial animations have been created. Unfortunately, the same attention has not always been invested in other details: the game is undermined by some graphic bugs, among which collision problems between the character models and the elements of the environment stand out above all, even in the cutscenes which are in any case represented through the in-game engine. The latter still needs to be optimised, above all in the light of the long loading times and the onerous hardware requirements it imposes and which cause slowdowns even on a medium-high range machine (at least by the standards of adventures): to ensure smooth and painless, by activating all the advanced effects, you need a 2 GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM and a Radeon 9800 Pro or GeForce FX 5900 XT video card... and the visual impact is decidedly different from that obtainable with the minimum requirements indicated on the packaging! Ankh defends itself quite well with its three-dimensional engine and offers pleasant and colorful graphics, even if not exactly breathtaking Joys and sorrows of the three dimensions The soundtrack is discreet, with pleasant themed accompaniment pieces, but without infamy and without praise, if we exclude the nice Disney-inspired opening tune. The same goes for the audio effects, which however are compromised by some bugs and tend to come and go here and there. The English dubbing is appreciable, but for the Italian subtitles a separate discussion must be made: the localization leaves much to be desired, many nuances and jokes have been lost. While it is true that this may be partly due to a previous translation from German and the difficulty of adapting the telegraphic interface, it is nevertheless evident that the game has not been tested, being littered with absolutely avoidable linguistic bugs: regardless of the fluctuating quality of the translation, some of the sentences that appear in the status bar are disconnected (Enter stairs, Enter lower floor) and entire lines of dialogue appear left in English! Final comment Ankh represents a welcome return to comic-demented adventures and winks above all at the nostalgics of LucasArts titles, ridiculing old and new videogame clichs. His spontaneous and disengaged humor manages to create a certain complicity with the player, even if the product as a whole fails neither to truly match the glories of the classic 90s nor to appreciably renew the genre, making use of the new technologiesi.e. It's still a pretty fun game, pleasant to see and listen to, which should be rewarded for the nostalgic operation and at the same time for the courageous choice of three dimensions. Too bad only for the puzzles, inconstant and limited to the interaction with objects, and for some small technical lack that is not always negligible and difficult to swallow, as well as the mediocre Italian localization. It can prove to be a welcome surprise, if approached with due carelessness and a good dose of patience, and perhaps it also deserves the attention of younger adventure enthusiasts who have never known the unforgettable classics of the genre, being children of Syberia and not of Monkey Island!Pro Humor omnipresent Excellent characterization Cartoony 3D graphics Cons Monothematic and uncalibrated puzzles Poor localization and testing Very limited duration Video game archaeology Each setting draws a smile. Ankh is a more than classic ~point and click~ adventure... almost archaeological, given the (unfaithfully) historical setting and considering that it draws heavily on the legacy left by the founders of the genre: the caricatured Egypt told to us in the game it is populated by revelers and incompetent pharaohs, talkative mummies, banana throwers, camel washers and retired lamp geniuses, but it also and above all wants to be a tribute to the comic successes by LucasArts and to all the old-fashioned graphic adventures. Not surprisingly, the German developer Deck 13 has resurrected a title of the same name released for Acorn RISC in the past and made use of the artistic consultancy of the Telltale Games group, mainly composed of former LucasArts talents determined in turn to bring back the adventures 90s style.", "date": "2006-03-21", "grade": null}
