The merit of its founder, Dave Gilbert, is twofold: in addition to having created small cults such as The Shivah and the Blackwell series, the New York author has shown a flair for taking the most promising projects under his wing in the Adventure Game community Study. An example is the collaboration with Erin Robinson, the young game designer behind the lively Puzzle Bots, but the spearhead is undoubtedly represented Gemini Rue, the acclaimed graphic adventure by Los Angeles student Joshua Nuernberger. Two years later, history repeats itself: developed by Vince Wesselmann, Resonance has been at the top of the most wanted list among point-and-click enthusiasts for five years, promising an engaging storyline, inspired characters, original ideas and very elaborate puzzles. Yet, over time the more skeptical part of the community began to fear it was just smoke and mirrors: how likely were there to repeat the success of Gemini Rue in such a short distance? After playing and replaying the entire adventure we can finally say that the answer, fortunately, could not be more positive. A dangerous discovery The story told by Vince Twelve takes shape in a science fiction scenario very different from the gloomy and decadent one seen in Gemini Rue: the fate of the peoples who inhabit the Earth is threatened here by a new scientific discovery called resonance, born with the intention of bringing enormous benefits to mankind and to energy progress, but capable of turning into a devastating weapon of mass destruction once it gets into the wrong hands. The death of the physicist who discovered resonance thus sets off a treasure hunt full of dangers, in which four characters set off in search of the secret refuge where the results of the entire study are hidden. The possibility of freely switching from one protagonist to another is far from new in the genre, but already from the substantial introductory section it becomes clear how much Resonance stands out for their characterization and charisma. Ed is a somewhat sociopathic scholar, who worked on the resonance project and intends to preserve and continue the research; he is joined by Anna, nephew of the scientist who was killed who hopes to find some clues about his sad and mysterious past in his uncle's inheritance; then there's Bennet, who has years of experience as a policeman and doesn't mind breaking a few rules in order to complete a case; and finally Ray, a hacker and investigative journalist who gets involved in the expedition while hunting for a new scoop for his online newspaper. Each of these four characters is characterized by a unique and well-defined personality by the different way of relating to the other supporting actors, and if much of the credit goes to the excellent screenplay, it is undeniable how the result is further enhanced by the work of the dubbing cast . A gem is represented by the participation of Logan Cunningham, voice actor known for the role of external narrator of Bastion and who in Resonance gives voice to Commissioner Bennet, but it is important to underline how, unlike some previous Wadjeteye Games productions, this time all the voices of the main characters are maintained on qualitatively high levels. But where Wesselmann's adventure shines above all is in the perfect writing of the dialogues, always engaging, never banal and above all able to mix serious moments with jokes full of humor without ever seeming out of place or banal; the same hint system cleverly hides between lines of dialogue, so that the other characters give the player a few small tips without the exchange seeming in any way unnatural. The result is a graphic adventure in which one is so involved, amused or blown away by the conversations of the protagonists that it becomes almost a pleasure to get lost in optional sections and unnecessary speeches, while the narration always maintains a high pace and does not lack fascinating sections dreamlike and interesting flashbacks. All between charismatic characters and settings that are never predictable, while slowly approaching the spectacular climax that introduces one of the two possible endings. Perhaps the setting of Resonance will not be able to match the charm of Barracus and its rainy streets in the style of Blade Runner, but its plot manages to deal with Orwellian themes and social problems with the same and identical effectiveness as whenmade with Gemini Rue. enigmatic memories Putting aside the perfect combination of plot, narration and dialogues, the most interesting and innovative element of Resonance is undoubtedly represented by the management of the memories of the characters. There are two types: long-term memories remain imprinted in a specific character following a particular event in the plot and can be recalled at any time during the adventure; short-term memories, on the other hand, are more ephemeral and can concern any object or character that the player decides to momentarily ~remember~. In both cases the memories play a fundamental role, since many puzzles and dialogues can only be solved by resorting to a particular memory rather than another. It is neither more nor less than an evolution of the traditional collection of objects, but in this way Vince Twelve has managed to give his work a much more articulated and dynamic structure than the traditional point and click. However, predictably, the exponential increase in the number of objects that can be carried or interacted with ends up in some moments to overwhelm the player with too many possibilities, and although the clue system often comes to the aid, it is easy to get lost and remain stuck waiting to figure out which short-term memory to retrieve. Fortunately, the moments in which there is no clear connection between the puzzle and its solution are rare, and indeed we can only applaud the general quality of the various puzzles scattered throughout the approximately ten hours needed to complete the adventure : Ray, for example, is equipped with a smartphone with which he can check emails, objectives and notes, but it is in the hacking phases with him as the protagonist that Resonance reaches some of the highest peaks, stimulating the user to set his brain in motion and no longer to reason based on the objects in one's possession. In this regard, it is pleasing to note that, although the important elements blend perfectly into the rich pixel art of the environments, it is never necessary to resort to a messy pixel hunting in search of hidden objects. Finally, as in Gemini Rue, even in this case it is possible to lose or be killed, but an elegant time rewind system allows you to go back a few moments before without interrupting the story or resorting to previous saves.", "date": "2012-06-26", "grade": "9.0"}
