The reason is easy to say: the developers of From Software have the undeniable talent of being able to build an idea and make it attractive to those who decide to embrace it to the fullest, the point is that this path almost always turns out to be bumpy, full of edges and jolts that it is really difficult to turn a blind eye to; and the new Armored Core: Verdict Day is no exception. We had left the franchise last year with an episode that was certainly valid on the ~passion~ front, with highly customizable mechs, many weapons and components to unlock and buy, as well as a wide-ranging multiplayer structure; but limping on the front of ~reason~, given that to enjoy the experience you had to move within a damn badly conceived interface, spoiled by extra loading times for synchronization with the servers, and once in the game to reckon with an absurd territorial limitation for online users and a technical sector below expectations, moreover subject to frequent drops in the frame rate. A diamond in the rough? We have no doubts that fans of the series enjoyed Armored Core V and had the enthusiasm and patience to explore its merits, which usually come to the surface in the long run. Well then, what did the guys from From Software think of doing for Verdict Day? The answer will shock you. A strain of min... No, no, we're kidding. While positioning itself as the traditional ~update~ of an episode proper, in this case the fifth, Armored Core: Verdict Day brings a series of interesting innovations to the table, which respond to specific needs and further enrich gameplay and structure. In the first place, it was thought of transforming the entire global scenario into a persistent online world divided into factions, which compete within the various territories in order to control them. At the first start, we are asked to select a team precisely with a view to participating in these sorties and contributing to the cause, therefore we need to do some apprenticeship and make ourselves available as mercenaries in cooperative matches, all in order to earn a place in a team and participate in choral actions that can be engaging and spectacular, especially when the party members have a minimum of experience. During our tests, the matchmaking proved to be fast and efficient, putting us in contact with various realities and degrees of skill, within missions that often ended with success and a tidy sum of money to seal unprecedented alliances. Those who do not feel inclined to teamwork, however, do not despair: the game allows at a certain point to create bots that can play a support role in battle. Specifically, these are units that respond to certain behavioral patterns, which we can adjust in detail if desired or set starting from some presets. And then there is always the single player campaign, this time made up of something like sixty missions which, however, soon turn out to be quite limited and repetitive, as well as similar to what has already been seen in Armored Core V. Who will let themselves be conquered by the salad based of mechs prepared by From Software will also be rewarded by the unlocking of a further mode for experts only, with modifiers such as to make each level a real nightmare. Armored Core: Verdict Day boasts a solid structure, especially online, together with the usual flaws Playstation 3 trophies The fifty Trophies (plus Platinum) contained in Armored Core: Verdict Day present various levels of detail: we start with the more trivial ones, obtainable simply by completing certain actions for the first time, continuing however with more complex and articulated objectives, which include, for example, the destruction of certain types of mechs. Okay, but the rest? Let's go back to the initial speech on the idea and on making it attractive, because with Armored Core: Verdict Day the developers have done just that, that is they have continued to work on the heart of the experience, to insert new elements, new objects, new weapons, new customizations, so as to make the modification of the mech a real art, to be developed according to specific needs before tackling a mission. You can decide to mount a machine gun or sniper rifle, an assault rifle or a laser cannon, select a homing or normal missile launcher for the shoulders, change the arms, head, torso and legs to accommodate the need for greater resistance or mobility , then letting the engine translate the various combinations into an impactful design. In short, there is great thickness in thisthe junctures and there is the new structure for the online multiplayer we have just talked about, plus the various implications aimed at increasing the longevity of the product. Yet nothing has been done to improve the interface and make it more understandable and streamlined: the loads at each step in the menus are always present and inevitably dim the enthusiasm of exploring what the game has to offer in the various items. There are also problems with the management of the view when the targets get close, an inexplicable refusal to make options available during a mission (you necessarily have to go back to the starting screen...) and a technical sector which, while immune from the conspicuous drops in frame rates that characterized Armored Core V, it really has nothing to do with what one would expect from such a title, as everything is far too dirty and the scenarios perfectly match the description of ~wasteland~, with few elements composed of few polygons.", "date": "2013-10-02", "grade": "6.8"}
