In short, there are many users who have so far sought this type of experience, these stories and situations, without however ever being faced with a mobile game actually made under an official license, if we exclude the adventure of Telltale Games which, however, was born on PC and console . +4 Well, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has entrusted Turbine with the task of filling this gap with Game of Thrones: Conquest, a casual simulation that draws on the traditional mechanics of the genre, however, peppering the structure with quotes and characters that fans of the franchise know well. In the role of a new king, our task in the game will be to build an empire and make it prosper, while trying to defend our borders. To introduce us to the experience we will find various references to Game of Thrones, from the musical theme to the images of the various characters, each assigned to a different function. There is only one small problem: the exploitation of the HBO license is limited precisely to this, the simple visual representation of elements of the series and not their deeper use. In a nutshell, the sensation is of simply being faced with one of the many casual simulations available on iOS and Android, with the only difference being a few well-known names and faces. The Lannisters always pay for their microtransactions On the gameplay front, unfortunately, the initial bad sensations are only confirmed, given that the mechanics put in place appear decidedly inflated and not very original, however spoiled by a tutorial system that goes on for a good hour before letting us do it ourselves . The system will instruct us to build farms, woodworks, encampments, training camps and so on, and then to improve these structures. At first the procedure to speed up operations will be free, as often happens, after which to be able to continue it will be necessary to wait minutes and hours, depending on the complexity of the work, or to use hard currency to be able to go quickly. It's not so much a matter of inevitable grinding and microtransactions, aspects that for better or worse characterize the entire range of freemium productions in the mobile sector, but rather the absolutely dull and unconvincing way of reproposing this type of gameplay, as if digital stores don't were already full of games exactly identical to this one, but often made with greater care. To present the heaviest bill in terms of waiting are the fights outside the walls, when you select a target and send your troops to face it, but it is only a detail in the face of a disappointing general approach. Also from a technical point of view, and this is actually surprising, given that the developers of Turbine are not exactly the latest arrivals: zooming in on your kingdom and seeing the castle and buildings devoid of detail as they are made in low resolution does not represent that the final icing on a cake that we would not like to find on our birthday.", "date": "2017-11-03", "grade": "5.0"}
