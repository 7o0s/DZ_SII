In fact, many elements of what is the debut title of Dumpling Design are the classic ones of the genre so popular in recent years on smart devices, a factor that could be particularly repulsive for all those who feel the retching even just touching a game of this type. However, there is an element that could also arouse the attention of this type of audience, namely the background of the two members of the team in question: they are in fact former members of Sumo Digital and Rare, with a curriculum of collaborations on titles such as SEGA All-Stars, Kinect Sports, Viva Piata and many more. As it happens more and more often in the industry, after leaving the big software houses in question, the two have chosen the path of independent development on mobile. Dashy Crashy is an endless runner done right, which even those who are bored with the genre might like Candy Crashy Dashy Crashy is, as we said at the beginning, a car-themed endless runner. The goal is to make as much road as possible before the inevitable crash into one of the many other cars or into the obstacles that you are bound to encounter during the race. The wide carriageway, always straight, is divided into lanes, on which you can pass simply with a swipe of your finger to the right or left. By doing the same action, however, boost and braking are managed upwards or downwards: the latter initially may seem secondary and superfluous options to those who find it sufficient to juggle with the steering, but it doesn't take much to understand how they are actually very useful for avoiding worst situations and come out unscathed. And by ~worst situations~ we mean one of the many unforeseen events that can compromise one's progression, or at least further complicate the already demanding purpose of proceeding slalom between the lanes without hitting anyone. It can be apocalyptic accidents involving dozens of cars, or convoys of trucks as in the worst return with a black dot, or crazed cars chased by the police and so on. There is nothing really surprising or particularly new in Dashy Crashy, but the subtle balances in the dosage of the various elements always seem convincing and well studied, to the point of triggering the inevitable desire to play ~one more game~ to try to break the previous record. Another stimulating factor is the possibility of unlocking one of over sixty vehicles available, divided into classes (from E to S) and capable of ranging from taxis to minivans, from campers to buses, from ice cream vans to snowplows. These are distinguished not only by their appearance, but also by the characteristics of speed, maneuverability and impact resistance, thus allowing them to suffer up to 4 before game over. Even from a technical point of view, the Dumpling Design product convinces, though without surprising: the very colorful and squared design is immediately appreciated, above all for the variety of environments that one finds oneself crossing and which alternate dynamically, just like the day night cycle. The use of emoticons to convey the emotions of one's pilot then appears to be a fun and apt choice. Finally, as regards the freemium element, its presence occurs every five games with an unavoidable 30-second promotional video: a rather boring solution, which can however be solved by purchasing any of the available cars for a price ranging from 0.99 to 2.99. An eventuality to be taken seriously for anyone who appreciates the work of the British team and wants to reward their efforts.", "date": "2016-04-01", "grade": "7.8"}
