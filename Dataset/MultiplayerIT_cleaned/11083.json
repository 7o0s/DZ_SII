{"name": "FIFA 09", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09.html", "text": "Never like this year, the sports division of Electronic Arts has very little to reproach itself: in its version for PS3 and Xbox 360, FIFA 09 has in fact shown extraordinary improvements compared to the previous edition, with truly cutting-edge graphics and support to the unprecedented online game with great potential, which even makes ten-against-ten matches possible without lag problems. Compared to its all-time competitor, Pro Evolution Soccer, FIFA now has to improve in the polygonal models of the players (which in close-up shots generally show little resemblance to their real counterparts) and in the physics of the ball, especially as regards goal shots. These are not marginal elements, but at this point a clear overtaking becomes really possible if the Konami series continues to recycle itself without innovating next year. In the mobile sector, the situation is markedly different: the two competing simulations are still gaining confidence with the new pitch and have to contend with an already established opponent, represented by Gameloft's Real Football. The modes available in FIFA 09 are not very numerous: from the start screen we can opt for a friendly, start an entire season or try our hand at the challenge mode, or with a series of scenarios to be completed successfully, and which often see us straighten out a game that we are losing, perhaps with little time available. The picture is completed by the possibility of practicing training and penalties, while mysteriously missing any cup or tournament. The teams available are all real, including the players (not updated to the very latest stages of the transfer market, however), and come from the Italian Serie A, the ~rest of the world~, the Premier League, Ligue 1, the Bundesliga and the Liga BBVA . The management of formation and strategy are at least cumbersome: in the first case only substitutions are decided, but the game does not show us the position of the changed player on the screen, while the ~strategy~ actually concerns only the change of form. The bench is complete, unlike in PES2009, and as in the other mobile football titles there is no measurement of fatigue. Once in action, FIFA 09 unfortunately shows all its limits: the developers have opted for a different control system compared to the ~tradition~ on mobile phones, in the sense that only the 5 (pass) and 0 (shoot) keys are used, while actions like feinting and sprinting are done via the d-pad. The view, as in PES2009, is from above but not three-quarters, so you can proceed left and right without resorting to diagonals, the passing system depends on the usual indicators on the screen but in this case it also includes through balls depending on the color of the notice. The rush of the players is very unnatural, you can reach the area without too many problems but when it comes to shooting things get complicated: even perfectly in front of the goal, our attacker will be able to shoot the ball out. Scoring therefore becomes a very complicated thing, resulting in episodes of not just frustration... Technically, the new title developed by EA's mobile division is far behind its rivals: the animation of the players leaves much to be desired, they have an unrealistic run compared to the distance covered and the system designed to conquer the ball is in many ways absurd (starts with a tackle from behind without the referee calling the foul, then gets back on track with the ball as if nothing had happened). The ball itself moves implausibly, and through balls rarely really work. The surrounding graphics are poor, there are few animations and, in general, the visual impact is not the best. The sound, then, is to be forgotten. PRO Real teams and players Some modes are interesting Simple control system... AGAINST ...but not very effective Shots on goal are to be forgotten Technically mediocre", "date": "2008-11-05", "grade": "S.V."}
