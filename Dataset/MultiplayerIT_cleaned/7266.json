Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. It seems that Glu wanted to create two parallel series for the Frontline Commando franchise: the first is the one characterized by a modern setting and a greater static nature; the second, which we saw last year with the excellent Frontline Commando: D-Day, instead lets itself be experimented with to increase the variety and dynamism of the action. Where they are well done, it is obvious that users are ready to appreciate both one and the other interpretation, and the release of Frontline Commando 2 seems to clearly clarify the investment that the development team is making on this front . Impossible not to notice the technical evolution of the game, first of all: this new episode boasts quite numerous and very detailed scenarios, equipped with a good degree of interactivity (the shelters can be destroyed, as well as the vehicles), and polygonal models that move in convincingly on screen, reacting differently depending on which part of the body is hit. However, the values put in place by the production do not concern only the graphics, but also central aspects such as gameplay and game structure, as well as the incidence of the freemium model with respect to the enjoyment of the experience. Let's start right here, saying that there are the traditional two currencies and that the precious one is asked of us to recharge the ~special attacks~ available to our team (launching grenades and missiles, attacking drones, restoring vital energy, etc.), as well as to buy certain weapons. In the same way, however, you can play for free without too many problems and without even incurring the limitations of the now inevitable energy bar, which is consumed only during asynchronous PvP sessions and therefore leaves us free to face all the missions in single player that we desire. While not boasting the variety of D-Day, Frontline Commando 2 proves to be a solid and fun shooter Deadly touch The first missions of the Frontline Commando 2 campaign, made up of forty stages to which thirteen elite challenges are added, are completed in a matter of moments and act as a tutorial for the control system, which introduces some innovations compared to the past. In fact, some mechanisms appear more ~elastic~, see for example the management of the sniper rifle, whose viewfinder can be activated both with the appropriate key and with the fire button, provided you barely touch it. In principle, the touch controls remain precise and reactive in any situation, even the most agitated, and therefore allow us to cope with the ability to balance the difficulty that makes the enemies much tougher from a certain point onwards , urging us to use the weapon upgrade system or, better, to buy new ones using the credits obtained in the field. The presence of three ~stars~ for each mission, linked to the achievement of particular objectives, opens the door to a replayability that is not an end in itself and to the inevitable (albeit slight) grinding, the latter necessary to be able to survive the challenges elite, actually much more difficult than the others. As already mentioned, it is possible to play and complete the full-bodied campaign even without spending a euro, and this can only play in favor of the Glu title, which makes up for some small uncertainties in terms of hitbox also thanks to the unprecedented focus on the team. with trivial strategic elements that lead us to divert the attention of the bosses (yes, there are also bosses) to ensure that our companions continue to target them undisturbed. In short, the final result is very enjoyable and marks another center for a franchise that is proving to have very clear what the room for maneuver is for the fixed-screen shooter genre.", "date": "2014-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
