{"name": "NBA 2K13", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109198-nba-2k13-anelli-roventi.html", "text": "As we have repeatedly written in previous articles on the subject, in recent times things have really gone great for 2K Sports and Visual Concepts: their NBA 2K series has in fact sold millions of copies all over the world and has therefore obtained a enormous success from every point of view, so as to obtain unanimous recognition as the best series (amplified by the fact that competition is lacking...) with regard to sports simulations in general, and obviously basketball in particular, by the media industry and by fans of the sport. Yet, despite this, a bit like Konami did in its time with PES and Electronic Arts does today with its FIFA, the prestigious results achieved so far have not scratched much the soul and mind of the developers, who, eager to confirm themselves this season as well, they have spared no efforts to give the public a 2013 edition that is even more complete than the one that preceded it. Let me be clear, do not expect any revolution whatsoever, but scattered improvements aimed at improving the playability which for years has now rested on solid foundations and which therefore needed a few tweaks, and other aspects related to the contents, especially inherent to a couple of mode. Speaking of the latter, NBA 2K13 offers a great variety in this sense as per tradition, even if for reasons of space we will only mention the most important: let's start with the new My Team, a kind of Ultimate Team to play on the net, in which to take advantage of the special credits to build a team made up of current players and legends from scratch, and then gradually accumulate points to buy new packages containing other champions, upgrades, and so on. Then we have the Season, where you can take control of a team and think only of guiding it on the field until the final victory of the tournament, or the Association, once again the beating heart of the production, which this year too is extended to the network in so as to allow users to play, among other things, an entire season online, but with greater freedom of control over the various parameters that regulate both the gameplay and the organization of some of its aspects. My career As usual, in this session the gamer is also called upon to play the role of General Manager, managing a team both from an administrative and technical point of view, organizing its staff of coaches, talent scouts, but also the weekly rhythm of training, renewals , the sales and management of the starting quintet with the personalized creation, if desired, of schemes, strategies and the ~physical~ guide of one's men during the match. The Association mode remains conceptually similar to that of the previous edition, but presents important updates to the system that manages the market, the introduction of the rules relating to the collective agreement stipulated last year after the lockout and the addition of a new feature called Total Control Sim which allows those who do not want to play each of the over 82 seasonal games in first person, to partially influence the simulated ones by manually managing some aspects of their players, so as to be able to ask them directly to perform certain tasks such as such as making multiple attempts to block or block, or making multiple three-point shots. In short, if it weren't for the absence of the D-League, where it was previously possible to send freshmen to gain experience, everything would be practically perfect. Another flagship mode of the entire production has always been the one called My Player / My Career, re-proposed as a couple as in 2012 with Creation of a Legend. Basically, as always, you can decide to create your own basketball alter-ego from scratch by choosing every technical and physical detail, starting from a freshman showcase up to the Draft, and then trying to climb to the top of the NBA championship. Or, alternatively, you can impersonate an athlete already known on the US basketball stage to try to make him the brightest star in the league. The substantial difference between the two options is that with the second you start from better statistical values, as the real player already has his basic skills by himself. In both modes, however, athletes can be assigned up to five personalized special abilities among the thirty-one available, each of which divided by type, levels of effectiveness and price, which integrate perfectly with the usual system of rewards and with the basic attributes. They grant special bonuses to players who have them: for example we have the one called Posterizer whichenhances the athlete's dunking skills, Ankle Breaker, which increases the skill in dribbling and feinting giving a good 10% chance of dropping or tripping the marker or Mano Lesta, which as the name suggests improves the speed in stealing the ball to the opponents. To obtain them you need to spend Skill Points as in role-playing games, obtainable by playing all the modes present in NBA 2K13 without distinction. Xbox 360 goals NBA 2K13 gives gamers 55 goals for a total of 1150 points. Rewards are linked to certain achievements in all modes, both online and offline, such as winning tournaments, making at least 5 blocks and stealing balls with any team in a non-simulated game, scoring 15 or more 3, sign an endorsement deal with Nike or Jordan, or be inducted into the Hall of Fame in both cases in MyCareer mode. One ring to rule them all The deeds performed on and off the field by the athlete also have great importance for the individual growth of the character: his attitudes in fact generate consequences that positively or negatively affect his career thanks to a sort of RPG-style system. This takes into account a series of statistics related, for example, to relationships with sponsors, the team's management, with the latter interacting positively or negatively with the gamer depending on the level of popularity achieved by his virtual alter-ego; then with the press, with teammates and with the public (the number of fans can be increased to the sound of great competitions and media declarations), who thanks to the new Social media function can frequently comment on the performances, and become more vital for the individual growth of the player. But it is as always on the parquet that NBA 2K13 gives its best. Once you take the field, in fact, it is finally possible to enjoy all the most substantial novelties of the title, launching yourself into a challenge to the last basket against the fierce CPU or a friend. Let's say right away that the first impact with the actual game can be ~dramatic~. The controls have increased in number and changed almost completely for some moves compared to previous episodes, and this could cause some problems for both fans of the series and newbies. These modifications mainly concern the shooting for the basket, executable by combining the back button LT with the starboard stick (alternatively there is the front button X in combination with the left-handed bumper), and the management of dribbling and crossovers (expanded in number ) by pressing, moving or rotating the right analog stick again: in this way every gesture is entrusted more than ever to the skill of the gamer to whom initially everything can be a bit unsettling, above all because often you have to press several keys together, but once you get the hang of it, after a few games, you can make truly exceptional plays that give you a thousand satisfactions. For the rest, after just a few passes it becomes clear that logic and variety are the masters during the matches. Thanks to a more advanced artificial intelligence for both the coaches and the athletes managed by the CPU, every action on the pitch takes place in a more meaningful and varied way, with the patterns almost always called up at the right moment and the consequent movements of the players who are more functional to the stage of the tender in progress. In this sense, we would like to underline the greater effectiveness in this edition of Pick & Rolls and offensive blocks in general, easier for the user to evoke thanks to a more functional interface, and useful for the purposes of the action. Ditto when defending: the movements of the athletes in marking or rotation are more logical and two teammates rarely end up blocking each other by mistake, a sign that the algorithms of these phases have been better calibrated this time. The All-Star Weekend DLC The All-Star Weekend is a pack of additional content available as free DLC for those who pre-ordered the game and, while supplies last, for those who enter the barcode (EAN) found on the back of the package at this address. Inside you will find the NBA All-Star Game, Rising Stars Challenge, Three Point Shootout and Dunk Contest modes. NBA All-Star Game is the match between a selection of the best basketball players from the Eastern Conference and those from the Western Conference. The Rising Stars Challenge is the first event of the weekend of the All-Star Game, and is a game that pits the best NBA players in their first two years of career against each other, the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest is a challenge in which participatePlayers have one minute to score as many baskets as possible from distance, while the Slam Dunk Contest is a dunk contest that consists of a series of themed clashes, with gameplay reminiscent of rhythm games in some respects rock band type. Once the player to impersonate has been chosen and the test to be performed from a special menu on the screen has been selected, the race and the athlete start, the video image slows down as in a sort of slow motion until a ~ indicator~ which as in the Harmonix Music Systems title shows a keystroke. These appear falling from above and the gamer is therefore asked to press the relative commands on the pad in time and correctly, thus influencing the quality and correctness of the execution of the action. Physical question Staying on the subject of contacts, in our opinion the new system that manages collisions in the game is excellent, which had already impressed us well during the preview and which is able to give greater realism and consequently greater tactics to the product together with the aforementioned improved CPU intelligence. The feeling you get when playing, even if there are still some small defects in the detection of impacts, is that of a greater physicality of the basketball players whose ability in blocks and blocks are often exalted in the defensive phase, in the offensive phase the ability to free himself for the shot, perhaps with a shoulder, or to break through the defenses by exploiting his own strength up to perhaps an overwhelming dunk. Obviously, the technical specifications of the individual athletes continue to have great importance, many of whom are characterized by unique abilities that allow them to distinguish themselves from each other and perhaps to have a greater impact on the match. To embellish a product rich in contents there are also the historical teams such as the American Dream Team of Barcelona 1992 with the various Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley, and the ~special~ teams with the American Olympic national selection of London 2012 , the NBA Today, accessible directly from the main menu to always have the real season of the current season at hand, with the real roosters and official formations provided you are permanently connected to the internet and, as regards the Xbox version 360, support for Kinect, a device through which users can give voice commands to their team, such as calling for substitutions, tactical fouls, lineup changes and much more. A function in our opinion both fun and useful, especially considering the fact that our language is also supported. We close by mentioning online matches and taking a look at the technical aspect of the product: in the first case it must be said that we did not have any particular lag or connection problems during our tests. However, as often happens when titles are tested before their release on the market, one must take into account the fact that the servers were practically empty and consequently it is not possible for us to express absolute certainties in this regard. As regards the second aspect to be analysed, from that point of view NBA 2K13 is an excellent game, with more than convincing models as regards the athletes, mostly practically identical to their respective real counterparts in every smallest detail, beautiful animations featuring from a new set of movements that makes everything visually more harmonious, and a certain ability to keep the general quality always at the same level, to the point of allowing anyone who looks at it to leave behind the polygon count or some perhaps less performing textures of the average. Each stadium is perfectly characterized and different from the previous one, even the sneakers of the athletes featured in the game are reproduced with maniacal care, and the atmosphere surrounding the match event is something spectacular, thanks also to the television imprint given to the product in terms of camera movements and overlays with information and statistics that appear on the screen, identical to that of a real NBA television production. Jay-Z's hand can be seen in these situations in the pre-match intros that show music video footage with game sequences in a perfect audio-visual mix that helps increase the hype before the match. All this is further enhanced by an audio sector of excellent workmanship and which can count on sound effects, music, announcements and various slogans sampled directly from the various American arenas, as well as the motivating commentary in English and a soundtrack mainly characterized by", "date": "2012-10-04", "grade": "9.4"}
