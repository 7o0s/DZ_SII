{"name": "Midtown Madness 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midtown-madness-3_a.html", "text": "Don't follow the arrows don't be a child! There are four game modes: Bliz, Checkpoint, Giro and Under Cover. The latter is the main mode and, following a simple and absolutely ironic storyline, you'll have to carry out different missions as a police infiltrator. The jobs that you can carry out are the most varied: from a boy who delivers the goods, to a taxi driver, to a limousine driver passing through a secret agent and a pizza delivery man. The missions are divided into four sub-stages which, once completed, will allow you to unlock new jobs to do and new cars to drive. There are in total more than fifty divided missions divided into fourteen careers. To underline the attention to detail placed in this title, it is fair to say that the whole story is enriched by nice dialogues entirely dubbed in Italian. In Giro mode you can easily travel around the city, free to choose the time of day, the traffic on the street and the number of passers-by crowding the sidewalk. If we want to give him some panache it is then possible to insert some police patrols who will do everything to hunt you down. By scouring the city you will also be able to discover various bonuses that will make the Microsoft title even longer. The Checkpoint mode offers challenges against some opponents, the winner is whoever crosses all the established checkpoints first. In the case of Bliz, however, you will be faced with the classic mode of fighting against the clock, enriched by a variant: depending on the means you choose, the records to beat will also vary. Speaking of cars, it is fair to point out that there are more than thirty of them and that each one has its own particular driving style: from the heavy and slow garbage truck to the very light and super-handy Fle, to go on to fast cars like the Audi S4 and the Mini Cooper or real racing cars a la Fast and Furious like the Viper SRT-10 and the Lotus Esprit. The driving model is really good, obviously arcade at the highest level. After five minutes you will already be able to literally ~fly~ on the asphalt. High tech Digital Illusion did a really good job. The two metropolises are beautifully recreated and, above all, alive and pulsating, populated by passers-by with shopping bags and punks walking around with the radio on their backs, all ready to get out of their way as you pass so as not to get hurt. The cars that fill the streets are moved by a good artificial intelligence and the AI of the opponents that we will meet in the Undercover mode deserves a special mention. Collision management is very good and everything we meet on our way can be destroyed, cars and light poles in the first place. Following these clashes, obviously, our vehicle will also be damaged in an ~almost realistic~ way. The frame rate does not reach 60 frames per second, but remains constant, never giving signs of crisis even in the most crowded situations. Frame drops are felt instead in split-screen mode and in a single case when playing online on Xbox Live, or when a new user enters the competition. So everything okay? Well not really, aliasing is present in a rather evident way, some buildings are a little too ~square~ and some of the textures of the same are a little subdued, sometimes making the image of a building not exactly realistic. The lighting effects are kept to a minimum, while the different atmospheric conditions are well recreated and managed by the game engine. However, these defects, considering that it is a title that must be experienced at the speed of light, are not very evident while playing. I don't know if I love more the chocolate with cream or your driving style they are delicious The heart of the review can only belong to the Xbox Live mode. In fact, MM3 is a title created and designed specifically to take full advantage of the online capabilities of the Microsoft console. Live is 100% supported and allows both to download new content and to challenge other human opponents in races to the last tire on the network. The main modes Checkpoint and Giro are also playable online, plus there are four more: Gold Hunt, Pursuit, Hunter and The Great Escape. In Gold Hunt you will have to collect the gold scattered in the city and bring it to the base as quickly as possible. Of course, whoever collects the most wins. In the second mode, however, you will have to try not to remain ~chasers~ at the end of the maximum time,touching the other contestants and thus passing them status leading to defeat. Playing Hunter you will go back to being a child, thanks to a revised and corrected version of ~cops and robbers~. At the start of the race, someone starts as a hunter and then, bumping into other competitors, turns them into his followers until he catches the last one or time runs out. The Great Escape mode is perhaps the most fun and exciting. A driver has a rabbit (sic!) and the more he keeps it the more points he gets. The others chase him and, even here, if they bump into him, they take him away. The network game works very well and has no lag. Eight of you can play at the same time and fun is guaranteed. Like all new games for the Microsoft console that support Live, even in MM3 we will be able to stay connected to the network and therefore be online for our friends even when we play alone, so as to be able to receive invitations in real time. The only small problem, in addition to the drop in frames I mentioned earlier, is the lack of possibility to search for Italian lobbies. Searches can be made by type of game, by difficulty, but not by language, making it more difficult to find our compatriots on the net. Finally, a few words on the audio sector. The soundtrack is not particularly apt and is at times too monotonous. However, it is possible to remedy this deficiency by using your own MP3s ripped onto a hard disk. The sound effects, on the other hand, are good and convincing. Conclusions The third installment of the Midtown Madness series is particularly well done and very funny, and the small defects that afflict it do not affect the quality of the latest Digital Illusions that much. Played exclusively offline, it loses a bit of bite and risks becoming repetitive in a short time (take away a good point from our review), but if you are avid online gamer on Xbox Live you cannot miss a title that will make you spend the wee hours in front of the screen. Pros: Very fast and frantic at the right point Paris and Washington excellently recreated Infinite and very satisfying if played online Cons: Graphically more could be done In the long run a bit monotonous if played in single player Disappointing soundtrack The latest product from Microsoft Game Studios is the frantic and irresistible Midtown Madness 3, thanks to which you will be catapulted into a city as lively as ever, at your choice between Paris and Washington, and you will dart through the crowds and traffic aboard a roaring car, in search of the last checkpoint. Midtown Madness 3 (henceforth MM3), it should be clarified immediately, is an absolutely arcade title. If you are looking for realism and simulation at all costs then it is better that you go elsewhere. The Digital Illusions title is the furthest away from simulation there is: frantic, fast and fun, damned fun. You must imagine yourself on board a car traveling at full speed with you pressing the accelerator to the floor and with one hand always ready on the handbrake to be able to enter the alleys without slowing down. Everything you hit will be destroyed and going around the two cities it is impossible not to recognize the monuments and places that made them famous. Be careful, though, because you won't have much time to admire the landscape. The spirit of MM3 is precisely this: always new speeds and trajectories, even the most unthinkable. You will leap off the rooftops of buildings or descend into the depths of the subway at your choice. Yes, because all the itineraries provided by your navigator are only possibilities and it is not even said that they are the best: it will be up to you to choose the fastest route to reach your goal.", "date": "2003-06-28", "grade": null}
