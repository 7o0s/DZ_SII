{"name": "Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/barrow-hill-curse-of-the-ancient-circle-recensione.html", "text": "Deep storyline, balanced puzzles and archaeology? What differentiates Barrow Hill from the rest of the productions is the possibility of exploiting a whole series of tools typical of archaeological studies and research, or rather should have thought about it. In reality, the only elements that are really pertinent to this peculiar activity are a metal detector, essential for probing the subsoil in search of metal objects, and a small drill. The use of both, then, will not often be necessary, relegating the good intentions of the developers to a rather marginal role. Having reported this flaw, it is necessary to highlight a whole series of features of undoubted value. The plot is complex and manages to glue to the monitor until the end of the adventure, without suffering declines and with only the ending leaving a bad taste in the mouth. The game interface is streamlined and free of bulky icons, while the mouse arrow will take on a different appearance when pointed at an object of particular interest, allowing you to grab it, use it or zoom in on it. The inventory, in addition to containing the artifacts collected from time to time, has some useful tools, such as a cell phone, which however are almost never fundamental for gameplay purposes, ending up being only useful for the development of the narrative plot, through some cutscenes . Conrad Morse's movements are performed with the arrow keys on the keyboard, a convenient choice and capable of simultaneously guaranteeing the selection of an object on the seabed and the movements. For the puzzles it was decided to adopt a system capable of rewarding attention and the study of clues, rather than imagination and creativity; therefore, the bizarre and brilliant puzzles seen in sagas such as those of Discworld or Monkey Island should be forgotten. A careful reading of the documents and the constant reminder of what has been previously learned leads to the quick and satisfying resolution of each question. The evaluation of this setting is inevitably personal, but it certainly helps less experienced players, proving to be spot on overall. The not very high number of settings has forced the inclusion of many events in each of them, forcing exhausting back tracking sessions, which often end up disorienting and above all boring the user, forced to visit once again that place already seen and inspected. Longevity is sufficient, thanks to the 7-8 hours needed to complete the game. Unfortunately there are no multiple endings or other incentives aimed at increasing replayability, a defect that is eternally present in graphic adventures. Cheap fear Technically Barrow Hill comes with rather good rendered backdrops, which thanks to the very low real-time workload, can be displayed perfectly even on relatively dated computers. The design of each individual environment has been specifically designed to create a strong feeling of claustrophobia and anguish in the player, without however showing scenes of excessive violence or cruelty. Part of the excellent atmosphere created loses its tone due to some imperfections of the gameplay, above all, as mentioned, the need to retrace your steps several times. The NVIDIA 7900 and the gigabyte of RAM mounted on the computer used to test the game, have allowed for extremely short loading times, which we do not feel able to guarantee to those who meet or slightly exceed the recommended requirements. The sound suffers from enormous flaws: even if we want to overlook the limited amount of effects and music, the evaluation is significantly lowered by a well below average, annoying and repetitive dubbing. System requirements Microsoft Windows 98/SE/ME/2000/XP Pentium III 450MHz processor or higher 128 MB RAM (512 MB with Windows XP) SVGA or higher 32-bit color graphics card DirectX 9 compatible sound card Conclusions Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle is a graphic adventure from the past, which fails to develop the, however good, idea of giving the player the typical tools of archaeological studies in a sufficiently profound way. In any case, the plot remains absolutely enjoyable, just as the intentions of creating a high-voltage experience are not disappointed, constantly on the verge of taking an unexpected and frightening turn. Recommended for lovers of a genre that is always on the verge of disappearing but capable of returning every time, who can untangle themselves between puzzles and puzzles that are all in all well done. Pros Beautiful story Decent graphics Difficulty of the puzzles well calibrated Cons Almost no innovations Archeology is a topic only touched upon Sound to forget After Secret File: Tunguska, another graphic adventure comes to oursscreens bringing with them a massive dose of esotericism. It is Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle, which will transport the player to the gloomy forests of Normandy, where some workers have disappeared near a circle of Menhirs. In the role of archaeologist Conrad Morse, it will be necessary to thoroughly investigate the mystery, possibly unraveling it and taking the skin home. Not without taking risks, the narration was entirely centered on the figure of the virtual alter ego, minimizing the presence of other characters, a couple in total, in such a way as to enhance the anguish and feeling of loneliness produced. The gameplay is that of the classic ~point and click~ adventures, where it is therefore only necessary to interact with the environments present in search of clues and useful objects, solving the proposed puzzles and advancing in the plot. The latter progresses in a rather dynamic way: that is, it does not oblige to unravel the individual situations in a certain order, but leaves freedom of action and allows, for example, to set aside a particularly complex puzzle momentarily and then return to it later, after having explored other areas.", "date": "2006-12-18", "grade": null}
