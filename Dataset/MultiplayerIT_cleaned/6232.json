In reality, everything is compromised when you discover that the various animals are actually packed with explosives and ready to blow themselves up to kill the aliens who have started invading the zoo. One day you're sitting there quietly in your cage throwing dung at other monkeys like you, and the next you blow yourself up to destroy a wall. The quirks of life. Razor Sharp Studios is not new to absurdities and after Frobisher Says and the more evocative Hohokum, it returns with an over the top puzzle game that is rather banal in its playful setting, putting the explosive inhabitants of the zoo and their unorthodox defensive strategies at the center of the story . Super Exploding Zoo provides explosive animals to prevent an alien invasion Playstation 4 trophies Super Explooding Zoo offers nineteen trophies linked in part to the resolution of the levels and in part to the collectibles scattered around the game map. To obtain the four bronze, six silver, eight gold and platinum trophies, it will be necessary to complete all sixty levels and perform specific actions related to each animal's abilities. Kaboom baby! Within each scheme we will find ourselves facing one or more aliens who are heading independently and relentlessly towards the precious egg; the only way to stop them is to send all the animals we manage to recover within the level into kamikaze mode in order to destroy them and protect the loot. The mechanics are quite simple: at the beginning of the stage we find ourselves in control of a single animal that we have to carry around the map to wake up his companions, in order to set up a nice handful of dangerous explosives, just enough to kill the hostile attackers who are inexorably aiming for their prey. There are no attacks, combos or anything else: just have a good number of beasts and throw them all together at the target. In this sense it is of fundamental importance not to run out of ammunition-animals because this would inevitably decree the end of hostilities and the victory of the invaders. In the face of a tutorial setting, the first ten levels run smoothly without too many hitches, so much so that Super Exploding Zoo seems too easy, almost childish, but once the following ones have been unlocked, the situation becomes difficult. The puzzle game turns into a sort of continuous trial and error in which to implement different strategies each time, to be able to understand which will be the most effective for solving each specific pattern. The strategic depth is in fact given by the skills of each animal that must be used in the right place and at the right time to avoid us being left without creatures under our control. As mentioned, at least one animal must always be controlled, but to be effective, especially in the more advanced levels where the aliens appear in groups of six or more specimens, it is necessary to recruit a good number of nice kamikazes, all placidly located around the map doze off. The penguins together with the dodos and donkeys are simple cannon fodder, to be sent to be slaughtered to destroy walls and obstacles in order to free other animals from their cages. Crocodiles and turtles, on the other hand, are essential for overcoming streams, while monkeys can scale walls and lions slow down enemies with their powerful roar. Using everyone's peculiarity to increase your army is the key to continuing along successive levels, with an eye always focused on the sidebar that indicates the approach of the aliens to their goal. The design of the sixty levels is quite varied, but Super Exploding Zoo leaves the side uncovered on some aspects that compromise the final evaluation. First of all, despite the errors and the numerous game overs, we finished the game in less than four hours, with the various unlockables that fail to add longevity to a title that, after making you rack your brain, has nothing left to offer. Secondly, the difficulty too often leads to frustration, especially when a large handful of different animals are moving and it is not possible to select the ones we need. For example, if we have to climb a wall but in addition to monkeys we control penguins and crocodiles, we find ourselves wasting precious time without being able to immediately give the desired order. In the same way, the explosion of the animals takes place automatically by proximity and it can happen that you find yourself, especially in the initial stages when you control a fewthe animals, to blow them up by mistake sacrificing fundamental skills for the implementation of the final strategy.", "date": "2015-07-02", "grade": "6.5"}
