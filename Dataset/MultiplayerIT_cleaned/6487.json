Again we have two versions, Flame and Thunder, but the differences are limited to a handful of exclusive characters, events and items. For fans of Inazuma Eleven it is certainly not new: the series has been anchored to some axiomatic characteristics for several iterations, and in this sense Chrono Stones is yet another proof of the evolutionary path that the franchise has gone through over the years. The game is basically always the same, but the Japanese developer has implemented the usual new mechanics to revive the gameplay a bit. Will they be enough to capture the attention of those who haven't yet missed a game of Mark, Arion and co? In the new Inazuma Eleven Go you play football and travel through time: will it be enough to revive the series? Great Jupiter! For those unfamiliar with Inazuma Eleven, or who have missed our reviews of previous episodes of the series, it is worth repeating that it is essentially the spiritual heir of Captain Tsubasa, the hugely popular comic and cartoon that the more seasoned will know with Italian title Holly & Benji. Level-5, however, takes the spirit of Yichi Takahashi's work to an extreme, conceiving a world where football is a real philosophy of life, as well as the most played sport ever. The story mostly follows the events of the Raimon school football team, and the misadventures of two generations of football players: in the most recent Go series the protagonist is Arion Sherwind, a stubborn young man who has an unconditional love for football since a ball she saved his life when he was little. The new chapter of his trilogy, Chrono Stones, begins with a stunning twist only a few months after the end of the previous one and the conclusion of the Imperial Way tournament: Arion arrives at Raimon and discovers that the football team never existed . Being so attached to football, in fact, Arion is the only one who remembers history as it was before the criminal organization of the future called El Dorado changed it by traveling back in time to change the space-time continuum. Well yes, accompanied by some allies from the future Arion will have to travel through time to put things right, free the most important footballers from the control of El Dorado and save the world. By now we should be used to the narrative extravagances of Inazuma Eleven, between aliens who challenge our planet in football and shady figures who want to conquer power with balls, but the story of Chrono Stones is really ~over the top~, even taking us to distant eras to play football alongside mythical figures such as Joan of Arc and Nobunaga Oda. If on the one hand we feel like rewarding the absurd inventiveness of the screenwriters, on the other we are forced to note the usual problems in the dialogues - despite the excellent Italian adaptation - which end up affecting the pace and smoothness of the plot. Compared to the previous episodes, however, Level-5 has pressed the hand a little more on the cutscenes and on the details of the characters and settings: the cel shading of Chrono Stones does not disappoint and, indeed, is even closer to the cartoon that many fans of Inazuma Eleven will surely have known even before the games. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect as usual adds little or nothing in terms of gameplay, but spectacularizes the action and, obviously, the more dynamic and pyrotechnic special shots, given that the ball is often kicked towards the camera with an effective illusion of depth . The footballers of the zodiac In terms of raw gameplay, Inazuma Eleven Go: Chrono Stones is a real copy / paste of the previous episode, which in turn was from the trilogy for Nintendo DS. Level-5 has never wanted to overturn the proven game system, while implementing new mechanics at each iteration in order to make it more complex, deep and satisfying. The same also happens with Chrono Stones, but if the exaggerated richness of the plot in this case amused us, we must admit that we frowned several times at the succession of new powers and abilities that have strangely ended up making the clashes excessively heavy . Inazuma Eleven Go: Chrono Stones, we recall, is a Japanese RPG in which the player explores the various settings and faces enemies on improvised soccer fields. The upper screen reproduces the kinematics of the interactions between the players, while on the lower one we can controllarli with your finger or with the stylus, in a kind of combat a bit turn-based and a bit in real time where you try to score goals by passing the ball from one character to another and choosing the appropriate moves and counter-moves every time you you cross an opponent. The first games may seem a bit flat but still fast enough, then the various additional mechanics, special techniques and super powers of some characters begin to take over, including fireballs, evocations of ancestral spirits and absolutely amazing stunts. Even if at the beginning each game is more spectacular than the previous one, in the long run the skits tire, especially when facing the mandatory games that the plot frequently interrupts with dialogues. Furthermore, at a certain point, the novelties of Chrono Stones in terms of gameplay are also unlocked, namely the Armor and the Miximax. The former are an evolution of the Fighting Spirits concept introduced in the previous Inazuma Eleven Go: once their Fighting Spirit is summoned, the characters can ~wear~ it as a kind of energy armor that temporarily increases their stats and the power of their blows special. The Miximax, on the other hand, allows you to merge the auras of two characters, giving life to a temporary hybrid in both visual and statistical terms. The two new game systems will delight RPG enthusiasts who love to customize their teams, but we also had the impression that Level-5 has put too much meat on the fire, weighing down battles/games that for them by nature they should be much faster and hectic.", "date": "2015-03-17", "grade": "7.8"}
