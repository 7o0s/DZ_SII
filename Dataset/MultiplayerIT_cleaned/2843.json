{"name": "DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doom-eternal-the-ancient-gods-part-1-recensione.html", "text": "We faced the review of DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 1 with a frenzy very similar to that which characterizes the gameplay of the id Software shooter, completing the base game in very few sessions (the backlog was starting to feel really tight) and then diving into this awaited expansion without even refusing to breath. Available in the form of DLC for owners of DOOM Eternal but also in a stand-alone version, in both cases at a price of 19.99 euros, the first part of The Ancient Gods recounts the events which take place after the conclusion of the last chapter of the series, with the immortal warrior who has just saved his world but does not want to end his crusade and therefore sets himself the goal of reaching the heart of the infernal kingdom and eradicating it once for all. Gameplay: a great challenge On the gameplay front, DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 1 does not introduce relevant innovations compared to the experience of the base game: the protagonist performs the same maneuvers and does not receive new weapons, rather he must give up the Crucible. However, the degree of challenge changes: right from the start, the expansion acts as an exercise in skill, and the difference is very clear. Even if you have a fully upgraded character, in fact, at the intermediate difficulty level, you get a certain struggles to survive the inevitable gatherings of enemies, never so numerous and difficult. Setting aside the sense of progression of the original campaign, in which the most powerful opponents were introduced one at a time, the game throws us against everything it has, without asking any problems, and truly memorable but at the same time potentially frustrating sequences are born. Thus, although we had been largely forged by the final stages of DOOM Eternal, where literally everything happens, to meet the tight processing times we found ourselves on some occasions having to select a lower degree of challenge, completing the expansion in six hour ride and expecting a cliffhanger at the end which arrived on time. After all, the package is not called ~Part 1~ by chance. If there is no news in terms of weapons and powers, some noteworthy additions stand out on the enemy front. For example, the Summoner from the 2016 episode returns, with some differences regarding the functioning of her powers and the way in which we can eliminate her, in perfect Ghostbusters style. Also appearing ~intelligent~ turrets, disappearing, to be destroyed with rapid precision shots, as well as ghostly demons that become tangible only after having unloaded a hail of bullets on us. And then, of course, there are some challenging boss fights. Structure We talked about the duration of The Ancient Gods - Part 1, but how robust is the structure of this first DOOM Eternal expansion? If in the basic campaign it was possible to explore a dozen different scenarios, in this case there are three settings. We start from the UAC Atlantic Structure, a huge platform on the ocean that shows off the now classic ~metallic~ style without almost ever closing ourselves in narrow corridors and indeed preferring large spaces, to be filled invariably with enemies. Then we have the Marshes of the Blood, a rather disturbing place in which a further element of difficulty is added, represented by the mist that envelops certain areas and prevents a clear view even of the opponents, prompting us to dance a little blindly while distributing bullets left and right. And finally La Selva, probably the most original scenario from a stylistic point of view, in some ways similar to some locations in Shadow Warrior 2: a forest with peculiar colors, full of simple puzzles to solve: trees to cut down to create bridges or switches to press to then launch into the now traditional sequence of jumps and climbs. Technical realization Talking about the technical realization of The Ancient Gods - Part 1 without mentioning that of DOOM Eternal is obviously impossible, given that the product is basically the same. There are, as mentioned, new settings that are also very suggestive and an additional attention to the narration, with two or three significant cutscenes (a little soiled by a discreet but far from sensational dubbing in Italian) that try to carry on the history of the DOOM Slayer and the complicated lore that surrounds it. In terms of performance we are certainly facing one of the best optimized titles on PC, it is no coincidence that with an outdated configuration we were able to play at dynamic 4K and 60 fps with all the effects set to maximum, not noticing excessive reductions in resolution and onlya couple of uncertainties during some pre-calculated sequences. In short, for speed and fluidity, the id Software title remains a point of reference and this is reaffirmed with this expansion.", "date": "2020-10-21", "grade": "8.3"}
