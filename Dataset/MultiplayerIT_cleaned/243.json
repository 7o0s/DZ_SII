{"name": "SpyHunter: Nowhere to Run", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spyhunter-nowhere-to-run-2.html", "text": "The Rock and his little toy... After four episodes, the pilot of the Interceptor (the Spy Hunter car) has finally acquired a real identity: he is an agent named Alex Decker of the secret services, who will have to stop a ruthless criminal organization, Ours, which he aims to take possession of the Interceptor to use it in shady deals. The plot is rather trivial and devoid of noteworthy twists, it simply surrounds the gameplay, without delving into the characters well, characterized only the bare minimum to seem interesting. Spy Hunter therefore, from pure arcade, has undergone a radical transformation, becoming a hybrid arcade-shooter/third-person-shooter. The playable section is made up of two distinct parts (even if in some missions they are connected to each other): the frenetic and adrenaline-pumping section with the Interceptor, which has remained almost unchanged in terms of structure compared to the other episodes, and the new walking section in which Alex Decker will have to contend with the villains of Nostra. Let's start by talking about the latter, which is ultimately the real novelty of the game, and which unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Alex Decker will be able to take advantage of a standard war arsenal, in which we find some types of rifles and pistols, an inevitable rocket launcher, and close combat weapons (pipes and wooden clubs). In case we don't want to waste bullets, we will be able to take advantage of the mighty physical strength of Alex Decker to beat up our opponents: basically there are two simple attacks that can be linked together (one strong and one weak), and a grip command, which allows you to carry out four types of wrestling moves with which to break the backs of the criminals of Nostra. Everything turns out to be fun in the first moments, but after a few minutes all the problems and defects come to the surface, almost completely covering what is interesting in the game. Spy Hunter, despite having good ideas (even if not very original), is full of problems, and what immediately catches the eye are the woodiness of Decker's movements and the cumbersomeness of the control system, which translate into an experience of game far from pleasant; The third-person aiming system, as well as most of Decker's movements, are not the most accurate, and tend to easily lead to frustration that is limited only by the very low level of difficulty. The level design is linear and not very articulated, there are no particularly compelling game situations that keep the interest alive, the opponents' AI is poor, the difficulty is unbalanced ... In short, we are faced with a flood of defects which, combined to the fact that the only strategy to adopt (apart from rare cases) is to jump headlong into the rooms and shoot/beat madly without a minimum of stealth component, make this game flat and boring; moreover, the dull and short cinematics that occasionally break the rhythm of the game certainly do not help to revive the adventure. Leaving aside the (bad) news, let's go back to what is the true essence of Spy Hunter, or the guide of the Interceptor. This part of the game, for those unfamiliar with the old chapters, is simply an arcade section in which, driving a convertible car, all you have to do is follow a pre-established path and shoot left and right to knock down the enemies that you present in front. The interceptor can transform into three vehicles, a four-wheeled custom-built one, a super-technological motorboat, and an agile motorcycle: the transformation will depend on the type of path we will face, and each of the transformations will have weapons suitable for the situation to be managed, such as example machine guns, oil, water mines, homing missiles, and more. This phase of the game is definitely more immediate and fun than the on foot one, the vehicle has a very arcade response feeling (even if the viewfinder isn't very fluid) and it's pleasant to control, even unloading your arsenal against the opposing cars is quite fulfilling. The only flaws essentially concern the level design, which could have been more articulated, and the level of difficulty, which is always too low, in fact a few more enemies on the screen to make everything more frenetic certainly wouldn't have hurt. The umpteenth sore point of Spy Hunter is its longevity: a very few hours will be enough to complete the main adventure (about ten missions), and the desire to play it for the second time will hardly come ... all that will remain to be done will be just try a few bonus missions and then put it back on the shelf. Graphics and sound As well as the playability, the technical aspect also leaves much to be desired, and Spy Hunter certainly cannot competeand with the best PS2 productions of the latter period. The graphic quality, despite having undergone slight improvements compared to that of the progenitors, still remains of a medium/low level... only The Rock's model, which at least resembles the original, and the vehicle models should be considered sufficient. In the walking stages the polygons of the characters are a bit ~edgy~ due to the low resolution, the textures lack detail, the animations are woody, the levels are sparse, the lighting effects of the explosions are not very realistic, and there are inaccuracies here and the with regard to collisions. Behind the wheel of the Interceptor, things don't change much, and we find the same problems that afflict the other section of the game, i.e. poor quality textures and polygons, meager and poorly detailed backdrops and somewhat approximate collisions. To close this negative picture there are the FMV movies, which having been made with the low-resolution graphics used in the game, suffer from a bad video quality, exaggeratedly pixelated and blurry. The sound is perhaps what has succeeded best. The sound effects are above average, with fairly realistic explosions and gunfire; the voices (completely re-dubbed in Italian) are not bad, even if more could have been done in terms of expressiveness; the soundtrack is also well done, and although it does not stand out for its originality, it manages to convey the atmosphere very well in the various game situations. Spyhunter is a game that doesn't pretend to be too demanding, instead aiming for the simplicity and immediacy that only arcade games can offer. Unfortunately the result is low profile, a below average title both from a technical point of view and from that of playability ... and even if in an arcade-style game the visual aspect can easily take a back seat, the playability instead no. The advice is therefore to aim for something else, even for those who loved the previous two episodes, as they could be quite disappointed. Pros: Immersive Interceptor levels Action movie sound effects Cons: Below average graphics quality Low profile on-foot gameplay Cumbersome control system In the early 80s, Midway created a splendid arcade driving game that was destined to become a real classic over the yearsits name was Spy Hunter. A little less than twenty years after its release, i.e. in 2001, Midway decided to resurrect this cult and adapt it to the new generation consoles, transforming Spy Hunter into a 3D driving shooter which, while not equaling its ancestor, still managed to be exciting. To spoil everything, Spy Hunter 2 made its appearance, a flat and soulless game that, not offering the winning features of the prequel, ended up inexorably forgotten. Spy Hunter Nowhere To Run is the fifth chapter of the series (there is also Super Spy Hunter, released in '91 for the NES), or the third if we only consider the new generation ones, and with it Midway wanted to push the maximum this franchise by hiring a very famous character like Dwayne ~The Rock~ Johnson, who will not only impersonate Alex Decker in the video game, but will also be the protagonist of the film of the same name which will be released next year in cinemas. The news does not end here, Midway has in fact decided to modify the Spy Hunter format by adding third person shooter-style missions on foot, in order to enrich the gameplay; but even if the idea may be excellent, unfortunately the realization is not... and the mistake repeats itself for the second time.", "date": "2006-12-01", "grade": null}
