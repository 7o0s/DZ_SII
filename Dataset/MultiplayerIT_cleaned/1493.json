{"name": "Chaos Legion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chaos-legion-3.html", "text": "Sieg, Victor and the Legions The world is in danger. The mad Victor Delacroix is intent on recovering three artifacts capable of uniting the world of spirits with the material one, and it's not a good thing. The reason? Bring back to life his beloved, killed by the protagonist of this game, Sieg Warheit that is ... you. Why did Sieg kill his ex-friend Delacroix's girlfriend? We are not given to know it for at least half the game, but we certainly know why Sieg was sent to track down Victor and stop him: Sieg is able to summon the Legions, spirits able to surround him, defend him and support him in battle against monsters that Victor has scattered around him. The plot of Chaos Legion, despite an intriguing incipit and a modest development, unfortunately suffers from the banality of the main characters, not too well characterized and not very detailed; moreover, she proves rather confusing for at least half of the game, when (more or less with the introduction of the second playable character, the gunslinger Arcia) she finally gets into gear. However, the narrative plot is only a pretext for a game whose concept is concentrated in a single word: demolition. From this point of view Chaos Legion could be likened to an ~ignorant~ game like Devil May Cry, where the playful experience is limited 90% of the time to the frantic pressing of the keys aimed at destroying any hostile unit that moves on the screen . Instead, Chaos Legion presents a more strategic and reasoned game system, at least between one stage and another: in fact, Sieg, in addition to attacking with his sword, can summon the Legions. For some strange reason during the first stages you are supported by Thanatos, the most powerful of the existing legions, which however is immediately destroyed and scattered throughout the game levels (the player can later recover its fragments to be able to recall it); at that point, Sieg will have to recover the other Legions, which in practice will be ~provided~ by the game at specific moments (for example, after defeating a boss). Once a Legion is equipped (for a maximum of two at the same time), Sieg will be able to summon it and get help from it during battles, directing it against targets or using it as a shield: the Legions' energy is provided by the destruction of enemies , which also involves the acquisition of experience points to be distributed, between one stage and another, to increase the capabilities of Sieg or the power of its Legions. At this point the game meshes: in fact, generally in the initial stages we find ourselves beating all the enemies like damned, without understanding, at moments, what is happening and relating only to our own weapon and to the Legions; however, after having begun to acquire new combat or movement techniques (such as the now ubiquitous double jump) the structure appears decidedly more open to the eyes of the user who obtains the freedom to customize, a bit as he wishes, his own Legions and their abilities which, in turn, affect Sieg's abilities. However, the interesting mechanics is combined with a linearity of the stages (and not of the progression, given that it is possible to revisit them to acquire previously inaccessible items) that is a little too evident, which sometimes leads to monotony, when you find yourself proceeding along pre-established patterns destroying everything between Sieg and the exit. Legion May Cry Chaos Legion, as we said, looks like an offshoot of Devil May Cry but is actually played very differently. However, the similarities extend above all to the purely aesthetic side, which enjoys and suffers from an excessive similarity to the previous Capcom hit at the same time. This similarity is not limited only to the settings, gothic and with vaguely Italian architectural characteristics, but also to the polygonal models of enemies and, above all, the main characters, which recall the animations already seen in Devil May Cry. In this case, Sieg moves and fights exactly as Dante did with his sword, while Arcia is the female version of the oxygenated demon hunter with guns in hand: take away Dante's bully charisma from the two characters and you will have had a precise idea of their realization, which shows a pleasant and interesting character design as distinctive signs. These well-constructed and textured three-dimensional models move in scenarios that leave us quite perplexed: on the one hand, in their linearity they are graphically very well structured and offer a very convincing sensation of decadence and isolation; on the other, there is a continuous deja-vue in the re-propositionof the same textures for 80% of the stages, except for the final ones and for the wooded level of Arcia. On the other hand, the cutscenes are very beautiful, combining an excellent production with an original and disturbing montage. As far as the sound aspect is concerned, we are faced with a good quality composition, with the small detail that the most suitable choral and gothic music is limited to a few playful or narrative sequences, while for the rest, especially during the fights, in the background there are rocking themes with a good rhythm but not too suitable for the atmosphere of the game itself. Comment Chaos Legion is a good game, let's be clear, but it is one of those titles that should necessarily be tried before a possible purchase, if it weren't for the fact that the potential of the product begins to be perceived only after having purchased the first Legions and their skills. In short, it is not a kind of product that can be understood immediately, and yet it does not offer a noteworthy length of experience either (the game can be completed without problems in eight to ten hours). The overall technical realization is good but not shocking, but it follows the first Devil May Cry too much. There are few secrets or incentives to replay it: Thanatos can be reassembled from the first game session and Arcia, the second playable character who can be used in each level after finishing the game, being devoid of Legions, does not arouse any interest. Ultimately, Chaos Legion is an action-game that Dante fans and lovers of the genre will certainly like, an excellent starting point, on a conceptual level, for future productions which, perhaps, in addition to smashing the keys, will offer something more with which to amuse the user. Pros Great basic concept Stylish in the right place Lots of skills to learn Cons Too similar to Devil May Cry Too linear Too short Two years ago Capcom launched a three-dimensional action-game for PlayStation 2 which, initially mistaken for a sort of Bio Hazard, turned out to be completely different and made converts: we are obviously talking about Devil May Cry. Superb especially in the attention paid to detail and in the general ~stylishness~ that pervaded Dante, his enemies and the settings in which fire was breathed and slashed, Devil May Cry immediately made school. A few months ago, Capcom also released a disappointing sequel, which despite the 2 DVDs and good intentions can't bear the quality of the previous episode on its shoulders, of which it is nothing more than a faded photocopy. So it seemed that Capcom was in trouble this time around, as the recycling it has been used to for years hadn't worked. Hence, the producers of Dante's adventure themselves come up with the idea of taking the same concept, mixing it with some RPG features and building on it some interesting innovations, producing a result called Chaos Legion. But is Chaos Legion really just an offshoot of Devil May Cry? Or is there something more (or less) that makes it different, in looks or in heart?", "date": "2003-11-11", "grade": null}
