{"name": "NBA Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-jam.html", "text": "Back to the origins NBA Jam on PlayStation 2 represents a bit of a return to origins: if, on the one hand, the teams are still made up of three players (a relatively new choice), on the other hand the game mechanics have been simplified and include few elements. Players can pass the ball and shoot in various ways, with the only variable being dribbling. The rest is all part of the making phase: threes, alley-oops, super dunks and so on. In addition to the usual turbo bar, which allows players to move quickly and make certain types of shots, there is a special bar that fills up according to the technical quality of the baskets. When the bar is full, just press the right analog stick on its base to bring up the so-called ~hot-spot~: a circle on the field that allows you, when shooting from that position, to make an extremely spectacular shot with guaranteed results . Not only that: as you call up the hot-spots, shooting from there you can score well over three points The sound effects that accompany these super shots are hilarious. Example: a player arrives on the hot-spot, press the shoot button and you will see him jump in a superhuman way until he dunks the basket with an explosion, all while hearing the ~mechanical~ noise of the show ~The man from six million dollars to justify the exceptional performance There are three game modes available: exhibition, JAM Tournament and Legends Tournament. In the first it is obviously possible to choose any two teams you like and play a match, in the first you choose a team and all the others face each other in sequence. The Legends Tournament mode, on the other hand, will see you face teams from the 70s to the present day, with the nice feature of seeing the images in black and white, enforcing the ~old~ rules (which did not include the three-point shot) and listen to a ~softened~ comment for the occasion. Comment that, in normal games, does not spare enthusiasm Game features As already mentioned, the mechanics of the game are quite simple. Attack and defense phases follow one another (obviously), with the only unknown factor being stealing the ball, which almost always succeeds when you are in command of strong players but in which you systematically fail with small and light athletes. Before each game you can select your trio, which can only be changed at the end of the second quarter. The choice of players is very important, and we must always keep in mind the characteristics of each one before wasting impossible shots on paper (hitting a three-point shot with a player specialized in dunks is almost impossible, for example). On a technical level, the game is quite valid even if not exceptional: the fields are perfect, the public is only partially polygonal and the players could have boasted a few more details. It must be said, however, that everything flows smoothly and there are few uncertainties. The possibility of creating one's own player (who is automatically assigned to the chosen team in tournaments) and one's own team, whose characteristics can be enhanced by spending the points earned in matches, is very nice. Also interesting is the game mode in six via multitap, which can potentially give some emotion but which certainly cannot provide depth to a title that has always done without it par excellence. Comment If the first NBA Jam has remained in your heart, you will find this PS2 version of the game really good, even with all its limitations. The developers have spared no humorous touches (especially in the sound effects), so the spirit of the series seems unchanged to me. Obviously two game modes are not enough to make such a simple and simplistic title long-lived: making spectacular baskets is satisfying, but it tires quickly. In short, I would define this new Acclaim product as a divertissement dedicated above all to those who eat bread and basketball Pros: Some really spectacular stages Good graphics and sound Lots of nice touches Cons: Extremely repetitive and limited Few tactical solutions For fans only Basketball: game of American origin, in which two teams of five elements each participate, trying to send the ball manipulated with the hands into a net basket fixed to a backboard placed at the top end of the opposing sector of the field. NBA Jam: video game of US origin, in which two teams of three (previously two) elements each participate, trying to send the ballmaneuvered with the hands in a net basket fixed to a board placed at the top end of the opponent's sector of the field. With all the implications of the case: slaps and pushes, jumps from ten meters and players' tendency to spontaneous combustion. Born in the 90s in arcades, the NBA Jam series was a great success for Acclaim, which transposed the game to 16-bit home consoles and gradually enriched it with new episodes and unpublished features. Video game enthusiasts, however, know well that modifying a product that works is a risky operation; don't change it, ditto. On the one hand, those who appreciated the original game could refuse changes to the gameplay that distort it; on the other hand, in the long run the same mechanics can get boring.", "date": "2004-01-09", "grade": null}
