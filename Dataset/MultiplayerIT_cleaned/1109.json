{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap-2.html", "text": "Capcom does things right As for the very valid Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons chapters released for GBC a few years ago, Nintendo wanted to entrust Capcom with the work of creating this The Minish Cap, in view of the policy that is now increasingly catching on to commission to external softco the production of titles also belonging to extremely important franchises. A very appropriate choice, since the ~mother~ of Street Fighter has given life to one of the best episodes of Zelda that have ever graced a Nintendo home console, portable or otherwise. The graphic system, obviously in 2D with the classic bird's eye view of the series, finds strong inspiration in the one admired in 4 Swords, proposing a more cartoonish general style with pastel colors and a soft stroke in the design of characters and settings. The glance is excellent, to the point that The Minish Cap is undoubtedly one of the most technically valid games to appear on the GBA. The level of detail is exceptional, giving way in each setting to appreciate the work done by the programmers in an attempt to create a world with its own life; in fact, a few minutes of play are enough to immerse yourself completely in the magical atmosphere that surrounds the title. The story that forms the backdrop to the events is rather classic, and does not differ from the formula that has always distinguished the series: there is Link, the protagonist, there is Princess Zelda to be saved and there is the villain of the moment, Go. The mechanics obviously take up the guidelines that have made the series one of the most famous and appreciated in the history of video games without skimping on some original ideas, which are essential for giving The Minish Cap the strong personality that distinguishes it. The world in miniature We talked about original ideas. The first of these, which is also the fulcrum around which the Capcom effort revolves, lies in the presence of the Minish people, that is, tiny gnomes who populate the world of humans, but without them being able to see them. The Minish are everywhere: under the roofs of the houses, in the middle of the meadows, inside small caves and so on. The beauty is that Link can also be part of this miniature world, shrinking through special ~portals~ present in some tree trunks, rocks or vases. Which opens the door to a whole new perspective within the locations that we are used to knowing in ~normal~ size, making it necessary to observe the settings with a keen eye in search of crevices, holes, micro-sized inlets that could be explored once miniaturized. Beyond what is possible to express in words, facing the situations proposed in the Minish Cap perhaps crossing a meadow with flowers that have become enormous, or fighting what were harmless mosquitoes, or even exploring very normal drinking fountains, represent moments capable of eliciting a smile even from more experienced players. It goes without saying that the presence of 2 worlds, the normal-sized one and the tiny Minish one, has made it possible to create new puzzles and situations that are authentically capable of refreshing the super-tested formula that has always characterized the Zelda series. Of course we are not talking about upheavals, also because this was not what Nintendo production needed, but rather an excellent idea to propose something new while remaining faithful to tradition. Happy Happy, Joy Joy Another interesting element introduced by the programmers of Capcom in this The Minish Cap is to be found in the ~fragments of Joy~, which are nothing but medallions divided in half that can be found almost everywhere: inside chests, between the bushes, in bottles and so on. By pressing the L key some characters (but not only the characters ...) will be willing to attempt a ~fusion~, or rather to show their medallion fragment. In the event that you are in possession of a half that perfectly matches the one presented, you can reunite the 2 fragments and thus give rise to particular events in any area of the map. These events can be the appearance of chests, the opening of otherwise hidden passages, but also the activation of various related events related to the other inhabitants of the city of Hyrule and its surroundings. A further stimulus to exploration, as well as an additional element capable of literally ~filling~ the gaming experience. The sound, even without setting new terms of comparison, does its job very well by proposing the classic themes of the series together with spot-on effects. A perfect game then? Almost, ifwere it not for a longevity that is certainly not particularly full-bodied despite the large amount of side quests and secondary objectives to be achieved: the dungeons are a handful, although strong in an almost impeccable design, and the level of difficulty (fortunately) never represents a problem for the constant flow of adventure. But we undoubtedly prefer a relatively short but intense experience like the one offered by this The Minish Cap rather than the diluted and unstimulating ones that characterize most of the games of recent years. Comment The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is, by no means, one of the best games available on the Game Boy Advance. The adventure created by Capcom has in fact succeeded in the delicate task of proposing a title based on the aspects that have made the Nintendo series famous, but by introducing peculiar features capable of giving freshness and involving the player in a truly wonderful experience. The perfect pace of play, impeccable playability and an excellent graphic system are the fundamental elements of a title that really arrived on tiptoe, but capable of leaving its mark in the heart of every lover of the Zelda saga. Pros Excellent game mechanics Beautifully designed and colorful graphics It is one of the best episodes of the series Cons A bit too short The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a sleeper hit. By sleeper hit we mean a title that arrived quietly, without particular media and advertising coverage, but capable of surprising for its qualities once played. And in fact, the bare minimum of this new chapter in the historic GBA saga has always been known, and its presence at trade fairs in the sector has been largely overshadowed by the highly popular titles for living room consoles. And this is the reason, together with the rather unusual choice to debut the game earlier in Europe than in the States, why the arrival of The Minish Cap was not accompanied by the expectation that the products of the series have always enjoyed. Which, we tell you right away, is a real shame", "date": "2004-12-01", "grade": null}
