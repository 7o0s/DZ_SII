The televisions played them continuously during the afternoon programs dedicated to children and the structure of the series, which saw six heroes in colored overalls fight huge improbable space monsters, lent itself perfectly to the proliferation of merchandise of all kinds. Costumes, toys and even video games crowded the store shelves until fashion slowly faded away, taking with it the success of the rangers. However, the phenomenon never completely disappeared and in Japan, but above all in the USA, series of different types continued to be produced, abusing the usual narrative construction which, apparently, continued to please the remaining fans. By heart, however, we do not remember a good video game developed under license, if not perhaps for the 16-bit edition of Power Rangers published on SNES, and in 2017 history repeats itself again with Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Mega Battle. However, many, too many things in this production don't work as they should, making the nostalgia operation a failed attempt to ride the advertising boost of the film, which will hit theaters in early April. Power Rangers: Mega Battle really gets it all wrong, a production that is impossible to save GO! GO! But also not... Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Mega Battle takes the brand from the early 90s, with the evil Rita Repulsa determined to conquer the earth and to place a tombstone above the cursed rangers. Then return Jason, the red ranger, Tommy returns, the green ranger and the Dinozords and the very first Megazord also make their reappearance. We will thus be able to relive the birth of the original Power Rangers in a 2D scrolling fighting game that tries to follow the successes of the very first arcade titles of the genre, however failing miserably in many respects. Fast hits to be chained in short combos, slashes with the special weapons that consume no energy and the possibility of transforming, they all seem to be successful basic mechanics but very few moments of play are enough to realize that their realization is approximate and without any logic. Thus you will find yourself continuously throwing punches and kicks for the duration of the levels, against essentially defenseless enemies who will never put your warrior skills to the test. the artificial intelligence often remains stunned to observe you and only some tougher enemies that you will meet as the story progresses could represent a danger. The energy bar that dominates the top of the screen will allow you to absorb some blows due to carelessness but be careful because Mega Battle does not include any checkpoints and in the case of premature death your only chance will be to reload the level and restart from the beginning. There are six stages in all, divided into three sections each, and it will take you less than three hours to complete the main story, time destined to be further reduced if you decide to take the field with three other friends in local multiplayer. Things get a little better in co-op, but how could they improve with a game of the bottle or a beer pong challenge: with a couple of friends everything becomes more fun. While focusing so much on the multiplayer component, the Namco production lacks any online mode, which greatly limits replayability and further reduces the value of the title. The choice is senseless given that, analyzing the branches of talents of the various rangers, thanks to which to improve their statistics and acquire new techniques, it turns out that all the special moves can be performed only if several players are present on the screen at the same time, thus removing from the game alone some rather important mechanics for the variety of the combat system. There are other things about this Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Mega Battle that show how rushed the development has been. In some levels (without any connection to the plot) you will be asked to rescue some hostages but without this bringing any benefit in terms of score or experience bonus. It is simply an end in itself, incomprehensible and thrown into the cauldron just to make up the number. You are rangers, but little changes You can choose to play with one of the six available rangers, with the Green Ranger unlocking midway through the campaign, but the differences between the characters are very minimal and the impossibility of changing heroes during the game, or between levels the other without returning to the main menu, makes everything so cumbersome that you'll find yourself choosing one at the beginning of the adventurea and to complete the title with that. The other rangers appear in some cutscenes only to mention a few lines of dialogue and then disappear again as if nothing had happened. Even during the battles with the end-of-level bosses, boring and repetitive at best, you will find yourself governing the Megazord in a tank or robot version, something completely illogical for the brand's philosophy. From a gameplay point of view, the bosses are divided into three main phases, the first in which you will have to use martial arts to defeat them, a terrifying arcade phase on board vehicles where you can hit some targets with the cannons, and then conclude the battle with a boring battle based on quick time events. Rewind and repeat six times and you will have clear what awaits you in the campaign. There are no collectibles and even technically there are very big problems. The controls don't always respond appropriately, and rangers often freeze waiting for the next command. Furthermore, the hitboxes of the enemies occupy an extremely small space of the playing field on which they are located, a problem that often leads the player to throw punches at random without hitting anyone while your target instead, in case he wakes up from hibernation and decides to answer, he would be able to hit you without problems. The sound is embarrassing, with a really bad soundtrack that only gets better when the iconic ranger tune starts at full volume, giving you the energy, however, suffocated by a spasmodic quantity of sound effects of the most vulgar quality. In short, we are faced with a title that could make a mediocre figure among the freeware games developed in flash, therefore unspeakable when compared to some pearls that are regularly found on the Playstation Store or Xbox Live. Finally, in case you don't have enough, once all the levels are completed, some extra modes will be unlocked that will slightly extend the longevity: a battle between rangers in the arena in a PvP mode, a sort of tower of resistance and the possibility of facing the bosses in quick succession. Too little to raise from oblivion a production that can't stand on its own feet. A port of the old 16-bit brawlers, at this point, would certainly have been more appropriate and perhaps even more suitable for the target audience, try to avoid this production with all your strength.", "date": "2017-01-27", "grade": "4.0"}
