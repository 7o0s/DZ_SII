The Wii U version of the effort by the Germans of Shin'en Multimedia - those of Nano Assault and Jett Rocket - is in fact the third iteration of the franchise, albeit without any numerical suffix, after the debut on WiiWare in 2010 and the re-release for Nintendo 3DS of 2012. Not a sequel therefore, but rather an expansion and refinement of the contents presented in the previous releases. Even on the most recent Nintendo home console it is a product distributed only digitally through the eShop at the price of  8.99: a modest amount through which you can enjoy one of the best puzzle games around. Art of Balance is also confirmed on Wii U as one of the best puzzle games out there Art of Balance is, as the name suggests, a game about balance. The basic purpose is to put all the pieces at one's disposal on top of each other, positioning them starting from a stone structure that separates the building from the water contained in a small container. The concept is all here, enclosed in an idea so simple that even a child can understand it in an instant: also because the title of Shin'en Multimedia is based on a physicality and on concepts of manipulation and construction that recall the toys for the little ones, in their first experiments to discover ~how~ the world works. However, Art of Balance is not, except for the very first levels, a child's game, but on the contrary a challenging puzzle that requires reflection, calm and large doses of patience. It is no coincidence that the theme adopted by the developers to set the action is in strong Zen colors, with domestic settings between plants, fruit and river stones. But we said of the gameplay, which is based on the need to balance pieces of different shapes and sizes one on top of the other: it can be simple square or rectangular parallelepipeds, but also L-shaped or cross-shaped blocks, or spheres or semicircles down to even less regular elements. But there are also the fragile ones, which break under the weight of more than 2 pieces on top of them, or the ~timed~ ones which shatter after a few seconds, and so on. A mosaic of apparently incompatible elements that it is the player's job to make sense of, finding a place for each piece to thus form a small tower that is able to remain stable for at least 3 seconds; all this obviously subject to the laws of physics, absolute protagonists of the action. The beauty of Art of Balance is that there isn't necessarily a right and unambiguous solution, except in rare cases: in most situations the user has the freedom to find his own way upon completing the puzzle, because the important it is the goal and not the road by which it is reached. The rapid increase in difficulty coincides with the greater effort required to overcome each level: if initially it is a matter of a few seconds, you are gradually faced with complex situations that require millimeter precision, a steady hand and precise planning. It goes without saying though that victory equates to an extraordinary sense of gratification, which is renewed one puzzle after another. All this passes through a main mode, called Arcade and which can be tackled in single or cooperative up to four players, consisting of two hundred levels divided into eight worlds of obviously increasing difficulty. A robust offer, albeit largely recycled from previous versions, capable of guaranteeing several hours of play. But the German team didn't want to stop there: in addition for the ~solitaries~ there is in fact also the Endurance mode, which is based on the need to overcome as many levels as possible with a maximum of three lives available. The final result, evaluated with a score, will then compose the online ranking among users from all over the world. There are also two multiplayer modes, called Tower Tumble and Swift Stacker, with the latter also accessible online. However, the matchmaking is a bit too basic, and the lack of users penalizes this solution. The control system allows you to choose between using the GamePad touch screen, obviously using the stylus, or the WiiMote: the first solution seemed to us to be the decidedly preferable one, in terms of precision and effectiveness. In multiplayer instead the Wii U controller is available only for one player, while the others will necessarily have to use the remote control, one for each user. From a technical point of view then, Art of Balance on Wii U certainly does not offer situations such as to impress the player: as already mentioned, the setting isaesthetic furnished with minimal, zen elements, without particular contrivances. Nonetheless, the result is delightful: high definition helps to offer sharp and spotless images, where it is above all the level of detail, the attention to detail (such as the reproduction of water) and the use of lighting that are appreciated . The sound component is also marginal but pleasant, which combines the didactic effects with perfectly themed songs that merely accompany the action without ever being intrusive.", "date": "2014-10-23", "grade": "8.5"}
