{"name": "Killer 7", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/killer-7_a.html", "text": "Creativity or madness? The story that forms the background to the events, as anyone who has followed the long journey of Killer 7 from its presentation to its publication will know very well, features Harman Smith, an old assassin now confined to a wheelchair, as the protagonist. From the instability of his mind, 7 killers have been generated, which are nothing if not splits of Harman's personality; each of them has a unique aspect and characteristics that distinguish it from the others, both in the offensive weapons and in the ~special~ skills. Dan Smith for example, the character with whom the adventure begins, represents the most balanced in quality; Coyote Smith, on the other hand, specializes in opening locks, and is also capable of jumping higher than anyone to reach areas otherwise out of reach. Kevin Smith can count on invisibility, while Kaede is the only one to have a rifle with a telescopic sight. Mask de Smith can pass through obstacles insurmountable for others thanks to his strength, on the contrary Con Smith through his small size is able to overcome narrow tunnels or use the highly developed hearing as sonar. Lastly Garcian Smith, the leader of the group, who is also the one to whom the ~Game Over~ screen is inextricably linked: if one of the assassins dies, it's up to him to reach the killing area to pick up his partner's head and so you can resurrect it. But if Garcian is also killed, all that remains is to reload the last save. The plot, far from clear and easy to understand even once the adventure is over, has as its main objective the killing of Kun Lan, a criminal boss who has an army of creatures called ~Heaven Smile~ on his side. Level after level, however, everything becomes more complex, confusing the player and introducing elements that go beyond the initial objective. If up to this point everything could fall within the perspective of a video game still ~inside the box~, it is enough to stand in front of the TV and take the pad in hand to completely change your opinion. I do not speak Italian The best version of the two available is undoubtedly the one for Gamecube. In fact, the Nintendo console can count on a more precise and reactive control system, particularly in the first-person sections, a superior graphic cleanliness, but above all on a significantly higher speed during frequent and annoying loading. Instead, the unfortunate desire of Capcom not to provide the title with a translation into our language should be noted; factor, this, aggravated by the total absence of subtitles during the interlude sequences (fortunately not too numerous). A real problem for those unfamiliar with English, all the more so given the importance of the plot within the economy of the title. The freedom to kill What amazed Killer 7 right from the start was undoubtedly the graphic layout, totally different from what we have seen so far. Using the cel shading technique applied however to an artistic style between the stylized and the cartoony (a dark comic, mind you), the Capcom production appears as a sort of post-modern approach to a decidedly retro game mechanic on the contrary. The key to understanding Killer 7 lies precisely in this word: contrast. Contrast of colours, shapes, but also of concepts and moods. The graphic component is in fact only the tip of the iceberg, or rather a portion of the whole, a whole that is in any case really difficult to understand. How else to define, if not ~difficult to understand~ the decision regarding the pure and simple gameplay adopted by Japanese designers? In fact, the first few minutes pass in sincere embarrassment in the face of the narrowness and rigidity of the available commands. While adopting a similar visual to the Resident Evil series (before the fourth episode), Killer 7 allows only a fraction of the freedom of movement of the survival horror par excellence. In fact, the characters move on pre-established tracks, and the player's only task is to press a key to allow them to proceed along the established path. It is not even allowed to go back, but only to press another key to turn 180 degrees and possibly travel the road in reverse, obviously without any change in trajectory. The key to understanding Killer 7 lies precisely in this word: contrast. Contrast of colours, shapes, but also of concepts and moods In the event that you hear a sound effect that warns of the presence of enemies, it will be necessary to press one of the back buttons to switch to the first person view, during which only the possibility of moving the crosshair is granted and not your alter ego. The semi-invisibility of the HeaFri Smile can be solved with the ~scan~ of the screen, which not only makes enemies visible but also identifies their weak point. It is a limited area of the body which, if hit, allows you to instantly eliminate the creature. Each downed opponent then provides a quantity of blood; the liquid, divided into two types (thick and thin), despite the macabre sense has a rather conventional use. It is in fact possible to convert it to improve the characteristics of each character, or to regain lost energy or even spend it in order to perform special moves. The simplicity and limitation of this game scheme is interrupted by the various enigmas and puzzles present in the levels, which are actually rather elementary and not particularly original. As if that weren't enough, the game provides the possibility of accessing various aids to solve the ~puzzles~, if they can be called that... Finally, the sound deserves a separate discussion, really excellent; while not intrusive, it does its job perfectly to support what happens on the screen, and can count on a series of songs of truly consistent quality and variety. Comment The grade assigned to Killer 7 was the result of a long reflection. On the one hand, credit must be given to Capcom for having produced an absolutely out of the ordinary title, above all thanks to a graphic design that represents one of the rare cases in which bothering with the word ~art~ is not an exaggeration. But at the same time it is really difficult not to recognize in Killer 7 a serious imbalance of form over substance. The gameplay is in fact poor, limited and often irritating, aggravated on Ps2 by really unbearable loading. Forgetting these defects in the name of the splendid aesthetic component would be like forgetting that we are talking about a video game. And as a video game, Killer 7 simply doesn't live up to expectations. Pros: Aesthetically unique and beautiful Great sound Intriguing atmosphere Cons: Limited and repetitive gameplay Trivial puzzles Exhausting loading on Ps2 It is difficult to write a review of Killer 7, just as it is difficult to play it and in the same way as it is difficult to pass judgment on the painful and troubled Capcom production. Originally born as a GC exclusive and then also developed for Ps2, the effort supervised by Shinji Mikami (take a look at our Portrait dedicated to the visionary producer) and created by Grasshopper and Suda 51 is in all probability the most out of the box you can get find today in the world of video games.
