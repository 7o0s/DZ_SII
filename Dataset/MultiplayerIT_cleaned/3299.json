{"name": "Darwin Project", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darwin-project-recensione.html", "text": "The Darwin Project review seems to transport us to a parallel universe in which the Fortnite phenomenon has seen the release of a spin-off set in a snowy scenario. Seriously: if you were to tell someone about it, showing them the game, they would have no reason to doubt it. The similarities between the Scavengers Studio title and the Epic Games blockbuster are numerous, especially from a stylistic point of view: the characters, the settings and objects seem to come from the same creative mind, with their colorful and cartoonish setting, and even the musical theme appears extraordinarily similar. Beyond belonging to the same genre, however, the points of contact between the two productions practically stop here. Map and equipment Darwin Project is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which the masses are entertained in front of televised competitions based on the violent elimination of the participants, in perfect Hunger Games style, but in this case we are talking about small, ten-on-ten matches exclusively with blows of axes or arrows, which take place within a scenario divided into seven communicating hexagons. Each of these areas, as per tradition, is characterized by different landscapes: there are forest districts, made up of rocky mountains, trees and snow; but also those that have more or less elaborate structures, ranging from blockhouses to industrial areas. Traveling through these locations on foot isn't too challenging, given the limited distances, but there is a focus on crafting that takes its cue more from the original Fortnite formula than from its battle royale declination. Participants in the match must in fact use their hatchet to chop trees and collect wood, extract hides from old abandoned armchairs, open crates left lying around and use the materials obtained for the construction of arrows, traps and clothes with bonuses of endurance and speed. Not only that: within each quadrant an electronic device appears at a certain point which, once conquered, gives the components necessary for the construction of devices ranging from teleportation to camouflage, from vertical boosts to defense turrets. In a random way the zones are ~closed~ and you have to move quickly to another hex, which ends up making the encounters more frequent and dangerous. Furthermore, attention must be paid to the cold indicator: to avoid freezing to death, every tot it is necessary to light a campfire and warm up, however risking being identified. The progression is also limited in this case to what happens within the single game, but with a different mechanism than what is generally seen in battle royale. Before entering the arena, in fact, it is possible to choose between three pre-set classes or independently manage the options available in the crafting wheel to shape a fighter that best suits our needs. Thus the arrows can be normal, tracing or burning, with differences in terms of range and power; hatchet can be upgraded to work better as a weapon against opponents or cut more quickly; the coat can have a different degree of protection from the cold and support camouflage with the landscape; walking boots can make us faster or quieter. You can also choose from various traps and various electronic devices to complete your equipment. Finally, ample space is dedicated to aesthetic customizations, unlockable through an in-game currency that is obtained by playing or through a set of microtransactions. It is thus possible to buy weapons of different appearance, clothes and anything else needed to strongly characterize our avatar. Gameplay, structure and technical realization The ~reduced~ nature of Darwin Project compared to the aforementioned Fortnite is compensated by an original and interesting strategic substrate. The clashes can be resolved within a few well-aimed blows, this is true, but winning a duel immediately proves to be less trivial than one might expect. The collisions with the hatchets and the timing of the swing must in fact be understood perfectly so that damage can be inflicted on the opponents, and even more so archery requires considerable precision given the constantly moving targets, so much so that on PC it is literally impossible to have any hope of victory playing with the controller: mouse and keyboard are a must. Before arriving at the comparison, however, some time may pass: the hexagons that make up the map are initially ments invaded by one or two participants in a casual manner, without the traditional launch and landing phases, and identifying the enemy's position sometimes requires real investigations. Interacting with a downed tree or a uprooted armchair we will be shown for a few seconds where the opponent who has touched these objects is found, while at close range any action other than normal walking will signal our presence with a visual indicator. Unfortunately, the dynamics that characterize the clashes do not make the necessary leap in quality, keeping intact those simplistic solutions which, however, the general public seems to appreciate: there are no stakeouts except by luck, but above all the evasive maneuvers (somersaults and side swerves) leave the character vulnerable to blows, making it even more difficult to escape a duel that sees us at a clear disadvantage. It goes without saying that the great emphasis on timing and shooting accuracy, as mentioned to be carried out always and in any case towards constantly moving targets, also places a substantial focus on the quality of the connection: a medium-high latency can represent an insurmountable obstacle. The modalities initially available in Darwin Project are two, solo and tag, which see us face all-against-all battles or in the context of five pairs. In any case, the matchmaking is quite rapid, a sign that the long period in early access has helped create a large and passionate community, which will not fail to tear you apart during the first, tragic games. After level five it is also possible to try your hand at the Director mode, which undoubtedly represents a fascinating variation on the theme: instead of competing in the arena, we will control a drone and be able to influence the progress of the match in various ways, for example by choosing the areas to close, bombing others, placing targets on some players and benefiting others. A great power which, however, at a certain point ends up running out, leaving us to act as passive spectators in the final stages of the battle. From a technical point of view, as mentioned, the title of Scavengers Studio is very similar to Fortnite, giving up the personality in favor of a perhaps excessive form of emulation, which as mentioned even extends to the musical theme. There are some touches of class, see for example the snow that moves as you pass through the coldest parts of the scenario, but in general we are faced with simple and cartoonish graphics, which in terms of animations find the right compromise but pay the price as regards the visual variety of the settings, the precision of the collisions and, above all, the rendering of the impacts: the melee comparisons are inevitably slippery. On the test configuration we were able to play at 2160p and with all the parameters at their maximum, however obtaining the stable 60 frames per second only by acting on the internal scaler and bringing the real resolution to 80% of the output.", "date": "2020-01-14", "grade": "7.5"}
