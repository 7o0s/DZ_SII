I'll never stop taking off all these faces.~ This sentence by the writer and artist Claude Cahun is perfect for Candelaria, protagonist of the horror visual novel I Did Not Buy This Ticket. The Brazilian developers (and publishers) of Time Galleon aim to cultivate the habit of reading through video games: in this sense, I Did Not Buy This Ticket is strongly based on the dialogues and thoughts of the protagonist, and the interactions are based about choices, capable of leading us to different endings. I Did Not Buy This Ticket was created by Time Galleon's Lead Storyteller, Tiago Rech, and visual artist Lrio Ninotchka. A small note: Time Galleon and the authors jointly own the copyright to the work, registered both in the name of the company and in the name of the people who actually helped create it. In the gaming world it is not common to find such full recognition of the individual work of developers and artists, except in cases where self-publishing is used; we find it correct to highlight what is undoubtedly a protective practice towards whoever created the intellectual work in question. We tell you about Candelaria, her tears and the journey on the Eigengrau Line in our review of I Did Not Buy This Ticket. From one funeral to another The mysterious Eingengrau Line bus driver soon becomes a regular in I Did Not Buy This Ticket Candelaria is a woman who weeps for payment at funerals. Similar figures were not infrequent in past centuries, and were aimed at demonstrating to the community that the deceased was loved and deeply mourned by his fellow citizens. Candelaria, however, does all this as a hobby, traveling from one place to another on foot or by bus, discovering one day that she has a ticket in her pocket that she never bought: in order to escape from the relatives of the deceased, who often trap her into complicated conversations and are forced to recall her past, Candelaria is also willing to use a mysterious and disturbing ticket. I Did Not Buy This Ticket never hides its surreal streak, and Candelaria's trips on the Eingengrau Line bus are full of absurd and disturbing characters: a mouth without a body, a man with a face full of teeth, a conductor who obsessively asks her for her ticket. ~Eingengrau~, ~proper grey~ is the color that the human eye sees in the absence of light, and in a certain sense all the passengers on the bus are waiting for enlightenment, for a turning point that starts from their past and leads them towards a different future. Candelaria is forced to face the traumas of her life, and the dialogue choices that are made by the player will give direction to her journey, leading her towards different endings, anchored by the options selected by the player and how these lead Candelaria to confront a mysterious call that continues to receive on the cell phone, but to which she, at least initially, categorically refuses to answer. The idea of crying as a commanded performance, related to Candelaria's experience, is capable of triggering deep reflections in the players and prompting them to experience all possible sides of an undoubtedly short story (I Did Not Buy This Ticket can be completed in about an hour), but very deep. It is a story that speaks of the value given by society to appearances rather than substance; of the ability we have to change our face depending on the situation; of the expectations of others towards us, and of how these, in the long run, can shape us into a different being, often not better than we were at the start. Candelaria's face, poised between essence and other people's vision, between being and being-as-it-is-seen, is the perfect symbol for this enigmatic and never-ending journey. Terrible visions Ninotchka is in her first attempt as a visual artist for a video game: we hope she continues on this path, since she was able to give memorable visions in I Did Not Buy This Ticket The work of the artist Lrio Ninotchka - who tries his hand at a video game for the first time - seems to come from another, distant dimension, anchored in surrealist painting and in some visions of Central European silent cinema from the early 1900s. The characters are marked by bulky eyes, often out of place, to symbolize society's obsessive scrutiny of the behavior of the individual; sometimes it veers decidedly towards horror, to which sound effects capable of making your skin crawl. I Did Not Buy This Ticket is, in general, a contained and very refined experience, and also the visual choices that are repeated - the always identical interiors of the bus, themore or less identical setting of each funeral - fit well into the narrative and design choices made by Rech and Ninotchka. We found the branches to reach the various endings not always clear, but this is an aspect that does not affect the enjoyment of the experience, which has its own meaning and closure even if completed only once. We report the absence, at the moment, of a translation into Italian; we played I Did Not Buy This Ticket in English.", "date": "2023-04-17", "grade": "8.0"}
