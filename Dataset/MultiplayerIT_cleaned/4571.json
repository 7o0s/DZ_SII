Is this what Need for Speed Payback represents for Ghost Games? The Swedish studio, owned by Electronic Arts, took the reins of the franchise succeeding Criterion and provided its own interpretation of the atmospheres and elements that have always characterized it, in this case the clandestine races, the immoderate attention to tuning, the theme of considering themselves heroes of the street that does so much ~anti-system~ and that in this new chapter is gutted in an all in all coherent way. The plot behind the game in fact sees a gang made up of three talented pilots (Tyler ~Ty~ Morgan, Sean ~Mac~ McAlister and Jessica ~Jess~ Miller) who go into hiding, scoring a few hits here and there. Their latest venture, stealing the custom-built one of the richest men in Fortune Valley (a fictitious version of Las Vegas), is however compromised by the betrayal of a collaborator, Lina Navarro (played in the game by the unmistakable Dominique Tipper, the Naomi of the television series ~The Expanse~), who turns out to be in the pay of the Lodge, a powerful organization that also and above all makes money by rigging the clandestine races that take place in the area. Pursued by the police, Tyler has no alternative: he makes a pact with the man he wanted to rob and both agree to take revenge against the Lodge. To succeed in the enterprise, however, it will be necessary to reunite the gang... Desire for speed Six months after Lina Navarro's betrayal, Tyler finally decides to act: he shines during a race to get a job with the Lodge, then enters one of the organization's rigged races only to crash it, crossing the finish line for first and making your sworn enemies lose a lot of money. Once the cards are revealed, the matter becomes serious and Mac and Jess are therefore called into action, whose function in the game is not only narrative but also and above all practical: where Ty is specialized in traditional races and acceleration, Mac can drive offroad and in drift challenges, while Jess is a master of escape, especially from the police. Different types of events that in the large open world of Need for Speed Payback require the use of specific cars, divided into five categories: racing, acceleration, drifting, off-road and escape. When the team comes together and the story meshes, the map of Fortune Valley and the surrounding area is progressively filled with a large number of activities: the main missions, which revolve around ten gangs to be defeated in order to finally challenge the Lodge, are accompanied various secondary quests, in the form of simple speed races, speed cameras to be overcome at full speed, collectibles of various kinds and finally the ~catorci~. The latter are glorious cars, with extraordinary potential but reduced to terrible conditions, which must be put back together after having found the components within the scenario, in a sort of treasure hunt that often involves spectacular jumps and in-depth exploration of the area, as if you were inside an adventure and not a driving game. This type of vocation emerges clearly during the experience with Payback, which therefore pushes on the content front and offers a main story that is completed within twenty hours, but to which are added all the collateral activities we mentioned a little while ago 'on the contrary and the competitive multiplayer for eight participants, to be tested, however, with open servers. In short, respectable numbers, but how is the driving model? From this point of view, the developers have remained consistent with the work done primarily by Criterion, in the form of an undoubtedly arcade approach in impacts and drift management, but at the same time solid and capable of discretely rendering the differences between the various cars. You go around the map in a pleasant way (possibly taking advantage of quick trips to garages, workshops and distributors to cover long distances), there are no random encounters with the police (their intervention is limited to escape missions) and the traffic represents a element of profound annoyance only in a few situations, when perhaps the front end with a van ruins our performance a few meters from the finish line. In this regard, unfortunately the ~elastic~ effect remains between the cars in the race which makes certain comebacks less credible and devalues the effect of the nitro, essential for regaining groundwhen we are in difficulty, especially when facing an event with a car of a lower category than the one requested. Lots of stuff The Need for Speed Payback map offers a certain degree of variety in terms of territories and landscapes: once you leave the city limits, you find yourself in desert lands and mountainous areas that are much more visually inspired than the urban views , rather flat and dull, except for the most representative buildings of the fictitious Las Vegas recreated for the occasion. However, to substantially increase the variety rate of the experience there is not only the aesthetic factor, but also and above all the types of races with which we will have to deal with during the campaign, so different as to in all probability represent a completely new factor for the series. The acceleration races, for example, take up what was seen in the first ~Fast & Furious~ and revolve completely around the use of the gearbox and the nitro to get the best starting point on a short straight, in the best of three or five rounds; while offroad events involve spectacular jumps, shortcuts and drifts to be the first to cross the finish line. The highly entertaining escapes as Jess will instead see us escorting personalities from point A to point B, pursued by police or criminals, or making timed deliveries in Crazy Taxi style. In short, we are talking about a surprisingly varied gameplay, which places victory as a fundamental step in order to continue and which gives a Speed Card with each triumph. This is the new tuning system created by Ghost Games, which replaces the traditional modifications: each card goes to improve one to three aspects of the car (top speed, acceleration, nitrous power and capacity, jump length, brake effectiveness, etc.), leveling it up in order to remain competitive against increasingly complex challenges. The Speed Cards that are obtained with victories, to be chosen at random from three possibilities each time, generally offer higher quality improvements than those that can be purchased in the workshops, strictly using in-game money; which means that the imperative in Need for Speed Payback is to run and win, perhaps by agreeing to bet a small amount to complete specific challenges during the race and thus multiply your earnings. The cars that can be purchased at dealerships, divided into the five categories we have mentioned, are many and ordered according to power, which means that with a more substantial nest egg we will be able to afford a car capable of almost mathematically ensuring success. There are also aesthetic customizations, very interesting and varied but also linked to an achievement system: in order to be able to modify certain elements of the machine, we must have passed tests. The intentions of the developers are therefore once again confirmed: the open world of the game is large and rich, and they want us to dissect it as much as possible. At the center of the controversy in recent weeks, the prize boxes are also present in Need for Speed Payback and boast the same value: to allow those who pay to accelerate their progression. In truth, the chests often contain only aesthetic elements, but there is also always a cash token that will invariably allow us to speed up the action. In any case, you are never forced to buy them, even when you move on to the second phase of the campaign and the races get more complicated: simply at that moment you have to use the money earned from the races to change cars and move up to a higher category , but at first we too doubted that the ~sprint~ in terms of challenge was a way to push users to spend their money on the purchase of some loot boxes. In reality, an approach of this type, which ~forces~ you to stay on the map longer and to try your hand at a large number of activities in order to continue, certainly does not go to the detriment of those who have bought the game and understandably want the experience doesn't run out in a handful of hours, but it could certainly frustrate (and we bet it will) those who received the title from the publisher with only a few days to be able to test it before reviewing. Playstation 4 trophies Need for Speed Payback includes fifty-four Trophies that are obtained by completing the various stages of the campaign, but also and above all by deepening the tuning, completing the secondary activities, the daily challenges and the inevitable Autolog recommendations. In short, a set of achievements that aims to make the most ofor the rich open world of the title developed by Ghost Games. Not a great show Need for Speed Payback is a particularly rich and varied open world-based driving game, but does it also manage to offer graphics that are adequate for the size of the map? Not exactly. While using the powerful Frostbite engine, the Ghost Games title suffers from a very evident pop-up effect that affects both the scenarios and the cars. In the latter case, the question becomes evident during the short cutscenes in real time that see two cars side by side and the view that rotates around them, with body parts that literally appear suddenly on the vehicles and environmental reflections in very low resolution that, ironically, are framed in the foreground, as if they were a beautiful sight to behold. In terms of overall polish there was evidently more than one shortcoming and we expected things to be fixed by a pre-embargo patch, but to date the only update released has only made loading times a bit more bearable when starting the application, quantifiable in about a minute and a half. In short, something went wrong: during the races there are entire portions of the road that appear a few meters away, while as soon as you load a save you can admire the mountains in the distance ~mounting~ of textures and shaders. In general, the look of the graphics is flat in urban areas and there is a lot of aliasing, while outside the city things improve substantially but HDR support is lacking to enhance the appreciable day / night cycle, represented in this episode completely and not partially. The cars are very well made (however the view from the cockpit is missing), the aesthetic damage appears fairly implemented and the thirty frames per second are maintained without major problems, but the polygonal models of the characters in the cutscenes are so old-gen and the problems we've talked about are so obvious that we can't explain how the developers didn't solve them before handing us the review code. On the other hand, the enormity of the matter practically guarantees that the defects will be fixed with a patch.", "date": "2017-11-07", "grade": "8.0"}
