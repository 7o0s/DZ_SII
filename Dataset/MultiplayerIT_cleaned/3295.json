{"name": "No Way Home", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-way-home-la-recensione.html", "text": "An excellent example of the productions we expect to find within Apple Arcade can be found in this review of No Way Home, a game that enriches a classic structure such as the 360-degree shooter with deeper hybridizations, dropping everything to the interior of a setting with a remarkable style. The immediacy of the oldest game solutions is often found in mobile productions, but what matters in this case is the notable addition of freshness given by the construction of the world in which the adventure of the protagonist Cho is inserted, which can only be reached through solid planning work, such as can emerge from a title destined for Apple's subscription service, combined with coherent artistic direction such as are often seen around here. This is how a simple twin-stick shooter like this becomes a real adventure, thanks to the creation of an interesting lore and a more exploration-oriented approach, while relying on gameplay based on the classic principles of the genre. The beauty is that all this is told with a highly humorous 2D style that gives a remarkable character to the whole, thanks also to enjoyable and excellently dubbed dialogues in English. After being frozen for 9 million years due to a technical failure in the ice cream machine of an Economy Cruises spaceship, young pilot Cho finds herself aboard an escape pod in the middle of unknown space, having to find a way to return home to planet Earth. All is not lost: the capsule is actually an autonomous shuttle equipped with a cannon and a grappling hook (which can be strangely very useful in alien space) and the girl is a pilot to be reckoned with (after all she attended the Flight Academy from which been ~just kicked out~, as she often repeats). But above all at his side is Matey, an accompanying droid provided by the Economic Cruises company, which in addition to providing drinks is able to act as a support pod and show us everything there is to know about the operation of the ship and of the various game systems, all in a rather talkative way but with a succession of truly hilarious jokes. Shooter with an adventurer soul The soul of No Way Home is that of the twin-stick type shooter, which however adapts rather well to the touch screen control system: with one ~stick~ you control the shuttle and with the other, at the same time, directs the cannon to shoot 360 degrees, or the grappling hook to grab elements of the scenario. So far nothing particularly new, but it is everything around us that determines the particularity of the game. Cho's adventure is in fact a quest structure, like a sort of role-playing game: it's about exploring the numerous systems and undertaking different missions, in most cases carrying out errands of various types for the aliens you meet around the space bars. These open the door to other sectors and push us towards a deeper exploration of the universe, making us discover various secrets that make up the bigger picture of the story of No Way Home, which also has to do with alien artifacts and with the reconstruction of what happened to Earth and alien planets. Furthermore, completing the quests also brings numerous rewards, which allow you to expand and enhance the arsenal and the characteristics of the spaceship, essential elements for surviving in the depths of the universe, where systems are increasingly full of threats and surprises. A good part of the jokes come from the exchanges between Cho and Matey, but it is in the space bars and in the various agglomerations that are scattered around the star map that the richest moments of narrative elements come and Mike Rosenthal's humorous writing in these cases seems to draw heavily from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a strong character element and supported perfectly by the 2D graphic style hand-drawn by artist Scott Vanden Bosch. The various explorable systems are built in a procedural way starting from some basic elements, so an in-depth study on level design is not to be expected, of course, but there is still a good variety of situations to come across, enriched by combat with bosses, choices to make and even daily challenges.", "date": "2020-01-16", "grade": "8.0"}
