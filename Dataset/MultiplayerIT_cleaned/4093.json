{"name": "Strange Brigade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/strange-brigade-recensione.html", "text": "Strange Brigade offers a curious mix, from a narrative point of view: the idea of the group of adventurers who in the 1930s travels the world on an airship, in search of treasures and threats to thwart, is halfway between Indiana Jones and the League of Extraordinary Men. However, the atmospheres are inspired above all by the work of Alan Moore, peppering the cutscenes with moments in the ~war documentary~ style, complete with black and white and a narrator who emphasizes the heroic nature of each mission too much. We would have frankly preferred that only the protagonists would speak, given that said narrative voice becomes cloying after a while; while the general layout of the sequences, perhaps thanks to the monochrome and the abundance of ~British~ accents, is probably not the best thing Rebellion has ever made, quite the contrary. Once launched in the middle of the action, however, Strange Brigade immediately puts the cards on the table and confirms the goodness of a system that is undoubtedly the result of the experience that the English team has gained with its flagship franchise, Sniper Elite, and with the spin-off Nazi Zombie Army. More of the latter, in truth: the gunplay focuses on fights from short and medium distances, in the arsenal there is a single sniper rifle that you will hardly use and in no case will you be able to remain stationed somewhere, targeting the hordes enemies with all the calm in the world. No, not really. Characters and missions Who are the protagonists of Strange Brigade? There are four selectable characters, but being the title a cooperative-based shooter (however playable even in solitude without problems) there are few differences between a ~brigadier~ and the other that go beyond the appearance, the initial equipment and the special move, which can be charged by collecting the energy left by killed enemies. We have Nalangu Rushida, an African demon hunter; Gracie Braithwaite, skilled Lancashire fighter; Professor Archimedes de Quincey, occult expert; and finally Frank Fairburne, who we imagine is the father of the better known Karl. Once we have chosen our champion, we will be able to embark on one of the available missions following the order of the campaign, possibly opening the game so that friends or other users can join the match, or even scroll through the list of active rooms to experience co-op in a of the three modes included in the package: the aforementioned campaign, the Horde and the Score Challenge. During the tests we completed the story of Strange Brigade playing mainly solo, but fortunately there was the possibility to try the multiplayer too and check its quality. Well, apart from sporadic cases we have not encountered any latency problems and it seems that the balance of difficulty adapts to the number of participants, even if perhaps the opponents are not actually quadrupled compared to single-player matches. There is certainly a good variety of scenarios, the theme is adventure and therefore expect to visit valleys, ruins, dungeons, jungles and, in general, locations in line with this setting. We will have the task of thwarting the evil plan of an evil and ancient Egyptian witch, a real deity who can bring the dead back to life to create almost infinite armies and count on the support of huge, tenacious stone guardians, protagonists of boss fights discreetly challenging and spectacular. The formula recalls that of the aforementioned Nazi Zombie Army: within each stage you have to solve environmental puzzles by finding keys, activating switches and shooting certain mechanisms, until the enemy waves begin to arrive. At that point we will be able to exploit the breadth and peculiarities of each map to give life to frenetic and engaging clashes, made more interesting by the need to obtain ammunition for the main weapon (the secondary has infinite bullets, but in terms of effectiveness there is no comparison) and the possibility of activating various traps with which to thin out the ranks of the undead, especially the less reactive ones: rotating blades, spikes, flames and explosive barrels. From the point of view of hostile units, Strange Brigade boasts a very rich and varied bestiary: classic zombies alternate with armored warriors, skeletons of different types, ~monks~ who avoid our blows and throw flames or daggers at us, guards who target us from a distance while we are busy with all their companions, mummies able to summon additional reinforcements and to launch wide-range attacks, armored ~minotaurs~ and unstoppable when they charge, and other types. The cadence with which these different enemies are presented, complete with a grindhouse-style ~sign~, reveals great attentionone towards progression and a gradual increase in difficulty, so much so that in the final opponents who were previously presented almost like bosses we will find them moving in the pile, in an orgy of blows, somersaults, evasive maneuvers and grenade throws to take time. It's in those moments of chaos that the Rebellion title looks almost flawless, and played with friends can be damned fun. Playstation 4 trophies There are forty-two Trophies in Strange Brigade, and none of them are related to the normal progression in the campaign. To unlock the achievements it is therefore necessary to try your hand at particular actions, for example collecting collectibles, eliminating a certain number of enemies, covering a certain distance by walking, obtaining all the weapons and a specific amount of gold, solving the puzzles of the doors and so on . Gameplay and graphics There is one ~almost~ too many, however, and it is linked to the stressed nature of Strange Brigade, which was born as a PC title - as is the tradition for the English studio - and arrives on consoles without a series of optimizations that would have could have made the experience better. We are talking about tiny texts and the interface in general, but also about a hitbox system which in some cases fails or requires exaggerated precision, certainly designed for the use of the mouse rather than the controller. Let me be clear: using the analog sticks you shoot very well (after all we are still talking about a third person shooter) but there are some boss fights in which you happen to find yourself in difficulty because you have to hit very small targets within a few moments, or in the same way it happens that common enemies are not hit for a few millimeters by our bullets, giving rise to some episodes of frustration. The management of the arsenal allows the unlocking of new weapons upon payment of a certain amount of gold, with stations within the levels where it is possible to change one's equipment at will among the available tools, in this case main weapon, weapon secondary and grenades (infinite: they reload after a certain number of seconds). There are precise and effective shotguns, devastating but slow loading shotguns, but also machine guns. Each weapon has unique values of power and reliability, and can be enhanced by applying magic stones collected around, according to a somewhat limiting system: it is not possible to dispose of the modifications at will, which are definitively linked when they are confirmed. We come then to the graphics, which are surprisingly well done. The polygonal models of the characters still represent the weak point of the Rebellion productions, but the work done on the scenarios, the HDR support and the possibility of selecting the unlocked frame rate are all appreciable elements. In reality, the lock at 30 fps appears inconsistent and gives a feeling of jerkiness, therefore on PlayStation 4 Pro it is definitely recommended to proceed with the unlocked option, also because in this way the game runs very close to 60 frames per second, with a variability of values which, however, does not disturb the action, even during the most agitated phases, when there are literally hundreds of enemies on the screen. The lighting system enhances some locations very well, which in fact play with the contrast between light and dark coming out of caves and catacombs. Speaking of the scenarios, a respectable result lies in the fact that you never have a sense of deja vu regarding the placement of assets: there is personality in level design.", "date": "2018-08-28", "grade": "7.7"}
