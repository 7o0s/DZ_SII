Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The theme of dinosaurs has always exerted a great attraction for gamers, although there are not so many games that project us into a scenario in which the enemy consists precisely of enormous hungry reptiles. However, there is no doubt that those overgrown lizards, which many people have come to know also thanks to the films of the Jurassic Park series, pose as the ideal victims for a hunting simulation, much more than a mild and basically harmless deer. Here, therefore, that the developers of Glu have decided to take the latest episode of the Deer Hunter series, released last year, and clone its structure and gameplay to transform it into something different, precisely Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores. The experience starts from different scenarios, all to be unlocked, which offer a large number of short missions based on the elimination of velociraptors, stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs and various other species of dinosaurs, all reproduced on the screen in a convincing and detailed way, referring to the classic canons (the same used by Steven Spielberg for his films) and placing them in discreetly made settings, which can somehow reproduce what were the landscapes of prehistory. To access a new area it is necessary to complete a special tournament in stages in which we will have to eliminate different targets as they become more and more tough, proceeding simultaneously with upgrading the weapons in our possession. An operation that in the aforementioned Deer Hunter 2014 took place in a very ~piloted~ way and therefore took away a good part of the fun, and which unfortunately in this new title suffers from the same restrictions, if not more. In standard missions it is in fact possible to ignore the suggestions of the system and therefore try to hunt even if our sniper rifle does not have the latest upgrade in terms of power, stability or precision, but in tournaments these updates become mandatory and end up dampen the bulk of the challenge. Let's go dinosaur hunting, hoping we don't end up on Facebook too! Lethal and silent As regards the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay, as mentioned, the similarities between Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores and its ~conventional~ predecessor are many: you place yourself in the middle of the landscape, identify the prey on duty, activate the viewfinder and then fire opens. In some cases it is necessary to score aimed shots at internal organs, which implies the use of infrared; in others one or more of our prey will spot us and try to attack us, which will lead to a last second defense in bullet time glory. All situations that the game handles easily, in a perfectly tested way, as is normal for a product that was born as a clone, a spin-off of a relatively rooted franchise. The good thing is that some of the limitations of the freemium model, which in Deer Hunter 2014 concerned the use of infrared, have been eliminated in favor of a rather permissive setting, which beyond the traditional ~action points~ does not pose any particular constraints on the experience and therefore allows us to tackle quite a few missions and move from one area to another freely, without necessarily having to make in-app purchases. The precision of the touch controls and the excellent graphics, even though they pay little attention to detail (see the rendering of the water, which is too static), are all factors that contribute to drawing the picture of a high quality hunting game, and it is therefore a pity that the potential of Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores remains mostly unexpressed due to a too linear and ~piloted~ progression, which does not leave the user free to try his luck and deal with situations characterized by a higher degree of difficulty to average.", "date": "2014-07-26", "grade": "7.0"}
