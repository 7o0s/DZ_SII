The Ardennes offensive represents one of the most important passages of the conflict and Relic could not let it slip away: the idea of making Company of Heroes 2 a sort of large platform, a theater in which to reproduce events, men and stories that characterized that dramatic, intense historical period has paved the way for the creation of an enormous amount of content, which the Canadian developer seems to have figured out how to manage in the best way. If the additions of The western Front Armies were in fact perfect for reworking multiplayer, introducing two factions and improving the general offer, at this juncture the desire to tell a story above all suggested creating a brand new campaign, eighteen missions but above all a rather original and successful progression system. The result is a standalone expansion with a couple of flaws but many advantages, designed for those veterans who don't want to give up on the idea of spending their hours solely online. Ardeness Assault is a standalone expansion that will give even veterans of the series a run for their money Freedom of movement Once the Ardeness Assault campaign has been launched and the mission that serves as a tutorial has been completed, albeit in a rather summary and incomplete way, we are presented with the three US Army companies that will accompany us throughout the entire campaign: Support, Mechanized Infantry and Aviation, to which are added the Rangers, which can be purchased for a few euros as downloadable content. Each team is headed by a different character and has its own narrative progression, even if the most interesting aspect is linked to the special abilities that distinguish one from the other: instead of just giving the player the usual handful of reinforcements, bonuses and upgrades, in in this case, between one game and another, real skill trees are accessed in which to spend the requisition points earned during the missions. The Air Force's Paratrooper skill, which provides us with airborne reinforcements in the field, can for example take advantage of the support fire on the landing area or reduce call costs or even enrich itself with a second unit. It is not an insignificant addition because it offers a layer of dynamism and freedom of choice that is well suited to the setting given to the progression of the adventure. Indeed, after the very first missions, we are placed in the presence of a Risk-style map, divided into pieces to be conquered one mission at a time. Moving the three companies around the map may seem like a rather trivial task at first, but there are some variables to take into account that make this approach very interesting. Moving through enemy territory saps the spirits and health of our battle-weary soldiers; a value that can be recovered by spending the aforementioned requisition points. Depending on how the missions are completed, it is also possible that part of the surviving German troops move to surrounding areas, increasing the challenge level of the maps that we will face later. Having to deal with simple soldiers and relatively light vehicles or with teams of grenadiers, snipers and fearsome super-armored panzers can make the difference, so when playing Ardeness Assasult you must always try to understand what consequences the completion of the current mission will have on the subsequent ones. The dual progression, of the campaign and of your own forces deployed on the map, creates a sort of emergent narrative that involves far beyond the simple progression of the story, conveyed through the usual mix of cutscenes, audio briefings and text. On the contrary, one almost wonders why important resources are used to create the computer graphics films to introduce the main events, given that they add very little and certainly cannot compete in quality with what is done by other productions with higher budgets. Not for all By focusing the magnifying glass on the game mechanics, Company of Heroes 2: Ardeness Assault does not change the cards on the table compared to what was previously done by the series. It is the usual mix of resource management and careful planning of attacks, good physics and many elements to be carefully considered in order not to suffer bitter defeats. However, the innovations mentioned for the campaign are reflected positively on the missions, which now enjoy greater unpredictability: the objectives are more or less the same as always, between defense and attack of precise control points,the conquest of territories and the occasional presence of more scripted moments, but the need to adapt from time to time to the enemy's firepower, which varies according to what happened previously, and to complete important secondary tasks that are generated procedurally, it makes every match different from the next. Ardeness Assault is therefore also a highly replayable scenario generator and probably the best single player portion ever offered by the series. Having said that, there are two problems, however relative, that it is important to underline and which take the game away from other peaks of excellence. The first is that, despite being a product that doesn't require you to have previously purchased Company of Heroes 2, it's clearly only meant for veterans. And this is true both for an above average level of difficulty and for the absence of clear and exhaustive explanations. The structure of the campaign even risks not being clear at first, even for those who have already been familiar with Relic Entertainment titles for some time, who should think of better solutions in order not to risk scaring off potential buyers. The second critical point is related to the price: forty euros is too much considering that here you don't see any technological leaps forward, at least not in a clear way, and as much as you perceive the commitment on the part of the development team, it's hard not to think that if the figure had stopped at thirty, it would have been a much more attractive package. Even so, however, this umpteenth cross-section of the Second World War is extremely valid, there is no shortage of new ideas to explore and the Americans prove to be a faction to which it was actually worth dedicating similar content game after game. Hoping that positive sales feedback will entice SEGA to invest again in a project that started with some critical issues but still seems to have a lot to say, as well as being able to take advantage of the absence of high-level competitors.", "date": "2014-11-20", "grade": "8.5"}
