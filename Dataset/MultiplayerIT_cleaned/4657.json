{"name": "Gungrave G.O.R.E.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gungrave-gore-recensione.html", "text": "Exploring the intricacies of the PlayStation 2 era, one sometimes discovers hidden treasures, almost completely ignored gems from the masses who have implemented enormous innovations a decade early, or made very courageous experiments only to be beautifully ignored at the moment of exit. Being one of the most prolific periods in the history of video games, the fact that every now and then some retrogaming enthusiast pulls pearls with unpredictable characteristics out of the hat shouldn't come as a surprise, yet there are cases in which one remains speechless in the face of the rediscovery improvised titles so full of ideas that they are sometimes innovative even in today's market. In this unusual mix, Gungrave are mentioned very often, albeit with a certain reserve. The motivation is easy to say: almost anyone who was born in the 80s and has been hanging out in video games for some time has usually heard of them or seen them in action, but more than for their actual quality, the reason is to be found in Yasuhiro's character design Nightow, whose Trigun has more or less accompanied the childhood of most of the ~overgrown children~ of that period. Apart from the stellar look of the protagonist, Grave, and the generally excellent style of the game, however, the Gungraves are often greatly underestimated by the shooter enthusiasts, either for their excessiveness, or for the very short duration of both chapters released (we speak than a couple of hours to complete the former, and barely six for the latter). A pity, because in all honesty those games had a lot to say, and still today they represent a peculiar transformation of the classic mechanics of third-person shooters, with seriously significant evolutionary potential. Well, someone out there must have figured it out, because now, twenty years after the launch of the first title in the series, the Korean team Iggymob has been entrusted with a third installment called Gungrave G.O.R.E. And, on paper, this software house had the prerequisites for churning out a high-level following: having developed Gungrave VR at least demonstrated the presence of historical fans of the brand among the developers, and years of mulling over the mechanics lead to a myriad of ideas when you need to evolve a rather intuitive gameplay. Yes, on paper ... because sadly the new adventures of Grave have turned out to be half a disaster, and much of the fault clearly lies in the inexperience of the team at the reins of the project. Let's see what went wrong, in our review of Gungrave G.O.R.E. Gameplay and some history Beyond the Grave, star of Gungrave G.O.R.E. it is always a devastating war machine with the expressiveness of a reinforced concrete wall. But what style Rather than dealing with Gungrave's narrative - which in all honesty is a mixture of clichs, blood feuds, and completely emotionless characters endowed with warfare comparable to a nuclear-armed army - we would rather focus on the ~story~ of the series, understood mainly as a historical analysis of what made the previous two chapters objectively innovative and hilarious at the time of publication. In practice, the Gungraves are shooters without a cover system, where everything revolves around an automatic targeting system of enemies which forces the player to focus more on movement and choosing specific targets than on aiming. The bullets are infinite and the guns of the protagonist never need to be recharged, therefore the action is usually reduced to a continuous riddle without stopping and the difficulty derives from the diversification of the opponents, with the relative need to interrupt the fire from time to time to use close combat attacks or special moves. In Gungrave G.O.R.E. the action closely resembles past chapters. However, it takes little for the balance to break completely due to very not very clever design choices In the original titles these features, especially on maximum difficulty, resulted in a much more strategic experience than one might think. Enemies in the series have always been grouped into many and varied ranks, and simply being able to rain down bullets on them has never been enough to leave those games' campaigns unscathed. No, timing and cunning are needed to dominate Gungrave: the coffin behind the protagonist is the tool used for melee combos, and its blows can send back the annoying missiles of certain opponents or break armor. In addition, the aforementioned special moves they recharge from fighting and are not wasted, because their ability to quickly disintegrate anyone in the vicinitygi is specifically designed to counteract the sometimes exaggerated appearance of individuals ready to kill you. The system is also more refined than it might seem from the description just made, because the hordes of opponents are in some ways ~guided~ like sheep around the map (mostly by exploiting the natural covers of walls and columns , and controlling its flow), with slow and precise movements that prevent Grave's rechargeable energy shield from taking too many hits while it clears the maps. The player's skills are then rewarded at the end of each level with a score, which also calculates the number of shots fired in a series and leads to devastating not only the threats, but also any destructible element of the map to keep the multiplier always active . The bosses of Gungrave G.O.R.E. they are one of the few positive sides of the game, but even among them there are not indifferent ups and downs In short, the series may seem like a superficial tamarrata where everything dies in a few seconds at a first glance, but between aggressive and numerous enemies with very irritating resistances, management of Grave's movements, the need to always have a considerable overview during the shootings, and scores to keep, it's not exactly a walk in the park to master the systems. And evidently, in Iggymob there are developers who have loved this soup in the past, so much so that they have maintained many of its characteristics in Gungrave G.O.R.E., together with a significantly higher level of challenge than the vast majority of TPS in circulation. The problem lies in the fact that, when the Korean team tried to evolve the system with new mechanics, approach the level design of the game in its own way, and vary things a bit, it tumbled breaking all the bones. Let's see why. News and problems Gungrave's special moves G.O.R.E. sometimes they are the only way to survive if you get surrounded In reality, things are going pretty well as long as you stick to the fundamentals. The automatic pointing, for example, works without particular changes, and allows you to adjust to the targets in a fairly natural way. Of course, there are some hiccups right away even in the accuracy of the basic maneuvers: the charged shots sometimes take a while to activate, and the melee attacks - now it is possible to unlock various three-hit combinations with the experience points obtained in the levels - have active areas that often seem to connect haphazardly; however similar inaccuracies are not enough to ruin the gaming experience, which at least initially seems to faithfully follow the pace and philosophy of its predecessors. Delirium takes over when you start taking into consideration the special moves (here more numerous than ever, even if to be unlocked), the management of battles and the appearance of enemies, and the new hook mechanic. The completely open Pandora's box that acts as a container for all these flaws is none other than level design, but it is better to dedicate a separate space to that, because there is too much to discuss. Let's start by analyzing the elements put in place a little while ago, and it is the case, in particular, to start from the new mechanics introduced, or the hook from the distance. In Gungrave G.O.R.E., in fact, it is possible to recharge the energy shield of your alter ego simply by passing a fair amount of time without being hit, but the Iggymobs have also implemented a sort of grappling hook that can capture enemies and exploit them as if they were ~human shields~ for a short amount of time. While using a soldier as a barrier, your fire volume drops, yet this mechanic is very useful for recharging when you are overwhelmed by the antagonists, given that its implementation has allowed the developers to further press the accelerator on their number, filling the almost absurdly large troop levels. Not only that, in the game there are also instant executions (a bit ungainly, but useful) of certain weakened enemies, which can be activated remotely with the hook and very important at maximum difficulty because it is able to quickly reload the shield even if you are in the middle of a sea of bullets. When the level structure is close to its predecessors and everything works as it should, the game really manages to entertain. Too bad it doesn't happen often Parallel mechanics of this type should be conceptually smart: their presence allows you to increase the level of challenge naturally, and would have the potential to tie the enjoyment of the experience much more to the player's skill, guaranteeing healthy fun even in situations far more complex and challenging than those classesThat. There's just one problem these new tools are inaccurate, unreliable, and easily curbed by a myriad of external factors. Want an example? A marginal difference in height is enough for the hook not to work, and therefore it can happen to see one's series of shots interrupted because an enemy a few meters away positioned on a slight slope is not captured; then the hook does not seem to become more precise if you use manual targeting - a maneuver that allows you to bypass the automatic targeting by aiming at a single opponent - it is in no way automated towards stunned opponents (which would be the ~useful~ ones to capture for of the recharge to the shields), and any enemy immune to its grip nearby is enough for it to be blocked, halving or even completely canceling its efficiency. The maneuver also has a certain animation cooldown that leaves Grave uncovered, so unless you learn to use it around its many shortcomings, its unreliability can seriously cost you your life during battles. Ah, if you hold down the key to use it, the protagonist launches towards the captured enemy, but even in this case we return to the already described cracks in the melee combos, which are precisely awkward, interruptible by various attacks, and so slow to make sense only in a very limited number of cases. A not inconsiderable mistake, because if it had been implemented in a more fluid and natural way it would not have facilitated the experience excessively, but would have made it infinitely more enjoyable. Now of the end, however, this potentially hilarious addition is reduced to a scattered and very limited use that completely kills the meaning. point the game would have managed to reach sufficiency in our eyes, due to the solidity of the original formula. Of course, the Gungraves on PS2 were not and are not masterpieces to be placed on the Olympus of gaming, yet their structure remains so uniquely excessive and delusional as to offer an experience that is still highly enjoyable today when things work out. In Gungrave G.O.R.E., however, the moments in which everything clicks perfectly are minimized by one of the worst level design ever seen. Level Design and difficulty progression Each level starts with this phrase, and it's adequate... until platforming stages, ravines, or fights concocted by a drunk bonobo appear Curiously, the first levels of the game are the best ones, as they stick to the formula fielded by the previous two titles: simple and easily navigable maps with a limited amount of variations on the theme, designed to be almost completely destructible and allow you to manage naturally the mostly fixed spawns of enemies. In GORE however, with the excuse of the new mechanics and the will to innovate at all costs, the Iggymobs have deliberately gone against these fundamentals. And for heaven's sake, if the alternative solutions found had made logical sense, we would have fully supported them, but here the choices made are generally terrible, when not completely devastated by very low level programming. And if you think we're exaggerating, let us tell you when it all ~broke~ for us, because the shortcomings only really start to become evident once you reach a level aboard a moving train. Nothing particularly original or atypical you will say, but here the inexperience of the Korean team comes under like a boxer on steroids, due to a series of choices that defining ~crazy~ is an understatement. To clarify, in this specific level we begin to understand the mismanagement of the checkpoints, all too punitive in a game where there is no shortage of instant deaths, and it is possible to die if thrown off the aforementioned train with a simple shot while advancing in peace; however, the real horror begins in the final horde, where Grave finds himself having to eliminate the enemies in a sort of platform phase with signs to avoid, and the voice of Quartz (one of his fellow adventurers) who constantly repeats to ~hurry up~. The ~forest~ levels of Gungrave G.O.R.E. they're not among the best in the game, but at least they're mostly limited to simple fights with manageable masses of enemies. Now, you should know that this last phase is timed, and Grave should theoretically run as fast as possible among the hordes of opponents to reach a height difference in which to jump, before the arrival of a huge final cartel capable of killing him without escape. Nature would like that, faced with such a structure, the instinct of any player is to worry more about movement", "date": "2022-11-22", "grade": "4.5"}
