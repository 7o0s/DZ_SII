Both have received unanimous acclaim from audiences and critics, but as often happens when it comes to Japanese titles of a particular genre such as visual novels, the crystalline success was not enough to put it at the top of the list of videogame products to be exported to the West as soon as possible. From 2009 it took six years before seeing Steins;Gate in English, only for PC despite the fact that it was released at home for practically all existing platforms, from home consoles to iOS and Android portable devices. Fortunately, after the first English translation, the greatest effort was made and in return all the other versions could be more easily brought to our area. After all, they are nothing more than relatively easy porting, given the storytelling in drawings and the absence of any control system that would require a more targeted adaptation based on the command system of each platform. So then, if on the one hand the old generation consoles that have fallen into oblivion are not worth the effort of even a small amount of work, the English version of Steins;Gate was created for PlayStation Vita which, given its portability and graphic quality, is a candidate best solution for graphic adventure developed by 5pb and Nitroplus. Steins;Gate also arrives in English on PlayStation Vita in its best form PSVita trophies Steins;Gate includes as many as forty-two Trophies all related to the continuation of the story and to the use of Rintar's cell phone to read emails and messages, which help to better contextualize the plot and the game world. Many are hidden to avoid spoilers, but to get them all requires completing the title several times by making different choices. A mysterious story Steins Gate's success is all about the quality of the storytelling. Rintar Okabe finds himself unwillingly involved in a story with a supernatural flavor and far from trivial implications. Without going into too much detail to avoid any risk of spoilers, it all begins when our Rintar together with his friend Mayuri Shiina goes to the Akihabara district to attend a conference, finding the lifeless body of a girl only to find her alive and well shortly after After. The narrative then develops around the protagonist's investigations to understand what really happened, how it is possible that the girl is not dead and what mysteries the shady conference scientist hides. Each character is well defined and characterized, resulting interesting from the first meeting despite often approaching the typical stereotypes of Japanese productions: Rintar Okabe plays the role of the bipolar scientist, while Mayuri Shiina plays the naive girl who does not seem to fully realize the situation where the protagonists meet. The same goes for the other supporting actors introduced as the hours go by, for a rich and varied cast that adds to a generally well-paced plot even if not free from declines. The strength of the latter is the variety of topics covered, from more serious and reflective topics, to moments of pure adolescent comedy with some sexy references, in line with the genre of belonging. Not everything is rigidly scripted: sometimes it is necessary to make decisions that will significantly influence the narrative, revealing unexpected and very interesting implications. Each narrative crossroads is managed by the protagonist's telephone by deciding whether or not to answer specific calls or messages by carefully choosing the words to use. In this case it is a question of choosing them from those proposed on the screen, but this does not take away from the weight of each decision. With the presence of the touch screen everything can be managed directly with the touch, as well as the scrolling of the dialogues and navigation in the menus, even if for the latter it is better to use the arrow keys given the very small characters used for the interface. As for the visual rendering, the PlayStation Vita screen proves to be perfect for the tables made really well, confirming itself as the best platform for the game especially in light of the dozens of hours of longevity. Since it's just a matter of reading line after line of dialogue, Steins;Gate is in fact highly enjoyable on the move, on the train rather than in the park, perfect situations for indulging in an excerpt of history and then pausing it and then picking it up again from where it wasmo interrupted.", "date": "2015-06-10", "grade": "9.0"}
