Upon the news that Konami was preparing to launch a trading card game based on Star Wars, many fans of the franchise felt a very similar quake. Without a doubt, the App Store is full of card games: from Magic to Ascension, from Rage of Bahamut to Guardian Cross, then passing through a whole series of licensed games, such as Assassin's Creed Recollection and Tekken Card Tournament. Yet there is no doubt that an alternative starring the characters and worlds of the Star Wars universe, moreover published by the company behind Yu-Gi-Oh!, would have ended up arousing a lot of interest. But just like any Imperial stormtrooper, Konami misses every blaster shot, delivering what is arguably one of the worst trading card games on iOS devices. Star Wars Force Collection: This is not the card game you are looking for I find your lack of deck unbearable Through an interface as graceful as a Hutt, Star Wars: Force Collection focuses entirely on the possibility of buying, unpacking and collecting a large number of cards, each of which depicts a more or less well-known character who appeared in the cinematographic exalogy. From this point of view, a good job has certainly been done: the developer has drawn heavily both from the original trilogy and from the prequels, combining VIPs such as Yoda and Darth Vader with lesser-known faces, such as Captain Antilles or the criminal droid 4 -LOM. The fact that for each card there is also a brief description of the character depicted helps to make Force Collection a small encyclopedia to complete, but from this point of view it could have been done much better. The decision to use only protagonists, supporting actors and extras taken solely from cinematographic films represents a major limitation both in terms of aesthetics and completeness: many of the photos used are of the lowest quality, and we certainly would not have minded if instead of the last alien glimpsed for a second in the Mos Eisley Cantina had been given space to characters from the Expanded Universe. There are three different types of cards: the main ones are of the Characters type, they have particular attack and defense values and can be upgraded using other cards; those of the Stack type are instead group units to be used in fights to increase numbers (examples are the imperial stormtroopers or the Tusken raiders); finally there are the Vehicles type cards, powerful battle weapons and vehicles that are more difficult to obtain and can be used a limited number of times. In reality, this simple differentiation becomes completely useless as soon as one realizes that the playful part is completely absent in Star Wars: Force Collection. To progress in the campaign and level up, you simply need to face a Mole Catch-style minigame, in which the enemies that appear on the screen are eliminated with a simple touch: in this boring phase, the cards at your disposal have no use, nor do you perceives no sense of challenge. You simply eliminate enemies, accumulate experience points and move on to the real battle, a match in which the cards of each challenger face each other on a game grid. At this point one would expect a minimum of interaction and strategic choice, a few rules to remember, changes of turns and a deck to draw from, and yet even in this case the player has an absolutely passive role: the cards, arranged in a formation chosen before starting the match, they move and face each other in complete autonomy until one of the two sides has not been completely eliminated. The same is also true in online challenges against other players in the flesh, but the impossibility of intervening during the resolution of the game prevents any type of conscious strategy. Everything is then made frustrating by intergalactic loading times, so much so that on some occasions we had to wait tens and tens of seconds just to switch from one menu to another. Just look at too many menus, too much on-screen information and too chaotic interface to understand that Konami's main mistake was to focus on the amount of secondary elements rather than creating a game with real rules and a minimum of depth. There are boss fights and the option to align with the dark side or the light side; or there are periodic events, such as special quests and Raids. All ideas that would probably have helped enrich the game ifonly this had foundations, but which at present are just smoke and mirrors. The truth is that Star Wars: Force Collection would have worked just as well, if not even better, if the player's only concern was the player's only concern with unveiling new cards.", "date": "2013-09-13", "grade": "3.0"}
