{"name": "Evil Dead - Hail to the King", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-dead-hail-to-the-king.html", "text": "The first approach More or less direct conversion of the title already landed on Sony and Sega consoles, this Evil Dead arrives on our monitors with a feature that is nowadays considered more as a real offense towards pcists than as a defect of the game itself: the resolution of the title, is, in fact, of 640X480, and in no way is it possible to increase it. Leaving aside any speech about it (especially those that could brand it as ~effortless conversion~ which at the time had been the trademark of some important titles, such as Final Fantasy 7), it must be said that here at Multiplayer.it we are not here never let yourself be fooled by the graphics of a title, because we have always preferred other factors to it and in particular playability. And even in this case we won't be fooled by the general appearance of the game, which, despite the not exactly happy premises, knows how to do its job more than very well. On the contrary. In fact, the first impact with the game is quite positive, as the use of two FMVs (more than discreetly made) immediately captures the player's attention and in a few moments allows him to be transported again alongside the protagonist in one of the settings most successful horror movies of the last decades. Unfortunately, the first real sore points are already encountered from the first minutes of the game, when one realizes that not only is the resolution adopted for the construction of the main character inadequate compared to today's standards, but his own movements seem to belong more to a mannequin than to a hero: however unfortunate, still a hero. However, it cannot be denied that the different backgrounds that will form the backdrop to the game in its many locations have been done well and rather faithfully reproduce the places that we have been able to see in the films: however, it must be said that they are the same at times, perhaps due to the lack of any graphic artifice of the accelerator card (whose presence is necessary if you want to play the title), seem rather detached from the characters, in an effect quite common in the first action/adventures of this genre of recent years. Therefore, despite a rather critical first approach, due to the mediocre technical realization, the title could flow happily, if it weren't for the game concept itself, both lacking and approximate. All this can already be understood from the first minutes of the game: if it is true that from the first episode of Resident Evil the player's attention was focused more on the atmosphere that the presence of zombies was able to create, in this case it seems that the programmers they wanted to bet everything on the real action. If you still haven't figured out what I'm talking about, let me say one word: respawning. Yep, respawning. For those unaware of the meaning of this term, it indicates the possibility of enemies to recreate themselves from nothing after being dead. Close your eyes and imagine the typical scene you will face in Evil Dead: you enter a location, you are attacked and after fighting, your enemy dies and generally drops an item on the ground that can be useful to you (health or ammunition) : OK, now count to five, and the monster will reappear out of nowhere. I don't intend to stop too much to discuss how such a choice could affect my judgment (I'll just let you guess my thoughts by telling you how I waited to play System Shock2 only when I had the opportunity to disable respawning), also because often this, which in reality is generally a trick of the programmers to increase the longevity of a title that has proven itself too short, can be a positive element, usually when the combat itself is fun. And here we are at the focal point of the review: playability. Are fights with demons fun? No. No, because what was the only innovative element proposed by the programmers, i.e. the possibility of using two weapons at the same time (actually the chainsaw which replaces the possessed hand and a real weapon), is nothing but a fake. because Ash always uses one or the other. But above all because the clashes are almost always resolved in a click fest worthy of Diablo. I'll try to explain myself better. Click, click, click: please smile Resident Evil has taught us a very important thing: it is useless to try to kill those who are already dead, you would end up wasting ammunition without any useful result. This lesson, for some reason, has been forgotten in Evil Dead. If the alternative in the Capcomiano title was either to not be seen, or to flee in front of the zombies, here it is literally not possible. In fact as soon as you arrive in any location of the game (to tell the truth only in 90% of the locations...), the protagonist is attacked by one or more demons that suddenly appear from the ground: what to do, then? Try to avoid them, they are already dead, and try to quickly take the items in the background (beams, ammunition, energy mushrooms, important elements for the story)? Yes, here is the only solution, the smartest! Wrong! In fact, the demons are not only faster than our Ash, but more powerful: so here is the clickfest above. As soon as you see an enemy, you should go against him and start pounding like hell on the keyboard keys (ah, didn't I tell you that there is no support for the Joypad?) until (we will have realized that the programmers wanted to make honor to Track And Field...) the monster will disappear: in that moment we will be able to recover what we were looking for... but only for a few seconds, because almost immediately another demon that appears out of nowhere will attack us. Nor is it possible to use any type of tactic in the clashes, since the ammunition present is really too few, but our only chance is to repeatedly hit the enemy with the ax and the electric saw (which we can turn on using petrol cans, and lit it will do more damage) by healing our wounds (to do this, however, we will have to access the inventory each time by pressing a particular key... to add insult to injury the fact that every time we return to the game from the inventory the character will be for a few seconds as ~dazed~ and will not respond to our commands, allowing the enemies to get the better of us very easily) as soon as possible. So what to do to try to escape the fury of our executioners? Simple, change screen. In fact, it is enough to take advantage of the second lesson forgotten by the programmers (Dino Crisis Docet) and simply ~exit~ the fixed location to leave behind the demon, who doesn't even have the idea to follow us. The strangest thing is that in the second part of the game, that is, the one set in the Asia-like universe, respawning seems to disappear, and only then do you have more time to devote to exploring the world, which, to tell the truth, is however rather limited... The real problem of a scheme of this type is that even the weakest of the demons that attack Ash needs at least twenty blows to be knocked down, making the clashes rather frustrating, which already due to their constant repetitiveness tends to bore the player. Yes, Ash also has the ability to use a pistol, a sawed-off shotgun, and a repeater rifle, but soon the player will understand that he has to keep the ammo for the Bosses he will encounter quite frequently during the adventure. In fact, more or less every ten minutes of the game, whenever Ash will have the opportunity to recover an important object for the continuation of the game (in the first part it is the five pages of the Necronomicon and some minor elements), he will have to face one of the many Bosses present in the game, which will give him much more than a headache. Generally these characters will each have a weak point that it will be necessary to discover to get to the bottom of the battle, and this is perhaps one of the few really successful points in the game, even if it takes us back a few years when we inserted tokens into a coin op. And perhaps, believe me, these are the only moments in which you will have fun... In the second part of the game, things tend to improve also as regards the availability of weapons, since scattered throughout the levels it will be possible to find kits to modify your own weapons (Parasite Eve docet): the sawed-off shotgun will be able to shoot nails and this will increase its damage potential, the repeater rifle will be able to mount a scope, and the pistol will also increase in power. Adventures? It is not difficult to imagine how with such a setting the Adventure part of the title goes absolutely into the background, because you don't even have the time to calmly explore the locations in search of clues or useful elements for the continuation of the story. As far as the purely adventure part of the title is concerned, it certainly cannot be said that it is comparable to the masterpiece titles of the genre, but unfortunately not even to Resident Evil itself. In fact, the puzzles present in the game are never particularly difficult and complex, also because the elements useful for solving them are found more or less in the space of two or three nearby locations. Suffice it to say that the most complex puzzle of the whole game is shortly after the middle of the same, when it is necessary to open the door of a deconsecrated churchIt is necessary to place three objects in a precise order: the three objects, guess guess, are located exactly in front of the church... Among other things, the availability of objects useful for the adventure is absolutely facilitated by the fact that they are represented with a small light that stands out on the bottom of the location: it is really impossible to miss them. Absolutely amusing the moment in which Ash is instead faced with an enigma that forces him to think by making calculations: at that moment a film starts showing us the same protagonist picking up his own rifle and using it against the device, splitting it into two and activating the door closed by the same... perhaps the only really spot on moment of the game. Once any object has been collected, it is placed in the inventory, which really works like in RE: it is small in size, elements can be collected in it and can be mixed together to generate a new object (too bad it only happens once , and only towards the end of the game) thanks to the use of a converter that you will need much more often to transform the mushrooms into energy jars. Sometimes, generally in the points preceding the encounter with a rather fierce Boss, it is possible to find some crates that will allow us (I think I have already heard it...) to deposit the contents of the inventory in them and above all they will let us save the game. Yep, save. Because the programmers have decided not to revolutionize the control method adopted on the console game incarnations, and have decided to keep these Save Points which, added to the continuous respawning of enemies, have the power to make even the most determined players lose their patience. .. As far as the game world is concerned, it should be emphasized that it is rather limited: moreover, it will be necessary to return to the same locations several times to perform an action that the previous time (generally because we were missing a vital object) we had not been in able to do. To help us the presence of a map, which can be recalled at any time, which shows us the location of the protagonist, and which demonstrates, rather mercilessly, the unfortunate choice of the programmers to enclose the whole story in four main locations. As for the evolution of the story, Ash will find himself from time to time to carry out and implement small quests (find that missing lever, look for a sphere that allows you to complete a statue), and only once does he stumble, almost by chance , in an interesting quest, when a poor old woman instructs him to recover a small piece of a jewel... (far be it from me to reveal the rest of the story, which will reveal some little surprises), for the rest he knows everything he has already seen and played . A last, very painful note, must be made to the longevity of the game: when I finished the adventure and went to check how much time I had actually spent bent over the monitor in the three days of play, my eyes read a figure that was really a bit too much short: 3 hours and 13 minutes. It's really useless to try to hide it: the game, if it hadn't been for the constant clashes with demons, for the impossibility of saving and above all for the presence of really trivial puzzles, probably would have lasted less than a day of play. It's true: even Resident Evil and his family (especially Dino Crisis) are certainly not champions of longevity, but the five-minute atmosphere and fun of those titles cannot be found even in five hours of Evil Dead. Final conclusions As it is easy to guess from the rich premises, the title was one of the most anticipated action / adventure games of the season, together with the future Alone in The Dark 4, but unfortunately the final result is far below all our hopes. In fact, despite the rich background and the charismatic character available, it seems that THQ have simply taken the game concept of the first Resident Evil, and have transported it verbatim into the Raimi universe. Where all the elements that helped make RE unique end up perhaps remains the biggest mystery of the entire game. What we have in hand at the end of the fair is an unpretentious title, capable only of entertaining in a few and rare moments (the clashes with the bosses), interspersed with a rather repetitive and most of the time unnerving action (you know something my girlfriend when she killed me yet another respawn after half an hour of play ... without of course I was given the opportunity to save ...). If the action part of the title not only leaks from almost all sides, but due to the total lack of any tactical approach it loses hands down the comparison with the datat", "date": "2001-05-06", "grade": null}
