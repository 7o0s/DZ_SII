The events that we will relive in LEGO Star Wars II are therefore inspired by the most important scenes of the very first three films of the saga: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. Starting from the bar in Mos Eisley, a bit like a base of operations, it will therefore be possible to choose our destination and which of these three films to explore, each divided into a certain number of stages which take up some epochal sequences: in A New Hope, for example, we will have to explore Leia's spaceship and then the Death Star, which we will attack aboard an X-Wing in the final level; Cloud City will be one of the labyrinthine levels of The Empire Strikes Back, at the beginning of which we will have to defend the rebel base aboard our Snowspeeder in the epic battle of Hoth; and obviously there is also a level aboard Jabba's floating palace in The Return of the Jedi, during which the Ewoks and the final battle with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine also await us. In short, these examples give an idea of the approximately twenty missions that make up the game, but the most interesting thing is that each of these can be tackled in two ways: you can follow the story and use only certain characters in each level, which one once completed it will allow us to take advantage of the second mode and explore it again using any character we want among those available. To explore each stage to the fullest and unearth all the secrets, you will have to carefully choose our team. The LEGO flows powerfully in you, young padawan... In fact, each stage, in addition to presenting the usual dose of battles via blasters or lightsabers, puts the player to the test by challenging him with simple puzzles which, however, sometimes require the use of a particular character who, following the Story Mode, would not be usable in that juncture. In fact, the characters have individual abilities that allow them to overcome certain obstacles set up in the environment: while Han Solo or Leia can throw a rope to climb raised platforms, Jedi like Obi-Wan and Yoda can instead use the Force to create telekinetically bridges and support structures, while only Droids can open certain doors and bounty hunters like Boba Fett still others. Consequently, to explore each stage to the fullest and unearth all the secrets (which ultimately allow us to select new characters and vehicles) our team will have to be carefully chosen, in order to choose the right character to solve the problem on-the-fly. riddle of turn. It is therefore an ironically interlocking play structure, just like the LEGO bricks that characterize it. In short, LEGO Star Wars II is a product characterized by a strong exploratory component, in which the goal of the game is not so much to finish it as to simply unlock every secret, every additional option, every character and every vehicle: suffice it to say that the Game practically does not exist Over, as once our character's energy is exhausted there will be no interruptions, and the amount of money in our possession will simply decrease, which however will always be so high that reducing it to zero will be practically impossible. Master, my lightsaber got buggy... If from the gameplay point of view LEGO Star Wars II proves to be a bit childish as it is fun and long-lived, especially for fans of the saga, the defects certainly emerge on the technical side. The problem does not lie in the absence of speech and in the small amount of sound effects, and certainly not in the graphic design, but in the exorbitant amount of bugs and glitches that are very easy and disheartening to come across during game sessions. There are invisible walls that hinder the passage, others instead that you end up involuntarily penetrating, the camera sometimes goes on its own business and frames the scene in a way that forces you to move the characters completely at random, not counting the 'AI of our teammates that annoyingly leads them to get stuck in some points of the environment or to shoot at random ending up hitting our own character, consuming his energy. Sometimes following us between one jump and another, the characters controlled by the DS end up falling into the abyss of turn more than once, in an obtuse loop that leads them to fall behind, forcing us to retrace our steps to recover them. The frequency of bugs is not very high but it is indeed disheartening. Visually, however, LEGO Star Wars II demonstrates a truly commendable care for polygonal construction: the environments and polygonal models are detailed and colorful, the animations are pleasant and for most of the time the game remains fluiddo despite the amount of moving models, although occasional frame drops, fortunately not too serious, are not uncommon. Here and there are also touches of class that mimic home consoles, especially in an attempt to replicate transparencies and reflections of a higher quality than the DS would be able to offer, with convincing results. And above all, the adaptation of the entire universe to the shape of LEGO bricks is commendable, with results that more than once elicit a big laugh, especially during the mimed narrative cutscenes (exemplary the hilarious case of Princess Leia in front of Darth Vader). Obviously the action is constantly accompanied by the famous musical pieces by John Williams: between the legendary initial fanfare and the imperial march, those who have seen the films at least once will soon recognize not only the excellent quality accompanying music, but also the most classic and traditional sound effects of the saga, such as the noise of blasters and the buzz of lightsabers. On the other hand, the absence of other environmental sound effects, which sometimes make the action a little alienating, where perhaps a necessary explosion would be missing, and any form of speech, is inexplicable. LEGO Star Wars II is a bizarre product that manages to give kids and, above all perhaps, fans an atypical entertainment based on the most famous science fiction saga in history. The very aim of the game implies an assured longevity, with a ton of characters to unlock (more than forty), a very pleasant multiplayer mode and even an editor for assembling new models (the half-naked Leia prisoner of Jabba with the helmet of Darth Vader is an image as disturbing as it is comical, assured). Even technically LEGO Star Wars II basically defends itself well, both graphic and sound defects are compensated by as many advantages, in particular the quality of the polygonal engine and the splendid music. The real problem with this version of LEGO Star Wars II is the amount of bugs we found in the final product, which if they don't completely undermine the playful experience, they certainly make it unpleasant at times, ultimately unacceptable: you don't launch a such an incomplete product on the market. The semi-absence of the Game Over basically makes the annoyance caused by the bugs almost superfluous, but there remains a basic indifference that prevents the product from deserving a certainly higher evaluation. Maybe next time...? Pro Technically well-finished Very long-lived It's Star Wars! Cons Too many, huge bugs Too simple Almost no sound effects George Lucas' science fiction hexalogy is probably something that no one will ever be able to forget or put aside, it has forcefully entered our imagination and, whether we like it or not, all the fiction of the same genre after those three films directed in the seventies it suffers and will suffer forever from the comparison with the work of Lucas. And with all the merchandising that has followed it in more than thirty years. The so-called Classical Trilogy, precisely the one from the seventies narratively subsequent to the most recent new trilogy, occupies a special place in the hearts of all lovers of the saga, for various reasons that completely ignore the quality of the special effects, the acting skills of the actors (for how undefeated the late Sir Alec Guinness remains) and the complexity of the plot. It is something much more sentimental, almost affective. And therefore it is not surprising that the sequel to the popular LEGO Star Wars has the Classic Trilogy as its theme: the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa and the whole gang are about to be relived through LEGO bricks on the screens of the DS.", "date": "2006-09-20", "grade": null}
