{"name": "Chaka Chaka Pata Pon!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87887-patapon-3-chaka-chaka-pata-pon.html", "text": "Pon Pon Pata Pon is a rhythm that has literally entered the brain of all those who have played at least the first episode of this very original franchise: if you have seen them humming this refrain by frantically beating the keys of their PSP, don't worry, they have not gone mad, they have been simply bewitched by one of the most popular strategic RPGs of recent years. Patapon has never been a game for everyone and this became clear especially with the second episode, where the extreme complexity of the gameplay married a game system that was sometimes a bit frustrating, alienating the more casual players and giving the more daring huge satisfactions and hours of fun. With this third episode of the series, Sony reverses course and also thinks a little of all those who are not rhytm-game champions, churning out a game full of ideas and possibilities that has split critics in two. The question is: was this sequel a step backwards or a step forward for the patapons? Super! Patapon 3 starts in a decidedly different way compared to the two prequels, also detaching itself narratively from the rest of the series: the story begins right where Patapon 2 ends, the Patapon tribe has been petrified and their beloved deity, that is you, decides to incarnate in one of the valiant warriors, transforming it into a real ~super patapon~. Consequently, in Patapon 3 you will not play as the invisible god of the patapons, but directly as one of the bizarre little creatures, endowed with extraordinary powers: together with three faithful companions you will have to discover how to reverse the curse by venturing into this new land. In reality, for the purposes of raw gameplay, it doesn't change much, but the idea works and makes the narrative even a little more dynamic. The choice of the patapon in which to incarnate is fundamental: you will be asked to basically choose between three ~classes~ defined by the peculiar weapons, namely sword, spear or bow. This decision will determine what kind of patapon you will be during the adventure, while your three companions will each reflect one of the three archetypes. And here the many differences from the prequel begin. As you may have guessed, this time you won't lead an entire army but only four patapon, which honestly makes the game less complicated and more manageable. Furthermore, each patapon will earn individual experience points at the end of each mission and by reaching certain levels it will unlock new classes: some will be a natural evolution of the current class, while others will be totally new and specialized in the use of different weapons. Each type of weapon has its own rules and if in fact there is something to reproach Patapon 3 it is the extreme darkness that surrounds almost every element of the game, which is not explained or described in any way except during loading, when synthetic gameplay tips appear: unfortunately these ~tips~ are completely random and the player remains left to himself for most of the time. You and which army? Once you become familiar with numbers and statistics Patapon 3 becomes a real crescendo of surprises and content. In general, the developers seem to have greatly simplified the strategic component of this new episode which seems to be much more ~action~ than the previous ones. Don't be fooled, however: there's an entire undergrowth just waiting to be explored. Each class, for example, has some exclusive abilities, generally linked to actual combat: only by repeatedly playing that class will the abilities be unlocked, one after the other, and the player must consider their usefulness in the mission that wants to face. On the other hand, each class also corresponds to various passive skills: these, once obtained, can be ~equipped~ by the same character even after he has changed class. As you can imagine, therefore, the management of the ~party~ revolves entirely around the various skills that the player will do well to learn and equip by exploiting synergies and compatibility. Once you take the field, the gameplay reveals itself as always, but much more accessible and less severe than in the past: two correct (and not even perfect) lines are enough to activate the ~Madness~ mode and enhance your patapon and as if not enough we will have an extra chance to keep the Madness active after a clumsy execution of the rhythm. Despite everything, the player is once again called upon to carefully study the behavior of the enemies to predict their attacks and react by inserting the correct lines, for example by defending or retreating at the right moment. A great novelty consists instead in the simplification of thethe ~objects~ component: having eliminated the fun but in the long run boring mini-games and the excessively expensive creation system of the previous episodes, Patapon 3 adopts a new mechanic and the player finds chests of variable quality, during the missions, which contain weapons and equipment with the most varied stats, which can also be upgraded by the blacksmith or broken down into money and materials useful for upgrading other items. To define Patapon 3 we could use the term ~dungeon crawling~ which identifies historical games such as Blizzard's Diablo series: it would not be wrong at all since the player is encouraged to repeat the missions to increase the experience of his patapon, gain new abilities, new classes and new items, in order to create the perfect army. ... This army! The Diablo mention will have led some readers to sweet memories of evenings spent online exploring crypts and exchanging objects. In fact, Patapon 3 works in more or less the same way thanks to a multiplayer component that left us speechless with its completeness, depth and wealth of options. The only problem is that it's not easy to find occasional players, but it's enough to get organized with a few friends to recall the sensations of playing Diablo 2 or, to stay on the PSP theme, Monster Hunter. Brave similarities? A little, but it is clear that Sony has been inspired by these giants of online multiplayer to develop the infrastructure of Patapon 3 and the possibilities offered are truly numerous. Not only is it possible to play against other players in real competitive modes of various kinds, each with precise rules, but Patapon 3 also allows you to tackle missions in cooperative mode, hosting other players who can help us defeat the most difficult enemies , for example the bosses that appear randomly in some repeatable missions and that give access to increasingly powerful and rare items. The possibility of creating a ~team~ complete with a business card is the icing on the cake and the only weak point of the whole idea is the absence of a chat system, apart from a series of pre-set phrases of dubious use . Patapon 3 is a game that is best expressed when played with friends and while not boasting the longevity and depth of other similar titles, including those we have already mentioned, it really reveals a surprising wealth of content.", "date": "2011-04-26", "grade": "8.8"}
