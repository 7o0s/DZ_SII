{"name": "Giochiamo con le piste?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81162-trackmania-wii-giochiamo-con-le-piste.html", "text": "Born and raised on the PC, TrackMania is a series of arcade driving games clearly inspired by legendary titles such as Stunts (1990) in which, aboard very fast racing cars, you embarked on speed tests at the limit of human possibilities on circuits overloaded with ramps, loops and dangerous chasms. It must be said that the product developed by the French Nadeo avoids specializing in the ~acrobatic~ aspects of track racing, and rather tries to focus attention on identifying the best trajectories to beat record times and get on the podium. The experience is then enriched thanks to a simple but powerful track editor, as well as the possibility for the user to share their creations online, a feature that has contributed to the birth of a community that is still very active today. In the last two years, the TrackMania series has approached the Nintendo platforms, coming out first on DS (precisely with TrackMania DS) and then on Wii (with, um, TrackMania Wii), thus creating a sort of bridge between very different videogame realities. The game subject of this review, developed by Firebrand Games, offers us both single and multiplayer modes, includes a powerful track editor (adapted for the occasion for use with the Wii-mote) and doesn't forget what the trademark of the series, or the sharing of content between users, a really well implemented feature if we think of the limited possibilities generally offered by the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The brake, this unknown The one hundred and twenty-six tracks available in TrackMania Wii are divided by type and level of difficulty: the ~Stadium~ scenarios are presented as real speed tracks, and it is no coincidence that they see us driving a Formula 1 single-seater with extreme grip, which it doesn't even break down in the fastest corners, despite boasting excellent acceleration; with the ~Island~ tracks, on the other hand, we identify almost urban settings, which we travel on board of custom-built cars that are rather difficult to manage when cornering, which skid at every turn of the steering wheel and shoot like missiles; ~Desert~ indicates desolate and often sandy scenarios, to be faced sitting comfortably on a powerful car with four-wheel drive, with slow and reasoned driving; the ~Snow~ tracks, as it is easy to guess, are generally snowy and they see us driving big pickups that sometimes tend to tip over; ~Rally~ identifies the dirt roads, with our car that practically always drifts and must be controlled very carefully; Finally, the ~Coast~ tracks are located near the sea... and what could be better than an open-top sports car for such circumstances? Each car has unique characteristics, which combine with the peculiarities of the track, creating precisely six different interpretations of a driving system that always remains anchored to the arcade spirit of the series. The brake, for example, remains almost unused in standard races: much better to guess the best trajectories and cut corners at the right time, or in the worst case scenario let go (but only for an instant!) the accelerator. The spirit of TrackMania manifests itself in the possibility of restarting the race instantly, by pressing a single button and without going through any menu whatsoever, a factor that makes our furious attempts to get the perfect lap an immersive, frenetic and always poised between contentment and frustration. Depending on the level of difficulty, the races can literally be made up of two bends and a straight, to gradually gain consistency and depth as higher category tracks are unlocked. All the unlockable elements in the game are regulated by a system that is based on the experience points earned with victories, and which can be spent in the appropriate shop to buy new tracks, new blocks for the editor and new liveries for the cars. The solo game mode is not limited to racing on normal tracks, but also offers two interesting alternatives: ~puzzle~ and ~platform~. The first combines puzzle elements with what is the basic gameplay of TrackMania Wii, and presents us with a series of incomplete tracks that we must first finish (using the editor) and then try in first person, with the aim of breaking records pre-established. The point is that it is not simply a matter of adding two corners and racing: the way we choose to complete the track is reflected in our final performance, for example placing an acceleration ramp before or after a certain corner will produce significant variations in time marked at the finish line. The ~platform~ mode instead sees us engaged in a complex obstacle course, full of barriersand chasms that we must try to avoid, while obtaining a decent performance. DIY track But let's go back to the editor: the main menu allows us to create a new track, load a saved one or share the contents created with other players via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. To work on the tracks it is necessary to use the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combo (whereas it is instead possible to play with only the Wii-mote horizontally or using the Classic Controller), and it takes some time to get used to the rotation and zoom on the affected area. In our view, it would have been better to assign the C and Z keys to change the floor and the d-pad to rotate the view, but in the end, a little experience is enough to familiarize yourself with the commands. The selection of the ~blocks~ and the editing tools appears quite quick and intuitive, as well as their positioning on the ground, while the depth rendering leaves something to be desired, which often makes us place elements off axis with respect to the area concerned . In any case, the potential of the editor is enormous, in just a few minutes we were able to already create a couple of tracks and then we verified that there are already numerous respectable creations online, some truly extravagant and spectacular. The game allows you to share content in a really simple and fast way, while managing a list of friends and opponents which is useful for multiplayer games. And speaking of multiplayer, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the matchmaking system for online matches, with the various participants entering their preferences in terms of races and tracks into the ~cycle~, and then facing the events together in succession, like in a tournament. It is also possible to play locally, via split-screen for up to four players, or turn-based for up to eight players. Moving on to the technical implementation, given the low number of polygons on the screen, it is clear that the developers have preferred the speed and fluidity of the graphics rather than the level of detail: the textures are just discrete, the models rather poor and angular, but the frame rate appears solid and uncertainties are very rare indeed. The music that accompanies the action, in many cases of a ~dance~ nature, plays its role without infamy or praise.", "date": "2010-10-06", "grade": "7.8"}
