No", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114463-crusader-kings-ii-the-republic-monarchia-no-grazie.html", "text": "In the panorama of Paradox Interactive productions, Crusader Kings II is certainly one of the most representative games of the grand strategy genre, of which the Swedish publisher has become - as repeated to exhaustion on other occasions - one of the greatest exponents. The freedom of play and the depth of the title released about a year ago know few rivals on the market, making available to the player a potentially infinite amount of hours to spend in front of the monitor. All thanks to the sandbox mode which in fact knows no end, between heirs to be generated and preserved together with intrigues worthy of Game of Thrones, to which one of the most popular mods in the online community has been dedicated. But despite the success of Crusader Kings II, the developers have not at all rested on their laurels, publishing a series of additional contents and expansions of which The Republic will not even be the last chapter: for the occasion, forget the possibility of exercising the your absolute power over the people, as we are now moving from the monarchies of the Middle Ages to republics, evolved centers in which losing one's glory can be a matter of one vote, and where at the time, as now, winning elections can also be a question of who has more money to spend on promoting himself. The arrival of the republics is a particularly interesting feature especially for us Italians, given that among the new playable powers we find Genoa, Pisa and Venice, together with the Hanseatic League and the island of Gotland, located instead in Northern Europe. Living as a Doge The historical period that we find ourselves reliving inside The Republic remains the same as in the base game: in fact, it starts from 1066 to arrive up to 1452, keeping intact most of the game mechanics of Crusader Kings II for the management of one's ~court~ and of diplomatic relations. Among the main innovations, we find the presence of what are real elections to decide our successor. Victory will obviously be unrelated to belonging to our own bloodline: to get our heir elected as the new Doge, The Republic introduces a hybrid system that requires both the investment of hard cash and the achievement of a certain level of family prestige . To do this, any means is legitimate, even going so far as to put i spokes in the works of the candidates of the other more powerful families, in order to ensure victory. Being a republic, the titles of our enemies can no longer be revoked as happened previously, thus making it more necessary to resort to internal political operations of dubious morality, implementing plots to damage one's opponents as much as possible. But the republics also know enemies outside the lands they control, given that, as we said, they base their existence on trade: the battles and the need to keep the other powers at bay obviously remain standing, but this time without becoming solid merchants able to amass substantial wealth the end is almost guaranteed. Ports therefore assume a key role in carrying out our trade by sea, and for this reason it is mainly the republics themselves that constantly contend for them, sometimes even the most money-hungry feudal lords finding themselves in the way. The new contents introduced by Paradox naturally include other historical characters, for whom new character traits are also available, together with ambitions created ad hoc for a true republican. From a visual point of view, the changes obviously concern the various republics, the arrival of which introduces new dedicated management menus, a skin for the game interface and unique models for costumes and ships. Let's expand Crusader Kings II can count on a substantial amount of additional microcontent and four expansions. The Republic is the latest release in chronological order. The first two are entitled Sword of Islam, dedicated to the Islamic powers, and Legacy of Rome, dedicated instead to the Byzantine Empire. The third, Sunset Invasion, is about an imaginative Aztec invasion. The next novelty with The Old Gods has also already been announced, thanks to which it will be possible to go back in time to the year 867, thus guiding the populations of that era.", "date": "2013-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
