This is already evident in the first minutes of the game. Although the first sequence seems to be taken directly from the Tom Clancy market of ideas, the initial screen instead shows an upside down American flag and a US anthem entrusted to the distorted notes of an electric guitar. An image that provides a strange impact, considering the apparent context of a video game with a realistic military tone. On the other hand, as we have already reported previously, the narrative model taken as inspiration by the developers is not exactly trivial, since it is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. A model that does not emerge immediately from the context and from the game action (apart from direct references such as the name of Colonel Konrad, a sort of mix between the name of the writer and that of Kurtz, from the same book), but which emerges slowly slowly, as if covered by windswept sand, when we realize that the Colonel's recovery mission transforms into something different and deeper, reflective, like a journey of discovery and education within a wild environment that has lost all its points of reference, returning to the primordial chaos. A strange place where the misery of survival is hidden among opulent jewels and furnishings, a legacy of a rich and hedonistic humanity over which nature has once again taken over, forcefully throwing man into chaos. Then one realizes that crossing those deserted (but not deserted) ruins is really ~like taking a journey back in time, to the beginning of the world~ and that ~in the hot, thick and heavy air~, as in Conrad's book, ~there is no joy in the sunshine.~ Yager's experiment, given by inserting a third-person shooter with a rather mainstream structure on a narrative substrate with a certain importance and originality, has certainly succeeded. But let's see the rest. Rescue Private Konrad We find ourselves in the role of Captain Martin Walker, in charge of the small Delta Force team, engaged in the recovery of Colonel Konrad and in the search for clues on the fate of the 33rd squadron of the US Army, whose contacts have mysteriously been lost during an operation in Dubai. We soon understand that the situation in the city now completely invaded by sand and desert is far more complex than one might have expected, with marauders, military, CIA and local forces fighting each other in a total chaos of factions that makes it difficult to make the classic division between good and bad, leaving the protagonist and his two companions increasingly perplexed and dismayed. The structure follows various choices made by previous titles belonging to the same genre, with a particular tactical hybridization however. Most of the elements bring it back to Gears of War, especially with regard to damage management (which is automatically healed by staying away from hits for a certain period of time), the control interface and the use of game elements. scenery as contextual covers. On this last point, however, there is a convincing dynamism in the passage from running in the open field to covering behind an obstacle, which takes place with good speed and reactivity, allowing fast movements and passages from one point to another of the battlefield, essential for being able to survive in the often very large and stratified areas where the firefights take place. The tactical elements (in Ghost Recon style, so to speak) refer to the management of the team composed of two elements, which can be requested to concentrate fire on particular targets and carry out particular actions such as throwing stun grenades. Rather basic strategic implementations, but which still manage to deepen an otherwise somewhat abused game structure. The two battle companions are also managed by a rather convincing artificial intelligence which makes them valid supports, although in some cases there are slightly too daring behaviors which translate into momentary killings which make it necessary for us to intervene to cure the companion (or the order given to the other comrade to treat the wounded fighter). Even the equipment of the weapons is the classic one of the shooter with a military setting, with rather faithful reconstructions of rifles and machine guns that really existentities that in the heat of the action are distinguished mainly on the basis of the differences in damage done and the tendency at short and long range (the classic variants of the more or less heavy machine gun, pistol, shotgun, grenade launcher and sniper rifle according to the canon like that) and various types of grenades. Moral dilemmas in the dunes The other characterizing elements of the gameplay of Spec Ops: The Line, for the rest rather lying on standardized models in this generation of ~cover~ TPS, are mainly linked to the width of the battlefield, which often develops along vertical and allows for a variable approach to the enemy and vice versa. The commands given to the team, although basic and simple as focusing on a particular objective at a time, therefore take on a certain sense when you find yourself in the possibility of lurking behind different covers at different levels, often moving from one point to another. In the same way, it must be said that even the enemies attempt the approach in different ways, without skimping on grenades and also particular types of ~bayonet~ assaults which sometimes force hand-to-hand clashes. Nothing particularly irresistible at the medium difficulty level, but raising this the challenge certainly becomes stimulating. Another peculiar introduction is the constant and pervasive presence of sand. The element, initially underestimated but which later became a real cataclysm that led to the collapse of Dubai, is found as an integral part of the landscape, a changing and threatening scenario but in some cases also advantageous and foldable to one's own purposes. In fact, at various times it is possible to destroy glass walls or ceilings to let large masses of sand enter which can thus fall on the enemies and conclude a battle with a great saving of ammunition. The idea is interesting, the points in which it is implemented are resolved in spectacular scenes, but these are strongly pre-established moments, classically scripted, which do not quite convey the idea of alternative solutions always at hand. The spectacular sandstorms also fall within careful direction, which periodically rise over Dubai and within which it becomes practically impossible to orientate, give orders to the team and precisely hit the enemy. They are highly scenographic episodes, during which survival becomes even more complicated and the main objective becomes to find shelter as soon as possible. Similarly, the other great introduction of the team, i.e. the possibility of making some choices of a moral order during the course of the story, is partially crippled by a certain lack of depth for the purposes of the plot and the game structure, but we must also consider the general context of the shooter, which hardly allows for such layered evolutions. We are placed in front of some emotionally involving situations, with the possibility of choosing the life of some individuals or whether or not to trust the characters encountered along the way. The classic boundary between the ~good~ and the ~bad~ choice blurs in a loss of reference points, echoed by the comments of fellow soldiers who do not spare harsh criticisms of our behavior and this raises perplexity, confronts us with choices and evaluations of a depth that we hardly find in a shooter. Everything is then resolved in a few effective crossroads which in any case do not considerably change the story as a whole, but the attempt is certainly admirable and enjoyable. Story-driven war Such a solid and structured campaign, although not excessively long (it remains within 10 hours on its first passage), obviously represents the fulcrum of the playful offer of Spec Ops: The Line, which in being so deeply guided by the narrative and from the particular figure of the main character it consequently excludes the presence of other players within this mode. It is rather strange, however, that the developers have not included the possibility of playing it in cooperative multiplayer, given the constant presence of the two teammates of the Delta patrol. The objects to be collected scattered throughout the levels also contribute to this narrative superstructure. Instead of being simple extras for the obsessed with completion and unlockable achievements, the objects each carry a small fragment of the story, sometimes in the first person by the protagonist, in other cases as a recording and testimony by other characters, contributing to a reconstruction of the background and to a choral narration similar in some ways to that seen in Bioshock with his recorded tapes. Within a predominantly ~story-driven~ arrangement, multiplayer represents a distinctly separate sector from the Campaign experience. The game modes are the classic, academic ones: deathmatch, team deathmatch and more complex options to unlock, such as missions with objectives in multiplayer, thus placing interesting elements of progression beyond the increase in experience from clash to clash that allows to specialize and customize your fighter. The sector defends itself well, proposing a mixed style between Gears of War and tactical elements (substantially taking up the examples of the basic structure) that works and entertains, but compared to the solidity of the Campaign, so closely connected with the narrative substrate, it appears as an addition imposed, inserted due to the prevailing market needs. It's certainly not a bad thing, but it's struggling a bit to find its identity in a crowded market which, on the multiplayer front, can offer better choices. Xbox 360 goals 50 goals for 1000 points represents the classic loot to be collected within the game. Most of the achievements are located within the single-player Campaign, with some of these linked to the progression in the story, and in a certain sense obligatory, and many others obtainable only through particular performances in battle. A smaller part is reserved for multiplayer modes, so the big hunt is open especially on the single player front. However, most of the points are collected with a not too much effort, although the full loot requires some effort. Relentless sun This Yager title is also part of the huge dynasty of the children of the Unreal Engine, yet the lineage is not as clear as in many other games. Of course, the effects and textures can easily be traced back to the classic repertoire of the Epic graphics engine, but overall the German developers have managed to build an original setting, which also due to its decidedly atypical elements hardly falls into the cauldron of the already seen and the derivative. The relentless sun pervades the scene within the wide open spaces and creates stark contrasts within the crumbling structures, with shafts of light, cut shadows and glare effects in the transitions from the dark interiors to the open stages. The continuous entering and exiting of the structures, as well as the state of abandonment and destruction of these, creates a sort of continuity of the setting between the open and closed spaces, which helps not to crystallize the action and instead propose continuous passages from battles short-range to broad-based ones. The strange effect that strikes when you look out the windows, or you are on the edge of a huge sand canyon that could once have been a busy road in Dubai, with the peaks of skyscrapers sticking out of the sand and all their extension that sinks into the moat, is truly something special, which creates a feeling of alienation typical of fantastic or science fiction sets but remaining somehow anchored to current reality, showing what could be an alternative reality, catastrophic but free from the classic iconography of the genre encoded from disaster movies or similar. Not to mention the disorienting effect that causes the progressive darkening of the tones of the story which is reflected in some truly disturbing moments, which a military-realistic game can hardly reach. Also noteworthy is the strident contrast created between the misery in which the survivors are forced to live and the still evident traces of the Baroque opulence of certain decaying interiors. In detail, we note a fluctuating quality of the graphics in some cases, with occasional falls in style as regards the quality of the textures or the management of the lights, in some cases also linked to certain intrinsic idiosyncrasies of the Unreal Engine, among which we can include a certain static nature of the scenarios that offer limited, prearranged and sometimes scripted interactions as in the case of the use of sand accumulated on the surfaces to be poured on the enemies. The soundtrack is remarkable, offering more or less progressive rock songs, basically 70s, recovering the Apocalypse Now-style atmosphere here too with non-trivial choices. The dubbing is entirely localized in Italian with excellent results.", "date": "2012-06-26", "grade": "8.0"}
