{"name": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3_c.html", "text": "A too hasty conversion The main problem of THPS3 for GameCube is certainly that of being a somewhat botched conversion. Firstly, the online multiplayer intended for the PS2 version is gone here. But THPS3 loses points compared to its PS2 counterpart also due to a control system which, explicitly designed to work on a Dual Shock 2, does not run as naturally on the cube controller (although remaining, mind you, highly intuitive and functional ). Finally, it is difficult to turn a blind eye to the graphic proposal of the game: by hastening the conversion from PS2 to release the title at the launch of the Nintendo cube, the programmers have maintained the same, identical graphic of the original, failing to make the aesthetic proposal suitable for a more powerful console like the Cube. The result is what one would define as first generation PS2 graphics, below the average of GameCube titles: low texture mapping resolution, few polygons for the characters and blocky ones for the environments, fluctuating framerate, presence of slowdowns and the The hated PS2 effect that made the blocky outlines of objects so famous that Sony copyrighted the term used to describe them. Only occasionally does the game offer nice aesthetic moments, in the form of luministic routines or pleasant animations of the skaters, devoid of motion capture but equally able to convey a certain realism (nice is also the large bloodshed of the poor skaters' knees which you will make tumbling and bouncing imperceptibly in the paintings). The graphic aspect is therefore disappointing, a ~literal~ conversion that does not suit the possibilities of the purple beast Nintendo. Here are the defects of this title highlighted: now, however, let's get ready to go into the merits of its many strengths. How to buy a CD! Just to revive the fortunes of the audiovisual sector, let's talk a little about the incredible sound put on by the guys from Neversoft. The effects are well produced, as are the ambient sounds and the music in the menus: the grinds on the railings ~scrape~ realistically, the birds chirp near the trees in the provincial town stage, the characters who populate the backdrops protest, dodge, punch and curse us, the menus are accompanied by catchy grooves. The real strong point, however, is the soundtrack, perhaps the best that can be remembered in a video game in terms of relevance and quality: if from the introduction movie with Ace of Spades by Motorhead in the background you will begin to understand that It's all about the usual sound, when you find yourself bouncing to the tune of Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones or aggressively grinding to the latest hit by Alien Ant Farm or the Rollins Band you'll be sure you'll never turn down the sound and be tempted to immediately plug in your TV on the stereo. With a soundtrack that ranges from great classics such as Motorhead to a wide selection of hardcore, hip hop, rap, punk, funky, rock and new metal, it is no coincidence that this game boasts an official CD with additional contributions on the music market of bands like Nofx and Linkin Park. ~Music from and inspired by THPS3~ is the clear sign of the production commitment poured into this title, and we assure you that grinding to the sound of hardcore is more engaging than ever. On top of the genre Graphics and sound, however, come and go: what matters in the final analysis is simply the factor of playability, involvement, fun that a title manages to express and THPS3 belongs to the category of those games capable of giving great emotions and fun even regardless from the audiovisual sector. The control system, while less intuitive on the purple cube controller, becomes equally second nature. Soon even an absolute beginner of the genre learns to master the physics of the game, to balance the skater and to perform simple tricks. The main game, which is divided into the Career mode, progressively unlocks the available environments, revealing the player's journey step by step based on his learning rate: there is no possibility that you will compete in the skaters competition in Rio, for example , if you can't get that damned pro score in Canada or grind the hot metal bucket in the Foundry first. This time, compared to the second episode, no money: instead you will have to solve certain goals to be able to advance in new environments and so on. Therefore, after a couple of hours of application you will return to the previous frameworks solving the missions that previously appeared imas possible, pulverizing your previous records and unlocking coveted new sections. The Tutorials also prove to be a valuable source of learning for beginners, while the Free Skate mode will allow you to explore the already unlocked frameworks with complete peace of mind: in Career mode you will in fact be bound to precise times to complete the missions. The game is also full of surprises, such as unlockable cinematics and a futuristic bonus level. But the great strengths, which carry an excellent game system within a top-level presentation and variety, are three: Multiplayer modes, with a great variety of challenges and a split screen without slowdowns (unfortunately, however, nothing online multiplayer); the ability to create one or, finally, ONE personal skater, dress him/her and accessorize him/her at will and save any progress; and above all the circuit editor, which allows you to create your own stunt parks tailored to your skater dreams. Ultimately, THPS3 is a title that would be able to excite even those who are not particularly attracted to this genre. For those who, on the other hand, love the genre, it is a top-level title and an important stage for the entire category: the innovations brought about by this third episode can be appreciated to the point of justifying its purchase even by those enthusiasts who already own the second episode. If you have a GameCube buy it without reservations; if, on the other hand, you are among the lucky owners of a GameCube and a PS2, we recommend the version for the Sony monolith, if only for the online multiplayer option omitted here and to punish the production for a superficial conversion, and push the programmers to give their best while waiting for the next chapter. Pros: Simple yet complex gameplay Exceptional learning curve Soundtrack worth buying a CD You can play by headbanging the Motorheads Edit your skater Design your own custom tracks Cons: Low profile graphics Conversion without additions or improvements. No online multiplayer Hawk 3 moves to the Cube If you don't know what a Rail Grind or a Kickflip is and you have never wanted to emulate the exploits of Steve Caballero or Kareem Campbell, there are two possibilities: you have never gone on a skateboard or you have never played an episode of the Tony Hawk saga Pro Skaters. Since the beginning of the first chapter on PSX, the series inspired by the deeds of the now famous Tony Hawk has delighted fans of extreme sports games with playability at the highest levels, a more successful concept of interactivity than many competitors and a graphic sector- sound of the highest level, reaching the third episode with a homogeneous and highly sophisticated game system, simultaneously complex and immediate and capable of giving great satisfaction after an adequate application. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 puts the player in control of the world's most famous skaters in a series of vast, richly interactive environments: the goal is to complete all the required missions, reach the highest high scores, perform the most spectacular acrobatic combinations, unlock other areas and start all over again in a continuous improvement effort that works perfectly with the criterion of progressive accessibility to the levels. In this the saga returns to its roots, abandoning the goal of earning money that was at the center of the second episode, also introducing new features and functions in THPS3. The GameCube conversion does not escape these considerations as it is almost perfect compared to the original for PS2. At the same time, however, it appears open to criticism in certain aspects that we intend to highlight immediately, to then leave room for the right applause that a title of this caliber deserves.", "date": "2002-07-29", "grade": null}
