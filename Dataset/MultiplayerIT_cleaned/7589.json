Anyone who even knows the name of H.P. Lovecraft knows how much his works have influenced the horror imagery that now pervades all or almost all genre productions. Well when we saw the first photos and the first trailers of Source of Madness we do not deny that we were pleasantly surprised and displaced. The procedurally generated tentacled creatures caught our attention as well as the general atmosphere but, and there is a huge but, we had to understand pad in hand if really the good premises were respected in the finished game. Let's also add a little Bloodborne seasoning, as regards the palette and the use of lighting, which never hurts, and you can understand how many expectations we approached playing it with. Let's start straight away with no frills: the game isn't perfect and is full of flaws, but it's definitely fun and like all roguelikes it has a replay value that borders on the obsessive compulsive. The guys at Carry Castle did a great job especially considering that it is a very small team of only 3 people and we feel like praising what has been done by virtue of the difficulties that such a small group of programmers found themselves facing during the development phases. We, however, must try to put all the dots on all the ~i's~ of this Source of Madness. History The main HUB or the ~Tower of Madness~ The lands of Crete have been infested by monsters and horrific creatures and we, as Acolytes of a mysterious sect, will have to be able to get to the source of the madness to try to understand what is happening, trying not to go crazy along the way. The premises are simple and the path of the acolyte is full of pitfalls of any type and kind. We will wake up inside the Torre della Follia displaced and without understanding what to do nor where to go. As we begin to explore this place, we will first find different characters with whom we will have to deal with during our adventure and then, finally, the door that will allow us to access the disturbed world that awaits us with open arms to offer us an incalculable amount of deaths. The background of the character is deliberately sketched for a simple reason: every time we die we will have to say goodbye to that particular protagonist (complete with date of birth and death) to subsequently take possession of another acolyte and start again from the beginning of our journey. Gameplay The few happy islands, the merchants ~Death and rebirth~ is not exactly the most suitable motto for the Carry Castle title, as, as mentioned, we will never have the same playable character available. Let's explain ourselves better: once we die we will take control of another acolyte, male or female, with exactly the same appearance as the previous one, thus giving continuity to the gameplay. Obviously, like all self-respecting roguelikes, even here, once the run is over, all the equipment collected will be lost due to having to restart ~clean~ from inside the Tower. The peculiarity is that each time we will carry with us the currency that we managed to obtain during the previous attempt to be able to unlock bonuses in a sort of spherography inside the main hub. These vary from passive skills, active or upgraded starting equipment or even special classes that can be unlocked after visiting the related altars during our happy raids. Each class obviously has its own peculiarities and particular abilities: the pyromancer, for example, after taking the shot, leaves behind a ball of fire which explodes after a few moments, damaging enemies, but also us. Speaking of skills, the equipment and intrinsic skills of each class take care of differentiating each game; we will have some slots available where we can place offensive or defensive objects such as rings, hoods, stones or even summonable contraptions that will help us by shooting magical shots, both by following us and by being able to position them as defensive turrets. All equipment is divided into classes ranging from common to legendary with a fairly generous drop rate especially from the second part of the game onwards. A procedural map set outdoors There are checkpoints at the end of each of the nine biomes available, in which you can save the game and fill the healing flasks, which can also be unlocked from the skill tree. During our ~attempts~ we will not have a moment of respite, apart from those small happy islands representedenter the various shops scattered around the maps, usually before the bosses or mini bosses. Within them we will be able to buy equipment from two merchants, one normal and one ~special~, using the same coins as currency that we will then have to use to buy upgrades. This is precisely one of the most interesting mechanics: in fact, we will have to decide whether to save on the purchase to obtain upgrades after the next (safe) death, or, on the contrary, whether to sell everything we have to take those 2 or 3 upgrades that they will allow us to defeat the boss and continue in the story which, incidentally, will have a variable duration from 8 to 12 hours, depending on our skills. Technique and style The skill tree Every single pixel of the game exudes Lovecraft and love for his works. All enemies are procedurally generated and this constantly puts you in front of different dangers to approach differently. Procedurality that is also exploited to create the game environments and certainly gives its best in open spaces or in any case with buildings, really interesting and fun to explore, while heavily showing its side to criticism when it comes to enclosed spaces such as caves and caves. Here, in fact, a bit of originality and diversity is lost. Net of the design and combat system ideas, unfortunately we have to point out some problems that have heavily affected the experience. The first is precisely one of the strengths and that is the random generation of enemies. The idea behind the AI that generates the monsters is very interesting, but unfortunately they are so ~tentaculous~ that the vast majority of the time it is not clear from which side the blows you receive come from and it becomes frustrating when we are 3 or 4 of them on you and you can't move for who knows what particular reason. In addition we must point out the lack of characterization of these monsters that are all quite the same. Perhaps inserting some ~special~ monsters other than those created procedurally, apart from the bosses, would have benefited the overall experience. As well as the general quality of the sprites and effects, not exactly the best compared to the general invoice of the title, however more than acceptable. The maps are almost all of a good standard, even if they don't make a miracle cry, but considering the random generation, the development team has certainly done a very good job. A separate discussion for the main hub, the Torre della Follia: far too large and empty, with few possible interactions and with the areas too far apart. Perhaps we are too used to it in recent years, but certainly shortening the distances to reach the various characters and doors would have benefited the pace of the game. Another negative note must be made to the general gameplay, with our acolyte who is perhaps a little too ~light~ and not perfectly animated. His cloak then seems to mix the various animations giving a sense of sketchy which is not exactly pleasant. From the point of view of the audio we are not yet sufficient with the soundtrack which is however pleasant, but the sounds and the cries of the monsters are the only thing that remains in the lead, being totally disproportionate in terms of volume balance; we had to remove the headphones very often to try to muffle the cries of the creatures.", "date": "2022-05-11", "grade": "6.7"}
