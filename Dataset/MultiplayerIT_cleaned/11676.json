{"name": "SimCity Societies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simcity-societies.html", "text": "The first mobile episode of the saga (promptly reviewed by Wirelessgaming) was quite convincing, managing to re-propose all the peculiar characteristics of the original on PC within a quite adequate interface: certainly, however, there was ample room for improvement, both regarding the latter aspect, both in terms of cosmetic richness. Well, this SimCity Societies definitely starts off on the right foot, immediately hitting the user with massive upgrades in the two sectors mentioned above. Graphically, the EA Mobile work presents the classic isometric view, which however this time is accompanied by two-dimensional structures with attention to the smallest details and embellished with bright colors, in stark contrast to the dull colors of the previous episode. Also worth mentioning are the menus, elegant and complete at the same time, whose navigation is made simple and intuitive by an excellent control system: in addition to the directional cross and the 'OK' key used to move the cursor and perform various actions, SimCity Societes only uses the '1', '2' and '3' keys. respectively delegated to the opening of the windows relating to the statistics of the Sims, the city and the company. Three elements that constitute the keystone of the gameplay of the EA Mobile product: unlike the various prequels, in fact, this time the emphasis is not placed so much on building an efficient town, but rather on the well-being of citizens. The play structure has therefore been lightened of the more strictly ~technical~ aspects (for example, it is no longer necessary to build roads and electrical connections, while the financial part is considerably simplified) to ensure that the player concentrates his attention on the quality of the life of the inhabitants. Each action performed will therefore be weighted bearing in mind the three levels of statistics described above: a wind farm will therefore provide work to many Sims and energy to the city, but will reduce the levels of happiness and beauty of the landscape Again, a hospital will increase the standards of well-being but will consume a considerable amount of electricity, while a stadium will have a negative impact on pollution and city traffic, but will make everyone satisfied. In short, although the objectives are slightly different, even in this SimCity Societies it is very important to use the right measure, although the user is completely free to do what he likes, bearing in mind, however, that one's decisions are reflected in the very aspect of the city: consequently, a liberal society is reflected in a sunny and welcoming metropolis, while a dictatorship will lead to a gray and gloomy urban landscape. Equipped with a Free Play mode and a Scenario section made up of eight different challenges, SimCity Societies is a fun and satisfying game, whose only major flaw perhaps lies in the excessive simplification of some management aspects, which can make people turn up their noses genre purists.
