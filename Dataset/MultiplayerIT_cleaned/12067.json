HAL basically took pure simulation into its own hands, added a dash of Marble Madness into the aesthetics and finally infused all of this copiously with the metamorphic amenities typical of Kirby's brand. Basically there was minigolf, with courses and holes and a control system calibrated on the classics of the Olympic games, with the bars to be stopped at the right time, the speeds and angles of the case. But in between there was everything else: a series of enemies to be blasted with shots of Kirby rolling, who acted as a ball, and the transformations and special abilities that Kirby could take on by overwhelming the aforementioned enemies, instead of engulfing them as per his more typical habits. A certain longevity was ensured not only by the variety of the hole system, which went out of its way to present the final hole of the situation only at the end of the massacre of the enemies with half a pink ball, but also by the relatively high amount of effort required by the title. Everything was presented with a decidedly pastel and relaxing aesthetic style, vaguely fairytale-like and ironic, lifted from the world of Kirby to color the sporting idea with all the paciocco gaiety, according to many instigator of episodes of acute ultra-violence, of the HAL character . What is it today Kirby's Dream Course, despite the originality and cohesion of the game design, did not achieve the success it deserved. Probably, this is due to the lack of appeal of the basic theme of the game compared to the killer applications of the time or the simple concept of ~cool game~. Moreover, there are not a few who remember well nodding with tears in their eyes for joy in front of the famous end credits of an episode of The Simpsons in which Bart finds himself, despite himself, without the hit videogame of the moment to settle for the fabulous golf title 'Ammazza, che Mazza' (pencil included). That the blame for this historic failure is attributable to this, in any case, matters little. In fact, forget about golf. Kirby's Dream Course uses the exciting minigolf as a simple starting point to build original tracks, full of gimmicks, complex and sometimes labyrinthine, infusing them with transformations and frenzy. The control system is decidedly solid, and the learning curve is old-school: everyone starts having fun right away, but only the best go home with gold after a lot of effort. Impacting an unfortunate enemy with a pink ball and stealing his power to make lightning bolts in order to then blast other enemies and finally put Kirby in the hole is something that remains fun despite the time (if you persist in the stupid belief that old games should be abandoned as such) and despite golf (in case it's not our favorite sport). For this reason, Kirby's Dream Course represents the typical forgotten, misunderstood or underestimated title that the Wii Virtual Console can have the merit of bringing to light from the oblivion in which it has been unjustly relegated by the general public and most of the critics. Published in 1995 for SuperNES, perhaps unjustly condemned to a long decade of oblivion, Kirby's Dream Course is a rather original title to be rediscovered, halfway between golf and action-puzzle, now available on the Wii catalog for 800 points .", "date": "2007-08-10", "grade": null}
