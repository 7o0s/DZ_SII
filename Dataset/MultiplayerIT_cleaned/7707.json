Starting from a project linked to a competition dedicated to indie developers, here comes Futuridium EP, a particular 3D shooter characterized by a graphic style that recalls the typical atmospheres of the 80s space shooter, filtered through an original vision: the use of geometric shapes and sharp colors, the volumes built in a relatively simple way are properly alien in this way, like the archaic three-dimensional structures of the first polygonal games. But be careful, we are not talking about a product that is all aesthetics and no substance, a fine exercise in style more devoted to visual performance than to gameplay: this is a solid and bloody challenging shooter, with a level of challenge that cannot be found in the mobile sector. find easily. Not only that, from the first minutes of the game it is clear how Futuridium EP emanates vibrations that a real gamer cannot ignore: starting from the clear reference to the classic Uridium for Commodore 64, we go through the memory of Star Fox and Zaxxon as a general setting and graphic style up to the Star Wars ~trench run~ suggestions, with the grazing flight on the huge spaceships in search of the nucleus to be destroyed which will easily recall the historic X-Wing race in the Death Star channel, in search of the elusive ~light unloading~. In short, a beautiful medley of charms ready to capture, in particular, those who in the 80s and 90s were already well immersed in star wars made of pixels. Yet, even in this mixture of suggestions, the MixedBag game still manages to emerge with its own specific identity, which especially in the iOS context stands out with its old-school shooter spirit and in the cut - allow us the term - ~hardcore~. Futuridium EP is a challenge from the past set in an audiovisual context of great impact Race against yourself The challenge against oneself is the core of the experience, starting from the desperate search for survival to reach the heights of the high score, Futuridium EP places us in front of the classic elements of the video game: constant danger, maximum precision of movements, limited time and Game Over looming. To immerse yourself in such a typically videogame world, a few words are enough, because the narrative substrate and the verbose presentations have little to do with the classic space shooter, at the limit we can mentalize the story in The Last Starfighter style in our own way between a game and the other, like in the old days. In the game we find ourselves driving a ship sucked into a particular space dimension populated by huge ships to be destroyed. The game mechanic is a rather faithful update of Uridium's gameplay but transported in a three-dimensional environment, therefore it is necessary to fly grazing the complex surfaces of these cruisers, dangerously skimming the protrusions and geometric extensions and trying to destroy the colored cubes of which they are sprinkled. This is the only way to recharge the star ship's energy and to reveal, once all the cubes have been eliminated, the main core of the large ships so that they can be destroyed. The concept is simple but its execution quite complex, since the trajectories to follow to hit the cubes require maneuvers at the limit of perfection to avoid crashing on the surfaces, while the spacecraft's energy decreases continuously, representing in fact an extremely time limit little to complete the levels. Precisely the difficulty and the basic simplicity, although characteristic elements of the game, can also represent the limit of Futuridium EP in an enlarged market such as the mobile one, directing the product towards more consummate gamers, looking for a serious, demanding and without many challenges frills. The controls represent another good intuition from MixedBag, proposing, instead of the notorious ~virtual pad~ a system of ~rub~ gestures on the touch screen to move the spacecraft, a pressure area dedicated to shooting and another to the 180-degree change of direction, another element derived directly from the old Andrew Braybrook title. The system works well on the iPad but there are some difficulties on the iPhone screen, where the proximity between the two different pressure areas can lead to pressing in the wrong place at the wrong time, even if the problem can be solved with updates. In the end,a particular mention should be made for the soundtrack: the ~EP~ in the title refers precisely to the presence of a soundtrack of a certain thickness, with 45 minutes of electronic music in 11 tracks that can be selected during the game like in a jukebox. A selection that, regardless of musical tastes, is perfectly amalgamated with the graphic style and ~retrofuturistic~ atmosphere of the game.", "date": "2013-07-24", "grade": "8.5"}
