The subscription service of the Cupertino house, since its debut, has represented a sort of safe haven for gamers interested in mobile platforms, but looking for experiences that do not necessarily have to be subjected to the often devastating logic of freemium and online purchases. -app. Crossy Road Castle takes up the same universe and the same aesthetic characterization of the previous Crossy Road, a fun endless runner based on the Frogger concept and released over 5 years ago and capable of enjoying enormous success. In this case, however, the game mechanics are totally different, much more structured and complex, thus giving life to a title that stands out as one of the best ever available on Apple Arcade today. This time it's a platformer! If Crossy Road was a very pleasant but extremely casual game and linked to typical mobile gaming mechanics, Crossy Road Castle is instead an experience that would not disfigure at all even on more ~noble~ systems. It is basically a platformer set in a castle, or rather in the Unicorn Tower, where each room is a mini level. The goal is to reach the exit door to go to the next room, but obviously it's easier said than done: if some areas are actually simple to overcome, in others it takes a greater effort. The gameplay solutions are many and varied, although almost always based on quotes from much more famous predecessors: the platforming is in fact precise and satisfying like in Super Mario and the enemies are eliminated by jumping on their heads, there are barrels from which to be shot as in Donkey Kong, coins to collect and secret rooms to discover. And then again mobile and disappearing platforms, spikes and traps to avoid, bosses to face (damn giant eagle!) and so on. Everything works great even with touch controls, proof of the very careful work of the team, but traditional controllers are obviously also supported. Better in company However, what distinguishes Crossy Road Castle from most similar games is the possibility of being faced in local multiplayer up to 4 players. We are talking about possibilities, but in reality it would be better to say necessity, because the title of Hipster Whale takes flight precisely when the adventure is shared with at least one companion. In fact, the level design offers more than one interesting starting point to take advantage of the presence of several characters at the same time, in a cooperative key that often cracks in the noisy and hilarious anarchy of progression. The funniest thing is in fact the chaos that is unleashed with multiple players engaged in such small environments: despite the foundations of the experience pointing to collaboration, even more so in the face of the 3 shared lives that are lost when all the players die inside of the same level, it is inevitable that between a poorly calculated jump and a more or less accidentally pressed switch, one often ends up getting in the way. The laughs, in short, will hardly be missing. The only limitation in all of this is linked to the fact that, in order to play together with other people, everyone must have their own iOS device with an Apple Arcade subscription and the app installed. All devices must also be under the same wi-fi network. In short, not exactly the best of accessibility, even if the possibility of sharing a single Apple Arcade subscription with members of one's family makes things easier in this sense. Chickens with hats Crossy Road Castle is also an irresistible game from an aesthetic point of view, with the blocky and colorful ~Crossy Road~ style that manages to guarantee a distinct and particular characterization to the product. The list of characters including cats, unicorns, ducks, chickens, pigs and so on, all with wide eyes and with their verses, are an integral and essential part of the formula. The initial set can then be expanded precisely through the coins and tokens that they are collected during the levels: both, once obtained in sufficient numbers, allow you to activate Gashapon from which to unlock or new characters or headgear (yes, exactly) with which to embellish your protagonist. Because a chicken in a purple top hat is definitely more glamorous. The defects of Crossy Road Castle can therefore be summarized in the lesser appeal of the single sessions and a certain inevitable repetitiveness in the long run, even if the arrival via update of a second tower with levels, characters,completely new accessories and bosses. The sound is also excellent, with perfectly timed songs and effects. Finally, for the record, we add that there is no type of in-app purchase or similar, as per the standard rule of Apple Arcade.", "date": "2020-03-07", "grade": "9.0"}
