Virtua Tennis 4, a revised and corrected version, or rather a pocket port of the title for the flagship consoles released last spring, makes a fine show among sportsmen next to FIFA. The arcade setting has remained the same, as has the structure of the Career, while the mini-games and some ~goodies~ implemented specifically for the new Sony console are completely new. But how to play Virtua Tennis 4? The setting is the arcade one, with the shots arranged on the front buttons of the console. Like at home There is no need to load the shots as in Grand Slam Tennis, everything revolves around the timing and above all on the positioning of the athlete when hitting the ball. Missing the moment of the opening of the shot means canceling potential winning shots, with high and slow lifted balls that will be the coveted prey of baseline shooters. A very simple mechanism, anomalous forehands and precise passers are executed with relative ease, something that will delight all those looking for immediacy and immediate gratification. Choice also corroborated by the special shots that are activated by loading a bar that increases with the execution of techniques related to the specialization chosen for the tennis player and which, once full, is able to release a devastating power shot to which the opponent hardly will be able to respond properly. Regarding the Career we find ourselves moving a pawn within a vast map that represents the athlete's path in the world launched towards climbing the rankings. The pawn moves on squares placed on different paths, which can be followed by choice, each of which represents a different event in the sportsman's life, including training sessions, exhibitions, tournaments or even meetings with fans and opportunities to relax. Movement on the grid takes place through discards imposed by some cards that are drawn by lot and contain the number of boxes on which we can pass, generating a random and forced element in the movement of the character, with the possibility of choosing between three different cards and therefore plan the journey of our sample to a minimum. Thanks to the many things to do, the relative short duration of the minor tournaments and the many training mini-games, the Career works decidedly well and lends itself perfectly to a fragmented use such as that of a portable console, with the plus of a marked replayability by varying the movements and above all the styles of play. Playstation 3 trophies Virtua Tennis 4 rewards the player with 49 trophies that are collected without any particular problems with the simple progression in the game. Each mode, each type therefore commits us to the bottom to unlock the trophies, even with ~daring~ actions such as saving ten eggs in a row in one of the mini-games or detonating 20 bombs. Keys or thumb? The only substantial innovations for this PlayStation Vita version are some activities that involve both the console's motion sensors and its touch peculiarities, such as first-person matches that require us to move the console to keep our eyes focused on the field, VS for two players with a top view to play in point of index finger or Acque Agitate in which by tilting the console we also tilt the targets arranged on a ship. So nothing to tear your clothes off for but small introductions that still entertain, they are not just pastimes that expire quickly after the wow effect. The same thing cannot be said for the touch screen controls, front and rear, thanks to which it is possible to move around the field and hit the ball. They are basically of little use, they don't have the same responsiveness (and precision) as the front keys and these are one more that we didn't miss. From a visual point of view, the work done by the developers is excellent and what was said a few days ago for Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 is valid. The Vita screen returns a clear and vibrant image, perhaps without the special effects of the Capcom fighting game, but with texture hyper detailed, just look at the licensed tennis players that are really indistinguishable from the real ones. A completely satisfying picture, beautiful to look at, fluid and perfectly animated, a nice calling card for the Sony console.", "date": "2012-02-23", "grade": "8.0"}
