{"name": "Pathologic - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pathologic-recensione.html", "text": "The view is in first person and recalls that of the shooters of the second half of the nineties: as can be achieved by scrolling through the images accompanying the review, obtained in as much detail as possible, the technical realization betrays the economic and personnel constraints with which it is the project was carried forward. It is enough to know that the software house is made up of about ten programmers; for this reason we do not feel like judging the graphic aspect too heavily, despite the fact that the polygons are decidedly scarce and the animations approximate, the play of light non-existent as well as the shadows of objects and NPCs, the characterization of the landscape and unsatisfactory characters. The color palette remains to be saved, in which dull colors such as ocher and olive green prevail, which manages to manage discreetly and manages to convey the surreal city atmosphere. The characteristic aspect of this ~human behavior simulator~ (as the Ice-pick Lodge programmers define it) derives from the fact that, in addition to dealing with the mysteries that surround the unknown Russian village, the player must keep the vital functions at bay own alter ego. This means that, during the 24 hours (which pass faster than in reality), you have to eat, sleep and heal yourself from the symptoms of the epidemic, which become more and more evident as the days go by, until the bizarre inhabited center is transformed into a real open-air cemetery. Clothes, medicines and food can be bought from the numerous shopkeepers in the area, being careful to avoid those who are better at looking after their own interests. Instead, with children playing in the street, you can swap junk (needles, razors...) for other objects that appear useless to their naive eyes, such as bullets, medicines of various types and so on. The backbone of Pathologic are the dialogues: there are dozens of lines of text (all excellently translated by Blue Label, an example to be compared even for the noble colleagues from across the Channel) which in most cases are mutually exclusive. The reactions of key interlocutors essentially depend on the reputation that accompanies us, and it is not always possible to make the discourse take the desired turn. Let's face it, Pathologic is certainly not the type of game for which there was the classic crowd in the editorial office. Arrived decidedly quietly in Italy thanks to the Blue Label distributor, unfortunately the 25 honors he was able to earn in his native Russia in 2005, the original year of publication, were not adequately recognized in the Old Continent. Categorizing Pathologic in one of the classic genres we are used to would not do justice to a title that makes originality one of its strong points - starting from the plot, which deals with an adult and delicate topic: what comes after the death? How can it be defeated and what lies behind the strange epidemic that is about to decimate a remote village in northern Russia? Answering these and many other questions is the task of the three protagonists: the Graduate, the Soothsayer and the Devout. The choice of character influences the style of play and allows you to experience the same adventure from different points of view; missions and sub-quests vary, while it is always necessary to arrive at the resolution of the final arcane within twelve days of the start. The typical day includes a primary task to be compulsorily completed and a series of secondary mandates, most of which are timed, thanks to which money or other useful rewards can be obtained. There may be more ways to achieve the objectives even if the limited interaction with the environment means that everything is almost always resolved with an exchange of jokes or, at worst, fist fights. The fighting aspect is marginal  and it's for the best. Given the shortage of ammunition and the toughness of the bad guys, you fight mainly with your bare hands (or with a few knives). The artificial intelligence cannot be said to be superfine and can be easily circumvented with the usual hit and run tactic: in practice, the enemy is hit and retreats so that he is unable to respond to the punch immediately. Clearly things aren't that simple when facing multiple opponents at the same time; however, apart from a couple of occasions where violence is explicitly required, it is up to the player to decide if and when to fight. Going out at night to eliminate thugs may not be a safe idea, but it is an easy way to raise money easily. The longevity aspect is partially limited by the aforementioned shortcomings, but it is appreciated by those who let themselves be seduced by the plot. Relive the same aadventure from different points of view, to better understand the personality of certain characters or more materially to be able to attend all four available endings is an incentive that allows Pathologic to guarantee a long stay on the hard disk. The music changes (in the truest sense of the word) with the audio apparatus; the dubbing of the protagonists (always in English) is sufficient while the soundtrack would really be a nomination - a pity for the small number of tracks which could become too repetitive in the long run. The game structure itself is in turn the subject of chiaroscuro. Among the most successful aspects, the robust script is highlighted above all, which invites the player to continue (and perhaps even to replay) to understand who the thread weaver is behind the ~sand plague~. The interweaving of power between the most powerful families, the double-dealing of apparently harmless and fragile figures, the continuous twists and turns that follow one another from the first moments, are excellently told by a first-rate plot that keeps alive the curiosity of the adventurer  and this is certainly the best compliment that can be paid to an adventure. The downside is represented by some design choices that make the otherwise impeccable work of the programmers slip. The most annoying and obvious concerns the location of the key characters: practically all the missions have been structured in such a way as to make the player travel as much road as possible. From the moment in which the only method to move from one corner of the city to another is represented by one's own legs, one will soon realize how many hours (this time real) it takes to cross the various alleys a thousand times just to get entrust a mission. System requirements Minimum requirements Windows 98/Windows ME/Windows 2000/Windows XP Pentium III 1000 MHz 256 MB RAM NVIDIA GeForce 2 / ATI Radeon 7500 2 GB hard disk space DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card Conclusions An adventure dedicated to true enthusiasts, Pathologic sees its immense potential limited by the inexperience of too small a group of programmers. Anyone who manages to overlook the visible flaws will obtain a gratifying and prolonged experience, such as has not been experienced on PC monitors for a long time. Waiting for a new and (hopefully) more engaging gaming experience: this adventure hides the seeds of a vote very close to the double digits.
