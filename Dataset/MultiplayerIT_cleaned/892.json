Titles that marked the youth of most of our readers; productions perhaps unknown to the youngsters, who however will certainly be able to appreciate the main characteristics, find out where the historical sagas are from, and spend hours having fun provided they obviously contextualize the package offered by Capcom. So let's analyze in detail this new, curious edition of titles from the less recent past: what does it have to offer compared to other similar packages? We tell you about it in our review of Capcom Arcade Stadium. The contents Capcom Arcade Stadium: You recognize the game in question, don't you? REAL?! Naturally, let's start with the contents, which represent the most interesting aspect of Capcom Arcade Stadium and obviously what distinguishes it from many other similar collections, such as SNK 40th Anniversary Collection and Konami's Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection. Capcom Arcade Stadium: The arcade comes to life, even visually The thirty video games what you will find in Capcom Arcade Stadium are Vulgus, Strider, Warriors of Fate, Pirate Ship Higemaru, Dynasty Wars, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, 1942, Final Fight, Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Commando, 1941: Counter Attack, Powered Gear: Strategic Variant Armor Equipment, Section Z, Senjo no Okami II, Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness, Tatakai no Banka, Mega Twins, 19XX: The War Against Destiny, Legendary Wings, Carrier Air Wing, Battle Circuit, Bionic Commando, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, Giga Wing, Forgotten Worlds, Captain Commando, 1944 The Loop Master, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Varth: Operation Thunderstorm, Progear. In short, all classics that have appeared in arcades since 1984 ranging from action-platform to fighting game, passing through the shooter. It wouldn't be a Capcom package without the ubiquitous Street Fighter 2 and Ghouls 'n Ghosts, but great absentees such as Three Wonders, Area 88 (U.N. Squadron), Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The King of Dragons are still missing - no doubt due to rights issues , Willow and Aliens vs. Predator. Note the fact that all this goodness does not necessarily have to be purchased in a single solution at the price of around 40 euros: you can also opt for ~smaller packs~, each offered at the price of fifteen euros and including about ten titles, organized by year: 1984-88, 1989-92, 1992-2001. Playstation 4 trophies Capcom Arcade Stadium offers quite a few trophies to unlock, some more general, others related to the individual titles in the package; definitely an ~extra gear~ to enjoy the pearls of the less recent past. We also advise you to try out all the customizations available, at least once: in addition to being fundamental, they are essential for completing the trophy list! The conversion to PlayStation 4 Capcom Arcade Stadium and one of its filters Last February, Capcom Arcade Stadium was already available on Nintendo Switch, with merits (portability) and limitations (the controllers) of the case. For our part, we therefore had the opportunity to test the conversion on PlayStation 4 well. Predictably, the game remains substantially identical, and although the DualShock 4 is more comfortable than the Joy-Con (but not necessarily the Pro Controller and its directional cross), the ideal would be to own an arcade stick. After all, Capcom's title constantly reminds him through its interface, which from the very beginning tries to recreate the environment of an old arcade. Capcom Arcade Stadium, it is also possible to ~glimpse~ the nearby cabinets From a technical point of view, then, Capcom Arcade Stadium is irreproachable: the emulation does not present any kind of problem, and allows you to select the European or Japanese rom; no slowdowns or tearing problems occurred in our sessions, with an imperceptible input lag, if any; the interface is also lively, and switching from one cabinet to another is a matter of a few seconds. It would be almost useless to point out that, since we are dealing with a re-proposition of old games in their original guise (and therefore not remasters), there are no aesthetic embellishments and only the hub and the menus are in high resolution, while the individual titles scale the resolution by proposing the adventures as they were enjoyed at the time on cabin cruisers on the beach, in bars or in the arcade. Capcom Arcade Stadium offers some old gems However, the aesthetic customization options are inevitable, ranging from filters that simulate cathode ray tube screens, passing through smallo the precautions that embellish the package, without really revolutionizing it compared to what has been seen in the past with similar collections. In fact, it is possible to customize the difficulty level of the cabinets, rewind time in the event of death or slow down or speed up the experience, as well as obviously the possibility of having infinite tokens. However, we also noticed a bit of confusion between all these settings and between the various game menus; navigating through the options is certainly not the most intuitive element of the game, which in an inelegant way prefers to bombard the player with numerous messages and guides at the very first start.", "date": "2021-05-21", "grade": "S.V."}
