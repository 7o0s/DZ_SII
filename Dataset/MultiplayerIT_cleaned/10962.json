A type of game that by now many know well thanks to the episode released on Nintendo DS. With this version for Wii, Nintendo absolutely did not want to delve into the different facets that make up the game, despite many of the features of the Wii would have fit perfectly, and more than anything else it seems that it has packaged a product with the intention of starting the whole brand the new user of the Wii. For historical fans, things have hardly changed, but it is still difficult to resist its charm thanks to the introduction of voice chat on the Nintendo Wii. We look back The path taken by Nintendo for the Wii version of Animal Crossing was to recycle practically everything, and in fact this choice is not new if we consider that the game has never evolved from the GameCube era, or from the Nintendo import version 64. The work done on the Wii is mostly that of converting the portable episode, without worrying about taking advantage of any of the features of the Wii (Wiimote, Wifi Connetion, computing capacity, etc) and putting his hand mostly to what on Nintendo DS it had not been possible due to technical limitations. Finding yourself faced with a deliberately antiquated style and graphics engine is not surprising at all, given that the technical aspect has never been a quirk of the game, but what leaves a bitter taste in the mouth the most is that nothing has been done to take the game to another level. No new introductions, no new interactions, and this time not even any major changes in the possibilities offered by the village other than the one constituted by the city. The city is a sort of square where some activities that previously resided in the village have been transferred, and where itinerant characters have taken up residence. For example, the vendor Volpolo, Griffa the Giraffe, and Vanda the fortune teller can now be found in the city, without necessarily having to wait for the exact day of their arrival. However, many of their services are not updated for a week, thus making their services more accessible, but not more numerous. Even Frodolo the insurer has found a place in the city and now manages the ABC Academy, the one that has always valued the beauty of your home. One foot in two brackets What Nintendo did with the WiiConnect24 is probably a big mess. It has created a system capable of being connected at all times, and yet, from the service's inception until now, we have only seen software that connects only when requested. It almost seems that Nintendo doesn't know which path to take, whether the one devoted to full online play or that of optional services, which don't take away too much from those who want to do without them. After the announcement of the Wii's innovative features everyone thought of Animal Crossing as a test bed for the WiiConnect24 , but even in this case Nintendo was stingy with ambitions. Perhaps due to technical limitations or perhaps due to a too marked recycling of the libraries of the series, this episode also connects online only by requesting it at the gate. A little bit if we consider the fact that the game could communicate with the internet even with the console off. If the connection is active, and if the memory is accessible, there shouldn't be too many problems downloading a ~switched off~ village and re-saving its changes at the end of the game. What's the point of setting up such a service if for each access to the outside world you have to go online manually? It seems absurd that the Stan-By function was set up only to download messages to the bulletin board, if this were the case it would only be a waste of resources, the fact remains, however, that even in this case the infamous WiiConnect24 has no effect at all inside a game. Mr. Resetti To want to be more possible, one can think that it is all the fault of the Mr. Resetti mole who absolutely does not want it to go out without saving. In Animal Crossing, in fact, you cannot turn off the game if you have not first exited the village using the save option. This was done to prevent a player from resetting due to a bad deal, coin theft or similar cheat. To the disobedient user a talkative lecture by Mr Resetti at the following restart (and it seems also expropriations of goods after continuous infringements). This system means that the game must be constantly monitored, also because many of the interactions with the village are based on iton the relationship between the various characters / players as well as with the game calendar. Think, for example, that you have obtained a special object, one of those that cannot be ordered in the shop, and you think you want to send it by mail to ~Pucci~ who lives in the ~Multiplayer~ village. Now think about resetting to get the item back. Well, you were thinking of cheating the game, but instead it is the one who cheated you, as every event you have played will not have really happened until you save them. So correspondence, buying and selling to shops, transferring items and the like must be constantly synchronized with the local save and between the players involved. It is probably due to the lack of desire to review this system that it is not possible to always be online and interact openly with other players, given that the unexpected of a connection is always around the corner. And for this reason, on Wii as on Ds, a save function has been added that allows you to save data and continue playing when you are online. Nintendo seems very jealous of this system, almost a priority for Animal Crossing, so much so that if playing with the village open to the internet (even without players in the city), the line drops, the game returns an error and resets itself, making you lose everything you it was done up until the time the city opens (when an automatic wild is made). At least Mr Resetti is spared the player. Between old and new Animal Crossing has no achievements. It's about living in a randomly created village populated by anthropomorphic animals, collecting insects and fish, enriching the furniture catalog, and discovering new events, continuing to play day after day. For a more detailed description of the title you can read the review of Animal Crossing: Wild Word for Nintendo DS which is practically the same game: here we limit ourselves to talking about the new additions. In addition to a richer catalog of fish and insects, there are new services and some changes made to the village. The animals have a slightly different AI that causes their conversations to be limited to one topic at a time instead of constant unrelated dialogue. Non-player characters will also be able to tell you about friends registered in the friends list, even if you haven't played together yet. One of the strengths of the Nintendo brand is precisely that given by the illusion that the players are really all connected, when in truth they are all closed and asynchronous worlds that only exchange some data every now and then. For example, the inhabitants can move from one village to another based on their sympathy, and keep historical memory of their previous village. In the ABC office the most beautiful furniture will be mentioned which perhaps belongs to a character who lives at your friend's, the new auction house will allow you to sell and buy objects exhibited by other players, and obviously thanks to the post office you can always be in touch by correspondence. This time, however, you can also talk to each other thanks to Wii Speak, a microphone to be applied above the TV or wherever you see fit. We have tried the peripheral on several occasions and apart from some problems that can occur in the early stages of connection (volume adjustments, tests, echoes, etc.) the audio quality is more than acceptable and sufficient to carry on a conversation without problems. We would like to point out to be picky, a certain delay in the conversion of the voice, certainly due to a manipulation of the signal, aimed at cleaning it from disturbances and returns of any kind. It's okay to get rid of the hateful headphones anyway. Comment Animal Crossing is the usual game, and you can give this sentence the meaning that you think is closest to your thinking. You can read us a critique of the immobility of the practically identical brand from the debut, or a cheeky confirmation that, despite the years and the sequels, it is difficult to neglect your village and not love this game. It is certainly not thanks to the integration with the Wifi Connection which offers nothing more than what was seen in the last episode, nor to the controls which suffer from the same inaccuracies as the stylus. In this regard it is better to connect a Nunchuk to have a more accurate movement of the character. Finally, it is not even about the few innovations included, practically irrelevant in the overall economy. Nintendo has played it safe, but despite all the criticisms that can be made Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City remains an extremely captivating and lasting product, which manages to grip the player who will return day after day to see what's there new in his dear village. The formula is talmly relaxing and attractive that would be able to work even with just a board and a few playing cards. Pros The village returns from the big screen Wii Speak included in the game Ability to import character and catalog from the DS version Against Nothing new Online functions still lacking The Wii underexploited in every field", "date": "2008-12-19", "grade": null}
