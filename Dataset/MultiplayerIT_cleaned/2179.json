{"name": "Jet Sky Riders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jet-sky-riders.html", "text": "Not all that glitters is gold... even water!! The first impact, in terms of graphics, is not bad at all, in fact the water was made very well, or at least I liked it a lot (I say so because dear old Gozzer is not of the same opinion as me.). Both the reflections and the splashes really give the idea of being in the middle of the sea. Not to mention the underwater reflections, all very beautiful, especially those of objects such as boulders or piers that undergo a decidedly high-level deformation in real time. I don't understand why the rest of the textures have not been treated in the same way. The only thing that is saved are the textures of the bikes and riders. Everything else is poorly defined and jaggies are often seen on the surfaces. However, even the movements of the characters are often not very fluid, and all this graphic carelessness greatly affects the overall judgment. The scenarios are quite varied and as you progress in the game they become more and more demanding, but more could be done on a graphic level, given that they appear not very ~full~. Double flip pike somersault Being used to the physics of Waverace's movements, I was hoping to find a match in the Eidos title, but I must say that the disappointment was great. As in the game for N64, here too you have to pass, within a well-defined area, such as an island or a port, to the right or left of buoys scattered along the entire route. Now, however, the movements of the bike are decidedly more cumbersome and cornering becomes really difficult. If you miss a trajectory or give too much throttle, you're done, you miss a buoy and get a penalty which consists of a temporary slowdown of the vehicle which honestly could have been avoided, given that it is really frustrating in the end. Imagine, for example, finding yourself second on the last lap one step away from the first position and for a small distraction you jump a buoy... the whole group will pass you, as you will be automatically slowed down, and you will finish the race in fifth/sixth position at the latest. In my opinion it would have been better to manage the penalties at the end with an accumulation of seconds or better reduce them to a maximum of three and, once those were exhausted, the race was over. However, apart from this, it must be said that the title looks decidedly at the arcade with a touch of realism which is also reflected in the quantity and quality of the tricks. They are actually very varied but not very intuitive to perform and, although most faithfully reflect the stunts that fans of this sport are used to seeing on television, there are others that are truly spectacular but difficult to perform. The replay is definitely very nice, which skilfully mixes various cameras, among which it seems right to mention the innovative helicopter shot and the accelerated rear one complete with motion blur. On the other hand, the sound part is disappointing, with tracks that are not very incisive and boring, but above all, as already mentioned at the beginning of the review, the voice-over is unlistenable which is annoying right from the first listen. Concluding Lovers of this type of racing game will appreciate this attempt by Eidos to transpose their favorite sport into the binary code of the Sony console, given that there are few and badly made games of this genre. Unfortunately this Jet Sky Riders shows more shadows than lights but there is time to improve, so we trust the programmers, in the hope that they will be able to improve a game that has a decent starting base and good development possibilities. Longevity is however ensured by the two-player option which offers healthy fun and many hours in company. A good product that is at least worth a try. Concluding Pro H2O Effect Licensed by Kawasaki Only worthy rival of Waverace Cons Background Textures Music .All your own flour?! Thanks to the official KAWASAKI license, EIDOS Interactive offers a title decidedly similar to the progenitor of racing games on jet skis, the surprising and hilarious Waverace, killer application of the now defunct N64. The mechanics of the game are practically the same, although now there is the possibility to drive the jet skis both sitting and standing. As a first impact we are faced with the possibility of choosing between five different languages, and fortunately our language appears in the list. The game is completely translated into Italian, including the commentary of the speaker, but I recommenddisable it, since the sentences are repetitive and trivial. The presentation is a mix of real footage and gameplay footage but it's all quite confusing and the background music isn't overwhelming; the consequence of all this is that future times you will tend to repeatedly push the Start button to skip it on the fly. Arrived at the main menu we have the possibility to choose from a fair number of options, among which we can mention the championship, the two-player challenge and the freestyle. However, there is no shortage of the classic arcade and the time challenge. In each discipline we are given the right to choose both our driver and the vehicle; in fact, as already mentioned before, there is the possibility of playing both with the character standing (Sky) and seated (Runabout).", "date": "2002-04-02", "grade": null}
