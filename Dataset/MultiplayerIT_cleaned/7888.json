Released in 1999 on PSone and developed by Shiny Entertainment, the team behind Earthworm Jim and MDK, the game offered a real radio-controlled helicopter simulation. The goal was to use the Dual Shock exactly as if it were a radio control, trying to better manage the inertial context to carry out increasingly complex routes, avoiding any contact with the scenery. Well, it's a bit like what happens in Chopper Mike too, available for a few days on the App Store and Google Play. This is the first mobile project created by Jamie Lowes, a veteran of the gaming industry with a curriculum of productions of the caliber of Colin McRae Rally and SEGA Rally, characterized by a reliable and precise touch control system, as well as particularly clean and polygonal graphics pleasant, which moves at sixty frames per second and therefore guarantees a remarkable fluidity in every situation. Adopting an isometric view, the game puts us in command of a series of different helicopters (we start with three models, but with the possibility of unlocking others) and offers a total of forty-eight challenges divided into three levels of difficulty (Easy , Normal, Expert), challenges that can be completed by obtaining ratings from one to three stars based on our ability, precision and speed in collecting all the crystals present within the scenario without touching the elements that make up the location. Let's go! As mentioned, the gameplay of Chopper Mike is very simple and adopts a structure composed of increasingly complex challenges. In fact, the path that our helicopter has to cover alternates fixed obstacles and mobile obstacles, switches of various kinds and large variations in height that must be approached with caution to avoid unwanted contacts. For the controls, a very intuitive and functional solution was thought of, namely a virtual analog stick on the left side of the touch screen and a simple pressure on the right side, intermittent, in order to operate the main propeller of the aircraft. Dosing the thrust in the inertial context of the game ultimately becomes a fundamental element of the gameplay, an element of depth because it varies greatly depending on the model we use and therefore requires a few test rides to understand well what the reactivity of the helicopter we are piloting. No criticisms can be made of VAMflax's debut title as regards numbers and production quality, thanks to the clean and very fluid graphics, as well as a nice musical accompaniment; however, the discourse of an excessively linear action is certainly valid, which closes in the ambit of skill challenges and does not try to do something different, even just dosing the ~rewards~ on the basis of the results achieved and therefore spurring us on smarter way to find the perfect performance. Ultimately, it is the lack of this variety that prevents Chopper Mike from clearly standing out from the crowd and rising above the many action games available on the App Store and Google Play. And it's a real shame, because in this case we started from very solid foundations.", "date": "2013-04-19", "grade": "7.3"}
