{"name": "Men In Black: The Series", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/men-in-black-the-series.html", "text": "Graphics and sound First let's get our hands on: Men In Black The Series is inspired by the animated series that still rages in the United States and not by the film mentioned in the previous paragraph. Graphically I'm sorry to say, but alongside some fairly decent animations (combined with other simply mediocre ones), Dave A. Palmer Productions has packaged some sprites that defining rough is equivalent to using an understatement and if our heroes J and K, as happens usually, they are actually the sprites made in the best way, I can't imagine the face you would make when you see your alien enemies who aim to conquer our planet by replacing us human beings. Too bad, because at first glance the rendered graphics used by the programmers almost made a good impression on me. Graphics and sound As far as the backdrops are concerned, unfortunately the situation does not change: someone could argue that the cartoonish style used therein does not lend itself to more elaborate color palettes, a greater number of graphic elements on the screen and so on evidently the backdrops of Wario Land 4 (also a platformer, coincidentally we are also talking about cartoon-comic style graphics), but also Klonoa, they must have been the work of some alien, just to stay in theme with the Men In Black universe. While waiting for the next paragraph to show you the infinitely low playability of the title produced by Crave Entertainment, it is enough to know that apart from some well done digitization, the audio sector is worthy of that of the Game Boy Color, which does not help in the least to restore already disastrous situation of Men In Black The Series, abominable music also (sadly) guilty. Borderline unplayable!!! Before starting this new paragraph, let's think about something that platform games have in common: jumping from one point of the level to another, taking down as many enemies as possible, recovering as many medkits/power ups/extra weapons/whatever comes to mind, perform some key actions and take down the end-of-level bosses. We have generally been accustomed since our gaming childhood to a game interface that assigned the attack function to a key, the jump input to another and so on. Well, the guys from Dave A. Palmer Productions have decided to twist everything by proposing an absolutely frightening configuration of the mini pad of the Game Boy Advance: to shoot enemies you must first hold down the back key ~R~ and then press the canonical ~B ; such a choice may be more than acceptable for a 3d adventure like the games created by Shinji Mikami (Onimusha, Bio Hazard, Dino Crisis, etc) but for a two-dimensional action adventure, which should place great emphasis on immediacy and long-lasting fun term, the development team chosen by Crave Entertainment has definitely made a hole in the water. Let's now continue our ethical-philosophical disquisition on platformers with one of the most common and vital (and I repeat, vital!) actions for a good platformer: the jump; the instruction manual (however scarnuccio, but anyhow) talks about the jump and the roll to avoid enemy shots that can be activated using the ~A~ key, yet at the beginning, apart from the roll (which can be done in a cumbersome miccino way) , the jumps don't seem to really stand out, at least until the human brain understands that it's impossible to jump from one platform to another as we've always been used to (??????Nd readers); if you are on a small platform, to get to the one that is about ten Cm further away, you will first have to go to the ground, on the lower level, position yourself under the area to be reached and climb up. No comment. Borderline unplayable!!! Icing on the cake: the 6 game levels (yes, we had to finish it to be able to review it!), can be visited even after a nice stroll to the nearest bathroom, thanks to a password system that will give you a minimum of breath, what the demented artificial intelligence of the enemies will not give you, being real nuisances. A mess... I think the review was comprehensive enough to stop hardcore fans of the lucrative franchise from grabbing a copy of the game for their Game Boy Advance: I thought EA's 007: The World Is Not Enough was one of the worst tie-ins ever, but this Men In Black The Series manages to do better by reaching the very low levels of the equally horrid Batman Gotham Race for Psone!A mess... Mediocre graphics (except for some animation, we repeat), horrid music and one of the worst game systems ever tried in 17 years of honorable videogame life, bring the Men In Black tie-in for Game Boy Advance almost to the top of a hypothetical ranking of dumbest video games ever. Pros: Some very fluid animations Captivating license Cons: Game mechanics among the worst in history Technically a lot of improvement Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones paperbacks Men In Black can certainly be counted among the funniest films that have been churned out in recent years, after all the soundtrack has had a truly enormous success in the cinema (the refrain ~Here comes the men in black~ by Will Smith is still pounding) was among the best-selling CDs worldwide and the special edition with 2 limited edition DVDs has long since sold out in every self-respecting DVD store. Obviously, a video game dedicated to the champions of justice Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones (sorry, agents Jay and Kay) could not be missing and, simultaneously with the launch of the Game Boy Color, Crave Entertainment released a tie-in that is still remembered for being one of the worst video games ever, by all accounts. The cartridge we are about to review has just arrived on the market and is optimized for the Game Boy Advance only; have the programmers of Dave A. Palmer Productions finally packed a platform video game worthy of the name or is it good that we return to our very affectionate DVD player this time too?
