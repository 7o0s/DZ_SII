{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2007.html", "text": "The ancient art of knitting In very poor words, just for those very few who don't know the simple basic rules (but where were you when Lotti was broadcast on TV?), let's assume that the aim of the game is to send your ball, starting from an area of the field called the Tee. In between, the Fairway which would be the ideal point to land the ball before sending it onto the Green, and a whole series of more or less natural obstacles and placed in such a way as to make life difficult for the athlete. The ball will be hit, to make it reach the goal, with certain clubs: there are various types, each suitable for a different distance to the detriment of shooting accuracy. Finally, each hole must be completed in a certain number of shots: by exploiting less we will score points, otherwise we will lose them. From the point of view of what can be done on the pitch, things haven't changed much since the previous editions The ancient art of knitting This, simplistically, is the essence of golf, and in Tiger Woods we find exactly the same basic concepts. From the point of view of what is possible to do in the field, things have not changed much compared to the previous editions, apart from a general and obvious refinement of mechanics that are already very tested in any case. Our golfer will therefore have different types of shot available, from the basic Full to the low ball capable of reducing the effects of the wind, from the cushioned shot that allows the ball to stop immediately once landed (normally it would continue to roll), to the Pitch, ideal when you are a short distance from the Green and want to get closer to the hole, up to the Putt, the only type of shot that can be taken when you are on the Green, and often the most difficult to interpret. The ancient art of knitting Each shot has its pros and cons, just like the various types of effects that can be given to the ball, the various clubs that we can use, the power that we can give to the shot and so on... The options available of the player are really many, and the beauty is that, exactly as in reality, apart from the cases in which the shot to be made is practically a must (this is the case of the Putts or most of the tosses from the Tee), there are various ways to achieve the same goal, but each of these will do it in a different way and it is up to the player to study the variables involved (shape of the hole, wind speed and direction...) to establish the best approach. Since then each ~option~ refers to a particular aspect of the shot, the expert player will have to manage in a wise way a combination of various elements. Tiger Woods, from this point of view, as every year manages to recreate reality perfectly: in some cases it is really difficult to predict the behavior of the ball, and only by trying and trying again will we acquire the necessary experience. there are various ways to achieve the same goal, but each of these will do it in a different way The ancient art of knitting Three new gameplay features this year. The first is a further option available to the golfer, who this year can decide, before the shot, how to position himself with respect to the ball: further forward and the ball, with a more arched trajectory, will tend to roll slightly once landed, but also to be more conditioned by the wind. The opposite will occur when positioning yourself backwards. Another novelty is the ~Tiger Vision~: at the moment of the Putt we will have, as always, the advice of the caddy (the guy who brings us the equipment from hole to hole), but also the possibility, obviously only a few times during the course of the eighteen holes, to see exactly where to place the pointer to be sure of a successful shot. This is a useful feature the first few times if you really don't know golf titles, but once you have gained some experience it is advisable not to use it in order not to make the holes too easy. The latest novelty is a new difficulty level, the Tour, which eliminates or resizes most of the ~softening~ of the game, such as advice or a certain flexibility in considering the timing of the swing (the movement one makes to throw the ball), bringing Tiger Woods much closer to a real simulation. The reward consists of more generous cash prizes and, above all, personal satisfaction. Otherwise the game is the same as always, including the unique control system that dispenses with all the bars and indicators seen elsewhere to take advantage of a swing controlled directly via the analog stick, and which makes the real feeling of this sport. Tiger Woods, the legend! The dress chand EA Sports has put its new baby is as usual for a grand gala. The main mode this year includes a career that will take our alter ego from the first launches to challenge none other than the greatest legends of all time such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and of course our Woods. The first step is the creation of the character, never as complete and exhaustive as in this game thanks to the new ~GameFace II~ system, an evolution of what we saw last year. You can manage tons of physical characteristics of your alter ego and really give him the look you want, and you can also customize his swing. When none other than Tiger Woods arrives to offer to play a match with you, you can truly say you've reached the top. Tiger Woods, the legend! Once born, your golfer is faced with a pre-established sequence of events, which are divided into Legend Tour, a normal eighteen-hole challenge against real and imaginary golfers, Legend Scenarios, where each legend will challenge you with a particular objective, and the canonical PGA season; each of these events, once faced, can then be replayed to improve the results obtained. Obviously, in case of positive performance you will earn trophies, to be admired in the special room that is reserved for you in the Hall of Fame of the game, and above all big bucks, with which you can either directly modify your characteristics, or buy new equipment with better features than the previous one, or simply more beautiful and elegant. Tiger Woods, the legend! Furthermore, on certain occasions you will be given ~Legend Coins~ through which you can literally buy the many courses available in the game and then take the holes from each of these that seem best to you to create your personalized course. It is not enough, since - and this is the latest big news of this year - through the ~Tiger Proofing~ option you can intervene on each hole by changing all the parameters at will, from the size and maintenance of the Green and Fairway to density of tree foliage: a really difficult hole will add prestige to your course, and with high enough prestige even golf legends will challenge you on the same course as you. When none other than Tiger Woods arrives to offer to play a match with you, you can truly say you've reached the top. But then you have to beat him... And that's not all... In addition to the career, other modes are available, from normal battles to play alone or against other human players, to ~mini-games~ with bats and balls with special rules , up to the Real Time events that will be activated only on particular days of the year, which the console will read from its internal clock. There is plenty to play, and in a big way, up to the 2006 version, and if you add the online mode of the PS2 and Xbox versions to this, you have the picture of a virtually infinite longevity. There is to play, and great, up to the 2006 version The graphic aspect of TW begins to show its first wrinkles: the engine, which was developed primarily for the PS2 version, has always been the same for years now and although it keeps its strong points intact such as the extreme resemblance of the golfers to their counterparts realities, the fluidity of the animations and the breadth of the field of vision, leave something to be desired when compared to other productions. In particular the textures are a bit dull, there is no amalgam between the players and the backdrop (it seems that the golfers are stuck to the background like a collage), some elements such as the grass of the Rough are by now antiquated and, this year, there are also occasional framerate dips; all this does not affect the playability of the title at all, but the eye, as we know, also wants its part. In all likelihood, it will have to wait for the new consoles... Few and scarcely relevant, and we conclude with the graphics, the differences between the three versions. Tiger Woods, the legend! The sound aspect does its duty, with the classic EA Sports trendy music and two commentators, probably very famous in America, who appropriately underline the moments of the game and do not skimp on dispassionate advice or poisonous jokes about lackluster performances or too much time spent to throw. For the rest it is the triumph of the classic television style of EA Sports products, which shines through in shots, spectacular replays, in the cheering of the public, adding that ~made in Hollywood~ salt that for some might be missing in the game of golf. Bad news for non-English speakers: even in Italy the game remains in Shakespeare's language, too bad... The only reason why Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 does not reach the coveted 9 isthat as usual the novelties, which are there, may not be such as to justify the purchase to those who own an edition not too distant in time: in reality we are simply faced with the most beautiful golf simulation on the market, and if you haven't played a Tiger Woods in a while or loved the previous ones, go ahead without fail. As always, the GameCube version is penalized by the lack of support for online play, and is therefore not recommended for owners of more than one console. Pros Great variety of parameters Further refinement of mechanics Lots of events to play! Usual cure for ~immersiveness~ Cons It's still the same game after all The graphics are starting to look dated Strange sport, golf... At first glance it certainly doesn't seem the most dynamic of disciplines, yet it requires from the practitioner that nothing is left to chance, from a physical as well as a mental point of view. And it is a very exciting sport: it is no coincidence that the champion who for years has lent his name and image to the sports series whose new version we are about to review is one of the best known, most admired and richest personalities of the world star system, famous both for his extraordinary skills and for being the first black player to reach certain levels, in an environment traditionally associated with the wealthy white bourgeoisie, as well as, more recently, for the usual private life squabbles. And again, it is no coincidence that golf has always been courted by video game developers, who have given various interpretations of the discipline over time, leaving out other sports that perhaps at first glance seem much more suitable for videogame conversion. The Tiger Woods PGA Tour series is precisely one of these interpretations, which in the most perfect EA Sports style focuses on the similarity between game and television event, on increasingly extreme customization, on gameplay halfway between simulation and 'arcade. What has changed in this mid-decade edition? Let's go find out...", "date": "2004-11-12", "grade": null}
