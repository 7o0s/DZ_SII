Tie-ins are too often developed superficially with the sole intention of benefiting from the publicity given by the cinematic release or by the fame of the series, but with Beowolf we had some hope of being able to deviate from this evil trend. Gameplay? The Legend of Beowulf is an epic poem whose film adaptation has just been released on the screens of Italian cinemas, certainly a game that spoke of the deeds of the Norwegian hero could not be missing. The developers have detached themselves from what Zemeckis told in the film, instead going to narrate the deeds of the warrior in the 30 years not taken into consideration by the director. As Beowulf we will find ourselves traveling to reach Denmark and bring our help to King Hrothgar whose lands are devastated by the monstrous Grendel. In the adventure of this action game set up as a scrolling fighting game we will not act alone, our men will follow us, the faithful Knights who will fight together with us and together with Wiglaf our best friend and ally. We will immediately be thrown into the fray and after a race with Wiglaf himself, essentially a sort of tutorial, we will find ourselves fighting a gigantic sea serpent with several heads that we will have to defeat using our agility and a good dose of brute power. In this first clash, two characteristics that constitute the essence of the title developed by Ubisoft, real time events and carnal fury, can already be glimpsed. The former are used during the game in the most epic sequences to make Beowulf perform the right actions in the established times, it will be a question of pressing the buttons of our joypad at the right time, in case of error the attack or the action will fail miserably and we will have to try again, it is no coincidence that the system was exploited in an exceptional way by both Shenmue and God of War. Carnal Fury, on the other hand, is a particular ability of the Norwegian warrior that allows him to go into a sort of ~berserk mode~, to be blinded by violence and the desire for destruction, thus dramatically increasing his strength but losing his humanity. This skill should be used as little as possible to then be rewarded by the game, the problem is that the difficulty has been set really badly, so much so as to make many situations frustrating, for this reason it is practically impossible not to use Carnal Fury as much as I can. Let us also add that the system that should reward the use or not of this special ability has been implemented in a decidedly approximate way and the ~reward~ is absolutely insufficient. As anticipated we will always move together with our soldiers who will follow us everywhere and will always be at our orders. For example, the Knights will take care of leading our boat in the right direction, of moving all the obstacles in our path with their strength and above all of fighting against every opponent along the way. During the choral actions, in the role of Beowulf we will have to show them which gestures to make, inciting them and emotionally supporting them; this system is structured as a sort of rhythm game given that choral situations must always be marked by the right rhythm to work, and we, following traditional Nordic songs, will have to push them to action. In practice we will have to press the joypad keys with timing and we will see the soldiers sing and rejoice at the success of their efforts. The music is very epic, the incitements to the Knights are absolutely effective as their certainly realistic exclamations. The big problems in controlling our men occur during battles in the open field, unfortunately the management entrusted to the a.i. of the game is really bad and in practice in every fight we will see our men remain ~dazed~ and still waiting for an enemy attack. Basically we will have to fight to save not only ourselves but also the whole group, this leads to moments of real frustration also because once we see all the knights succumb one by one, the game over will be assured. We have confessed to you more than once that we had to replay a scene because of the AI. The further element that dramatically increases the frustration is given by the Carnal Fury which yes makes us bloodthirsty and very strong beasts, but also makes us capable of wounding and killing our own soldiers, and given that the melees are somewhat chaotic and poorly organized this situation is repeated very often throughout the adventure. Group fights We will be able to give simple commands to our men always hoping that they will carry them outor correctly, but as already stated a few lines ago the effects will almost always be unwanted. The fights are reduced to a mere random combination of keys, actions based on very simple combinations that vary very little from X + X + Y, certainly the developers have not considered this aspect adequately, the depth of the fights is in fact non-existent . The weapons that we will be able to use during the adventure and that we will meet on our way are subject to wear and tear and after some clashes will lose their effectiveness, we will therefore find ourselves fighting even with our bare hands until we meet with a new sword or hammer from war. Technically we are in the presence of an absolutely mediocre title, made in speed and with superficiality, it seems to have gone back a generation of consoles. The animations are quite good even if during the fights we will be injured more than once to wait for the end of a chain of movements of our character, thus we will not be able to respond to the enemy attack with the right timing. The scenarios are absolutely linear, presenting a single way forward, complete with invisible walls that do not allow exploration of the play area. The end-of-level bosses are made quite well on a technical level (let's not talk about their intelligence) and offer a good glance thanks to the application of different graphic effects and sufficiently fluid movements. The audio sector is perhaps one of the best things about the whole game, the music is good and the dubbing in Italian is also good. Xbox 360 - Goals Getting the 1000 points up for grabs won't be easy, mainly due to the frustration that permeates the entire game. The objectives are of the most varied, in addition to the classic points for the end of the two acts that make up the Ubisoft title, we will earn them by destroying objects on the screen, using different weapons, fighting with bare hands and killing the end-of-level bosses. Comment The legend of Beowulf unfortunately proved to be yet another tie-in developed in a hurry to take advantage of the advertising pull of Zemeckis' film, we must admit we were disappointed, we definitely expected more. A ~naive~ artificial intelligence and many frustrating situations are too obvious shortcomings to be compensated for by some decent combat scenes and good real time events, so much so that we only have room for a rejection for this new product from Ubisoft Shanghai. Pros Real time events Some decent fighting Cons A.I. ~naive~ Frustrating gameplay", "date": "2007-11-20", "grade": null}
