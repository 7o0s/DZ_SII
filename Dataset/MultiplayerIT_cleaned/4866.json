{"name": "Venera il ritmo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183400-thumper-venera-il-ritmo.html", "text": "Ever since its announcement, Thumper has always been presented as a rhythm game. Being developed by former employees of Harmonix, the blood of Rock Band runs in its veins, and looking at a few images you can see more than a similarity to other more famous music games. The player's avatar, a sort of chromed beetle, crosses a long track in depth on which elements with which to interact are scattered in line with the beats of the music. In Guitar Hero they are the notes of fake chords, here they are deadly traps. And this is because, dissonant and oppressive, Thumper is the nightmare of those who have played too many rhythm games. Brian Gibson and Marc Flury's game is a nasty trip born from the mind of someone who wants to subvert the idea, so dear to games like Rock Band, that the user should feel like a rock star by creating fake melodies. In Thumper the roles are reversed, and it is the player who bends to the music, responding to unpredictable beats and bending to a sensory experience ready to punish every single mistake. When it debuted last fall, it surprised music game enthusiasts in a positive way, but now that it's landed on Switch, Thumper has found his ideal groove. Thumper is a pounding and head-banging game until you pass out A very violent beat In Thumper you only ever do one action at a time. From jumping a trap to negotiating a curve, to dodging metallic snakes in the more advanced levels. All while responding to the unpredictable rhythm imposed by the percussion of an aggressive music, which hammers the player and with each new segment it seems to challenge him to keep up. The reaction window is microscopic, and in the beginning it's easy to be late and hit a trap. But then the spark strikes: something clicks, and the player gets in perfect sync with the game. Every curve and every ring collected is a small victory that produces an acoustic effect and enriches the soundtrack. You start keeping time by tapping your foot, but in Thumper synesthesia is never a relaxed or lively experience, but always dark and frightening. In the latest episodes of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, music has paradoxically lost its centrality by putting the player at the center of the experience in order to make him feel like a star on stage. Thumper, on the other hand, is pure music: whoever plays never feels like a jock with creston and guitar, but rather a slave, an instrument, a constantly beaten punching bag. Even on the small screen of Switch, a game of Thumper is overwhelming, leaving you drenched in sweat, yet invigorated and extremely accomplished. In order to never drop below 60 frames per second with this port, the development team has set aside some effects. Not much stuff, also because at those speeds, even those who have already devoured the original game find it hard to notice the absence of motion blur and the other doodles of the PlayStation 4 and PC version. For the occasion, the camera has been slightly brought closer to the metal hornet, so that even on the ~small~ Switch screen, the action is easy to decipher and incoming objects are immediately visible. At 720p in handheld mode and 1080p when playing on TV, Thumper for Switch manages to deliver the same fast and crushing experience seen last year. Sure, it won't quite reach the level of detail that native 4K on PlayStation 4 Pro delivers, and probably the most immersive way to experience that is by wearing an Oculus Rift or PlayStation VR. Yet, it is in the possibility of playing Thumper anywhere and anytime that its ~rhythmic violence~ - as the developers call it - finds its perfect dimension. The fact that the nine game levels are in turn broken up into many small segments, each with its own checkpoint, allows you to stop and resume the game in a flash, making Drool's rhythm game ideal for a portable console. Play in public and you risk getting caught cursing, leaning your body or bobbing your head, as if you were mesmerized by the beat. Try it at night, with headphones, in the dark of your room and in the privacy of your bed, and that beat will end up haunting your sleep. The support for HD Rumble technology is discreet and the vibration is never invasive (or ~violent~ as the authors like to define it), giving the impression that the blows, waves and explosions spread along the entire surface of the two Joy- With. The best part comes when, after having assimilated a good part of the mechanics and becoming familiar with the more advanced levels, you decide to replay the first courses in an attempt to improve your result, perhaps in the hope of scoring all ~S~ or arriving between the top 10 in the classworld ification. You splash along the path of the game without ever faltering, facing every single obstacle and foreseeing every single trap. You feel in control, and this time for real.", "date": "2017-05-20", "grade": "8.8"}
