There are various beat'em-ups in meetings proper on the App Store and Google Play, see the reductions of Street Fighter and King of Fighters, equipped with mechanisms very similar to what is seen on consoles or directly in the arcade, with virtual sticks for running crescents and the traditional set of buttons on the right side of the screen; however, these are not products that are particularly accessible to the mass, and it is at this juncture that the stroke of genius of the Mortal Kombat authors took shape, who saw fit to eliminate jumps and free movements, and to limit the gameplay to a simple button mashing, shifting the balance on timing only and on trivial strategy, the one that makes you select one character rather than another and that leads you to launch a special move at the right time. These are elements that determined the commercial success of the mobile version of Injustice: Gods Among Us and the subsequent WWE Immortals, two products practically made with the cookie cutter, and which we find precisely in Mortal Kombat X. The mobile version of Mortal Kombat X is a visually spectacular but soulless casual beat 'em up Even more immediate! Right from the start, the sensation is of being faced with a further evolution of the concept we have just expressed, that of casual fighting games. Or perhaps it would be appropriate to speak of ~involution~, considering the fact that it was decided to simplify the combat system even more, eliminating the moves made via slide in favor of single-touch commands only, with combos that must be closed by executing a trivial quick time event, which in this case consists of drawing a line in the indicated direction. If you have tried the aforementioned Injustice: Gods Among Us and WWE Immortals, you already know practically everything about this new tie-in, which also arrives on the App Store (and will soon make its debut on Google Play) a bit like an ongoing construction site, devoid of two main modes (Faction Wars and Raiden Challenge) and with major stability and connectivity problems, given that access to the Warner Bros. platform does not work (at least in our case, on iPhone 5s, but we doubt it may depend on the device) and this implies the lack of a possible resource in terms of grinding, that is, the daily challenges and ~alliances~ with other users. We were saying, the game is structurally identical to the previous NetherRealm Studios mobile games, with increasingly longer and more demanding tournaments in which you have to participate with a team of three characters, to alternate ~on the fly~ during the fights. The campaign develops within a map that leads to visiting various towers, but the fighters available at the beginning are just simple ~extras~, both in terms of design and skills, substantially inferior to the various Johnny Cage, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade and so on. In fact, to be able to use some of the big names, you have to wait a lot of time or put your wallet in hand since, beyond random prizes, to unlock a prominent character you need an enormous amount of gold coins or souls, and neither currency is handed out in large quantities during games. Even more challenging! In addition to the difficult access to the traditional stars of the roster and a basic and fundamentally repetitive gameplay, the problems of Mortal Kombat X also reside in a very questionable difficulty balancing, in which it happens to meet opponents who with a single special move can eliminate one of the components of our team. If we consider that even by parrying the attacks of very strong enemies we suffer considerable damage, it goes without saying that the whole focus lies in leveling up and trying to enhance one's team where possible. In this sense there is unfortunately little freedom to manoeuvre, given that the main characteristics depend only on the level of experience and it is only possible to make the specials more effective (which are performed simply by pressing the relative icon in the lower part of the screen and performing the usual QTE) to have at least one attack capable of causing damage to anyone. As long as you can use it, of course. Trying to place the experience in the right perspective, we can say that playing Mortal Kombat X is pleasant, until you collide with the paywall and the related grinding, while the inevitable action energy bars (those that wear out at every meeting) did not represent an insurmountable obstacle during our testsbile: for them to recharge, just wait a few minutes or use a soul. Technically the game is really well done, we see that many graphic assets are the same as the console version and certain moves stand out for their spectacularity and impact, in particular the very violent Fatalities (limited, however, to the stars and therefore also not easily accessible) . However, there are some technical problems, sudden crashes and audio defects that would need to be fixed, together with the already highlighted shortcomings of the online platform, which is currently unusable. The developers probably could have used some extra time for refinements, and perhaps to operate a different calibration of a balance which, right now, leaves little doubt as to what the main objective of the game is.", "date": "2015-04-13", "grade": "6.0"}
