{"name": "Sfida combattente del crimine n.4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/159689-sfida-combattente-del-crimine-n4.html", "text": "The end of November saw the release of several DLCs for Batman: Arkham Knight and among these, inevitable in recent times, there was also a package dedicated to the classic AR challenges. Crime Fighter Challenge #4 contains some new competition scenarios for the Dark Knight, Nightwing, Azrael, Robin and Catwoman. These challenges are as always focused partly on non-stop fighting training and partly on stealth missions in a predatory style, with one specifically designed for team action between Nightwing and the Boy Wonder. The DLC is available on PlayStation Network, Xbox LIVE and Steam, ~free~ for season ticket holders and at a price of 1.99 for all others. Six new AR Challenges for Batman, Nightwing, Azrael, Robin and Catwoman in the Arkham Knight DLC Beats in time By accessing the usual RA screen, six challenges can be selected, three action and three based on silent action, therefore, starting with ~Wild Cat~. The protagonist is obviously Catwoman, who has to fight endless and continuous waves of enemies on the western set of Panessa Studios, eliminating them to get points and additional seconds to increase the time that inexorably passes. At the end of the countdown, the game stops and assigns a result in relation to the number of opponents eliminated, how it was done and any seconds recovered. Another action-based AR challenge is ~Swiss Precision~, and the title is not accidental since the brawl takes place inside the Gotham City clock tower. It is there that Batman must contend with a large group of adversaries ready to do anything to kill him. The clash is practically divided into rounds, and each time the number and type of opponents change, as well as their equipment. At the end of each block of enemies, the game calculates the prize score based on how you fought, gadgets, combos, moves used and other factors, which is why it is always essential to make the most of the accessories at disposition of the hero together with the combined attacks. Obtaining the 22,000 points necessary for the record and the coveted three stars at the end of the various rounds will otherwise be very complicated. Also in ~Quarantine~ you have to resist waves of increasingly better equipped enemies who oppose each other between the hero and obtaining the best possible score, this time however in the guise of Robin and under ACE Chemicals. The scores of the various assaults are added up and bonuses can also be obtained here in relation to the variety of opponents killed, the gadgets and techniques used for the purpose. Predators and victims Moving on to the three challenges of a more ~strategic~ nature, let's define them like this, we first have ~In flight~ with the young duo formed by Nightwing and Robin. The pair have to contend with the Militia types in the usual laboratory setting that we have seen in various other circumstances. As always, therefore, the conformation of this area pushes the user to act mainly from above, alternating the two heroes to eliminate enemies even from a distance (that is, giving one of the two boys the order to attack) or to carry out quick tag combos. The faster you are in cleaning up the area, the more points you get, as well as the final result is also influenced by the satisfaction of some requests of the game regarding the type of KO to be inflicted on the guards. The Wonder Boy is also the solitary protagonist of ~Credit Crunch~, the other Predator challenge, which however does nothing but re-propose the usual bank robbery to be thwarted, and therefore hackneyed mechanics and schemes. The last challenge offered by the Crime Fighter Challenge #4 DLC is ~Divine Intervention~, and as the title suggests it stars Azrael. He is located on the roof of the Penguin's warehouse, but fighting against the patrolling Militia. In order to get the best score you have to complete the level in the shortest time possible. Like the previous crime fighter challenges, this add-on also positions itself somewhere between a decent addition to the main product but at the same time something that was not missed at all, at least under these conditions. Crime Fighter Challenge #4 is interesting enough for those who like to spend countless hours trying to break records and pass certain ~competitions~, as well as collect all Batman: Arkham Knight collectibles. But honestly the usual handful of AR challenges got the audience a bit bored; in this sense it would perhaps have been more logical to create a single DLC from the beginning containing all the challenge-themed ones released up to now and at a price vantagious, rather than continuing to bake them in a continuous stream but broken up. As always, our advice remains to buy the package only if you really want to collect everything in the world of the Knight of Arkham, otherwise leave it alone.", "date": "2015-11-30", "grade": null}
