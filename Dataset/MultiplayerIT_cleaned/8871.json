After 15 years this glorious series, somewhat forgotten by the market but certainly not by the numerous fans who remember its glories, is back on the new Apple mobile platforms: Moto Racer 15th Anniversary (henceforth simply Moto Racer) therefore the look, ready (perhaps) to face the formidable comparison with the current generation of games on the App Store. Uneven terrain As per tradition, therefore, Moto Racer immediately offers the possibility of tackling 3 of the main motorcycling categories: the race on the track, called MotoGP but which bears only the name of the official championship (there is no license in fact), the one on dirt thanks to the well-known SuperCross and the spectacular FreeStyle, where you can perform jumps and tricks of all sorts regardless of times or routes. Each category can be tackled according to the three classic difficulty levels and in single race, championship or time challenge mode; as we will see, however, the differences between the three modes both in terms of gameplay and in general are very marked. The MotoGP, first of the three types of races in order of presentation, is certainly the most well-finished and most successful part of the whole game: in fact, considering that we are faced with a purely arcade approach, the behavior of the motorbikes and centaurs is appreciable , as well as general physics. Despite what has just been said, however, it is clear that those looking for simulation ambitions in such a title can easily do without its purchase; however for all the others, the fun is guaranteed by the immediacy and the easy learning curve. Shocks and falls then, however present, occur only in situations at the limit (if not beyond), that is when not even physics ~differently reliable~ to Newton's laws can justify certain manoeuvres. The situation gets quite complicated when the SuperCross road is taken: the rider's posture, from lying down and aerodynamic as it was on the track, now becomes erect and in constant search for balance, returning to sight a totally unnatural, rigid position, as if the driver wore a corset. To aggravate everything then we think about the anachronistic transparent walls, those hateful invisible walls which by virtue of who knows what magnetic field or mystical force prevent the bike from leaving the course, often straightening it even in the case of abundantly wrong jumps. The poor vision of the pilot's animations, framed from the outside in the third person, can be hidden from view by approaching the camera (which can be positioned in 4 different positions up to the fairing); this option is possible in all three game categories but it is clear that, in the presence of uneven terrain and dangerous jumps, the closer view ends up hindering the player as well as causing nausea and headaches in the more sensitive subjects head. The last modality, i.e. the FreeStyle, slightly improves the fortunes of this new edition of Moto Racer: if it is true that the animations are always woody and that racing in certain circuits still brings back the odious invisible walls, in this type of races it is also possible to try your hand in arenas totally devoid of rules, whose only objective is to take the different ramps at maximum speed and perform as many stunts as possible. The control system, common to all three categories, is one of the strengths of the game, thanks to its simplicity and immediacy: with a tap on the right knob you accelerate, with the left one you brake and with the accelerometers you face each other the curves. The turbo button, located just above the brake, and the command rose for the various tricks, positioned within reach of both thumbs (for left and right-handed) then complete the picture. There is also a variant of the controls without the use of motion sensors, using a virtual stick on the right: this solution is absolutely to be avoided, because with a single stick you control both curves and accelerations and decelerations, in an awkward and imprecise way . Having already introduced the discourse on the (not good) animations of the pilots, it remains to speak of the remaining aspects related to the graphics: to the detriment of an excellent fluidity, unfortunately we note the absolute desert around thevarious tracks, without even a small detail of any kind, as well as a marked alising effect. Even the textures spread on the grandstands taste old, with an absolutely bitter aftertaste given the technical potential available. Only the polygonal models of the motorcycles are saved from this general dullness, not so much thanks to them as due to the demerit of the context in which they run.
