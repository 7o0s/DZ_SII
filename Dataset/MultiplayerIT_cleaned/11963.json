{"name": "Monster Hunter Freedom 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-hunter-freedom-2-recensione.html", "text": "There are some universally acclaimed and appreciated games, capable of reconciling both Western and Eastern tastes. And there are others, however, decidedly more sectoral; within this group Monster Hunter Freedom fits fully, which with the first episode for Psp and even more with this sequel has literally depopulated in Japan, leaving instead the spirits rather tepid outside the Land of the Rising Sun. Hunting what a passion Although the title brings with it some aspects of the J-RPG genre, among these the plot certainly does not figure, reduced here to the minimum wage. During an excursion among inhospitable snowy peaks, the adventurer protagonist of the game is hit by a hostile creature only to fall down the steep rock walls and thus lose consciousness. Some time later, our alter-ego finally reopens his eyes in a comfortable bed in a house in the Pokke village; and from this place, after a short series of dialogues, it becomes the focal point of the entire game, in which to develop one's skills as a professional hunter. This is the premise for what is in fact nothing more than a huge series of missions - over 300 - in which to hunt creatures of different danger and size to obtain objects with which to create new ones or develop weapons and armor with greater potential. Basically, Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is all about it; a decidedly particular and atypical action/adventure/rpg game, and precisely for this reason particularly sectoral and intended to capture only a few curious players. A fundamental aspect lies in the combat system, not very complex or rewarding but in any case made profound by the large quantity of weapons available, each with different characteristics and with a different way of using it, a factor which requires you to learn to know their qualities and limits to be able to get the most out of them. On the other hand, a hunter can only rely on his ~iron of the trade~, and in this case the Capcom production does not disappoint; However, the same thing cannot be said for the control system, really cumbersome and demanding, complete with key combinations even just to access the menu or use an object. Obviously time brings with it an ever greater familiarity, but the fact remains that there is a lot of room for improvement in the accessibility of the title in question. Nonetheless, Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is certainly a title with charm, as well as cared for and with an extremely robust backbone; anyone who has the will and predisposition for this type of production, will be able to indulge in collecting objects, eliminating creatures to earn raw materials, improvising as a miner or fisherman or cook, modifying one's equipment and so on. Capcom's fatigue is certainly not a gentle game with novices, but equally certainly it is particularly generous with those who have the patience to accept its limits and the complexity of the control system. Furthermore, graphically, the title is undoubtedly of an excellent level, if not among the best of the current Psp offer; huge settings and monsters, a remarkable level of detail and respectable animations. Too bad for those uploads ... Wait and hope Yes, because if the defects listed so far can roughly be overshadowed, it is decidedly more difficult to do the same with the exhausting and very frequent loading that continuously interrupts the action and markedly compromises the atmosphere. Imagine accepting a mission, and then being transported to the place established for carrying out the same; this large area has been divided into smaller areas connected to each other, where, however, each connection is equivalent to a loading of several seconds. And so if some sections can keep the player busy for several minutes, others of pure ~passage~ become simply distressing, in the awareness that perhaps to reach the set point it will be necessary to go through a handful of very boring loads. It is also a pity that Capcom has not succeeded even with this chapter, despite the PSP's capabilities in this sense, to insert an online multiplayer game mode. In fact, Monster Hunter finds its maximum expression on the occasion of the missions tackled in groups, but to do this the only possibility is through the ad hoc multiplayer, which obviously requires a group of friends each with their own Psp and relative copy of the game. A situation which, with the exception of particular situations, frankly seems very difficult to meet. The absurdity lies in the fact that in every respect, the title seems to have been designed specifically for theand games in company, as demonstrated for example by the exhausting and frankly boring battles against the biggest monsters, capable of requiring even an hour of repetitive single player combat and a few exciting tens of minutes in multi. In reality, playing online is possible, thanks to the commitment and intelligence of some users who have managed to devise a system to get around the problem; the fact remains that Capcom has shown little effort to develop a feature that would certainly have allowed Monster Hunter Freedom 2 to earn a better evaluation. Comment With Monster Hunter Freedom 2, Capcom has offered the classic sequel capable of expanding and improving a formula without absolutely wanting to distort it. Unfortunately not even on this occasion did the Japanese programmers want to remedy the most serious defect of the series, i.e. the absence of an online multiplayer mode which would have greatly benefited a product which, in fact, is created to give the best of itself faced in company. A cumbersome control system to say the least, a deep but also repetitive playability and above all loads at the limit of human endurance finally inevitably clip the wings of a game that will probably continue to drive the Japanese crazy, but certainly will not be as successful in the West . Pros Great graphics Potentially huge longevity Very fun in multiplayer Cons Absurd lack of online support Repetitive and cumbersome Loads chilling", "date": "2007-10-04", "grade": null}
