{"name": "Race Driver 2: The Ultimate Racing Simulation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/race-driver-2-the-ultimate-racing-simulation.html", "text": "A brilliant career... The main mode of Toca 2 is the Career, where we will be able to start from the basics, and therefore with the lowest performing cars in the segment, and gain access to better teams and vehicles. As per tradition, by progressing in the various championships, it is possible to unlock advanced game modes, new cars and tracks. Unfortunately, unless you use the maximum difficulty level, the arrival at success will not be very long and can be completed in about ten hours. Career is not the only mode available, in addition to the classic sections, dedicated to fast races, time trials and Live, there is also the possibility of organizing your own virtual championship, selecting the level of difficulty and simulation, the circuits and the categories of cars to drive. Speaking of the level of difficulty and simulation, it can be seen that Codemasters has foreseen a sort of percentage, whose full scale is 100%, which, if modified, leads to an increase in realism during racing: the lower the percentage, the consequences will be less in the event of breakdowns and the car's reactions will be easier to manage. The Artificial Intelligence recreated by the programmers does its duty and offers a good degree of competitiveness, so that the best opposing drivers will choose ideal trajectories and will hardly make mistakes. At the same time, however, there are some differences with less experienced drivers, who will sometimes use unorthodox ways to block our way, leading us to some collisions. Getting good performance in Toca 2 isn't easy, you have to forget the controlled drift driving of Project Gotham Racing 2 and start calculating the braking distances, setting the curves, and being aware of the weight and characteristics of the driven car more specifically than in other racing games. For many, this will be the best and most successful aspect of the title, others, however, will consider the lack of immediacy in controlling the vehicles as Toca2's greatest limitation. Damage go go Race Driver 2 provides accurate and realistic damage management, so not only will we see the bodies deform or lose components along the circuit, but we will also have a decrease in performance in the various characteristics of the car, based on the type and extent of the damage suffered. This particular aspect significantly influences the conduct of the race and the driving style to be adopted. Regardless of the mode chosen, both online and offline, in the Codemasters title, it will be difficult to seek contact or collision with one of our opponents, but it will be preferable to study his weak points to risk a clean overtaking, taking advantage of the driving model with braking at the limit or better trajectories. During the course of the races, we may also run into various technical failures, such as engine failure or tire problems with consequent early withdrawal from the race and a whole other series of elements that undoubtedly increase the realism of a race. The Codemasters title features various types of cameras, three of these are provided for the first person view, from different angles, such as the view directly on the bumper of the car or the one directly from the pilot's eyes and consequent virtual realization of the cockpit. Obviously, the top view is not missing, perhaps less simulative, but more practical in the most frantic game situations. Finally, we can add that the title also supports split screen for two players at the same time and, not a small detail, Race Driver 2 is presented completely in Italian, obviously including dubbing. Live Enabled As far as Live support is concerned, Codemasters has certainly not stepped back from the online version of the first Pro Race Driver. The game modes are the classic ones present in the singleplayer section, with no particular differences, except for some small changes, such as the possibility of continuing to run with the damaged car (very slowly, mind you), just to not force players to return to the chat room waiting for the end of the race. On Live, the title supports up to 12 players simultaneously, during our tests via fiber optic line no lag problems emerged, even with the maximum number of players in a circuit. The online section also features a ranking system, through a points evaluation system, obtained on the basis of performance in a race, it is possible to check the positions on the various leaderboards, rigorously updated in real time. The negative aspects in Race Driver 2, as far as support via Live is concerned, basically lie in a non-proprietary user interfacevery friendly, especially for the limited flexibility of being able to customize the race once an online session is open. Toca 2 is certainly not a racing game suitable for everyone: its setting is oriented towards simulation and realistic driving, in this way some behaviors typical of arcade racing games are limited, such as the use of other cars as a sort of  virtual in certain curves or even trying to make your way through doors without affecting the performance of the car and this aspect greatly influences multiplayer games. Technically speaking, the graphic aspect of Toca 2 does not differ from the general setting of the title, ie that of the search for realism. While not representing the best technical expression on the Microsoft console, the results are undoubtedly appreciable and textures, choice of colors used and lighting effects only increase the graphic realism of the game, representing a significant step forward compared to the prequel. The frame rate, despite the large number of vehicles moving simultaneously, always remains stable at 60 frames per second. The cars are reproduced very accurately, as well as the asphalt thanks to a clever use of bump mapping, combined with convincing light effects. The downsides come from the trackside details, such as trees, spectators and buildings, certainly not on the same level as the cars in the race. Toca 2 has some aliasing problems referred to the background in some street circuits, but in general the video cleanliness is very good. The sound department deserves a note of merit, the work of the technicians was impeccable. The best result is appreciated through a Dolby Digital 5.1 system, which literally transports the player inside the cockpit, reproducing the roar of the engines in a very realistic way, together with all the other environmental effects, such as the noise of the tires on the asphalt or of the bodywork during the contacts. Toca 2 also supports the ability to use your own soundtracks saved on the Xbox hard drive. Comment Race Driver 2: The Ultimate Racing Simulation represents the ideal complement to Project Gotham Racing 2: if, on the one hand, the Bizarre Creations title focuses entirely on immediate fun and on a distinctly arcade driving model, on the other hand, the new production Codemasters is aimed at an audience looking for realism and a section dedicated to vehicle setup to improve and exasperate its performance on the track. The Codemasters title features a large number of different modes and car categories, but this aspect, while representing credit for increasing its depth, it may be a small limitation for those looking for a specialist simulation, capable of perfectly recreating one category of car, rather than a multitude, none of which are perfect. The improvements compared to the prequel are numerous, the team programming has done an excellent job and, while not representing a model of longevity in the short career mode, Toca 2 is highly recommended both for offline play and for the challenges on Xbox Live, which promise to be fun and crowded. Pros: Simulation a go go Many Championships Live Support Cons: Career mode not very long Driving model not for everyone Graphically improveable Not all car categories are made with the same care Race Driver 2: The Ultimate Racing Simulation was officially announced during last September's X03, in these months Codemasters has also brought to Xbox a modified version of the first Pro Race Driver, equipped with Xbox Live support, a sort of warm up for this awaited sequel. Race Driver 2 or Toca 2, as identified by many, therefore presents itself as a revised, corrected, and expanded version of the previous title in every single part. The game does not offer revolutions or clear changes with the past, rather, Codemasters' work has focused on the individual aspects of the game and, based on the various feedback received, has created one of the most successful simulation racing games of recent years. Along the lines of the prequel, Toca 2 offers a series of interludes, during the career mode, which serve as a logical thread between the various stages of our climb to success, the sequences are reproduced in real time and the graphic quality is visibly higher than those featured in the previous title. 35 are the car models selected for this edition of ProRace Driver, including cars such as the Ford GT, the Aston Martin Vanquish, the Jaguar XKR, the Nissan Skyline and the AMG-Mercedes CLK. The numbers of the Codemasters title, however, do not end here, there are over 30 championships and types of race present, while the tracksThere are 48 sides, including Hockenheim, directly from the DTM championship, or the Australian Surfers Paradise for the V8 formula races. Toca offers a babel of different modalities and types of competitions, in fact we will be able to drive Formula 2 cars, with consequent tuning of the incidence of the ailerons or distribution of the braking, to then move on to driving mustangs developed for track competitions, German championships , truck races or rally sections. All these championships are very enjoyable, thanks to the diversity of the driving model, but obviously, some solutions are more accurate than others. The clear example is the transposition of rallies or on frozen circuits, in which the response of the car and the playability are certainly not comparable to games dedicated exclusively to that type of competition.", "date": "2004-04-26", "grade": null}
