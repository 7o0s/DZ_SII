The ingredients? Magical girls, a Mario Kart structure and little else.Here is our review of Gensou Skydrift. Gensou Skydrift | Review Gensou Skydrft: loli kart Gensou Skydrift is a karting game, though not literally. The protagonists of the story are little witches that it is impossible not to define in any other way than ~loli~. These ~puellae magi~ realize that some entity has robbed them of their power and has caused a series of karting courses to appear around the region. They then set off in pursuit but, no longer having the ability to use their brooms, they decide to ride each other (don't ask questions). When you compete, therefore, there are no four or two-wheeled vehicles, but only lolis that ~surf~ above other flying lolis. Yes, all quite absurd. The narrative premise of Gensou Skydrift is told (very badly) in a very sad white font on a generic forest background, translated from Japanese to English in the worst possible way and with completely staggered new lines, to give that low-profile idea no budget and no quality control. But let's leave aside the narrative interludes between one race and another, which will be brutally skipped by pressing the X key faster than any video game has ever seen: let's talk about the gameplay instead. Of course, each wizard has their own stats for speed, maneuverability, power, and so on. When we compete we will therefore control a couple of characters and we will also be able to reverse their position to change the vehicle and consequently statistics. Each character also has a unique magical ability. In fact, we are talking about witches and magical powers are part of the package. In terms of pure gameplay, spells are nothing more than the attack and defense objects that in Mario Kart are obtained through the flying cubes scattered along the course. In the case of Gensou Drift, the powers are not collected from the track but must be evoked by spending an energy bar: this must be accumulated by passing through magic circles which also give a short speed bonus. These hoops are regularly scattered throughout the track and ideally you should maintain a continuous push as you pass from one hoop to the next. The various routes have crossroads and shortcuts from time to time to be exploited to gain an advantage and slightly vary the pace of the race. The magical powers vary from the classic forward thrusts, up to various types of more or less homing attacks. Then there are shields to defend against enemy blows and blocks to be placed to slow down the enemies that collide with them. Furthermore, the magic is ~summoned~ by the loli she leads and, in the event of a role reversal, is put into the background: the new loli can therefore summon her own magic. Theoretically we could therefore keep a useful power on the loli-kart to reverse and use when needed. This tactic is actually very irrelevant. Most races are resolved with clean driving and using the various magic circles to maintain top speed. If you don't crash off the track (and there isn't always a ~flower of the track~) and if you don't miss every corner, the enemy AI won't have many chances. We've completed a few paths without a single magical power being used against us. Gensou Skydrift: like Mario Kart but not really The campaign mode throws us into one course after another but doesn't do much to entice replay value; there are no special tournaments or competitions. However, we have the Free mode, which allows you to compete alone to establish the best time. Then there is the local multiplayer, the race against the AI (with some modifiers, for example ~no spells~) and the online multiplayer that we have not had the opportunity to test. In essence, a classic package on which there is little to say. What we can say is that Gensou Skydrift is basically uninteresting and quite boring. The powers are practically of three types and most of the time they have little use especially if you are in the first position. There are about twenty courses and they have their own uniqueness and styles, but the problem is that they are graphically terrible to look at. Overall the whole game lacks style and personality. The first demo of the game was presented at a Japanese fair in 2014 and we believe that they have not gone much further. We're basically talking about a bad PS3 game now coming to PS4, when the world (or at least 4-5 million people) are playing PS5 and related next-gen games. In some cases the graphics are also a playful impediment: the effects of light or fog are letlaterally some giant flat textures that invade the track and will prevent you from clearly seeing what is in front of you. Various paths also have terrible color combinations: there is a path that we believe can also cause an attack of motion sickness to the most sensitive as there are moments in which it is not clear where you are and in which directions you are facing. There is also no visual, audible or tactile feedback for impacts against opponents or against the course. Finally, although it seems superfluous to say, there is no support for PS5 functions in Gensou Skydrift. Gensou Skydrift: Visually improved", "date": "2021-03-13", "grade": "5.0"}
