But a real cooking guide So what is the fundamental difference compared to a traditional recipe book? What makes this Cooking Guide different from its paper counterparts? Certainly the type of interactivity, which allows you to be literally followed step by step in the execution of the recipes, without having to consult pages of books with your hands often dirty with flour and sauce . Books that (at least to the writer) often have the terrible habit of making us lose the page just when some preparation is about to boil or we have both hands busy in a dough. Best wishes for finding the page again. In this sense, the software proposed by Nintendo can rightly be considered liberating and truly of great convenience, provided that one is not particularly tied to the traditional nature of the classic cookbooks. No more fingerprints on recipe books The first thing we have to do when starting the software for the first time is to carry out a voice recognition procedure that allows the Kitchen Guide to recognize our pronunciation of the word ~forward~. This will be particularly useful, if not focal, in the process of our recipes. In fact, it will be that sort of magic word that will order the software to move on to the next step of making the dish we have chosen to cook, allowing us to virtually make our electronic chef ~turn the page~ with a simple voice input. Here's the real difference with paper cookbooks: we'll just have to communicate vocally to the game that we've finished the phase we were facing. Once the command has been implemented, the virtual chef on the DS will move on to explaining the next step, thus allowing us to execute the recipes in a rather agile and comfortable way without hindrances of any kind. This regards the ~heart~ of each recipe, i.e. its execution concrete. But this is not what the Cooking Guide is limited to, offering us a series of highly useful sections. In fact, let's say that we don't know what to cook for dinner. We just need to turn on our DS and look for a recipe we like, selecting it on the basis of the course (pasta, meat, vegetables, etc.), the country of origin, the calories or the difficulty of making it, or even simply by ingredient, inserting the word of our interest in the free writing field. In our case we wanted to make meatballs. In the German way, we have decided. At this point it will be possible to view the complete list of ingredients and necessary utensils, which will allow us to check if we are missing something in the pantry, as well as all the information and some advice on the specific dish. Guanciale or bacon? This is the dilemma The actual realization of the recipe is followed in a very detailed way, we would say that it is really impossible to go wrong. But there are defects which, however venial, in some cases could lead to unpleasant results. One of the major defects is certainly that relating to a certain superficiality, in some cases, in the description of the ingredients. Now, for example, we know that spaghetti all'amatriciana must be prepared with bacon. The recipe of the Guida in Cucina instead indicates bacon as an ingredient. Nothing dramatic, we also know that the recipes are often subject to regional variations, everyone makes it as they prefer, in short, establishing which is the original recipe sometimes triggers endless and inconclusive disputes. So let's say that it's okay for us to indicate bacon rather than bacon. The problem, however, is that it is not specified whether it is sweet or smoked bacon. Which definitely changes the balance of the other ingredients as well as the definitive flavor of the dish. This is an example given only because it is close to our traditions, but such inaccuracies on totally unknown dishes can lead to compromising the final result, due to the different dosages required depending on the type of ingredient used. Another minor defect is that of the sensitivity of the microphone which, if there are ambient noises, loud conversations or bumps into something, desperately tries to recognize the magic word ~forward~. Failing to do so results in a what did you say? which in the long run can even be irritating. On the other hand, this sensitivity cannot be ignored if we want our ~forward~ to be effectively recognized when necessary without placing ourselves two centimeters away from the microphone. Among the advantages that we want to underline, however, we find the presence of a glossary of the most commonly used terms and a series of videos that show how to carry out the basic steps. ccomment We have decided not to assign a real vote to La Guida in Cucina, in consideration of the fact that it is not a video game, in any of its meanings, but a real software that acts as a recipe book and guide for cooking. execution of the recipes themselves. The impossibility of evaluating it according to videogame parameters made us decide not to classify it. However, we can certainly tell our willing users to try their hand at cooking that we are certainly dealing with a very well-structured interactive software that allows us to simplify the creation of new dishes, as well as stimulating the experimentation of recipes never tried before by each corner of the world. Rather detailed, with great attention to detail, La Guida in Cucina perhaps suffers from the lack of the possibility, derived from the console in which it is inserted, of exploiting any additional contents that would have expanded the available recipe book, albeit large enough to keep us busy for many lunches and dinners . Extremely usable, the presence of a list of ingredients, a glossary and various indications on the chosen recipe, albeit sometimes a little superficial, allow us to try our hand at any dish without fear of making a mistake. To be recommended. Pros Vast recipe book from all over the world Usable and detailed Calorie content specifications Cons Sometimes superficial in defining ingredients Microphone sensitivity problems Dosages not always very precise The guide in the kitchen: what are we eating today? is available for Nintendo DS. In the last period, we can now say in recent years, we have seen the video game market expand in an increasingly important way towards the coverage of an area of ~atypical~ gamers, the so-called casual gamers, identified in an often simplistic way in an audience of adults and children. And women, above all, armies of housewives called to experiment with the new game worlds proposed to them, whether based on mental training, playful fitness or, in this case, cooking guides. In reality we are not exactly faced with a game, nor according to the standard canons nor, frankly, according to any possible canon. It's just not a game. But a real cooking guide, a sort of interactive recipe book through which we can be followed step by step in the creation of dishes of all sorts and kinds, for a total of 245 recipes from every corner of the world. do, this time, with titles like Cooking Mama. There will be no mission to carry out, no goal to achieve, no kind of dynamic action. Unless we want to consider an excellently successful dinner a goal to be achieved, in this case we can certainly say that the ~mission accomplished~ can be earned when the dishes put on the table have been tastefully cleaned.", "date": "2008-07-10", "grade": null}
