{"name": "Furby Island", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/furby-island.html", "text": "Do you know what a Furby is? Well, if you've seen the movie ~Gremlins~, you can probably get a good idea of what these cute little animals are like, since they are clearly inspired by the character of Gizmo. Yeah, you know, that funny little ball of hair who can't eat after midnight or it's trouble. Well, we understand each other. In short, it is no coincidence that Warner Bros has sued the producers of Furby for this resemblance. In any case, it is a line of electronic toys created in the late 90s, which we have also been able to see in Italy and which has enjoyed great success among children in the USA. The peculiarity of the Furby is that they ~learn to speak~, in the sense that they listen to what is said to them and slowly use our language instead of theirs. Unlike other lines of products for the little ones, there has never been a particular relationship with the world of videogames, and in fact Furby Island is one of the few titles (moreover developed exclusively for mobile phones) in which it is possible to play driving one of these strange characters... The game is structured as a sort of mix between role-playing game and ~virtual pet~, and the story on which it is based is really simple: the Furbys want to organize a party on their island, but to do so they have to complete a certain number of tasks. In the role of an inhabitant of Furby Island (an animal with a particularly disturbing look), we will therefore have to talk to all the characters we meet, accessing a new quest from time to time and completing it to move on to the next. The control system sees us control our Furby in the four directions of a three-quarter view graphic, using the 5 key to interact with the environment in different ways, through an interface that includes dialogue, use, inventory opening, etc. The missions are all very simple, generally it is a question of exchanging a few words with another inhabitant or obtaining a specific object, which perhaps arises from the meeting of different materials or must be purchased at a shop. To get the materials, we can not only collect them on the street, but also get them through small minigames in which we have to stop an indicator at the right time. To complicate life a little there are the bars that indicate the current state of health of our Furby, who needs to eat and have fun in order not to collapse. In short, a bit like what happens in the various The Sims, we will have to think about feeding it and entertaining it when necessary. The technical realization of the game is good, even if there are some significant shortcomings. The characters are drawn very well and have decent animations, moreover the use of colors is always excellent and the locations are characterized by numerous elements. Unfortunately, however, the island is anything but large, so you can explore it in its entirety almost immediately: therefore a little ~surprise effect~ is missing, where to complete the quests you end up always running in the same places. The sound consists of some MIDI music that neither adds nor detracts from the action, which lacks independent volume adjustment. As regards the control system (whose arrangement has already been mentioned), the character responds promptly to inputs and in this sense no problems are noticed. PRO Nice and colorful graphics A large number of objects and materials Simple game structure... AGAINST ...even too much Linear action Only one minigame", "date": "2008-06-11", "grade": "S.V."}
