{"name": "Aqua Aqua Wetrix 2.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aqua-aqua-wetrix-20.html", "text": "...and its game modes The game modes available are: training, a real tutorial that explains what to do step by step; story, the main game mode in which, by choosing one of the four available stages (plus an extra fifth obtainable by finishing all four levels with the ~Master~ rating), you will have to resist until the time runs out; in this mode you will suffer three attacks by the monsters that populate the planet but it is possible not to receive damage by reaching a pre-established number of points; then there's the quick puzzle mode, similar to the story without the monsters or time limits (you have to survive as long as possible); finally there is the two-player mode in which you have to resist more than your opponent, with the particularity that, by evaporating the lakes, you will no longer get the objects but, as in the game of filet (better known as tris ndcartac), a x or a circle: place three identical symbols in a row and you will activate special attacks (such as rain or fireballs) which will devastate the opponent's playing field. The technique Moving on to the technical implementation, it must be said that the title defends itself quite well. While not exploiting the enormous capabilities of the machine it runs on, Wetrix 2 shows nice and functional graphics for the type of game, with clear but monotonous textures (they change only depending on the level chosen) and with funny but not very varied character animations. The various special effects (such as the rainbow) are beautiful. The CG movies are missing, replaced by a meager introduction, which recalls those of the Naughty Dog (Crash Bandicoot) titles in terms of graphic style and by short clips between one level and another. Another drawback concerns the impossibility of rotating or tilting the playing area (it is only possible to move the view away) which makes control of less visible areas a bit frustrating. For the sound the same goes for the graphics: nice but could have been done better! The music will accompany you during the games without disturbing you, while the sound effects and, in particular, the little voices of the aqua are well done. Conclusions Ultimately, Aqua Aqua Wetrix 2.0 is a good, fun game (after a few hours of training because you need to practice a little before being able to understand how to exploit all the game elements) but not very long-lived due to the small number of levels available. A title that will appeal to those who appreciate the genre and in particular to those looking for an above average level of difficulty (and I assure you that to unlock the hidden stage you will have to really try hard!) but not suitable for beginners to whom I recommend rent it before considering the purchase. The actual game... At the helm of the aqua (water spirits), cute puppets with drop-shaped heads, your aim will be to establish the right relationship between earth and water, while trying to banish the four monsters forever. At the beginning of the game, partly taking up the mechanics of Tetris, you will have to place blocks of various shapes on the ground trying to create banks that can contain the water that will fall later. The difficulty lies in the fact that you will have to manage not to let it come out of the playing field, otherwise it will flow into a drain, filled which, the little water that is inside will perish and you will have to start over. Taking a look at the elements that make up the game, we find blocks of earth, bubbles of water, plus all the elements of help or annoyance. The earth blocks are represented by red arrows pointing upwards, while the water by blue bubbles; once placed on the ground, the arrows will give rise to hills, while the water bubbles will break, releasing their load. So far so simple enough but to complicate things there will be the rain (which unlike water you can't direct where you want), the green arrows pointing downwards that level what they find beneath them and then there are the balls of fire that have the dual purpose of evaporating water and destroying earth blocks. There is no shortage of annoying bombs which destroy everything they encounter leaving a deep chasm (be careful not to explode them in a lake otherwise all the water contained in it will be sucked up filling the drainage channel) and which cause a chain bombardment if you will blow up two in the same place, while the ice blocks freeze all the present (or future, which will fall) water in the lakebigger. Of course it doesn't end here: for example, by building lakes at least two blocks high, creatures will appear that will raise your score; moreover, by evaporating the water (through the fireballs) objects will appear which will be placed in a grid on the left of the screen: fill in a row and you will get additional bonuses such as the aurora or the power lake. Finally, if you manage to accumulate a certain amount of water, a rainbow will appear which will give you precious points; conversely, if there is too much earth you will fill the earthquake bar, devastating everything you have built so far (to avoid catastrophe, use the green blocks to flatten the earth blocks that are not needed).", "date": "2001-01-29", "grade": null}
