For the landing on the App Store, however, Exient has decided to present itself with another name, X2, and under this label it has debuted with a couple of games that are highly appreciated by Apple users such as X2 Snowboarding and above all X2 Football. Already with the 2009 edition, in the opinion of many, the latter had surpassed the exploits of much more famous football titles such as Gameloft's Real Football and EA's Fifa; the release of the 2010 version was therefore awaited with particular interest, in the hope that it would be able to bring with it a further qualitative step such as to definitively detach the competition. Piccinini tvb The work done by the English programmers was obviously focused on refining and perfecting the foundations laid with the previous episode; in this sense, the control system, an authentic and important problem to try to solve in the best possible way on a device without physical buttons, undoubtedly stands out as the best in the entire category of football titles on the iPhone. This is basically thanks to the more than decent precision of the directional stick, whose position can be changed based on the first touch of the player's finger, both in the face of the 3 function keys that allow you to perform a range of actions that are largely satisfactory in an intuitive way. It is clear that the developers wanted to refer to the best home console games, without too much awe in trying to reproduce their characteristics. The result, as far as pure and simple gameplay is concerned, is therefore positive although not without some problems; in the defensive phase, for example, the feeling of control can be improved, as well as the positioning of one's teammates controlled by artificial intelligence who too often leave sensational chasms open for the opponents. More generally, it is in the physicality of the athletes that some weakness is recognized, more precisely in the moment in which the contacts and contrasts between players occur. But probably where the X2 Football 2010 team should focus development is in the performance of the graphics engine; even without making absolutely sparks in fact as regards detail and number of polygons, the frame rate is only sufficient (on iPhone 3GS) and there is also some noticeable drop during the most agitated situations with enlarged views. A factor that significantly compromises the fluidity of the action and above all the control of one's players, even if it is clear without ever reaching serious situations. Although these defects preclude X2 Football 2010 from a promotion with full marks, it is still clear how the effort of the Exient team is able to establish itself as the best football game on the App Store, pending Konami's debut with PES. And the quality of the product is evident not only during the games, but also by observing the surroundings, especially in the sector of the available modes; in addition to the single game, a large number of intra and extra European championships and cups are available, together with the Dream Mode in which it is necessary to earn money to buy the best players and thus create a dream team. There is also a robust multiplayer component both locally - wi-fi and bt - and online, which however is difficult to use due to the lag and frequent disconnections which significantly compromise the effect. Finally, the technical component is not very exciting; from a graphic point of view, as already mentioned, we are faced with a more functional than spectacular product, with poorly detailed player models and not at all resembling their real counterparts. On the other hand, the animations are good, even quite well linked to each other. The sound is forgettable, both for music and effects, and for the English commentary destined to be deactivated soon.
