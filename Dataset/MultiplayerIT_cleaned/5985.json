The Firemonkeys developers have great experience with this type of product, and it was therefore completely natural for Electronic Arts to entrust them with the creation of Need for Speed: No Limits, the new mobile episode of the famous racing series. However, we are talking about a profoundly different experience from that of Real Racing 3, clearly arcade-style but characterized, in this specific case, by a very fast approach, evidently designed for rapid and impromptu use rather than for lasting involvement, in the perspective of complex and structured tenders. Certainly he hasn't skimped on the technical sector, and it takes just a few minutes to understand how the game's graphics are adequate to what is best seen on smartphones and tablets, thanks to detailed and excellently rendered cars, which compete in scenarios varied and rich in contour elements. The engine struggles a bit on the iPhone 5s, evidently optimized for the latest generation terminals, but the results are still remarkable and some drop in the frame rate certainly doesn't overshadow them. Need for Speed: No Limits is a spectacular and fun, but often ~hasty~ driving game No limit? Aware of not being able to repeat the debacle of the aforementioned Real Racing 3 and its many constraints aimed at monetization, Electronic Arts has given carte blanche to the developers, allowing them to design an experience that, while using a freemium model and the usual fuel system that wears out with each race, during the first few hours it doesn't actually put limits on our desire for progression. From the point of view of the structure, this means that Need for Speed: No Limits ranges from the traditional career to special tournaments and temporary events, gradually handing us ~fragments~ of cars and upgrades to be unlocked as we win the races, thus regulating the our ambitions but without choking them by forcing us to ~grind~. A solution that works, as mentioned, and which at first does not even suffer from time constraints, given that a complete supply of fuel corresponds to each new level of experience reached. In short, the game runs fast and it is possible to use three different styles for the controls (touch, tilt or virtual steering wheel), all valid and precise, even if the touch controls prove to be more comfortable on the one hand, and on the other less reactive than one would expect. The gameplay is distinctly arcade, therefore there is an emphasis on nitro and ways to recharge the indicator, in this case acrobatic jumps, drifts, trails and close overtaking. The point, as mentioned initially, is that all the races are rather short, in some cases in the order of thirty seconds, and in the long run this ends up limiting the ambitions of a product which, in any case, proves to be solid and pleasant. characterized by an excellent interface and more than one interesting cue.", "date": "2015-10-10", "grade": "7.8"}
