{"name": "La recensione di Overgrowth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/190300-overgrowth-la-recensione-di-overgrowth.html", "text": "The story of Overgrowth begins with the success of Lugaru, the first commercial title from Wolfire Games, a software house formed at the time by David Rosen alone, an independent developer who was very active and appreciated on the scene. It was 2005 and the many acclaim for that action game focused on ragdoll physics convinced Rosen to expand the formula, making him start the development of Overgrowth. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, with the independent scene which in the meantime has carved out an important place on the videogame scene and with some technologies, such as ragdoll physics, which have ceased to amaze and which have been surpassed . Overgrowth was announced in 2008, after Rosen had already spent many months developing it. In 2013 it launched in Steam Early Access, finally becoming playable and since then, after a disproportionate number of updates, it has finally been released in a definitive version this month (note for posterity: October 2017). game systems The history made in the introductory paragraph is not an operation for its own sake, but serves to make people understand a fundamental concept that we will develop throughout the rest of the review: Overgrowth carries with it the weight of an old conception, dragged on for years and years; conception that penalizes him in various aspects. But let's not rush. The game is divided into two campaigns, both starring Turner, the anthropomorphic rabbit already seen in action in Lugaru. One of the two campaigns is precisely the revival of Lugaru's one, while the other, the main one, is completely new and longer. Let's say that it takes about three hours to finish both altogether. The stealth system is under exploited Basically we are faced with a third-person action divided into very short scenes, of which the objectives are always the same: kill a certain number of enemies, defeat a boss or climb some building using Turner's agility. In fact, our rabbit is not only a master in martial arts, but he is also capable of making very long leaps, climbing and running on walls in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time style. Precisely these incredible characteristics have allowed Rosen to conceive very large and spectacular platform levels, despite the fact that graphically Overgrwoth does not cry out for a miracle due to not very detailed three-dimensional models and a great lack of inventiveness of the scenarios. The platform phases above all perform well, generally built vertically, while the other chapters, more closed, with some exceptions, appear to be decidedly poor in inventiveness. The fights can be spectacular or completely confusing Obviously the fulcrum of the game is the combat system, borrowed from that of Lugaru and completely based on contextual actions: the blows taken change according to the position, the given direction, the height of the view, the number of enemies around us and etc. In addition to attacking, Turner can also counterattack or use weapons (knives, swords, bo, spears, etc.). The enemies he will have to face are other rabbits, mice, cats, dogs and wolves, all obviously anthropomorphized. There is no graphical interface visible on the screen, so to know Turner's status you will need to read the signs on his body (injuries, posture and so on). Like Lugaru, Overgrowth also integrates a simple stealth system, which allows you to get behind enemies to choke them or cut their throats. In short, Overgrowth on paper is a truly varied title, but in practice it is not like that. Ten years to do what? One of Overgrowth's biggest limitations is its structure. We have already told you that the campaigns are divided into very short chapters, all with different settings, which are exhausted within a few minutes, if not quite seconds. Sure, each chapter is narratively linked to the previous one, but often you don't have time to load it that you've already finished. For example, some are formed by dialogues only, while others are resolved in single fights of a few seconds. At least the narration was decent... Unfortunately, although the stories that form the background to the two campaigns are interesting in their own way, they are treated hastily and with very low-level texts, at moments that are really bland and not very incisive, when not exactly childish. However, the biggest flaw of the game structure is another: having reached the end of Overgrowth, one feels as if he has exploited the various systems under it, because each scene imposes a certain behavior and leaves no initiative to the player, who finds himself not putting never reallytest the capabilities of the character in a wider context and free. Then when you learn the sacred technique of the flying kick, which allows you to get out of practically any situation, the clashes lose much of their attraction, since you begin to ignore the ground combat, sincerely too confusing and not very satisfying, in the its quickness. Unfortunately running, jumping and kicking almost always work, even playing the hardest mode, and you don't feel the need to do anything else. Smash a little So far we have only talked about the combat, which is the core of Overgrowth, but the platforming phases also have their problems. The least is the slipperiness of Turner, which can create some difficulty in landing, especially in longer jumps; the major ones being a crazily handled camera and a whole host of issues related to wall-running and clinging to ledges, which produce repeat deaths. The platforming levels are the best In truth, there is little to say about the camera, given that it is half a disaster: leaving it completely to the player's management means that the action is often framed very badly. If in fights this translates into random shots and a continuous search for the right shot to view the very fast enemies, in the platform phases it can mean blind leaps, with Turner ending up clinging to ledges whose existence we did not know. Selecting the automatic camera doesn't help much, because it's managed really atrociously and ends up causing other problems, especially where more precision is required. As for climbing and jumping from walls, it's enough to know that most of the times you end up crashed, it doesn't depend on the fact that you haven't understood what to do, but on the jumping system that often refuses to indulge us. It's true that watching Turner crash to the ground is spectacular, especially if you drop him from great heights, but let's not exaggerate. However after several attempts you always end up succeeding, even if sometimes you don't quite understand how or why. Turner's body doubles as a HUD Here, the strongest feeling that pervaded us playing Overgrowth is precisely this randomness of our presence: that is, not understanding if we were advancing we were mastering the various systems more, or if we managed to overcome the chapters by mere luck. Paradoxically, something more from the game system is obtained from the additional content, such as the arena mode, which really allows you to take advantage of the combat system, or the free maps, which allow you to make sense of Turner's agility. It's a pity that the latter are largely incomplete... maybe we have to wait another ten years to see them finished.", "date": "2017-10-24", "grade": "4.5"}
