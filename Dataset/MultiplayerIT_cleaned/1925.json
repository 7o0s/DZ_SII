Obviously, no tutorials or particular introductions are needed: once the protagonist's heavy armor is put on again, the DLC throws us directly into the fray, as it was legitimate to imagine, throwing everything he has at us and also something in plus, for a challenge that we found quite similar to that of the first The Ancient Gods, equally focused on arenas but with a final showdown that would have deserved more attention. Structure DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2, an image of the protagonist. The DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2 campaign is also divided into four chapters, lasting less than four hours where you don't get stuck on certain clashes. Having accepted the Dark Lord's gauntlet at the end of The Ancient Gods - Part 1, the DOOM Slayer must find a way to reach Hell and put an end to this story once and for all. The first thing you notice in the design of the levels is the substantial reduction of the platform sections, which probably the bulk of users had not appreciated in the first expansion. There are still some routes that must be completed by balancing double jump, double sprint and climbing in the best possible way, however with the addition of an extra function of the side by side that allows you to hook onto certain holds, and often they are equally frustrating. The difference, as mentioned, is that they are much less. DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2, a jumping and climbing sequence. We focus on the fights, therefore, in slightly different contexts than usual. The first scenario boasts rather large landscapes, although in the end the exploratory ambitions are reduced to a minimum, while once you have crossed the gate of the underworld the situation becomes different and there are at least a couple of truly evocative glimpses that somehow counterbalance the generic and widely seen appearance of many areas. It is interesting to note how the horde-style setting that characterized the first The Ancient Gods has been consolidated and legitimized in this second expansion, through the introduction of ~switches~ that start the waves, contextually closing the borders of the battlefield with barriers, and which if desired can be activated twice to get extra prizes. Gameplay DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2, an evocative mid-campaign sequence. On the gameplay front there are obviously no substantial differences compared to the first part, in the sense that the run & gun mechanics of DOOM Eternal also find their maximum expression here and it would be difficult at the moment to imagine a next step on which, however, we are sure, the guys from id Software are already working. In addition to the final boss, in The Ancient Gods - Part 2 we will be able to face four new enemies: the Armored Baron, who must be ~dismantled~ using the plasma rifle before being able to inflict damage on him; the Stone Imp, who can only be injured using the shotgun's rapid fire mode; the Howler, a pathetic creature that emits a scream before dying capable of empowering all nearby opponents; and finally the Cursed Predator, who with his scratches can inflict a curse that can only be eliminated by chasing him and killing him with a Fist of Blood. DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2, the Armored Baron in the distance. To enrich our arsenal, which we will find already fully upgraded, this time we will not have the Crucible, but another legendary weapon: the Hammer of the Sentinels. Effective against less strong opponents, it has the ability to stun even the largest and most powerful creatures, allowing us to repeatedly hit them as long as they are dazed and giving us a few moments of respite in the middle of a close fight. We were talking about the final boss: the sequences that bring us closer to the battle are undoubtedly among the most spectacular ever for the series and clearly recall the final battle of Avengers: Endgame, but the duel itself unfortunately turns out to be less multifaceted and complex than we would have expected, with a sort of variation on the theme of the Raiders which, however, thanks to the Hammer is made surprisingly easy to conclude. Technical realization DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2, the final boss. DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part 2 boasts a fair abundance of cutscenes which, despite their brevity, certainly add depth to the technical sector of thethe expansion. Some of them show the most spectacular moments of the campaign, and at this juncture they are accompanied in a very effective way by a soundtrack that beyond this is very little noticed. The scenarios, as mentioned, move between ups and downs , often resorting to assets already seen previously, but with a couple of notable exceptions. The PC version, which we tested, borders on perfection in terms of performance and in fact with our RTX 3070 we were able to set the graphics to 2160p with everything maxed out while keeping the 60 fps stable, with very few exceptions which, however, can be fine-tuned by activating the dynamic scaler.", "date": "2021-03-26", "grade": "7.5"}
