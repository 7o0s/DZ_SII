{"name": "iDracula", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/idracula.html", "text": "The protagonist of iDracula is a hunter in perfect Van Helsing style surrounded by hordes of vampires, werewolves, witches and Dracula himself. Surviving enemy attacks as long as possible is the aim of the game, spreading death among the abominable beings while racking up points. Two different modes are present in iDracula, Survival and Rush. If the second is a mere collective attack of hundreds of abominations with legs where the protagonist is called to mow down the monsters relying on an M60 with infinite bullets, the first is undoubtedly the most interesting: armed with a mere pistol, the hero it must defend itself from attacks that are initially slow and carried out by a fairly small number of enemies. With the progress of the kills and consequently the scores, life begins to get difficult mainly due to the increase of enemies on the screen. In support come the classic power-ups that are so retro but always useful to lengthen the hope of survival; the available aids are mainly of four types: weapons, energy, projectiles and perks. In iDracula there are six types of weapons, from the pistol to the rifle passing from crossbows, grenade launchers even missile launchers. In addition there is also the aforementioned M60, the big wheel, much loved by that celluloid Rambo. The green potions are the classic energy supplies so expensive especially in the most desperate moments and the same ideology of use is found in the collection of bullets. The perks are as important as the weapons since they give the player very useful and precious supports: in some moments of the game, in fact, an icon will be activated at the top right, pressing it freezes time and a choice with four options is placed in front of the user , who can decide which aid to use. The bonuses will range from being able to shoot three arrows simultaneously, invincibility for a few seconds, energy restoration, a smart bomb and much more. iDracula is one of the few iPhone games that uses the accelerometer and stabilizes the direction of the mobile towards the left, i.e. with the volume keys upwards. Small accuracy but without a doubt excellent choice. Remaining on the gameplay theme, iDracula is played using the iPhone screen as a joypad: the left side is used for the movements of the digital protagonist, while holding down the right side enables the shot. Between the two virtual sticks there are the weapon selection icons while the upper part of the screen is dedicated to the energy bar and the enabling of the perk. Playing iDracula as a result is undoubtedly intuitive: the hunter is called upon to shoot, shoot and shoot while trying to survive. As always, the touch of the iPhone responds wonderfully to the commands given even if the choice of using two virtual pads reduces the visibility of some small portions of the screen. The component that unites the Rush and Survival modes boils down to the certain death of the character, the aim of the game is in fact to accumulate points on points and some special glyphs that raise the final ranking, the omen. After having passed to the other world, a ranking establishes the statistics first, including the number of monsters killed, the score made and the like, and immediately after a comment describing our level. Graphically very dark and dark, iDracula boasts a game backdrop perfectly matching the context, where small ruined roads alternate with meadows illuminated by warm street lamps. The game environment is only one but an update with new locations and weapons will be available soon on iTunes. The polygonal creation models of the player and of the evil beings are really well created, as are the animations, even if our hero will be able to rotate on his torso at 360 in perfect ~The Exorcist~ style. Is the hunter a bit supernatural too? The audio sector is really well cared for. Even if it boils down to an infinitely looped track, the soundtrack really penetrates the brain of the player and excites him. Much attention has also been given to the creation of the sound effects emitted by the weapons, customized for each of them.
