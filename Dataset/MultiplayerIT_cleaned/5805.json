After the first dedicated to the famous German ~Green Hell~ and the second to Catalunya in Barcelona, accompanied during the year by free additional content such as the Bonus Pack, the third and last ~dream pack~ was launched on Steam a few days ago ~ for this 2015, eagerly awaited by virtual pilots especially for the track, the legendary British Brands Hatch present in the two variants Indy and GP. As usual, the Roman software house led by Marco Massarutto and Stefano Casillo took the opportunity to make significant changes to the code which, with the new update, moved to build 1.4. Brands Hatch, racing cars and update to build 1.4 with the new Dream Pack 3 Even more beautiful Among the most appreciated features of the refined Italian simulator we certainly find the aesthetic sector, which stands out above all for the rendering of the polygonal models of the cars, faithful to the real ones not only for proportions, details and quality of the shaders adopted, but also for the lighting and reflection, all in support of photorealism. The new build of Assetto Corsa pushes the accelerator right from this point of view, thanks to the introduction of renewed post processing effects; among them we find a new system for dynamic reflections, improved HDR and an FXAA filter translated by a shader shaped by the Italian developers. To further improve the appearance of the dashboards, some of which had somewhat blurry fonts and details, the instrument graphics have been redesigned, while increasing their resolution with a new rendering model. Another updated feature is the behavior of the artificial intelligence, which is now able to follow the ideal trajectory more effectively, as well as more realistically exploiting the braking system of front-wheel drive cars. This specific intervention is linked above all to the introduction of the 500 Abarth Assetto Corse, a very fun little bomb to drive. As far as the netcode is concerned, a new predictive algorithm has been introduced, capable of interpreting and managing any missing data packets; in simpler words, the stability of the so-called ~antiwarp~ system has been improved, i.e. the one that prevents the annoying teleportations and anomalous behavior of the cars that sometimes afflict racing games during online matches. Other fixes and updates concerned the audio sector, the LOD, the optimization of some special events in relation to the renewed Tire model and the shadows, plus other minor interventions. Overall, this is an interesting update, but for the features most awaited by players, it is likely that we will have to wait at least until April, when Assetto Corsa will also land on consoles and will predictably be accompanied by substantial news. Dangerous curves Dream Pack 3, available from December 15 on the Valve platform for around ten Euros, includes eight cars and the aforementioned Brands Hatch circuit, what the famous former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger did not hesitate to define as ~the best track in the planet~. The new package focuses mainly on racing cars, both historic and modern, however there is also a road model which, after our test, we elected as the best of the lot: the splendid Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, also available in the wicked S3 variant . The Abarth 500 Assetto Corse is an even more aggressive, agile and fast version of the basic model, whose setup is focused on cornering precision. Very fun to drift thanks to the Tire model 6, the little Turinese also features a solid polygonal model, as well as an engine sound extremely faithful to the original. With a leap back in time we pass to the Ford Escort RS 1600, a car entered the collective imagination for the look and some technical specifications developed by Lotus. Equipped with four huge tires and weighing around 900 kilograms, the RS 1600 should be treated with respect for its particularly nervous behavior, requiring a good deal of practice to master properly. The model is excellent and the engine screams an ~old school~ symphony up to ten thousand rpm. Let's go back to Italy and take a trip to Sant'Agata Bolognese, home of Lamborghini, which in Dream Pack 3 is represented by two custom-built cars; the aforementioned Gallardo Superleggera and the more recent Huracan Super Trofeo. The first is spectacular from all points of view, especially in the S3 variant, offering simply superb precision and driving pleasure. It is undoubtedly one of the best cars ever introduced in a driving simulator. The Huracan Super Trofeo is a GT pressed to the ground that is slightly more nervous than others of the same level, however it doesn't take much to become familiar with its limits and fall madly in love with it. We go to Germany to introduce the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT3, a car derived from the splendid GT heir to the SLS. It is a solid and precise racing car, which has its most distinctive feature in the hoarse and deep roar of the engine, to be appreciated at full volume especially during replays. The polygonal model is beautiful and is only marred by some minor inaccuracies in the drop shadows. Another GT class car is the McLaren 650S GT3, translated from the marvelous berlinetta that in 2014 replaced the MP4-12C, one of the cars present in the original Assetto Corsa garage. Pin-sharp and exhilarating under acceleration, with a delightful engine roar between second and fourth gears, Woking's work of art suffers only from a hint of aliasing at the joints. Let's go back in time again for a quick analysis of the two historic Formula One Lotus introduced, the 1962 25 and the 1970 72D. The 25, driven at the time by the legendary Jim Clark, has relatively limited power and is very enjoyable to drive in technical circuits, especially after getting used to the braking system which quickly blocks the tyres. The polygonal model is simply perfect, as are the modularity and vigor of the rhombus. The 72D, although powerful and aggressive, is decidedly more ~polite~ than the Type 25, sharing with the ancestor a splendid driving feeling but also not very efficient brakes. We close our excursus on the contents of the Dream Pack 3 with a mention of the Brands Hatch track, which thanks to the Laserscan technology presents an absolute fidelity with the original circuit. Full of gradient variations and fast curves, this is one of the funniest tracks introduced in Assetto Corsa, also standing out for its excellent graphic representation.", "date": "2015-12-26", "grade": null}
