{"name": "SimCity Societies: Destinations - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simcity-societies-destinations-recensione.html", "text": "Several months have passed since the release of the first non-Maxis SimCity and despite the cold reception from critics and veterans of the series, Societies seems to have enjoyed some success among casual gamers. Otherwise, EA's decision to create this expansion would not be explained, which enriches the mechanics of the base game, introducing another key element in city management: tourism. This new variable will present you with new challenges, new objectives to complete and many new buildings, but can quantity compensate for poor quality? How wonderful! As mentioned in the introductory paragraph, Destinations brings the Tourist Sim to your city, with all its needs and problems attached, as well as its generous wallet: the goal of this expansion will be to transform your metropolis into a 5-star tourist destination, of course in line with the social destination that you have attributed to it. You will therefore have the task not only of administering the already known problems of citizenship, but also of carefully planning which resorts to choose, since you can only build one of each type, and their location within the city: you will therefore have the Resorts available for Nature lovers, who will attract tourists eager for short holidays (even just one day) and particularly attentive to their wallet, just as you can opt for much more expensive and profitable Resort Casinos, essential for attracting dozens of celebrities and particularly wealthy VIPs . The type of tourists is not only attracted by the type of resort and the social destination of your city, but also by the means of transport you have built (now much more expanded category): so the bus stations will bring the poorest tourists, while helipads and airports will attract wealthier visitors, but also with much more demanding requests. The problems will come to accumulate when the tourists will start to take advantage of the city structures: the classic way, let's say abused, in the basic game of creating cities structured in small independent nuclei proves to be absolutely inadequate with the introduction of the tourist's unknown factor. Hence, therefore, attracting many tourists translates into an economic benefit, but also into a possible inconvenience for the citizens and these inconveniences can turn into riots, which will damage your tourism: and here, the miraculous SimCity cycle reappears in its splendor , requiring evergreen and continuous problem solving from the intellect of the weary gamer. The flaws Tired player because, after all, this expansion enriches the basic title, but certainly does not revolutionize it, presenting the problems of its predecessor: once the little desired 5-star classification is obtained, the game loses its charm and with him the player's interest in continuing or starting a new game. the miraculous SimCity cycle is once again in all its glory, requiring the evergreen and continuous problem solving of the intellect of the tired player The entire structure of the gameplay is undermined by an excessive simplicity which translates, for a gamer of little skill like the writer, into obtaining victory within a few hours and quickly finding those simple tricks that will allow you to avoid tactical traps foreseen and studied by the developers. A general diktat may be to build, if you plan to open your city to tourism, always one more element than necessary: thus, if your city area needs 2 restaurants to meet its needs, you won't have to do anything else. than build three or more, so as to compensate for any lack of services upon the arrival of tourists. PC - System Requirements The game is fluid on the test system, showing a framerate in fits and starts only in the presence of vast cities or atmospheric precipitations: in these cases, the number of FPS drops considerably, but without ever making the title unplayable. Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 1.7 GHz or 2.4 GHz on Vista RAM: 512 MB or 1 GB on Vista Video Card: 128 MB with Pixel Shader 2.0 support Disk Space: 2.1 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Dual core processor RAM: 2 GB Video Card: 256 MB with Pixel Shader 3.0 support Disk Space: 3 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 @ 2.7 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Ultimate Comment In conclusion, this Destinations does indeed bring a breath of fresh air, but to a product that already had little to offer at the beginning. We advise you to evaluate the purchase and to take it only if you believe that this is ita lean period for the PC gaming world or if you don't want to try your hand at something excessively complex given that, if nothing else, Destinations requires little time for the total learning of all the game mechanics. For the rest, discreet graphics, fun for the first few hours and easy to use: the emblem of mediocrity. Pros Some new additions Improve game mechanics... Cons ...but only for a few hours Impossibly repetitive", "date": "2008-06-24", "grade": null}
