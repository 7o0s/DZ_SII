It doesn't even have to be extraordinary returns or re-propositions of ideas that are still unrivaled today: the spice of nostalgia is often enough to make even medium-level productions special, just because many still tie them to happy experiences from the past. However, this does not mean that there is no merit in recovering some classics that have disappeared from circulation, because in the history of video games there are a myriad of brilliant titles, the inventions of which have not yet been ~consumed~ by the excesses of the market. of blockbusters to frequently unearth worthy video games, but that of independent development, always looking for distinctive features or structures modern enough to be re-proposed without who knows what transformation. The team we are talking about today, however, although well known for the Shantae series and often held in high regard due to its artistic skills, has never had a reputation in the field comparable to groups specialized in operations of this type (such as for example Dotemu). In fact, Wayforward would have the necessary skills to throw themselves into total remake operations of the classics or into the creation of high-level spiritual successors, yet for one reason or another they always seem to stumble on the finale, unable to fully consolidate the potential of their creature. But now, with River City Girls 2, this software house wants to demonstrate once and for all what a direct evolution of that River City Ransom can do in the current generation, which had in some ways overturned the concept of scrolling fighting games: a a more than feasible task, given the already valid foundations (but, as usual, far from perfect) of the direct predecessor. We played this sequel thoroughly, to understand if it really is the evolution of the genre that many feel the need; so here's what we think, in our review of River City Girls 2. Narrative: a merry fistfight with the yakuza If you want to use Provie, you'll have to beat her up first. In River City Girls 2, things are mostly accomplished by beating, after all The story of River City Girls 2 broadly restarts from the conclusion of the first game (although it tends to ignore much of what happened in the secret ending), and sees Misako, Kyoko, Riki and Kunio dealing with the consequences of defeating the yakuza Sabuko. Convinced that they have finally cleared the streets of crime, in fact, ours must face the harsh reality when the father of the previous boss escapes from prison, and begins to implement a diabolical plan to take control of River City. Our heroes then find themselves expelled from school, and after months of rusting away playing video games on the couch, they're suddenly thrown back into a whirlwind of brawls and wackos when they head to the mall to buy a sequel to their favorite video game. Yes, in short, if it hadn't been understood... River City Girls 2 doesn't even remotely try to maintain a semblance of seriousness. This is a deliberately comic title, which thrives on absurd characters, far-fetched situations and learned references to scrolling beat 'em up classics, and it is a form of narrative coherence on the part of the developers that we sincerely appreciate. It doesn't take who knows what plot to justify a series of brawls with increasingly colorful opponents, not to mention that Wayforward's work has managed to get us more than a laugh with its references to Double Dragon and the constant breaks of the fourth wall. Don't underestimate Marian, she's a very dangerous grappler, who can stun enemies in River City Girls 2 in bursts Speaking of Double Dragon, among the playable characters there are two unlockable ones, Marian and Provie, and the first is precisely the eternal damsel in distress of that series, who has become super tough because she started training out of too much boredom while waiting to being rescued by the Lee brothers. Really hilarious idea. This kind of light-hearted levity pervades the characterization of the entire cast, and the only criticisms we feel are the absence of an option to speed up or skip individual lines of dialogue (either avoid them entirely or expect, with no middle ground), and the scant differences in the lyrics even when characters with specific relationships are involved. For example, Marian herself practically speaks in the third person when dealing with Skullmageddon (an antagonist she directly dealt with in the horrid Double Dragon Neon), andit is not the only situation in which few contextualizations of the writing are noticed. This occasional lack of care is strange especially if you consider that the title is all dubbed, moreover with good quality actors. Gameplay and structure: six dragons is better than two Locally you can play the game in four. A bit chaotic, but fun Understandably, just as from a narrative point of view we are dealing with a title that is almost identical in tone to its predecessor but significantly expanded, also in terms of gameplay River City Girls 2 offers a richer system than the original, with as many as six playable characters . We start with the four available in the previous game, where the next two are obtained in more advanced stages of the campaign, yet each individual fighter boasts specific mechanics, a greater variety of maneuvers than in the past, and interesting differences in the approach to the clashes that should satisfy almost any lover of scrolling beat 'em ups. The aforementioned Marian, to say, is a powerful grappler capable of stunning enemies with great ease, Riki can perform devastating combinations with the help of an energy projectile that remains on the screen and so on, for a truly enviable assortment of options . Even the basic formula is a clear evolution of what was seen in the River City Ransom series: Wayforward's work has similar but more elaborate RPG elements, and the progression revolves around a system of stats and accessories that require money earned by dint of defeating enemies. Fel money is also the main resource needed to use the dojos, where numerous additional moves are learned and certain levels of experience are mandatory in order to purchase the most devastating (and tantalizing) maneuvers. Many of these attacks are governed by two energy bars - one for special attacks, one for charged shots that break guards - which fill up during fights and are practically the only element to be managed wisely outside of positioning . The shopkeepers in River City Girls 2 arepeculiar It is a mix of elements that works well overall, also because everything described above must be exploited in an almost freely explorable city map with multiple objectives, side quests, and fast travel areas, very different from the very linear levels typical of the genre. However, it must be said that, although improved compared to the ancient series from which this title is inspired, the underlying structure also maintains some tedious elements, perhaps abandoned a little too much by Wayforward. In fact, the limitations of fast travel and the positioning of certain shops, combined with the constant respawn of enemies, can make travel to obtain some moves (or even just certain objects) rather annoying; the rather staid enhancement of the protagonists, then, can make the early stages boring, especially if we consider that the combat increases in value significantly only once a fair variety of shots have been obtained, and the consequent ability to perform long aerial combos. In addition, Wayforward also seems to have wanted to maintain the ~slow action~ of the old River City, and although this combat system is (for obvious reasons) infinitely superior to those titles, we do not think it boasts the pace and response of the inputs seen in other high-class revivals (such as the excellent Streets of Rage 4). Even in two it is possible to combine disasters in River City Girls 2, especially if you coordinate during the combos The primary lack seems to be linked in reality, however, to the general balance. Enemies are aggressive, but their patterns tend to be pretty basic and predictable despite a good variation in types, and only on higher difficulties are the basic mobs a concern. The bosses, on the other hand, are much more exciting, yet in part plagued by fixed patterns that make the challenge level of many of them practically unchanged even at high difficulties once you have learned properly what to do (even the possibility of putting objects aside healing facilitates things enormously). Finally, there are rather crude choices, such as clashes that ~block the map~ creating visibility problems with unnecessary screen chains, and some accessories that are useless to say the least, but we consider them negligible oversights. Overall, even with these flaws, the game remains a quality scrolling beat 'em up with interesting extra mechanics - such as the ability to use assist attacks by hiring mercenaries or ~capturing~ defeated enemies - great bosses and a nice load of humor; just don't expect great mechanical finesse or a combat systemttimento capable of rivaling without problems with the great classics ... it is still a work of Wayforward, and the American team has rarely produced titles with unforgettable gameplay. Ah, if nothing else the unused characters also grow as you progress through the campaign, getting all the money and experience that is earned by completing the objectives of the primary missions; keep in mind, however, that only active characters get experience points from street battles, and therefore your favorite warrior will always be more powerful than the others due to stat boosts and extra growth. Technical and cooperative sector: Slow Pixels This is Ken, and he's a real imbecile. You will get into a lot of trouble in River City Girls 2 because of her As for the technical sector, however, Wayforward tends to be quite renowned among independent developers, by virtue of the considerable value of their artists, and their skills in managing both two-dimensional titles with 3D elements and pixel art. River City Girls 2 obviously earns many points in terms of aesthetics, thanks to excellent pixel art, and very accurate settings and animations that give great personality to the work. Yet something must have gone wrong in the development of the game, because in as a scrolling fighting game this shouldn't be a heavy title or with optimization problems, and instead sometimes it has strange drops in framerate even on respectable configurations, not to mention that the FPS are locked in the options on PC. From what we have seen around, the most serious situation seems to be linked to the Nintendo Switch version, which has serious performance problems, whereas on other platforms the drops are much more sporadic and practically never create real problems during fights; however, it is curious to see optimization problems in a game of this type, and developed by a team with a lot of experience behind it. It is possible that the slow pace and the non-excellent response of the commands are in turn linked to the technical characteristics, and who knows that with future patches there will not be significant improvements (a patch to resolve the frame rate issues has already been promised, it seems); however, we do not believe that any progress in this aspect will change the overall value of the experience much. In conclusion, as regards the cooperative, there is not much to add. River City Girls 2 allows you to play together both online and locally, although once again it is not possible to bring friends locally in online games, which are limited to two users (against the maximum four ~couch~). We haven't experimented extensively with network gaming, but it's seemed pretty stable, and we think Wayforward's work pays off well in company.", "date": "2022-12-27", "grade": "7.5"}
