And it is no coincidence that the project has undergone such a troubled process with the departure of key figures of the software house, above all the mythological John Carmack who has long since passed into the ranks of Oculus Rift, various rethinking of the gameplay and presentations behind closed doors that have not collected positive feedback on several occasions. Last, in chronological order, the recent multiplayer beta which probably showed more critical issues than merits and was not digested by a good portion of the user who had poured many expectations on this game. And how can we forget that third chapter released something like twelve years ago, which clumsily managed to detach itself strongly from the style of play that DOOM had really helped to create without being able to convince either the old fans or the new ones due to a woody and too much survival horror oriented that in no way managed to be funny. But with a strange paradox, indeed probably precisely because of this lack of parents and references to have to follow in an obligatory way, the game that we found in our hands amazed us, as happened a few years ago with Wolfenstein: The New Order . Part reboot, part remake and perhaps even part sequel, the new DOOM entertained us in a visceral and primordial way. It probably lacks a whole series of frills that a player today expects from a product sold at full price, and it is perhaps excessively repetitive and schematic in some basic mechanics, but it knows how to convince in offering a shooter experience that for too long now, was missing on the market. We liked the new DOOM in its primordial will to just shoot the player Dialogues: and who wants them? Let's start right away by saying that the plot in DOOM is pure and simple tinsel. No cutscenes, apart from a couple of interludes during the loading screens of the more advanced sections, and a handful of absolutely useless and free in-depth texts that you won't even realize you've skipped. On the other hand, what could we expect from the software house that had declared, years ago, that the story in videogames is like that in porn movies: it must exist but it's not important. Concretely a narrative arc is present and revolves around four figures: the player who represents the DOOM Marine of a prophecy who terrorizes evil entities a super villain who will try to do everything to open a portal that connects hell with the surface of Mars, a scientist inserted in the body of an exoskeleton who will guide you for most of the game, not without some notes of ambiguity and obviously the demons, thousands of demons. Who will want to do nothing but kill you without asking too many questions or investing their time in who knows what debate. On a narrative level, therefore, everything is extremely linear but, fortunately, the solution adopted is minimalist in its consequences on the gameplay: the few plot moments are told directly in the game with some dialogues and some skits without the action ever being interrupted. For those who want to go deeper, there are several collectibles that can be found and collected and which reveal a certain work by the software house to build a multifaceted world with a minimum of coherence. Let's be clear that we always talk about Mars, hell portals and people who go around killing demonic beings as if it were the most normal thing in the universe. And it is precisely in the collectibles that we probably find the most surprising component of this reboot: the large space given to the exploration of the levels. In many situations DOOM is practically a first-person platformer, a Mirror's Edge purified from parkour elements, where between one shooting and the next, there is plenty of time to devote oneself to free navigation of the scenarios in search of hidden ravines full of energy and armor but above all real secrets. Even before delving into the first-person shooter features, it is essential to say a few words about the exceptional level design that distinguishes the work of id Software. The maps are large, on a couple of occasions truly vast and above all endowed with a verticality that is very difficult to find in other exponents of the genre. And, what is even more linked to the past, they reward the player with a sea of collectibles which, in addition to deepening the narrative component a little as explained above, allow you to earn points to spend on the evolution of the protagonist and the weapons on your shoulder. But we will return to this aspect later, what we are interested in doingnoticing is precisely the stimulus to explore the levels, to study the excellent mini-map that can be recalled from one of the game menus and which can be comfortably navigated with the mouse and keyboard (much less with the pad) to analyze in depth where it could be hiding a certain access to one of the historical levels of the game recreated for the occasion (there is one for each map, very difficult to find) or to the hiding place of one of the DOOM Marines in a collectible action figure version or to some upgrades to be exploited . If you are a 100% completion maniac, you will not rarely retrace your steps without this ever resulting in boring and repetitive backtracking. A real dive into the past, to the time of the first Quake and the numerous exponents of the genre that populated the mid-90s. Come on, he shoots! Basically though, if you still hadn't understood, DOOM is and remains a first-person shooter that couldn't be more classic. You shoot a lot, a lot, and practically the entire focus of the gameplay is on the great skill required of the player to make his way through the dense levels, especially as the difficulty level increases. Precisely on this last aspect, the writer started immediately from the third level out of the five foreseen for the drafting of this article and, considering that the last one is unlocked only once the game is completed and differs from the previous one for the single life with which forces the player to complete the title, we advise you to do the same. Increasing the level of difficulty in fact brings not only a greater number of enemies to face at a time but also and above all, a greater amount of damage that is suffered when hit and this element further stimulates the basic mechanics on which it revolves all the action of the id Software project. First of all it is essential to move: there are no covers outside the natural obstacles of the level and the player is asked not to stop even for a moment to think and to run around the level making the most of the platforms and elements that enrich the scenario managing verticality in the best possible way. It is essential to perfectly dose the weapons possessed also taking into account the fact that there is no reloading: as long as you have ammunition you can continue shooting. Breathless. There are two important exceptions to this mechanism that appears extremely oiled from the first minutes of the game: special weapons and above all the ~finishes~ or, as they are called, the epic kills. Let's start with the latter. When you weaken an enemy to near death, they will start to stagger in place and flash blue. At that point, having arrived in shot range, the brightness will turn red and we will be able to perform a contextual melee blow to kill him. By doing so we will gain energy (and through a specific upgrade also armor) by activating an animation that will make us invulnerable for a few moments but still immobile and therefore at the mercy of any enemy in the immediate vicinity once the finish is over. The result is an incredibly fluid combat where we will have to alternate shots from a distance and sudden approaches to kill the opponent, all while properly managing the two volatile components, energy and armor, which do not recharge automatically but force us to search continuously medikits and equipment scattered on the ground. Several have felt like criticizing this choice by id Software which tends to break up the rhythm of the action with these continuous automatic animations but in reality we feel like saying that it is all appearance because, mouse and pad in hand, the mechanics are really very responsive and perfectly blended with the rest of the gameplay. To this equation we add the chainsaw on which we will get our hands after a very few hours of play and which allows us to kill enemies with a single close-range shot, regardless of their energy. But there is a prerequisite: the amount of petrol possessed must be at least equal to that required by the demon to kill him. Which means that the bigger the opponents we want to slaughter, the more we have to sip the use of the chainsaw by evaluating in a fraction of a second whether it is better to consume all the fuel to kill a Mancubus or if we prefer to alternate between a couple of Revenants and a Pinky. To add strategy there is the fact that each killing made with the chainsaw will drop a large amount of ammunition from the demon's corpse, effectively forcing us to use it during the most intense discounts to avoid running dry. We could also talk about the BFG 9000, another special weapon that we will pick up near theepilogue, but we prefer to leave you with at least a pinch of curiosity. The inevitable need to upgrade The weapons are the basis of an upgrade system that breaks strongly with the tradition of the series. Each gun has two different alternate firing modes (actually there are a handful of exceptions such as the aforementioned special weapons and shotgun) that can be switched on the fly once purchased by finding well-hidden drones inside of the various scenarios. By spending your hard-earned weapon upgrade points by slaying demons and completing a series of challenges related to each mission, you'll be able to unlock additional features for these sub-modes. Sometimes these are passive bonuses such as a greater speed of restoration of the functionality of the armory after the alternative fire has been used but sometimes there will also be more substantial modifications that determine the active use of the weapon. Just to get specific with a few examples, the shotgun can be used to fire an explosive parabolic shot, or to charge a discharge of three consecutive shots. The switch between the two modes requires the time necessary to unmount and remount the upgrade through a specific animation. Even the armor of our DOOM Marine has a similar enhancement system that can be activated by recovering special keys from the suits of some dead guards and, inevitably, adequately hidden in the various levels. In this case the functionalities of the suit are divided into five macro areas and we will be able to spend the accumulated points to unlock a handful of upgrades for each of them. These are almost always passive bonuses that allow us to increase the speed of our actions, or to be more resistant to accessory damage such as the explosion of barrels or our own rockets. And if this weren't enough, the title offers two further systems that the player can exploit to bring the controlled character even closer to his style of play. On the one hand we have an immediate boost that increases the maximum amount of energy, armor or ammunition, by spending energy capsules that we have to find in the maps. On the other hand we have a system of runes that must first be unlocked by tackling and overcoming mini-games and which we can then actually mount in one of the three slots available to us. The peculiarity is that these runes are also strengthened with use and the mini-games are nothing more than very short timed challenges where you usually have to use a single weapon to take out a certain number of enemies by meeting certain conditions. It's a clever system put in place by id Software to break up the pace of the action and let the player breathe during the most intense sessions. It is in fact in such a basic gameplay that we feel we can make the most criticism of the game. Yes because DOOM is ruthlessly repetitive in its mechanics. Fun, adrenaline-pumping and extremely satisfying for those who are willing to accept his style and are clear on what the software house has put in front of them. But hopelessly boring for everyone who was born and raised with Call of Duty, Halo and Battlefield. But also for those who expect gameplay less based on personal skill with the pad or with the mouse and keyboard combination from the shooter genre and perhaps want to experience a more engaging and refined experience, perhaps one that also has a story to tell deeper and more interesting. Instead, DOOM is truly primordial and in the dozen hours that it will take you to complete it limits itself to repeating the same, identical formula dozens, if not hundreds of times: entry into an area or room large enough, waves of enemies of increasing intensity to take out, optional exploration of the environment once it has been cleared in search of secrets, a few seconds of walking to reach a new area and repeat! There is more? Yes, but we didn't realize it! Before moving on to the technical aspect, let's spend a few words on the two other modes that make up the game's offer. First of all there is the multiplayer. The same that many of you who are reading this review have surely already experienced by taking advantage of the beta sessions that have taken place in recent months, some open to all. A high degree of aesthetic customization of your avatar and a hybrid class system that can be fully configured to enter the game with your favorite gear. There are several game modes but they all fall within the archetypes that can be expected from any traditional shooter with a soul of", "date": "2016-05-17", "grade": "8.5"}
