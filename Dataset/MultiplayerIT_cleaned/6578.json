{"name": "Two Point Campus: la recensione di un gestionale da bacio accademico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/two-point-campus-recensione.html", "text": "Welcome to the review of Two Point Campus, the sequel to that Two Point Hospital that four years ago reminded us how beautiful and carefree the management games of the past were, especially under the Bullfrog brand (where the founders of Two Point Studios come from). Two Point Hospital is a good game, which we still recommend to all interested parties today, which however lacks that extra layer of depth necessary to also guarantee a certain strategic variety; or if you prefer a certain type of texture, which is also essential when you are colorful and fun. Theme Park and Theme Hospital had it, certainly if they had it; Two Point Hospital much less so. No more hospitals! Two Point Campus: not only interiors, in this new game we will also be able to build huge, breathtaking parks With Two Point Campus, the developers have packed a much more interesting, multifaceted and balanced game. Yes, this time we can say it: a game that finally lives up to its illustrious past. Teleporting from hospitals to college campuses might not be the best if you are a fan of ER. Doctors on the front line and Doctor House, but the change of setting reserves several surprises and all positive. We weren't too convinced of the choice we made either, and many doubts survived even after our first quick play a few months ago, with a trial version, but everything changed once we tried the full game. Two Point Campus is a sequel that is not satisfied with adding and adapting the contents of the previous game to the new setting. The most striking novelty is the possibility of modifying the structure of our university right from the ground up. The exact opposite of what happens in the hospitals of Two Point Hospital which can be enlarged by buying new lots, but the sizes and shapes of the buildings are pre-established, used as another challenge for the player. At Two Point Campus we can raze any pre-existing structure and start from scratch; finished the space we will always have to buy new lots, but these are positioned with another idea of gameplay, fortunately much more fun and realistic than the one tending to the puzzle of the previous game. It's not enough to build huge rooms to fill with the necessary classrooms: in this game, green is also important given that certain activities can only be done outdoors, where students will also have substantial benefits to their mood. Little space, lots of creativity Two Point Campus: two aspiring wizards flirt on a cold winter evening As in Two Point Hospital, also in Two Point Campus we often find ourselves fighting with confined spaces, but compared to the first game here we have much more possibilities to resolve the situation. Furthermore, the scale reproduction of buildings and characters is studied much better, allowing us to build level rooms despite their small size. It also helps to better manage the positioning of the furniture which, in addition to following the game's millimeter guide, can now be rotated and positioned in a more gentle and precise way, freedom that allows you to organize spaces better and give the environment that touch of controlled disorder capable of making a difference. This is a function introduced with an update also in Two Point Hospital, but here it is granted much more gradually, particularly appreciated when we are going to compose gardens and parks. Outside, hedges, fences and low walls can also be drawn diagonally, in order to create unexpectedly complex compositions. There is no degree Two Point Campus: welcome to the Griffondoore school... yes, you read that right The school part is no different. There are fifteen degree courses, each with specific classrooms and others in common, and their duration differs according to the difficulty of the subject taught: some degrees are easier and will involve only one year of study, while others will ask students greater efforts and will have three-year courses. When setting up the school for a new degree course, it must be kept in mind that the number of students will double until that school path is complete, or until you have graduated those in the first year: from that moment on, the cycle will be over and their number will stabilize because the outcasts will be replaced by freshmen. The individual degree courses may also be strengthened and this will have three effects: the increase in possible candidates for enrollment, the consequent increase in the number of students that can be admitted, and the maximum qualification level that they will be able to reach once graduates. In practice they increase gThe students in the school, and when the students increase, so do the problems... The happy student Two Point Campus: The Cheeseball game is live, but the two teams remain tied In order for a student to do well, their needs must be met: the dormitories must be large enough, the facilities sufficient in number and evenly located around the campus. Vending machines are convenient, take up little space and do not require a permanent attendant, but offering only snacks and liters of soda will quickly damage the health of the guests of the structure. Each student has precise traits, some will be less capable than others and will not be able to aspire to the best grades except with the help of repetitions (they require a special room and teachers); however, it is possible to attract the brightest minds through open days, or by lowering the number of students admitted so that they are fewer than those in line to register. If after several attempts a student does not improve, and his traits make him a problem for the rest of the school, it is also possible to expel him from the facility. Whole vacation Two Point Campus: the sports university, where you can still teach anything else in free mode, is beautiful to see and play Like all schools and/or universities, those of Two Point Campus will also close at the end of the year and close to summer. The game will allow us to take advantage of this moment of apparent calm, while the university is quieter and there are far fewer students, to better organize the following school year. During the summer the staff training courses will be interrupted and no one will be involved in scientific research, but the rest of the workers will continue with their duties for the few remaining students, who will now have time to recover their strength. The Two Point Campus summer is a coup on the part of the designers because it allows you to do everything you would do while the lessons are active, but without pausing or damaging a promising vintage in progress. In the summer we build and demolish more calmly, and the more drastic changes won't risk putting a spoke in the students' wheels. This phase is entirely in the player's hands, there is no time limit beyond which the lessons will restart automatically; students will return to work only when we are ready, and after deciding whether to enhance existing courses or even introduce new ones. A special career Two Point Campus: more or less close friendships will be born among the students, and love will blossom Another area where Two Point Campus shines is in its campaign. If you have played Two Point Hospital, you will remember that the different hospitals were all very similar to each other: what changed was their layout and the external setting, sometimes urban, other towns and others still tropical or alpine. In Two Point Campus each university is introduced into the campaign bringing with them truly unique characteristics. The SEGA game starts with a little surprising tutorial, to take off immediately after with a university located in a delightful town square, where in practice we will manage a cooking school constantly inspired by the nearby restaurant run by the VIP chef SueChef DJ; here we can also organize various local, regional and international cooking competitions for our students. Soon after, the ancient University of Mitton is unlocked, with its medieval spiers and a great desire for robotics and the future. After that it's the turn of Noblestead, an almost medieval structure where we will be introduced to the degree course for Pushers of Knights (one of the many Italian quotations that the translators have allowed themselves, always respecting the original irony). Zero impact Two Point Campus: This is perhaps one of the cooking classrooms It is precisely in Noblestead University that Two Point Campus goes from being an excellent game, already superior in all respects to Two Point Hospital, to a classic of the genre. Here you can breathe a completely different, medieval-like air and atmosphere, furthermore the map is built in an unexpectedly organic way, with this inhabited center in the middle of the lots that we will be able to buy and exploit to expand the university. As in the city of the previous level, here too the university will be perfectly integrated with the rest of the environment, with students and staff who, if they deem it necessary, will be able to pass through scenario elements such as villages and parking lots. This allows you to build structures that blend perfectly with the surrounding environment, creating truly noteworthy postcards and offering hours and hours of extra gameplay to builders who love things done right, an aspect only mentioned in the previous game. Don't call her Hogw...Two Point Campus: party with guest in the student club, is there a better way to end the year? It will be difficult to make you understand the emotion felt in discovering the next level, but its name should give you more than a clue: we are in the University of Griffondoore. That's right, the fifth level of Two Point Campus will transform the game in such a radical way that for a few moments you will feel as if you have loaded a sort of spin-off dedicated to the world of Harry Potter. The gothic structure of the school, the sleet that makes everything more magical, the large amount of themed furniture, the challenges between wizards and the classrooms of spells and potions... and there is also an evil sorcerer who will cast death eaters and curses on the school, the former can however be rejected by the handymen trained as bodyguards (a function that will also be useful in other universities). And immediately after, another clear change of setting: the next university is hyper-modern and entirely focused on sport, more specifically on Cheeseball, and will require pitches and gyms. Even during your career, however, you are free to mix degrees freely, teaching for example science and the dark arts, or easy money, robotics and gastronomy. The third year darkettone... Two Point Campus: unlike Two Point Hospital, here the universities are much better integrated into the surrounding environment Each degree program will attract different types of students: there are goths, sportsmen, nerds, high-class, rebels, jesters and so on, each with its own characteristics. For example, goths always have a mood penalty, they are sad but manage to make others happier, perhaps by improving their self-esteem; the rebels are the dirtiest ones, but also the most creative. Depending on the scenario and facilities in our university, during the year it is possible to organize special events that will change the social and scholastic characteristics of the students, for example using a classroom as a cinema, or setting up a month-long party in the room of the students; if we have a stage, we will be able to call local stars for a concert, or challenge a cheesball team from another university for a victory that will earn respect, money and kudosh (as in Two Point Hospital, the latter are used to unlock new items) . And this wide variety of things to do, teach and build makes the challenges that will allow us to ~finish~ a level extraordinarily more varied and fun than those offered by Two Point Hospital). A club like any other Two Point Campus: a building entirely dedicated to the classroom where the fights between wizards are held, if you like you can do it. We called it The Arena Students will also be characterized by which club they decide to join, if they ever decide to do so. There are several, all quite silly and at the same time useful. For example, the brisk walk club will help students move around campus more effectively, while the nap club will reduce their need to rest. Clubs will also upgrade the university's entrance halls and gardens, as they will need different facilities for members to level up and unlock the best bonuses. But don't worry, like everything in Two Point Campus, this aspect is also designed to offer a sweet challenge, understandable but never taken for granted, and which brings with it other organizational logics that will further enrich the gameplay, which we can now say we have described to you in almost all its most visible aspects. Infinite playability? Two Point Campus: The game includes a photo mode but it just takes the interface off the screen. Better than nothing... However, there is another surprise destined to further increase the life of this product: in Two Point Campus you will not only find a mission structure, but given the size of the campuses and the large amount of possible choices, the new game is able to also host a real sandbox mode: choose the campus, the rules, and play until you have achieved absolute perfection. Before launching a new game we will be able to choose to play with a normal balance, opt for a permissive creative mode, test our skills in the challenge mode where money is very little, or calibrate every aspect of the game to the millimeter by choosing the customize option. If to obtain the three fateful stars in each level of the career it could take a hundred and more hours, the sandbox mode (translated into ~free mode~) risks quintupling this number, even touching that infinite replayability of the best exponents of the genre.
