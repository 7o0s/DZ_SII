{"name": "Age of Wonders: Planetfall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-wonders-planetfall-recensione.html", "text": "Many fans of the Age of Wonders series were baffled by the announcement that the new chapter would be set in space. How could a series of fantasy 4X strategy games be transported to the stars? However, by reviewing Age of Wonders: Planetfall all doubts have vanished, because Triumph Studio has succeeded in the enterprise. But let's get to the point because there is a lot to say. The first thing to do once you start the game is to customize your commander: there are six races available, unfortunately not very many, all with their pros and cons. For example, the Kir'ko are biomechanical creatures with psionic powers vaguely reminiscent of the Borg of Star Trek, the Amazon are a warrior race completely made up of women, the Dvar are space dwarfs, the Assembly are cyborgs who want to destroy galaxy to rebuild it according to their model of perfection and so on. Without mentioning them all, having made our choice, we started the first mission of the campaign, the tutorial one. The other possibilities offered are to face a scenario or participate in a muplayer game. Unlike Age of Wonders 3, whose campaign was divided into missions, that of Age of Wonders: Planetfall is divided into planets or, better, territories: each planet offers different challenges and stories, linked to the factions in the field. Let's say that in principle the setting is more open than in the chapters of the past, with each planet that can be replayed several times in a different way, as if it were a kind of Civilization with fixed scenarios. Either way, once you've selected the planet, you're ready to begin. 4X Structurally, Age of Wonders: Planetfall is very similar to many other 4X games. The gameplay is made up of two macro sections: the first is the more properly managerial one linked to the general map, in which you explore, come into contact with the other factions, go in search of resources, carry out the missions that are assigned to us and all those typical micromanagement operations of the genre are carried out, such as directing scientific and social research, choosing which troops or buildings to build in the colonies, managing diplomacy and so on. We will talk about tactical combat, the second section, in the next paragraph. The planets on which we will fight are divided into small territories, each characterized by different resources or by the presence of pre-existing settlements which can be cities of another faction, abandoned places to be reconquered and more. Each territory can be annexed to our domains by finding its center (indicated by a kind of placeholder) and spending a certain amount of influence points to take possession of it, building an outpost on it. The goal is to obtain as many resources as possible to upgrade our army and set out to conquer the opponents. From the point of view of the objectives and missions, Age of Wonders: Planetfall fills the player from the first minutes with things to do, including groups of marauders to kill, alien creatures to exterminate, personalities to escort, territories to recover, land to reclaim and etc. In addition to the classic panels full of functions, typical of 4X, the player interacts with the game world by moving teams, formed by up to six units. Although it has similar mechanics to many other 4X, Age of Wonders: Planetfall also has some notable differences compared to the competition: in particular, it is much more dynamic than any Civilization, devoid of downtime. Let's explain: very often in 4X there are stalemate situations in which one has to wait for a certain event, perhaps a few turns away, before being able to continue with one's strategies. In Age of Wonders: Planetfall however, the mission system always leaves the player with something to do, whether it's just reaching a certain point on the map with a scout. To achieve this, Triumph has adopted a couple of simple, yet innovative measures in their own way: it has substantially reduced the construction time of units and buildings, compared to other similar titles, and has reduced the research time for new technologies . In this way the succession of novelties is constant and, in case of defeat in some combat, you don't have to spend shifts on shifts rebuilding the army but you can have fresh troops in a short time. All this is seasoned with a good narrative side that keeps the player's interest alive even for the smallest actions, conducted through dialogues between the faction leaders and descriptive texts of the missions. Incidentally, being in contact with a certain faction does not only mean exploiting its resources or fighting against it, but also knowing its habits and carrying out the missions that are assigned to us.sign up to increase their trust in us. Annexing a territory desired by another faction means opening disputes that can be resolved with war or diplomacy (for example, asking or offering resources to mend relations). Acquiring a certain technology can turn the tide of war and so on. The price to pay for so much dynamism is that the player can often find himself disoriented by the high number of assignments received, but honestly one quickly gets used to it and, ultimately, what initially seems to be a problem soon becomes a point of Force. If we combine all the tactical fights, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, we get a complex, multifaceted, but very satisfying title, especially in the long run. Tactical fights The tactical fights of Age of Wonders: Planetfall are very reminiscent of those of the other Age of Wonders, especially the third chapter. When two or more enemy units come into contact, you can decide whether to automatically resolve the clash (handy when the forces in the field are extremely unbalanced) or whether to take part directly. The battlefield and troop deployment depend on which square on the general map the fight started on and the position of the squads at the start of the fight. In total, a maximum of seven teams can fight each other, an eventuality that only happens in the advanced stages of the campaign missions. Battles in Age of Wonders: Planetfall are fought in turns, with players and/or the CPU acting one at a time. Unlike the previous Age of Wonders, in Planetfall the clashes are focused on medium / long range combat; there is no lack of close combat, but they are rarer and dedicated to specific troops. Interesting is the inclusion of a coverage system reminiscent of the XCOM series, coverages that add an extra level of complexity to the action, forcing the player to take into greater consideration the probabilities of scoring from a certain position and the related problems at the shooting line. The presence of explosive weapons that can destroy cover and others that render them ineffective creates an exciting mix, magnified by the variety of deployable troops: there are infantry units on foot, armored troops, others capable of flying, still others equipped with such as building turrets or defenses. The native creatures of the planets are also very varied, essentially giant insects with different powers. As the game progresses and with the unlocking of new technologies, you get to control increasingly powerful troops, including armored beasts that are difficult to hide but have exceptional firepower. In principle, the tactical fights end up representing the fulcrum of the game and the section to which the most efforts are devoted. It is here that the extreme customization of the units, both those of the heroes, who acquire different abilities by leveling up and have a real inventory, and the standard ones, which increase in rank and can be modded with various types of technological grafts, comes into play. game and becomes essential to master if you want to win. For example, it is possible to equip the heroes with weapons obtained by carrying out the missions or purchased in the game shop (no microtransactions, don't worry), while the grafts of the regular troops are innumerable and range from healing ones to real summons. The good artificial intelligence also takes care of helping the player immerse himself in the clashes, which at the highest difficulty level offers a not bad challenge, net of some ingenuity. Also note the presence of special 'powers' that can be recalled during shifts and linked to the technologies developed. For example, we are talking about satellite attacks or mass treatments, just to name a couple. In short, those who feared that the transition from fantasy to science fiction would have impoverished the battles of the new Age of Wonders will have to think again, because this is not the case, despite the few factions and the lack of wizards and dragons (there are dwarves). Multiplayer, Italian language, mod Unfortunately we were only able to try the multiplayer mode of the game briefly due to the chronic absence of players on the servers, so we are suspending judgment on the matter until the servers are more crowded. We also point out the absence of the Italian language among those available, a lack that we imagine for many to be decisive in deciding whether or not to buy the game. Finally, it is fair to report that Age of Wonders: Planetfall has supported mods since launch, both through the Steam Workshop and through external tools. Style and interface Lhe only aspect of Age of Wonders: Planetfall that didn't convince us is the graphic style. Be careful, because we are not saying that the graphics are bad. Indeed, the units are varied, well designed, and well animated; the battlefields are convincing and rich in detail, despite being procedurally generated and while always remaining perfectly legible, and the decorative elements are more than adequate. The only problem is, as we said, that the general style seems already seen, as well as some choices relating to the mythology that forms the background of the game that all too obviously recall series such as Dr. Who, Star Trek and all the others that make up classic pop sci-fi. Nothing too penalizing, mind you, but honestly we would have preferred to see something slightly more risky and original. After all, other science fiction 4Xs, such as Stellaris, have also made similar choices, so it is clear that it is really difficult to free oneself from certain sources of inspiration. The same is also possible for the soundtrack, beautiful in the music, adequate in the sound effects, but too tied to the canons of the genre to stand out. After all, it is also fair to note the excellent work done on the user interface, which takes the good things Firaxis and Amplitude Studios have done in recent years and translate it into the world of Age of Wonders. If you have played one of the modern XCOMs, you will surely recognize some of the interface gimmicks in the tactical phase, just as if you have played Endless Legend or Civilization 6, you will like the minimalism of some choices of the general map and the more abstract style of the various windows. Finally, with Age of Wonders: Planetfall Triumph Studio has managed to create an excellent strategy, which takes a few hours to master, but which is capable of giving great satisfaction.", "date": "2019-08-06", "grade": "8.9"}
