However, a good game was missing that put us in the shoes of the always captivating and glorified warrior from the Colosseum, the so-called Gladiator who made the fortunes of Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe so much. Well, the time has come for you to grow a beard, put on a nice steel helmet and grab the remote control because Rage of Gladiator, downloadable for 1000 Nintendo Points, represents a sort of ancient Punch Out in Roman sauce with the relative setting of basic game and gameplay. Long-time gamers will already have in mind what we are talking about, and will be thrilled with a title that will bring them back with childhood memories and emotions. For all the others, however, it must be specified that a ~Punch Out-like~ game means a fighting game with a view behind one's alter ego, with three-dimensional graphics and a sequence of very charismatic characters to be knocked out (pardon , on the ground this time). In this game mechanic Rage of Gladiator also inserts a substantial character growth system with the possibility of increasing the intensity of one's blows, adding new ones, learning spells and spells, leveling up. After each match, based on our skill, the time taken, the energy left and the blows inflicted, we are given the opportunity to access a visual menu where it is possible to ~unlock~ certain icons referring to the moves we want to learn, so that from make them activated and available in subsequent matches. The tree diagram to follow to obtain all the skills and moves is very large and to collect them all and better customize our fighter there will be a lot to play: this is probably the most accurate and ~innovative~ part of the game. I have seen a slave become more powerful than the emperor! Once Rage of Gladiator has started, it is possible to choose the type of preferred control: horizontal remote control for a true NES-Style experience, remote control and nunchuck or Wii Motion Plus, for greater precision and speed in movements. Regardless of the fact that the game works well with all three types of controls (imperceptibly better with Wii Motion Plus), there are no real gameplay differences between one and the other, excluding the physical movement due to the rotation in the air of the wii remote. For each enemy we have to memorize the main moves and study their weak points, so that we can defend, parry and attack in turn. It is not allowed to move in the 3D space of the ring, but you can dodge and jump, or use the shield with the C key. Once the energy bar is filled, you can create endless combos (even aerial ones) or activate a spell that we learned previously (at the beginning we didn't have it). The developers Ghostfire Games have done a good job as regards the characterization of the bosses to be defeated: 10 characters that are very different from each other, both in terms of the type of enemy and moves, combos and special attacks. They range from the hammer of Taurus to the spells of Medusa, the meteorites of the Wizard Dark Vensor or the sword of the Ninja Naginata. All the characters are super characterized in appearance and in their behavior (scripted, of course), which through pre-established patterns makes them attack, defend, get angry and then make secret moves. The gameplay of Rage of Gladiator is all there: learn the movements of the enemy, exploit his weaknesses and strike. It's not all easy though, because each of them behaves in an extremely different way and every time a renewed commitment is required to move forward. Once all of them are defeated, the game continues in ~Challenge Mode~ in which we have to face them again, but with an extra degree of difficulty. It's about completing the game in a couple of hours, on the first lap, but the desire to unlock all the moves and spells requires you to play it over and over again. The graphic sector is very pleasant, with good polygonal models and excellent animations, all seasoned with discreet special effects such as fire, water, thunder, particles, motion blur. The game setting, while always remaining the same, varies greatly based on the weather conditions that change from clear to rain, day, night and so on. As far as the sound is concerned, decidedly suitable background music with an epic theme and many recited voices (although not always of high quality) stand out. There are no other modes, options, nor offline or online rankings. For all players who were leftyou are partially disappointed by the lack of new characters in the new Punch Out! for Wii, this is a good opportunity to have an excellent substitute (at a negligible price) that brings the same gameplay, a character growth system and 10 new enemies to defeat.", "date": "2010-04-30", "grade": "8.2"}
