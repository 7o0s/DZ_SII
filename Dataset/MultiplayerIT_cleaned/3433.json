Obviously we refer you to the full-bodied review released at the time to deepen every aspect of the game in every single part. Here the goal will be to analyze this version for Nintendo Switch, the hybrid of the Kyoto house. Since the surprise announcement a few months ago, we immediately wondered how much this port was really achievable, given the technical scope of the title and the possibilities of the console. After spending a good fifteen hours getting an idea, going from the sunny White Orchard to the life of Novigrad, we are ready to give you our opinion. The conclusion of a story One of the great ideas of the third chapter of The Witcher was the ability of CDProjekt to give a context and a continuation of Geralt's story, without forgetting the new players. The interplanetary success of the series, paradoxically, arrived during the years of development of this third chapter and the Polish developer has well decided to insert two literary characters as yet unpublished for videogame transposition as cornerstones of the narrative. In fact, the whole main quest unfolds around Ciri and the threat dictated by the Wild Hunt. The main narrative, which requires a good thirty hours to complete, at the same time represents only the tip of the iceberg and takes the form of a pretext to explore the huge game world. Alongside the witcher's primary journey in search of Ciri - his apprentice and towards whom he feels strongly bound and responsible - the game includes an almost boundless series of secondary quests, contracts to complete and treasure searches. The hunts represent a whole series of tasks through which to go in search of creatures that infest the boundless lands of the title, study their constitution and weaknesses and silence them. Treasure searches, as the name suggests, are a set of small tasks that lead to exploration and the collection of loot. However, it is with the secondary quests that the game system explodes and completes itself, setting up an almost infinite series of sub-plots and in-depth analysis of the game world that made the title and its development team great. Narrative research, the desire to tell stories and the psychological background of each inhabitant with whom you will be able to interact, are the elements that still today push The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt towards an excellence that is almost difficult to understand at first glance, because overwhelming and suggestive. In the specific case of this reissue for Nintendo Switch, we are faced with a package that also includes the two major paid expansions released later: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. These two additional contents are still remembered today, without risk of denial, as the most substantial and ~honest~ DLC that today's videogame market has given us. We are talking about an additional fifty hours for an already boundless game of its own, which in addition have brought a whole series of improvements to the interface and equipment, now considered the standard of the experience of The Witcher 3. While the first expansion turns out to be slightly less complex in structure, also recycling a large part of the environments and standing out more for the main narrative than for the ancillary activities; Blood and Wine is considered as a game in its own right. Set in a hitherto unheard-of region: the duchy of Toussaint, you will find yourself living in an almost fairytale-like portion of the world, with a whole series of narrative shrewdness and the tasks that will follow. What unfortunately is totally incomprehensible and on which it is difficult to postpone, it is the full price at which this package is still sold on Nintendo Switch. Net of a disproportionate amount of content, we are still talking about a title with four years on its shoulders and which, above all, in the Complete version for other platforms is offered at a lower figure. This is without taking into account the frequent promotions. Let's say that a more aggressive pricing policy would have been an important stimulus. The Switch version We come to the fulcrum of the judgment: the rendering of this porting on Switch. The guys from Saber Interactive spent an entire year working on this reissue, trying not to change its essence and perception of the pad in hand, but clearly having to compromise with a computing power that is profoundly different from the reference one. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a title that can still be considered at the top of the achievable technical value, especially considering the amount of elements and the size of the game world. Just thinking about the fact that Nintendo's hybrid can handle a game of this magnitude represents, as far as we are concerned, a production value that should not be underestimated. From a purely numerical point of view, this version always runs at a resolution around 540p for use in portable mode, which turns into a dynamic resolution up to 720p when playing by connecting the console to any external monitor. Before this statement leads you to hit the road with pitchforks, there is an important consideration to make. If it is true that we consider it almost a sacrilege to choose to buy this version to play it sitting on the sofa and looking at a sixty-inch, it is equally right to think of using it almost entirely in its portable version. Thanks to the excellent and sufficiently minute console screen, The Witcher 3 is playable and enjoyable, without perceiving that it has deprived the experience of a good part of its effectiveness. What is more annoying to tell the truth, is that these technical compromises that have led to reducing the horizon, adding a somewhat annoying motion blur effect and bringing any texture and model of the game back to very low details, have not resulted however sufficient to solve a serious problem of fluidity that is perceived on many occasions. The game almost constantly runs below thirty frames per second, managing to drop drastically on some occasions. This result is mainly revealed when we are in docked mode and, thanks to the aesthetic paucity, it is really difficult to find a justification for using it in this world. On the contrary, the portable version always remains pleasantly playable, generating that genuine satisfaction that few other times we have happened to perceive when testing a port for Nintendo Switch. We must admit that we would not have expected to want to complete the game again , taking advantage of those few hours of free time available, solely and exclusively because they are able to play The Witcher 3 at night, lying in their own bed, without the need to equip ourselves with our splendid but now not very functional PC version. We are not able to say if Saber Interactive could have gone even further, the fact remains that the compromises reached probably represent the maximum of what was possible to eliminate from an all too expensive basic version. The real miracle lies in the fact that this edition exists, and as such we believe it is right to reward its effort, while condemning a totally off-scale market price.", "date": "2019-10-14", "grade": "8.0"}
