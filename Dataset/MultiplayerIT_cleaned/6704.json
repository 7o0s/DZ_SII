In fact, who would have ever expected that a ~so~ Japanese title, exclusive for PlayStation 3, moreover from 2008, would arrive on PC? Instead it was also quite successful, according to how long the game remained in the Steam top 10 after launch. Valkyria Chronicles is a strategy with large narrative sections, divided into eighteen chapters, some of them double, which tells the war between the Empire and the Federation in an alternative 1930 of an alternative Europe. The player leads Welkin Gunther and his team. Welkin ended up on the battlefield despite himself in an attempt to repel the troops of the Empire who want to invade the neutral nation of Gallia, located between the two superpowers in conflict, to steal energy resources and to gain an advantage over the Federation. Valkyria Chronicles tells its story in a style somewhere between a cartoon and a visual novel. The various narrative sequences are divided into chapters of a thick book that makes up the entire game and which gradually reveals its subplots, which include the past of the main characters, some events on the sidelines of the conflict and the nature of the empire's secret weapon , the ~Valkyrie~, the last member of an ancient race believed to be extinct. There is no shortage of twists and turns and desperate reversals, in a story that becomes more and more compelling as the missions progress, despite being deeply rooted in the clichs of Japanese fiction. To help in the immersion there is also the peculiar graphic style drawn, in which characters and scenarios seem colored with pastel pencils. Sure, it's easy to see that the three-dimensional models of the characters and scenarios come from a different era than the more recent triple-A productions, but such a marked style allows you to overlook the technical obsolescence while enjoying the many beauties that Valkyria Chronicles has to offer . In addition to the narrative sections, Valkyria Chronicles is made up of at least two other macro sections: that of team management, which allows you to level up the different classes, to research upgrades for soldiers and armored vehicles and to replace the dead companions on the field of battle; and that of real combat, which requires you to manage the team on the field by spending action points to move characters or armored vehicles against the imperial troops. There is no shortage of extra content, such as all those added by the various DLCs, fortunately included in the price. Strategy or puzzle game? Unfortunately Valkyria Chronicles is not only style and story, but also strategy. Now, it will sound paradoxical to know, especially if you love strategy games, that the game system rewards speed above any other action. At the end of each mission you are awarded a rank which determines how many experience points and resources for weapons you have earned while fighting. Unfortunately, the main criterion for evaluating the battle is the speed used to conclude the mission, i.e. the number of turns spent overall. This translates into being pushed to make a series of evaluations that have little to do with strategy, and a lot with puzzle games, i.e. starting to observe the layout of the battlefield and the positioning of the enemies, not so much to understand how to use your troops and move them effectively, how to find out which shortcut has been designed (because there is always some shortcut) to allow a quick resolution even of missions that on paper are long and difficult. The use of individual soldiers is often enhanced, thanks to a bonus system (orders) which allows you to spend the command points available at each turn to dramatically boost some characteristics. At the expense are team play and, in more than one sense, the gameplay itself, impoverished by the awareness of essentially having to find the ~right moves~ to win and get more rewards. Of course, as the missions progress, it becomes more complicated to understand how to proceed and perhaps we first tend to use a more traditional approach to study the situation, but always with the awareness of not playing as really required, despite trying to put the tactic first to everything else. Perhaps, since we are talking about a strategic one, it would have been appropriate to expand the evaluation criteria of the battles, avoiding favoring absurd maneuvers and showing the great limits of artificial intelligence at practically every turn. For example, playing the game quickly reveals that the CPU can be ~asleep~ in attack phases if you hide well at the end of the phase. Opyet it turns out that on many occasions you can avoid an opponent's counterattack during your turn by shooting at him from a point where his line of fire is occupied by some object, wall or ditch. Valkyria Chronicles on PC brings with it all the strengths and weaknesses of the original for PlayStation 3 Note that we are not claiming that Valkyria Chronicles is a bad game. Indeed, far from it. It is simply not a strategic one in the strict sense, a problem that stands out above all in the PC version, a platform accustomed by the genre to titles of a very different caliber. Let's say it better: if you play it as a strategic one, thus trying to exploit your team and develop personal tactics, you will inevitably be penalized. What matters here is to understand and get as close as possible to the ~right tactic~ thought by the developers. There's obviously some range, but it's a de facto underdog and often proves to be a waste of command points. The same artificial intelligence of the enemies does not seem to be set with real strategic criteria, but more following the logic of the sequence of events. That is to say, enemies often attack our soldiers head-on without developing any strategy, but remaining motionless, as already mentioned, if they have been shot and then put themselves behind some cover. Other times they only move when we've gotten too close, without ever trying to surround us in collaboration with their cronies or with heavy vehicles. Too often it happens that they start shooting at the obstacles that cover their line of fire, demonstrating total idiocy. It's a bit strange to see a soldier position himself around the corner of a building and waste bullets with the wall, or it's funny to see them remain almost motionless despite being attacked by a tank. Unfortunately such events are frequent and break the atmosphere a lot, much more than a few too many jaggies in the graphics or some sporadic bug. This does not mislead you, because Valkyria Chronicles is not an easy title: many missions will have to be faced several times to be overcome, given that if you do not know the position of the enemies it is easy to be ambushed. Too bad that often the errors are not due to us, but to surprise events that happen in spite of us and that we could not predict in any way, especially when busy running to finish a mission in as few turns as possible.", "date": "2014-12-04", "grade": "7.5"}
