Over the last month, as promised, Blizzard's card game has been enriched with three additional chapters, which thus complete the list of four total episodes with which the Year of the Dragon ends. An undoubtedly interesting year for Hearthstone, which managed to shake off the torpor of 2018 also thanks to Team 5's decision to give narrative continuity to the outgoing expansions, until the arrival of the adventure The Awakening of Galakrond which concludes thus the mini-story set up by the developers. In addition to taking us inside the final battle between Rafaam, Reno and company, the adventure we are dealing with today is also important because it has returned to provide new cards with which to populate the meta, something that has not happened for this type of content in some time in Hearthstone. The Awakening of Galakrond The story that began with The Rise of Shadows and then continued with Saviors of Uldum and The Descent of the Dragons therefore finds its fulfillment in the four acts that make up Galakrond's Awakening. In turn, the episodes of the adventure are divided into two parts: the first linked to the implementation of the plan of Rafaam and his Legion of M.A.L.E. and the second dedicated instead to the exploits of the League of Explorers to try to stop the awakening of the powerful proto-dragon. The two parts are proposed in the form of two different books, within which each episode brings with it three battles that can be faced both in the basic mode of The Awakening of Galakrond and in heroic mode. Compared to what happened with the old Hearthstone adventures, however, the heroic mode does not offer additional cards, which can therefore be obtained simply by completing the challenges that make up the main story. As for the story, we must appreciate the effort made by Blizzard to propose something different within Hearthstone, even if obviously the proposed plot is quite linear and devoid of particular twists or memorable moments in general. However, there are some moments in which you smile thanks to the jokes of Reno and the other protagonists engaged in the fight that goes from the Costa Gelida to Dalaran, proposing some particular mechanics in its course to add some salt to the adventure. While the variety of dynamics between the various clashes works quite well, in its component dedicated to the single player Galakrond's Awakening unfortunately offers a difficulty that is a little too leveled downwards, where we would have liked to experience some more challenging battles to bring home the loaf. The heroic mode obviously tries to respond to this need, but by not offering cards as a reward its attractiveness remains rather weak. New cards, new meta? At this point, let's move on to analyzing the part of Galakrond's Awakening that will accompany us for the next few months, namely the new cards. Once the whole adventure has been completed, your collection will be enriched with thirty-five new entries, of which four are of the legendary type. The most famous of these is the one that was talked about for a long time before the release of the adventure, namely The Incredible Reno. The ten mana card dedicated to the magician literally makes all the minions in play disappear, not activating none of their possible effects from destruction nor allowing their resurrection later. In addition to this, the new version of Reno replaces the hero power with the casting of a random spell at the beginning of one's turn, thus bringing a small piece of Yogg-Saron into each phase of the game. The highlander mage will obviously benefit from this card, but the other cards in Galakrond's Awakening are also finding their way into the meta. In particular, aggro decks at the moment are particularly coveted by Frenetic Felwing, a four-mana 3/3 demon that costs one less for each damage suffered by the opponent during the turn. The Winged Guardian, on the other hand, allows the druid to rely on a seven-mana 6/8 card with taunt and rebirth, untargetable by spells or hero power. The Rotten Nest Drake is another card that will probably delight many hunter decks, especially the more aggressive ones: provided you have another dragon in your hand, the card in fact destroys a random enemy minion, also bringing a dragon into the field 6 /5 which goes hand in hand with the Storm Hammer that arrived with the latest expansion. However, there are several cards with excellent potential not yet in your handstto explored, such as Colpobot and Aerial Incursion which offer a couple of important additions to the pure paladin, or the Grand Lackey Erkh, one of the legendary cards proposed by the adventure which allows you to obtain a lackey every time you play another one. Do I buy or don't I buy? Before moving on to the conclusions, it is at this point necessary to ask ourselves whether or not it is worth buying The Awakening of Galakrond. Reasoning in purely economic terms, Blizzard has put the entire package on sale at a price of 19.99 euros, or 6.99 euros for those who want to buy single episodes. What has already been said on the occasion of the first chapter is valid: considering the permanence of card rotation, if you are a regular Hearthstone player and want to always be up to date, the purchase is to be considered almost obligatory. An idea for those who don't want to invest any more money and are in no hurry could be to collect the necessary gold, considering that each chapter can be bought for 700 units. In case you are not in a hurry, in view of the April rotation, you could in fact think of collecting the internal currency of the game to progressively take home the various areas of The Awakening of Galakrond, and then possibly integrate the purchase with the arrival of the new Hearthstone year.", "date": "2020-02-18", "grade": "6.8"}
