{"name": "Un passo avanti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71080-zenonia-un-passo-avanti.html", "text": "One of the limits of the still astonishing iPhone gaming platform is certainly that relating to a certain lack of complexity of many titles, perhaps profound because they are based on solid foundations and winning ideas, but lacking a large number of mechanics and an articulated story, of something that can elevate them from the simple playful aspect to express all the potential of a media made up of several elements such as video games. Zenonia, developed by the Korean Gameevil, tries to fill this gap by proposing an action role-playing gameplay quite close to what in the times of 16-bit gradually made its way into the hearts of users - however expanded and updated to requests of current designs - making the player take on the role of Regret, a young man in search of his missing father, discovering a difficult world full of dangers, upset by the internal war between two factions. So much in a small space An adventure, therefore, with all the elements of the genre positioned at the right point in order to compose a truly impressive picture in the best possible way, thinking of it from the perspective of the Apple platform: to complete all the main missions and venture a minimum into the secondary ones, you easily spend dozens of hours, necessary to develop a plot with a good atmosphere and appreciate the nice rhythm imposed, with the growth of the character made more profound both by the skills that can be acquired, active or passive, as well as by the vast amount of objects that can be looted from the bodies of defeated enemies or recoverable through the treasures scattered around the game world as well as from merchants. The system of objectives and rewards therefore works well, creating the right progression thanks to many small rewards and making use of the further implementation of a character development system of the user's alter ego, who can move to become good or bad by influencing some elements of the plot and relationships with non-player characters. Zenonia therefore does not invent anything but takes much of the good done by others and adapts it properly, dispensing an enviable depth also made up of many small gems, such as the need to eat or to repair weapons, which unfortunately is lost, albeit slightly, in the request in some sections to level Regret outside of normal missions, starting to kill some extra enemies in order to be able to assign the experience points necessary to continue without too much difficulty. Graphically, the work is excellent, perhaps with a non-original style but certainly of quality and with really many different enemies, objects, environments and characters on the screen, even being able to create a certain atmosphere thanks to the well-crafted soundtrack. The controls are a little less good which, although based on a decent interface, also equipped with a skill bar like the best hack and slash, take advantage of a four-way virtual directional cross, improved over time through updates but still imperfect; not exactly what is called a masterpiece of modernity, especially for the feeling of being on rails.
