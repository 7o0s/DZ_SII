{"name": "Myst - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/myst-recensione.html", "text": "Have you ever had the impression of being literally kidnapped by a book? Well, that's exactly what happens to the protagonist of Myst, a mysterious ~foreigner~ who, after reading a few lines of the volume in question, finds himself catapulted onto an apparently deserted island. A place that corresponds in all respects to the one described in the pages you have just browsed. The character will have to explore all the locations of this strange and particular place, finding the traces that someone has left him to go home. Born on the Macintosh in the early 1990s, Myst made an important contribution to the graphic adventure genre. In fact, it is difficult to label this product: it is certainly an adventure, which however is punctuated by the continuous succession of more or less complex puzzles. The concept of ~victory~ or ~defeat~ is relative, more than anything else the developers wanted to immerse the player in a very special atmosphere. In its structure, Myst is profoundly different from video games as we know them: we can explore the scenario through a first person view, but we can't exactly ~move~. To move we will have to touch the touch screen in the desired direction, then the game will load a new image. Each of the images may correspond to interactable areas (doors, switches, objects to collect, characters to talk to), and each of them is part of more or less elaborate puzzles, which must be solved to unlock new areas and continue the adventure. Touch by hand Reviving the original Myst to make a DS version, fifteen years after the birth of the game, is an operation to say the least bizarre. Moreover, we are faced with a very faithful conversion, which in no way attempts to remedy the limitations of an interface that was not ~old~ already in 1993, but almost. Unfortunately these knots come to a head right away: the developers have combined the Nintendo laptop with the PC due to the presence of the touch screen, which makes possible an interaction similar to that which can be obtained with the mouse. In its original version, however, Myst had an on-screen pointer that changed shape when it was over a sensitive area. All of this has been removed on the DS, so you really have to guess and ~plug~ the screen everywhere, or perhaps lose the switch for a device. An interaction of this type can be interesting for those who already know this product and perhaps want to replay it years after the first time, but for novices it is a really unfortunate choice, which only makes a structure that already in itself it is very inflexible. The game structure, which proceeds ~in images~, is very little immediate and intuitive: you have to make taps in the direction in which you want to move, after which a new image is loaded that portrays the landscape from the point where we moved. It's just that you need to do a little practice to orient yourself and actually understand in which direction you've moved and which way you're looking. Technical realization In addition to the shortcomings of the control system, which can be mitigated with a little application if desired (indeed, it is more likely to succeed if you already know the game, otherwise the matter becomes more complicated), Myst on Nintendo DS also loses one of its points of historical force, i.e. the impact of images. If at the time being faced with evocative three-dimensional landscapes, in high resolution, could fascinate the player and get him into the right spirit to explore the island, the same result cannot be obtained on the portable console with the double screen, either due to the limits technicians of its display, both for the fact that today it takes much more than a series of images to surprise. As mentioned, in the original version the game could have a pointer that changed shape according to the sensitive area it was on, something that the developers chose not to insert on DS: to interact with the scenario, you have to go to attempts, trying to touch the screen with the stylus where we believe there is a switch or in any case an interactable element. Unfortunately, the technical realization of this conversion is also flawed in terms of sound: the effects are discreet, but the voices really have a very low quality and all this really does not help to proceed with the adventure or to create the necessary atmosphere for feel involved. The good thing is that the uploads are lightning fast, and an extra episode has also been added to try to further increase the longevity of a title which, if appreciated, already guarantees a certain duration in itself. Comment interpreterBorn as a tribute to one of the best-selling PC titles ever, this version of Myst for Nintendo DS has its own reason: nostalgics of the original will be able to try their hand again with the puzzles of the island, experimenting with the touch screen control system , with the ability to immerse yourself in the adventure at any place or time. Unfortunately, apart from this consideration, there are no other positive elements at stake: the game structure is fifteen years old and it shows them all, technically the results achieved are mediocre from every point of view and one really has to wonder which owner of Nintendo DS could never appreciate a first experience with Myst lived in this way, marred as it is by a large number of limitations. If you want to try your hand at this game, better try it directly on PC. Pros: Faithful conversion An extra episode as a bonus A good opportunity for those who already know Myst... Cons: ...but not for those who don't know it Technically very limited Outdated game structure Myst is available for Nintendo DS, PC and PSP. The tested version is the one for Nintendo DS.", "date": "2008-01-21", "grade": null}
