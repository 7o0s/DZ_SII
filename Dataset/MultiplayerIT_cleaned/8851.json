Well, after much talk, Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary is finally available for download on the App Store and Android Market, just in time to celebrate its birthday and demonstrate first of all that it hasn't aged too much and secondly that it knows how to not easy rules of ~serious~ gaming on portable devices. With a ten As it was reasonable to expect from a perfectionist software house such as Rockstar, Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary offers the exact same gaming experience as the original released in 2001 on PlayStation 2. They therefore once again take on the role of the silent hero Claude Speed, intent on retaliating with his girlfriend Catalina who treacherously shot him after a bank robbery. Although the evolution of the series has accustomed us to better structured characters and plots, the return to Liberty City is still made enjoyable by a script that never fails to make you smile, with the added value of the nostalgia effect for anyone who has played the title in a previous version. Even from a strictly playful point of view, all the contents have been transferred to the 462 MB of the application, without sacrificing absolutely anything: characters, cars, weapons, main and secondary missions, extra activities and in general every single piece that contributed to the The incredible success of Grand Theft Auto III is faithfully reproduced here, creating what is undoubtedly one of the most gameplay-packed titles that the App Store and Android Market have to offer. Such respect for the original product could have led to some conflict with today's mobile gaming standards regarding the speed of access to the game, but Rockstar has been very careful: although it is always required to reach one of the shelters highlighted on the map to save the data in all respects, if you interrupt the application - or even if you close it completely - the action will still resume from the point where you left off, allowing you to use the product even for quick games. Even those that taken individually would be dated elements are transformed into strengths from the point of view of platforms such as the iPhone and iPad: therefore, the overall reduced size of Liberty City and its linear plan are better suited to its intended use does on iOS and make it easy to navigate despite the smallness of the on-screen map, especially on the iPhone. The same can be said of the relatively low crowding of the streets, the automatic pointing system, the more than affordable level of difficulty and so on: many aspects that are objectively outdated but which make a good game for the enjoyment of the product on the hardware in question. Matter of touch And therefore we come to deal with the real cornerstone of Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary, or rather that control system which in the context of touch devices can actually decree the propensity or otherwise of a user to purchase. Without fear of denials, we can say that Rockstar has adopted the best possible solution, capable of making the title usable with relative tranquility even if obviously with a feeling that cannot even remotely rival that given by a classic joypad. The left side of the screen houses a virtual analog stick when Claude is on foot, while in a vehicle you end up with two simple buttons to steer; on the right there are virtual keys that perform all the necessary functions, occupying a significant portion of the screen but without causing particular discomfort. The virtual camera does its best to always follow the action from the most suitable angle, but if a correction is needed, simply touch the center of the display and move your finger in the desired direction: comfort when stationary is guaranteed, but running the operation in motion effectively prevents you from doing anything else, proving to be a big handicap if -for example- you want to look over your shoulder during a car chase. In any case, thanks also to clever tricks such as the swipe to change weapon or radio station, Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary is appreciated on Apple devices, albeit with different pros and consyes: on the iPhone the smaller dimensions allow you to play with your thumbs but some elements on the screen appear really microscopic, which does not happen on the iPad, however compensated by the need to place the device on a surface and to use more than one finger per hand in order to handle the situation properly. With regard to the technical realization, from a graphic point of view we are faced with a perfect HD conversion of the original: if therefore the ten years of the title can all be seen for what concerns the polygonal complexity of characters and settings, on the other hand the game is made visually more than pleasing by a smooth frame rate and excellent image cleaning. On the other hand, nothing to say about the sound sector, impeccable today as then both for the English dubbing and for the quality and variety of the radio broadcasts.
