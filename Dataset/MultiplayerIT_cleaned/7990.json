Over time, Ubisoft's support has not decreased and, indeed, has even increased. It couldn't be otherwise since we're talking about the first DLC of the game's fourth season pass, which follows three seasons that are very rich and varied in content. This should make it clear not only to the public, but also to the developers, how much launching a similar title in a satisfactory state for the most passionate players can only do them good in an expansive perspective, as we will see in the review of Anno 1800: Semi del change, in which we will analyze the new additions. Seeds of change Seeds of Change is all about farming Seeds of Change is essentially a new agricultural system, based on the so-called modular hacienda. Basically, the possibility of building a real agricultural estate has been added, which can be customized in different ways, both in the crops and in the products obtainable, as well as in the aesthetics, and which allows you to use new techniques to improve the production, such as fertilizers. In terms of the game it is a structure made up of various elements ranging from houses to real agricultural buildings (silos, fences and so on). If your dream has always been to found a farm with a South American aesthetic, this is definitely the content for you. It should be noted that together with the modular hacienda, some aspects of the Anno 1800 gameplay have been revised, which complete the package, harmonizing it within the base game. For example, it is possible to issue specific edicts that affect the productivity of buildings or it is possible to produce drinks that end up on sale in the various clubs of our city. In terms of hours played, it is difficult to quantify Seeds of Change, in the sense that it is content that is perfectly integrated into the base game, which however is not modified in its fundamental aspects. So don't expect who knows what revolution and take it all as a nice addition, fortunately well harmonized with the other game systems. Silver Seasons Silver Seasons: Will we be able to revive this colony? The new scenario is more substantial: Silver Seasons, in which the player is called to take on the role of a Vasco Olivera who has fallen into disgrace, to carry out an apparently somewhat crazy and punitive mission: to install a silver mint in a remote and inaccessible region. This is a fairly challenging scenario, which requires dealing with changing and unpredictable climatic conditions, as well as very strict deadlines, which greatly reduce the margin of error. Let's say it's one of those scenarios where you have to make as few mistakes as possible if you want to win, despite the deeply adverse conditions. Arriving at the site of our mission, we found a city practically in ruins, with very few active buildings and a very high level of abandonment. How to attract new workers to work in the silver mine that we have to build? How to master the production of the precious mineral in such an inhospitable place? Answering these questions in practice will require having mastered the base game and discovering how even what appears to be an arid and hopeless expanse can contain great riches. In practical terms Silver Seasons takes up a few hours, depending on your practice with the game. As already mentioned, it's a fairly challenging and peculiar scenario, but nothing indomitable. It is certainly a good pastime for those who have already played the basic title and know the sandbox mode like the back of their hand.", "date": "2022-04-12", "grade": null}
