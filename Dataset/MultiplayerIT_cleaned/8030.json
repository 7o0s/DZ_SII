{"name": "Una rivoluzione?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114114-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-revolution-una-rivoluzione.html", "text": "The first add-on pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Revolution, marks a first for the franchise with the addition of a new weapon. It will certainly not be the revolution that many users are hoping for, but in addition to the single gun, the American boys have been able to insert a good number of new elements to continue playing. Next to the Peacekeeper (this is the name of the cross between an SMG and an assault rifle) we find four maps for multiplayer, one, very intricate, for Zombies, and a new game mode in which users will take on the role of survivors to wear the sagging bones of the undead. A package therefore undoubtedly interesting and well packaged. The maps The map that most pleasantly surprised us is Grind. The setting is very particular. We are inside a skate park, consequently the surface (not very large) is full of ramps, curved surfaces, and elevations to get to the top of the ~launch points~. Ideally divided into two parts, an indoor structure that houses small training ramps and the actual park that has nothing to envy to those seen in Tony Hawk, Grind has two very interesting peculiarities on its side. The curved walls require us to use the roofs significantly different from the usual one. In this sense it is impossible to creep stealthily without almost always exposing a good part of the body. In the same way, the level design requires us to use grenades not only by throwing them in a straight line towards the opponents or trying to saturate the area, but also by gently sliding them on the ramps. Obviously we are not talking about something that changes a granite gameplay, but it is pleasant to see how a well thought out level design can make us review consolidated habits. What is certain is that when all the players are in the central external area, the abundance of cover creates frenetic clashes almost like a close quarter. From the waterfront park in Venice we drive into the Gobi desert for Mirage. This map is probably the best of the lot. First of all it is the largest: the hotel complex devastated by the sandstorm makes us fight both in a gigantic room overlooked by balconies and real dunes and in the external areas between various huts and buildings. The level design is really well thought out here too. The sand accumulated in the open allows us to climb onto the roofs and therefore, more than on the ground, it gives us rather free lines of fire, giving way to sniping actions from a distance, while in the hotel hall the various access points and above all the raised areas guarantee multiple streets and secluded areas, expanding the different game approaches, which makes the objective game modes very fun and ~complicated~. Note then both inside and outside the aim is made unstable by the depressions of the sand, hitting the targets in the race is more difficult. A map therefore that reconciles the different souls of the game and which, thanks to its generous dimensions, lends itself mainly to matches with the maximum number of players on the field. We remain in Asia with Hydro, but from China we move to Pakistan. The map is set in a dam and has as its most important feature, as we had already seen in Express, an area that does not remain fixed but changes, directly impacting the gameplay. If in Express it was a train hurtling through the station, here it is the water from the dam which, once released, floods the central area of the map, killing all those who were not quick to move to the previous or underlying areas. Decidedly symmetrical in its design, Hydro is the most ~anonymous~ of all the contents released in Revolution, which will most likely be the least played in the package. It's not that it doesn't work, but the impression is that, despite a rather intricate design, between closed areas, secluded passages and lines of fire broken by numerous obstacles, with or without flooding, it is the least fascinating map, the most ~normal ~ of the lot. Europe, or rather the French Alps, are the protagonists of Downhill, a snowy map that brings to mind the icy atmosphere of Summit from the first Black Ops. Here too we have to take into consideration an ~interactive~ part of the battlefield. That is, a cableway that shuttles between two stations and which, in addition to offering a mobile shelter, instantly kills the unfortunate person who has not noticed that he is in his path. In addition to the indoor areas that offer the usual gameplay made up of frenetic shootings between corridors and blind corners, the outdoor part is the most interesting part of the map, uphill and with rather clean and long shooting lines. Here too we find a good number of secondary routesie and defilaments, for a map that is undoubtedly less anonymous than Hydro but which does not have that extra something like Grind and Mirage. Well done, but definitely not the high point of the lot. All the rest Regarding the Peacekeeper we can say that it did not give us the impression of being an unbalanced weapon, given its being halfway between an SMG and an assault rifle. From the large volume of fire and the recoil that is felt, Peacekeeper is also quite accurate from distance, a practically perfect weapon in maps where different types of approaches to firefights are combined. Fortunately, without ever resulting in being overpowered, both in close quarters and in fights where great aiming precision is required. In short, a medium weapon. If the new competitive multiplayer content offers the usual, excellent package, but without significant additions, Zombie instead makes the DLC leap in quality. The Die Rise map is the exact opposite of what has been played so far: characterized by a marked verticality and an intricate and convoluted level design, more generally it requires a lot of attention (and good memory) from the player. Instead of pigs in a flat environment, Die Rise puts us on top of a building that is falling apart, our task is to get to the ground, using both the elevator and the precarious flights of stairs, jumping from one structure to another. other, and being careful not to fall on deaf ears since in the first few bars we won't know if, turning a corner, we will find a corridor or a nice unexpected abyss. It goes without saying that there is no single way to get to the end and never as in this case, given the narrow spaces and the labyrinthine level design, teamwork is the only way to survive. Anyone who stays behind, maybe one floor up is zombie fodder. We liked Die Rise, but the new Turned mode impressed us even more. The concept is as simple as abused we could say. We all start as zombies, the first to find the cure becomes human and will have to survive as long as possible. All it takes is one of the zombies to touch him to turn him into rotting flesh while he in turn comes back alive and well. To complicate matters, Treyarch has made zombies faster than the living, but the latter gain a more powerful weapon with each kill, albeit a very slow reload. At the end of the round, the winner is the one who has been human the most times and scored the most kills. A very fast, frantic and fun mode, with a rhythm in some ways similar to the most agitated phases of Zombie's ~competitive~ mode, balanced in finding what seems to be the right middle ground between the pros and cons of the two factions. The only thing that puzzled us is that it can only be played on one map. Sin. Revolution or not, Treyarch has been able to create a first DLC that is undoubtedly interesting, capable of meeting all types of players. The pack is well worth the purchase by anyone who plays Call of Duty: Black Ops II on a daily basis. The quality is well spread both in the competitive multiplayer maps and in the exciting Zombie additions, obviously without forgetting the introduction, almost a sop, however, of the new SMG Peacekeeper.", "date": "2013-01-30", "grade": null}
