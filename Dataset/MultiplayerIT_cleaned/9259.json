{"name": "La guerra dei fan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87340-hyperdimension-neptunia-la-guerra-dei-fan.html", "text": "The console war has always been one of the most widespread side effects in the universe of video games, at least since the first gaming and non-gaming platforms, competitors, including personal computers, were born. It will be due to the very strange natural human concept of ~what is mine is better than yours~, it will be due to the fixation of some to be the custodians of the absolute truth (in the videogame sense, in our case), but users have always been divided between those who enjoy one specific console or series of video games over another. And there is no forum in the world where they don't engage in authentic virtual battles in defense or against this or that. Compa and the irrepressible Purple Heart Precisely starting from this argument, Nippon Ichi, NIS, Compile Heart and Idea Factory have imagined, for their new role-playing game entitled Hyperdimension Neptunia, a strange universe whose consoles ideally represent four deities viscerally venerated by as many groups of faithful who fight and they fight among themselves to impose their ideas on each other. The names of the regions of the Gameindustri world, i.e. the one where the facts narrated in the product take place, are a whole program: Lastation (PlayStation), Leanbox (Xbox), Lowee (Wii) and Planeptune (Neptune, which someone identifies in our opinion correctly as the SEGA console preceding the Dreamcast, i.e. the one that the Japanese company intended to combine the MegaDrive and Sega Mega Drive 32X in a single chassis. name Neptune). Ditto the divine beings, which as we will see in the appropriate paragraph dedicated to graphics have different looks both according to the form they take (human or divine) and the console they represent. Old fashioned RPG Returning to the plot, one fine morning, a young student at a nursing school named Compa sees an object fall from the sky. Reached the place of impact he finds the funny Neptune (the deity known as Purple Heart, here in human form), devoid of memory, coming from the realm of the CPU (Console Control Unit), Celestia. Together, after some vicissitudes, they decide to travel to find out what lies behind the increasingly frequent attacks brought by monstrous beings in the world. The combos are performed by pressing in sequence, even sparsely, the four buttons of the pad Hyperdimension Neptunia is the classic old-fashioned JRpg, apart from the interaction with worlds and NPCs that take place exclusively via menus from which to choose who to talk to, what to buy and which dungeon to access. Exploration of the latter forms the heart of the game. For the rest, expect long dialogues managed through specific more or less static screens, with the avatars of the anime-style characters and random and turn-based fights. The latter are quite frequent and sometimes, therefore, can be annoying to most. However, later in the game, thanks to the particular power of one of the protagonists, it becomes possible to reduce the rhythm of her appearance a little (the duration at that point of pause between one battle and another is marked by a countdown). During the battle, which clearly takes place in alternating turns as per tradition, every gesture made by the party members consumes a certain number of AP, once they are exhausted the turn passes to the next character or opponent. The actions that a character can perform are multiple and correlated to the type of game: he can arrange himself in a defense position, attempt an escape or attack after input from the user through the appropriate choice menu, while for the healing ~moves~ or recovery of killed comrades, everything happens automatically based on a probability system previously determined by the player himself. In the case of offensive actions, the gamer can choose the type of attack to be carried out among those at a distance, in melee or with a weapon, also creating combos. The latter certainly constitute one of the most original elements of the game, given that it is the user himself who chooses the composition and even the special power with which to conclude the sequence. There is even the possibility of customizing its visual rendering and name. Playstation 3 trophies Hyperdimension Neptunia offers forty-six Trophies to unlock, including secret ones: they are mainly distributed in the main mode and are obtained simply with the progression of the game. For example by reaching certain locations or by synthesizing some objects, to get the easiest prizes. Or by completing the various scenarios, performing a certain number of combos, walking all over the map, just to name a few, for the Trofand the most prestigious. Go-go combos The combos are generally performed by pressing sequences of keys corresponding to the front buttons of the PlayStation 3 pad. Each of them corresponds to a particular action: there are four slots and these must be filled with powers of your choice to be chained together (attacks with weapon, bare hands, spells, skills, etc). The combinations are multiple and always modifiable at will, which allows you to experiment a lot. Interestingly, depending on how you decide to close the combo, you can then generate further effects mainly related to functions called respectively Combo Link, Switch and Transformation. The first allows you to join the combos of two different characters one after the other. Just insert in the last of the four slots available for execution, a command that combines it with the next one and that's it. Switch, on the other hand, allows the one who is executing the combo to leave the continuation of the attack to a second party member. Usually, in fact, the formation of three fighters that makes up the team managed by the user on the front line has three reserve elements (when they are recruited of course). So, calling it up, the other character will go into action starting with the key used for the change. If the Switch, to be clear, is made with the Square button, then he will start his attack from the Square. Finally with Transformation, an ability that only divinities can perform, we witness the evolution of certain heroines into an enhanced version of themselves, complete with a transformation sequence particularly similar to those of Sailor Moon or The Enchanting Creamy. Neptune and statistics Finally, it is possible to associate natural elements to one's attacks, increasing the damage inflicted on enemies in relation to their physical status. For example a ~warm~ monster will clearly be weak to the element of frost and vice versa. There are several other things to do in the game, some to tell the truth trivial, others more interesting such as the innovative and unusual management of the care of the characters always during battles, which takes place, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, in a completely automatic way. But that in reality is previously determined by percentages of possibilities attributed to the action by the player. Basically and in a very simplified way we say that from the character's menu a certain percentage must be attributed to the possibility that he will perform a given move in a particular circumstance. For example, we can tell the heroine that when her HP drops below 40% she should automatically heal herself using the ~so-and-so~ potion. To do this, a score is assigned to it, for example 45%: this percentage indicates the probability that the healing object or related magic will activate when, as mentioned, the activation conditions occur. The thing is less complex than it might seem and just play a little with patience to understand the mechanisms. Some moves have an End Bonus parameter which can, if placed at the end of the combo, give an additional benefit to the attack. Like an anime However, what is described at the end of the previous paragraph makes it clear how in reality the product is also able to offer users a certain amount of strategy, since at a certain point it becomes essential, during the battle, to think about what the enemy could do is facing, whose turn is next, etc. At the end of each battle, as usual, you are rewarded with experience points and other elements useful for enhancing the skills and parameters of the various characters. To meet the needs of various types of gamers, Hyperdimension Neptunia also offers three difficulty levels to choose from, so that each user can tackle it with the degree of challenge they prefer. The graphics of the game, in cel-shaded and three-dimensional for the exploratory phases, reflect the light-hearted and ironic style of the plot, with an engine that definitely points to the anime style also for the look of the characters. In particular, the heroines are semi-dressed and winking, but never vulgar, as can only be seen in Japanese manga. The same look that distinguishes them seems to reflect, ideally, that of the consoles they represent: the aggressive Japanese Black Heart (Noire) for PlayStation 2, the western blonde Green Heart (Vert) to represent Xbox, the sweet and sensual Neptune of SEGA, and even the most adolescent, in form, White Heart (Blanc) Nintendo, almost as if to visually indicate the goodness of a console which, however, seems to be aimed at a different type of audience from the others, more casual and young (it's not an offense, be clear). If the main characters are well done, yesthe same cannot be said for the rest. The scenarios, especially the dungeons, tend to be rather dull, first in detail and repetitive, to the point that in some cases it seems to revisit the same places that have already been explored. Ditto the monsters to face. The audio, on the other hand, presents an excellent dubbing in Japanese and another discreet one in English, for the main dialogues (many of them, especially the secondary ones, are only textual), while the soundtrack disappoints a lot, where music that defines anonymous and repetitive seems an understatement, they accompany both the dialogue skits and the exploration phases.", "date": "2011-05-27", "grade": "6.3"}
