Groove Planet by Animoca Brands fits into this groove, which adds to an already tested formula a simple rhythm game element, apparently trivial but which in the end proves to be the proverbial egg of Columbus: let's see what it is... Groove Planet should be taken as a pastime, but fulfills its role flawlessly Tap tap unz unz Like all clicker games, Groove Planet also asks the user to simply tap on the screen to earn virtual currency (in this specific case represented by notes), but compared to many belonging to this particular genre, at least here it is necessary to adopt a minimum ~technique~, since revenue increases if you tap while keeping time with the background song. Music is the real protagonist of the Animoca Brands title, as can be easily seen from the particular setting of the game: a small vinyl-shaped planet inhabited by weird characters whose only purpose in life is to indulge in the wildest groove. The user's task is therefore to collect notes by rhythmically tapping the screen, then investing what is collected in the construction and upgrading of buildings and structures that allow you to increase the earnings for each second spent with the application. In a short time Groove Planet becomes a real vicious circle, with revenues and visitors increasing as the planet is transformed into an open-air disco. The developers of Animoca Brands have had a good time providing their product with a whole series of rewards designed to stimulate the player to move forward: there are challenges to complete, slot machines that guarantee different varieties of bonuses and cards to draw that they can have positive or negative effects on the progress of the match. The means of support of the application are inserted in an intelligent and absolutely tolerable way in these mechanisms, mostly made up of advertising videos that it is possible to decide to watch to multiply the received boosts or cancel any malus. There is also a shop that allows you to buy packs of gems with real money to convert into notes or to spend to enjoy some temporary power-ups, but you never get to the dreaded bottlenecks since the title can be enjoyed quietly without spending a single penny. Also because it's not exactly a game in the true sense of the term, but rather a pastime with which to amuse yourself when you have a couple of free minutes on your hands: from this point of view, Groove Planet plays its role in a impeccable, because it combines the absolute simplicity of clicker game mechanics with a genuine passion for music. Although the detection of the rhythm with which the taps are performed is far from impeccable, touching the touch screen going in time with the background track is a decidedly enjoyable activity, amplified however by the excellent quality of the eight dance pieces offered by the product. The interesting thing, however, is that each song contained in the music library of your device can be used as a basis on which to accumulate notes, and a special menu even allows you to directly download new songs via iTunes, perhaps drawing on the list of the most popular among players by Groove Planet. Beyond the obvious flatness of a gameplay that inevitably runs out of arguments after a while, the only real flaw of the title is the bad translation into Italian, with expressions completely distorted by literal interpretations of English.", "date": "2015-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
