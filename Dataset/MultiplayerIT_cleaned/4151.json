{"name": "Warhammer: Vermintide II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-vermintide-ii-2-recensione-xbox-one.html", "text": "Warhammer: Vermintide II has finally landed on Xbox One after the excellent response on PC, where it passed the million copies sold without major problems. The reasons for this success are simple: the formula of the game, which in many ways incorporates the mechanics of blockbusters such as Left 4 Dead, is still very current and engaging, especially when you tackle the missions with friends. The guys at Fatshark therefore didn't need to revolutionize anything compared to the first chapter, limiting themselves to enriching the package with new, interesting facets (first of all the two specializations to be unlocked for each character), a good number of maps, a set of fascinating new enemies and four different tanks that can enter the battlefield in an absolutely random way, thanks to a procedural system that also determines the waves of the Skaven and which therefore makes each game different from the next. The plot of Vermintide 2 begins immediately after the events of the original episode, putting us at the command of the soldier Markus Kruber in a prologue designed to serve as a nice tutorial, but which clarifies narratively how the five heroes escaped from the prisons of the enemy forces to take refuge in the Helmgart fortress, new hub from which you can access missions, both in single player mode (with companions controlled by artificial intelligence) and in multiplayer mode. The latter requires an Xbox LIVE Gold subscription in order to work, but it is however the only price that you will eventually have to pay, because if you have Xbox Game Pass, the download of the game will be free: a truly successful move for an experience that has obviously need many online users in order to express its full potential. Gameplay and classes As mentioned at the beginning, Warhammer: Vermintide II does not revolutionize the gameplay to which fans of the first chapter were used to: by selecting one of the available missions (or relying on a random choice), you find yourself exploring a large scenario often full of enemies, with areas where you have to activate switches and defend the position from almost endless waves of Skaven and other types of opponents. Even this time there are situations in which you end up hostage to a predator and you have to wait to be helped by a companion, just as the management of potions and first aid kits has remained the same, which you can use on yourself or to heal our friends. The most relevant difference must therefore be identified in the class system available for each of the five heroes of Vermintide II: by obtaining enough experience, we will be able to unlock a new ~profession~ for our character and select it to obtain a different approach to combat. The dwarf Bardin Goreksson can thus become an Ironbreaker or a Slayer, for example, while Sienna Fuegonasus can transform herself into a Pyromancer or Out of Control, the stage at which her fire-related powers have taken over. In short, the authors have taken some liberties with respect to the Warhammer ~lore~, but this feature actually guarantees greater variety, effectively multiplying our options in terms of characters and pushing us to grind hours and hours to be able to experiment with all possible combinations. to be naturally combined with equipment, crafting and the renewed loot system, simpler and more immediate than in the past. Do you prefer a slow but powerful fighter or a fast and deadly one from a distance? Whatever your tastes, you will find the most suitable solution. Structure, scenarios and enemies Warhammer: Vermintide II includes thirteen scenarios, and the difference from the previous episode is evident right from the start. Fatshark has in fact managed to expand and enrich the settings, which, although using some invisible barriers and a ~watertight compartment~ style approach, offer a remarkable glance, especially when playing on an Ultra HD screen. Some landscapes are really suggestive and we are given a few moments to appreciate them with relative calm, before the inevitable horde of enemies causes the situation to become explosive. From this point of view, the aforementioned random wave generation system contributes significantly to the variety of the experience, keeping the tension always high since we will never know when we will be attacked more violently by hostile troops or by an unexpected boss. You therefore find yourself improvising, trying to make the best use of the characteristics of your character and supporting your companions, especially when they are in difficulty. About that, on the occasion of this second review we have chosen to rediscover the fiery Sienna: a truly fascinating character, who can play both the role of ~point~ and stay in the rear to target opponents with her flaming bullets. Precisely as regards the enemy troops, we will find very different units waiting for us than the usual Skaven, sometimes armored, which will not fail to give us a hard time, putting our mastery of evasive maneuvers under scrutiny. To these will be added huge and very resistant bosses such as the Bile Troll, which not only inflicts important damage with its blows but can also vomit poisonous bile; or the Abomination of Chaos, a shapeless mass that with its fangs and tentacles can prove absolutely deadly. Xbox One goals Warhammer: Vermintide II includes fifty Achievements to unlock. The most traditional achievements are those related to the completion of the prologue and of the individual missions of the game at various levels of difficulty, but there are also more complex actions, for example the achievement of a certain degree of experience with the characters, obtaining exotic weapons , the extensive use of crafting and so on. The Xbox One version As expected, Warhammer: Vermintide II had to make a substantial sacrifice in terms of performance in the transition from PC and Xbox One, opting for 30 frames per second instead of the sixty obtainable in the Windows environment with the appropriate components. However, the feeling is that compared to the first chapter, the performances have been optimized better, perhaps paying attention to the frame pacing and the implementation of motion blur, in order to deliver a consistent result, which generally manages the enormous amount of enemies well that crowd the screen at times. It's a shame that Xbox One X didn't even think of inserting a 60-frame mode, instead opting for native 4K and a set of textures suitable for this resolution. While awaiting a technical analysis that precisely clarifies the differences compared to the PC version also in terms of effects and visual distance, we can however say that the result achieved does not significantly diminish the beauty of some scenarios nor affect the quality of a gameplay that also on consoles is confirmed as frenetic, fun and exciting. Obviously, the technical limits that we had also detected on PC remain: the effect of the flames is ugly, the polygonal models of the characters often reveal an old-gen connotation, especially in terms of animations sacrificed in the name of functionality, and there are inevitably several assets generic in the albeit valid composition of the locations. A negative note regarding the menu interface: in the passage to Xbox One the developers would have had to redesign it for the most part, having been born with the monitor / mouse combination in mind.", "date": "2018-07-15", "grade": "8.2"}
