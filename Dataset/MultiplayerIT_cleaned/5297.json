Even if everything is poorly corroborated by a series of official licenses limited in number, albeit interesting in terms of prestige: in fact we are talking about those of the UEFA Champions League and the Europa League, however penalized as we will see by the ever decreasing presence of official teams, the Super European Cup and the AFC, the Asian Champions Cup. Absent, however, this year the Copa Libertadores and the South American one with the related participating teams. Unfortunately, the list relating to the national club championships is even more meager. Pro Evolution Soccer 17 on the older generation proceeds in the wake of tradition and some novelties Licensing issue In fact, the game ~boasts~ the full official licenses only for the Argentine, Chilean, Dutch and French championships, those limited only to clubs for our Serie A (except for Sassuolo and Juventus, renamed Sansagiulo and PM Black White) and for the Brazilian tournament (the logo of Brasileiro is missing). For the Portuguese, Spanish and English ones it's even worse: although the names of the players are all faithfully reported, most of the teams are without names, flags and official kits, except for a couple per league, such as Arsenal and Liverpool, Sporting Lisbon and Benfica , Barcelona (with which Konami has entered into a particular partnership) and Atletico Madrid. Totally absent, as always, the Bundesliga, which sees in the rest of the European teams only Schalke 04, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund as officially licensed clubs. The same goes for the various B series. As for the squads, they are not totally updated, and therefore there is no shortage of players to still be deployed in clubs of which they are no longer part. Moving on to analyze the game modes, we see that there are the usual ones starting with the traditional exhibition matches and up to a series of competitions available in all sorts of ways, such as the Championship Mode, enriched by the presence of the second leagues of England, Spain, Italy and France, or the classic Master League, which presents the addition of some new options related to the transfer system. Without forgetting Become a Legend and, for online play, myClub, which this year boasts a scouting system, a new mechanism for choosing and analyzing potential opponents, as well as an unprecedented tutorial specially created to easily introduce new players to the mode. users, and serve as a refresher for veterans, plus all the corollary of options for playing on the Net (ranked games, tournaments and so on). Unfortunately, as well as for the older brother, also in this case we were unable to thoroughly test the online modes, which is why we refer you to any special future dedicated to the analysis of netcode, balancing and structures of this area of PES. Xbox 360 goals There are a total of 48 achievements available in the game, for a total score of 1,000 G. To unlock them, you need to complete certain challenges, such as having 65% ball possession in a match, becoming the best player in Become a Legend mode or winning the European or Asian Champions League. Ball in the center As for the gameplay, even this year there are no particular upheavals compared to the previous edition, if not a taste in a minor tone of some features present in the major edition and some tweaks to smooth out part of the defects of the 2016 version. once you take the field, the feeling with the controls remains the same as always, even if you perceive greater and faster control of the players, especially using the manual settings. Shots, plays, passes, building a play remains fun, above all because the ball has credible rebounds and there are teammates able to ~read~ and support the play thanks to the plays, and an even more advanced artificial intelligence than it allows the CPU in certain respects to adjust progressively also in relation to the user's and opponent's style of play. Even the goalkeepers are safer between the posts, making things more exciting. As a result, the teams act better according to what happens during the match with sudden sprints, unmarking, pressure on the ball carriers, markings and overlappingni, both offensive and defensive, almost always functional to the scheme and strategies adopted by the user or by the opposing coach, as well as the progress and result of the match itself. In fact, a large variety of specific tactics can be set up to be used in certain areas of the field, even in corner kicks, by selecting in advance how many and which players must perform certain movements without the ball to cover the areas of the field uncovered in defense or in midfield, or to make forward entries. And where tactics and strategy don't arrive, there's always the single champion's play that makes the difference. Whether it's an attacking phenomenon like Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, a midfielder like Pogba or Iniesta, or a goalkeeper like Gigi Buffon, it doesn't matter: exploited properly, albeit without the exaggerations of some past chapters, the champions can sometimes decide the victory or defeat of your team. Maybe due to a ~duck~ in front of an experienced striker, or with a precise free kick, provided you get one from an inviting position. In this sense, the title offers referees who, compared to last season, whistle more and better control the progress of each single action and tackle, so as to partially ~remedy~ a system that is still a little too unbalanced in favor of the more physically strong. From this point of view, nothing escapes the cameras of Pro Evolution Soccer 17, nor ~his direction~, which as per tradition remains worthy of a real television production. Fouls, bookings, disappointments after a wrong shot or celebrations after a goal (by the way, there are new ones again this year), but also the replays, the ad hoc shots of the cheering crowd, everything is as usual built to exalt the aesthetic component of the game and best restore the typical atmosphere of a football event broadcast on TV. Obviously, one should not expect upheavals from the graphic point of view compared to last year, given that the old consoles have now been squeezed properly and in productions ~serial~ like this, developers tend to update, tweak and fade here and there on the basis of what the old graphics engines can give them. In any case, the reproduction of the faces of the most famous players and of the game uniforms, at least those covered by an official license, remain good, as well as the animations, especially those of the most acclaimed champions. As for the stadiums, as per tradition for the series there are few, especially covered by a license, with some that stand out over the others for their beauty and fidelity to their real counterparts, and others that are more anonymous and dull. Finally, the sound sector is excellent, with dozens of typically stadium effects, choirs and roars of all types and genres, to underline every action that takes place on the pitch. The commentary signed by the usual duo Fabio Caressa and Luca Marchegiani is also good, introducing new phrases and exclamations, but at the same time ~maintaining~ some errors in the comment or in the tone, and a not always constant rhythm, of the 2016 edition.", "date": "2016-09-17", "grade": "7.3"}
