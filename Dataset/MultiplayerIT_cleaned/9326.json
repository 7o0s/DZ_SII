The players are happy, because most of the innovations that aren't graphics are of little or no interest, and we go on quietly without too many jolts to comment on the size of the textures, which as we know are the real fulcrum of the gaming experience - for not to mention the age-old question of the amount of particles emitted by a shot hitting a wall. Then one day you happen to try a 2008 FPS / RPG coming from Ukraine, a few months ago translated into a language usable in the West (only English, unfortunately) and after several hours of play the first question that comes to your mind (ok , we swear we'll stop with the obsolete words) it's because the developers have tried to experiment even though they don't have big capital behind them. Who made him do it? The game in question is the unknown Xenus II White Gold, followed by the better known Boiling Point, both developed by Deep Shadows. Those of Precursors, to give an example that we have already discussed recently. Let's start with the flaws Before talking about the features that make Xenus II White Gold a good game, it's better to put your hands forward and list all those flaws, some small, some more important, that prevent it from being a masterpiece. Most obvious is the artificial stupidity that drives non-player characters, both friend and foe. To say the least, we were unable to complete a classic escort mission because the escort did not want to go around the enemies by following us in a safe area and, above all, to take cover during the shooting following his kamikaze action. Another big problem is a certain cumbersome interface that is not exactly intuitive and which has been the cause of cursing on several occasions, especially when one is in need and must immediately find something in the very messy inventory (activating it the action does not stop). Here too there is a rather striking example to make you understand the mediocre design of some aspects of the interface: the tutorial pop-ups that appear even in delicate moments - imagine that you have just taken aim and you see a panel of writing appear it distracts you from shooting. Fortunately, a little practice is enough to understand all the critical aspects and deactivate what is superfluous. What is more infuriating, however, is the general lack of information. We don't pretend to have the solution on the screen as happens in Oblivion, but at least to have a pale idea of where to find the quests, yes, given that the free roaming structure makes it difficult to track down all the mission givers scattered around the various islands. The problem is that there is no indication that a character has a quest to assign, so you have to talk to literally everyone, if you don't want to miss anything. The last obvious flaw, but less relevant, is the entirely narrative paradox of having an initially incapable character, hired at his weight to carry out a very risky mission. To make you understand what we are talking about, the role-playing nature of Xenus II White Gold must be explained: by overcoming missions the hero accumulates experience points and levels that allow him to unlock extra skills. Nothing strange so far, except that often the skills in question are basic actions such as aiming with firearms (a mercenary who doesn't know how to aim has never been seen) or jumping higher. In short, from the point of view of verisimilitude it is a bit strange to see this macho survivor of a thousand battles who can barely hold a gun in his hand. In short, is it to be thrown away? No, we haven't gone crazy. Despite the defects described, and others to which we will mention, Xenus II White Gold is a title that we strongly recommend you to play. Let's see why. The first sequence takes place on board a boat and is a kind of rail shooter where you have to shoot down enemy vehicles. Destroyed the means of transport you find yourself lost on a lush tropical island, grappling with an open world and with so many things to do. The first need is to find a decent weapon to not succumb to firefights and try to figure out how to leave the island. You start with a gun, which obviously isn't enough to survive for long. From the first dialogue it can be understood that we are not faced with a shooter like the others. Based on the answers given to the man who was driving the boat, it is possible to make the flu rise or fall on the population, with results that have repercussionsthey will actually stay on the game world. Talking to the other inhabitants, it soon becomes clear that the islands are governed by a dense network of relationships between different warring factions and that, above all, it is not possible to please everyone. Which side are you on? Guerrillas or paramilitaries? Population or bandits? The decision will be determined by the choices made during the hundreds of missions that make up the game, and don't doubt that some reports will be truncated in case of incorrect behavior. Hardcore RPG There is a little bit of everything around the island. Sometimes it seems to be a fantasy hero more than a mercenary. The inhabitants have the most disparate needs, ranging from the usual objects to deliver or to find, to love affairs to reassemble (side note: one day the writers of Xenus II White Gold will explain to us why the hero of the game wants to prostitute all the women he meets; a little less male chauvinism and machismo wouldn't hurt in video games). Maybe it's a bit funny to have to carry out certain miserable tasks, but the money is used to buy the equipment and, if you are not good enough at picking, initially the missions are the only way to make some money without kill bipeds and plunder them. Moreover there is always the urgent need to accumulate experience, otherwise no level growth and no additional skills. As you progress in the game you will become very rich and spending sprees won't be long in coming. For example, it will be possible to buy a house; not that it does much good, but it's always nice to have a mansion in an RPG. Exploring the first island (there are five in total) one realizes that the dimensions of the game world are considerable and that the movements are quite long. Fortunately, one of the first missions allows you to get your hands on a car, making travel much faster. Speaking of vehicles, it is interesting to note how Xenus II White Gold gives almost absolute freedom to the player, allowing him to use land, sea and air vehicles. A godsend. Combat and other secondary aspects The combat system is more complex than that of a normal FPS. Meanwhile, all the damage is localized and based on the position of the wounds there are different effects on the gameplay. Wounded arm? Ouch ouch, bad aim. Broken leg? Ouch ouch, movement speed slowed. To heal wounds you can eat, go to a doctor or inject painkillers. If desired, it is also possible to temporarily enhance some characteristics of the character by using drugs. The problem is that painkillers and drugs are addictive, making their excessive use inadvisable. Better to eat some fruit, heal less, but have no strange symptoms during the action; of course, making the protagonist eat ten pineapples to heal him could give him squaraus, but fortunately this side effect is not foreseen. Obviously, among the unlockable skills there are those that increase the various resistances: to blows, to drugs, to damage from animals and so on. From a technical point of view, Xenus II White Gold is a mediocre production of 2008. The past time is all seen, but it is clear that even at the time some aspects were not worthy of an Oscar, such as the woodiness of the animations or the numerous graphic bugs that afflict him. The comparison with Crysis, with which it shares part of the setting, would be quite merciless, even if it must be said that Xenus II does many more things than any other FPS on the market. From a soundtrack perspective we had some issues getting the audio to play properly. Not that we were missing who knows what unpublished compositions, but playing for hours in absolute silence is not a pleasure. However, once we got the sound we found average music and mediocre sound effects. So we went back to listening to the silence.", "date": "2011-04-26", "grade": "8.0"}
