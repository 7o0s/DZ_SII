Only this time, since everything is made from Lego bricks, it's much more fun and colorful. full of basic pieces called studs, which act as the currency necessary to unlock the bonuses present in the title, partly because it is simply very fun to reduce the game environments into pieces, or rather, into bricks. In between sections on foot, there are also vehicle stages, from the pod race on Naboo, through to the final destruction of the Death Star. If the parts on foot should be studied as a small masterpiece of concept and level design, those aboard X-Wing and Speeder instead are rather repetitive and confusing, little more than a simple interlude not too successful to connect the various game sequences, despite the Traveller's Talles have tried to correct them in some way. Even the use of the Sixaxis only exacerbates this feeling, not actually giving any added value to the gaming experience. When I grow up I will be an architect Obviously Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga cannot take itself too seriously, and in fact the whole game is permeated by a subtle underlying humor, which sometimes leads to exaggerated gags, hilarious interlude scenes that demystify the drama of some events. If the playability settles on exceptional values, it is the replayability factor that makes the game soar to very high levels. The 36 chapters present, six for each film, are full of sections, doors, platforms and bonuses not accessible from the first game. In practice, the first time you have completed Lego Star Wars you are far from having seen it all, so it is a must to replay some areas being careful to choose the right character. If we add to this the collection of studs to spend in the Cellar and the search for minikits, the result is a really high longevity without boredom causing us to turn off the console. The brevity of the various levels helps in this sense, no back tracking, no kilometers to grind to open that door or to get to the coveted one hundred percent true Jedi. Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The versions tested are those for Nintendo Wii and Playstation 3. Polish or a simple damp cloth? Cosmetically Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga does not differ much from the previously released versions, it is limited to a graphic quality in step with the hardware on which it runs and to a general greater detail and cleanliness of the main characters. Nothing shocking, but a minimum of additional work to compensate for the age of the original code was due. Credit to the glittering and plasticky heads of the main characters, for the explosions and special effects in general. The camera alone does not seem to have received any adjustments with the transition to the new generation: it was not very functional two years ago and has remained so, fixing itself with lopsided visuals that do not facilitate the exploration of the levels. Polish or a simple damp cloth? Nintendo Wii The version for the flagship Nintendo pays duty, compared to the PS3 and 360, in terms of graphics and content. The Traveller's Tales title has lost all those graphic improvements that high definition has brought as a dowry, effectively making the game completely indistinguishable from previous versions. The controls then do not benefit much from the remote plus nunchuck combo: moving the remote control all the time to slash with the lightsaber becomes rather repetitive after a while: sensational and satisfying for the first few minutes of the game, however, boredom immediately appears (and also a minimum of fatigue), when you discover that the fight is just a matter of speed of execution without a minimum of technique. Even other small implementations like shaking the remote to build some structures faster don't give any plus to the gaming experience. Completely similar in terms of stages and sections present, however, this port lacks the online cooperative mode (the local one is obviously present), which effectively castrates the game compared to the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 releases. Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga for the Nintendo Wii is therefore the least ~flashy~ version of those releases, tremendously fun and long-lived, on balance however littlerecommended, given the exclusion of the co-op on the net, to those who have already played the two previous chapters of the series. Comment Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga despite being little more than a simple copy and paste of the previous games can be played with extreme pleasure being a small masterpiece of humor and level design. Very funny and long-lived, thanks also to the impossibility of being able to dissect the whole title during the first game, he is capable of making himself loved immediately, by virtue of small puzzles to be solved and an incessant rhythm that only rarely gives way to temporary slowdowns. The inclusion of the online co-op mode on PS3 and 360 is the classic icing on the cake that will definitely make even those who had already played it in previous incarnations appreciate the title. Pros Small graphical upgrades Inclusion of the online co-op mode Fun and long-lived Cons Not very functional camera Few unpublished levels The online cooperative mode is not present in the Wii version", "date": "2007-12-05", "grade": null}
