The Stick of Truth set a very high standard for video game tie-ins as, in addition to being a good RPG, it was laughable from start to finish at a time when frames per second are counted too much, forgetting a simple truth : games should above all amuse us. And laughing we forget the spartan graphics, but so faithful to the original animated series, or the one that works less in terms of gameplay, because after all South Park has always told us something important, even between farts and bad words. Well, maybe not always always, but often. Scontri Di-retti therefore had to face a double challenge. The new video game, developed this time by Ubisoft San Francisco with the collaboration of the official screenwriters Matt Stone and Trey Parker, had to prove to us that it was a better sequel and had to enjoy us as an installment of the television series. If he succeeded you will find out in the next few lines. The Coon Civil War The Fractured But Who begins as The Stick of Truth: the children of South Park are engaged in an epic cosplay battle, but Eric Cartman has changed his mind and, having stopped playing the wizard played in the previous game, has returned to wearing those of the Coon , his masked alter ego. For the uninitiated, almost every child in the charming Colorado town is actually a super hero: it all started in an old 2009 episode (~The Coon~) and then, over time, practically every character has acquired powers who come and go. It is difficult to place the South Park superhero stories in an official mythology, because these are deliberately exaggerated episodes that usually make fun of the Marvel or DC Comics franchises. This is what happens in Clash Di-retti, as Cartman intends to find a lost cat and invest the meager reward in the cinematic serialization of his super adventures. Obviously it doesn't make sense and here, in fact, the narrative infrastructure of Clash Di-retti fails a bit. While in The Stick of Truth the children basically participated in a sort of Live Action RPG, in the new game they take the story a little too seriously, even going so far as to fight in a feud between the super group of the Coon and that of the Friends of Freedom , aping the eternal rivalry between the aforementioned American publishing houses. In the middle of this ~civil war~ with no holds barred is us, in the role of the Newbie who arrived in South Park in the previous game. The Fractured But Whole is a true sequel but anyone can play it without first having to complete The Stick of Truth: in this sense, Stone and Parker have done a great job, writing sibylline references while playing with a truly multifaceted storyline. However, we must admit that the first hours of Clash Whore are a bit sluggish, and it almost seems like we see all the problems that have postponed the launch of the game several times: the plot remains for a long time without a precise direction and develops in a succession of main and secondary missions almost completely unrelated to each other. The story gives the impression of being too intricate for what an interactive video game should be. Intent on introducing as many characters and references to the television series as possible into the plot, Matt and Trey seem at a certain point to lose the thread of the conversation and around five or six hours into the game, one actually has no idea what is going on: the Newbie goes from one problem to another, thanks to Morgan Freeman he discovers the powers of his rear and faces ignorant call girls, ninja immigrants, pedophile priests and other amenities. At some point, however, something clicks. It's like a turning point. It almost seems that Matt and Trey decide to throw themselves headlong into the superhero storyline without paying attention to satire or moralism. Scontri Di-retti therefore becomes a compelling cine-fumettone in which, within the conclusion, each piece of the mosaic finds the right place, pushing the accelerator on an epic but hilarious conclusion. South Park fans will probably love the quotes and how their heroes relate to each other on screen, but it must be admitted that The But Whole is less funny than The Stick of Truth. His is a less incisive irony, certainly less brilliant, and in general we had the impression that Matt and Trey pushed a little more on the ~politically correct~, setting aside abortions and Nazis to devote themselves above all to defecation and supernatural farts. Clashes Of-retti, in short, is another super big stake in South Park, even if not among the most brilliant. Playstation 4 trophies The 36 South Park: The Fractured But Whole trophies are divided into 4 gold, 12 silver and 19 bronze. Once you unlock them all, you obviously get the platinum trophy. This is not a particularly difficult undertaking, but you have to carefully scour the city in search of every collectible, complete the various side missions and obviously get to the end of the game. The power of the heart....hours On the gameplay front, however, a lot of things have really changed. Exploration still clings to a ~metroidvania~ style: as you complete main and side missions, the Newbie unlocks specific abilities that grant access to previously inaccessible areas. His farts are capable of rewinding or stopping time, and he can summon supporting actors to reach elevated platforms, clear busy passageways, sabotage electronic circuits, or simply remove various obstacles. Each skill revolves around flatulence, but involves solving a simple mini-game that makes the experience always interactive, if a little repetitive in the long run. The process is more or less the same for about twenty hours: once a new power has been unlocked, it can and sometimes must be used to reach a new area where we will find some secret collectible or continue with the campaign missions. In this sense, there is no lack of variety: in addition to the more complex main missions, we will be able to engage in the search for dozens of yaoi illustrations, souvenirs or lost cats. The Fractured But Whole also offers a fairly basic crafting system that allows you to craft consumables, costumes, or artifacts. These replace entirely the equipment of The Stick of Truth, now that the costumes are mere visual frills that serve to customize the appearance of the New Kid. By leveling up, slots are unlocked in which to set artifacts that guarantee a statistical increase to the damage inflicted, maximum health and so on. The leveling phase is also strongly interconnected with the development of the story, since the enemies that roam South Park are few and easily circumvented, the missions revolve more often around puzzles than obligatory fights and experience points are earned above all by completing the numerous objectives secondary. This does not mean that Ubisoft has not taken care of the new combat system because, indeed, it is one of the best features of the game. Essentially it still works a bit like in Super Mario RPGs and by pressing the keys at the right time it is possible to increase the damage that is inflicted or decrease that which is received, but the setting of the clashes has changed drastically: while still being turn-based, they now take place on the grids typical of strategic games. During the turns of our characters - a maximum of four - we can move within a limited area and use various powers that profoundly differentiate the various protagonists and their roles in battle. Brico Boy, for example, is a great ranged attacker capable of hitting multiple targets in horizontal or diagonal rows, whereas the Coon is a melee fighter that deals massive damage over time and can manipulate the position of allies and enemies. Some characters possess very particular abilities - this is the case of Fastpass's supersonic attacks - and changing formations in search of the best synergies is a lot of fun, especially thanks to the Newbie's arsenal, who begins by choosing a certain class and ends up learning the powers of a second, of a third and, finally, any other possible power. Unfortunately, the Newbie's loadout remains limited to three common powers and one definitive - a kind of super move - so experimenting is a must but, faced with around thirty powers, it's a pity not being able to select others, especially during the battles with the more difficult bosses. challenges that require particular strategies, often focused on unique mechanics or tactical positioning: some attacks can in fact move the target from one square to another and with a little cunning it is possible to hurl it against an ally, who will give him a resounding blow to good measure, or against some obstacle, dealing even more damage. In this respect, the fights in Scontri Di-retti are usually long but fun and never prohibitive, thanks also to a series of small tricks and touches of class that increase their strategic depth such as the protagonist's farts that reset the enemy's turns, the politically correct counterattacks, the Final Fantasy-style summonsand so on. Two words on the Italian adaptation It seems perfectly useless to dwell on a technical analysis of the game, given that it would leave the time it finds: like The Stick of Truth four years ago, even Clash But Whole is essentially the ~cartoon~ that comes to life in its essential style and a little grotesque, never missing a beat in terms of fluidity. We did see a few glitches here and there which we hope Ubisoft will fix in an update at or shortly after launch, as in some cases these bugs gave us some headaches when we had to close a side mission or start another one. Likewise, we hope that any update will correct the Italian subtitles which, especially in the second half of the game, often appeared full of grammatical errors or missing entire words when they weren't transcribing a completely different joke from the one spoken. The Italian localization of Scontri Di-retti should have been a big selling point, given that Ubisoft summoned the voice actors of the Italian version of the TV series, but unfortunately it left us with a bad taste in our mouths. The Italian dubbing of South Park has always caused discussion, especially as regards the less recurring characters, but after twenty years it is normal that many spectators have grown fond of our local voices. Fortunately, the voice actors of the children do a good job, but those of the supporting actors often act listless and apathetic, especially when it comes to profanity and swearing. In some cases we even realized that at least two different actors were used to voice the same character. It is probably still the aftermath of the troubled development that was reflected in some last minute dubbing. Obviously we would have preferred more care, given that this is a more unique than rare occasion, but it is still possible to change the audio track at any time. On the other hand, there is no objection to the original dubbing: it is simply perfect. +24", "date": "2017-10-16", "grade": "8.2"}
