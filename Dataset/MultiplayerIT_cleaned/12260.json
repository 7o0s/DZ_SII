{"name": "Crush - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crush-recensione.html", "text": "At night I will have three-dimensional dreams The protagonist of Crush is Danny, a young man with thick hair and an ~important~ nose who suffers from a serious form of insomnia: after having tried all possible treatments, he relies on a bizarre doctor who introduces him to C.R.U.S.H. a complex machine capable of transforming Danny's twisted thoughts into abstract three-dimensional scenarios. And here the player enters the scene, who will have the task of guiding the atypical hero into the maze of his own mind (handily divided into 50 levels for the occasion) in an attempt to discover the causes of insomnia and eradicate them definitively . If the premises of Crush already appear quite original, it is in the gameplay that the Kuju title shows off all its creativity, giving life to a play structure so abstruse as to be even difficult to describe in words. Basically, each stage looks like a series of platforms suspended in the air arranged at different heights and depths, which the user can run, jump and stoop at will, also having the ability to rotate the camera 90 in any direction . A freedom directly connected to the main feature of the game, the so-called crush effect, which allows you to transform the 3D scenario into a two-dimensional plane: therefore, depending on the shot chosen, the use of the crush will have different repercussions, for example making platforms accessible far away in depth or allowing you to reach otherwise impossible heights. The puzzles of Sega production focus completely around this aspect, with the user who must have a good game in analyzing the characteristics of the environment and juxtaposing various crushes to achieve his goal. Which, in this case, consists in collecting a certain number of orbs in order to make the exit usable, most of the time deliberately placed in awkward positions... Confessions of a dangerous mind But that's not all: the settings of Crush offer several elements that contribute to further complicate the matter. First, there are interactable objects whose movement in the 3D scenario affects the two-dimensional plane or vice versa; some can then be unlocked only by locating a drawing on one of the walls of the stage from the right angle; again, there are huge cockroaches (which represent the projection of Danny's innermost fears) which must be eliminated by crushing them with a crush or using movable blocks and spheres. In short, the levels of Crush are decidedly rich and complex, to the point of often ending up exceeding the limit and resulting in excessive brain-teasing. In the more advanced stages, in fact, some scenarios of the Kuju title can even require an interval between thirty minutes and an hour to be completed, presenting such difficult (if not really incomprehensible) puzzles as to force the user to a little pleasant trial and error until the crux is discovered. Another unpleasant aspect of Crush lies in some obscure playful elements that can lead to angry frustration: it is not clear why, but certain boundaries between platforms cannot be crossed, or a crush is not allowed when instead the conditions would seem allow it. It almost seems that the developers of Kuju have deliberately created certain tricks to prevent the player from smooth progress in the adventure, with the clear aim of diluting the experience. Diets aside, Crush turns out to be a valid and above all original puzzle game, accompanied by an up-to-date technical realization. The sound is particularly good, with absolutely spot-on music, while the graphics manage to combine an indispensable functionality with a decent visual result, despite certain color combinations appearing at least questionable. Comment In addition to being able to boast an original concept (which is more unique than rare these days), Crush turns out to be a sharp and engaging puzzle game, even if perhaps a little too difficult and brainy in the long run: the 50 levels of the game will therefore give It's another hard time for puzzle enthusiasts, but certain questionable gameplay choices often derail the pure ~trial and try~ experience, sacrificing the fun. With a little more forethought, Crush could have really become a sleeper hit, but as it stands it is ~simply~ a good puzzle. Pros Very original Complex and elaborate scenarios Technically sound Cons Too difficult in the long run Can get frustrating In the video game dictionary, the sleeper hit is that title which, after a development that has passed well out of the limelight, bursts onto the market surprisingpublic and critical end thanks to particularly original or relevant talents. All credentials that seem to belong to the present Crush, created by Kuju on behalf of Sega: let's see if, put to the test, it can actually aspire to be included in the prestigious category mentioned above...", "date": "2007-05-23", "grade": null}
