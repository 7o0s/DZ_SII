Alongside the inevitable sighs of relief of those who were by now tired of seeing those furious birds declined in all ways, the large group of fans and diehards, who have resisted the charm of Ruzzle, impatiently awaits the title destined to collect that immense and cumbersome inheritance. We will not know, at least in the short term, if Tennis in the Face will be able to obtain the same impressive numbers achieved by its illustrious inspirer, however it seems that for once we are faced with a finally more original reinterpretation of an objectively inflated game concept. Watch out for the face! In Tennis in the Face, you will have to impersonate the bizarre ex-professional tennis player Pete Pagassi, who already from the name suggests the funny and ironic nature of the entire title. Fusion of two of the greatest tennis players in history, Pete Sampras and Andr Agassi, the frustrated protagonist finds himself unwillingly the victim of an energy drink even described as ~diabolical~, the Explodz, the abuse of which resulted in the premature end of the career. Revenge against the hated drink and the manufacturing company therefore becomes Pagassi's only reason and, obviously, the tool to implement it can only be his trusty racket. Thus begins a long journey in search of the most avid drinkers of Explodz, facing a whole series of unlikely characters in various contexts, such as disturbing clowns, policemen, even more disturbing ~trendy~ boys as well as, in the final stages, even the production factory itself . The game mechanism is, as already mentioned, similar to that of Angry Birds, at least in the aiming part of the tennis ball, which can be directed in the desired direction with the finger. However, the most important differences essentially concern the behavior after the shot since, obviously, a tennis ball has different and more pronounced rebounds compared to a bird. In practice, with a powerful punch, Pagassi can knock down all enemies present in the trajectory, weakened by the abuse of Explodz. It is therefore very important to calculate the correct trajectories of the rebounds, considering any obstacles and differences in height; in fact, scattered throughout each stage there may be ice walls, ramps, platforms, made of wood or stone, with different behaviors each time if hit. The ultimate goal of the game is to shoot down as many enemies as possible using the least number of balls available; the score is also given by the type of killing, including the spectacular ~headshot~ (similar to a very painful ball in the eye), but above all those in succession, initiated by a triggering event. Continuing through the levels, the destruction bonuses also increase, which can be used to create real chaos in the game scheme: tubes of new balls which, if hit, escape from all sides, explosives, barrels, Explodz cans (which explode after a few second from the impact), even whole can dispensers, which after three shots go to pieces, giving away many points. Due to its intrinsic nature, Tennis in the Face requires several attempts in the most complex schemes before completing the relevant framework with the maximum score; although the general difficulty is not very high, some of the over 100 schemes are rather difficult (but never frustrating). The most spectacular killings can even be immortalized by a screenshot that can be shared on the most popular social networks. Finally, both the level design and, above all, the colorful and parodic aspect of the graphics are very nice, ideal for contextualizing Pete Pagassi's bizarre revenge.", "date": "2013-02-06", "grade": "8.5"}
