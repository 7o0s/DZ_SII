StarDrone Extreme comes out, the new production of Beatshapers, which arrives on PlayStation Vita to enrich a growing sector such as that of ~budget~ titles, led by the fun MotorStorm RC, and which at the price of only 3.99 euros offers us sixty increasingly challenging and multifaceted levels. This is the revised and improved edition of a game released last year on PlayStation 3, which on the Sony flagship console boasted a control system via Move and which in this new version instead uses the touch screen to offer the same immediate and intuitive gameplay , with excellent results. And, speaking of results, the commitment of the Japanese house in offering users a series of low-priced games, alongside the ~traditional~ ones, can only be good for the possibilities of the new handheld to establish itself among an audience whose attention is increasingly catalysed by mobile games sold for a few cents. Closing this necessary parenthesis, let's see exactly how StarDrone Extreme looks like and what are its strengths... Like you were a doll If on PlayStation 3, as mentioned, StarDrone adopted a Move-based control system, allowing us to ~hook~ our drone by pointing the controller towards the handhold on duty, on PlayStation Vita everything works via touch screen and the solutions implemented field prove to be quite effective and ~elastic~ from the very first minutes, i.e. target identification does not require absolute precision but is detected on the basis of the distance from the touch. Those who prefer not to invade the screen with their fingers can activate the controls via the rear touch pad, which are also well implemented but, in the end, less practical than the default setting. In the sixty levels that make up the single player mode of StarDrone Extreme (fifty of which are ~remastered~ from the PS3 version and ten completely new) our goal is simple: to manage the movements of a space drone because, within each scenario, you can ~turn on~ a certain number of stars or, possibly, collect objects capable of activating particular switches. An undertaking that gradually becomes more complex, because we cannot move the device directly, but we must from time to time hook onto handholds and rotate around them and then launch ourselves in the desired direction, calculating any inertia as well as the presence of possible threats, be they enemies or traps. The gameplay is terribly immediate, after all it is enough to touch a handhold for the drone to connect to it and start to turn, but the experience turns out to be anything but trivial and moving around the stages in search of missing tiles or other requires a degree of precision that can only be acquired with a little practice, and that every perfectly executed maneuver corresponds to a great sense of satisfaction. PSVita trophies StarDrone Extreme allows you to get fifteen Trophies. Alongside the simplest ones to unlock, which are received simply by completing a certain number of levels or the entire game, there are some very nice ones. For example the ~Epic Fail!~ Trophy, which is obtained when you fail to complete a stage twenty times in a row... The business gets complicated Considering that the levels gradually become larger and more complex, and that new objects are also introduced that can influence the movement of the drone, StarDrone Extreme ensures a respectable longevity and is worth the 3.99 euros of its price to the last cent on PlayStation Store. Of course, it's not nice that after the umpteenth failed attempt in an internship the game offers us to ~skip~ it by purchasing a paid cheat to make all the scenarios immediately available, but there is definitely worse around from this point of view. Rather, regret that the gameplay variation elements are ultimately all ~external~ to the device we manage, that is, they depend on the conformation and peculiarities of the environment, while our abilities remain fundamentally the same for the entire duration of the experience. Daring more at this juncture would perhaps have made the action even more engaging. For the rest, the pieces of the puzzle appear all in their place: the touch controls are precise and reactive, the graphics are perfectly suited to the type of product and in the same way the music and effects prove to be appropriate.", "date": "2012-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
