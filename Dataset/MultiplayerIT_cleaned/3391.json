{"name": "Planet Zoo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-recensione.html", "text": "Planet Zoo is a fantastic editor, perhaps the best one made by Frontier. For this reason, reading the review it may seem at times that we are talking about a Photoshop application, rather than a real video game. After all, those who have played Planet Coaster, and to a lesser extent Jurassic World Evolution, will know that the fulcrum of these titles is not so much the campaign, weak here too, as the possibility of creating the park, in this zoological case, of dreams . Frontier, we will never get tired of repeating it, is not a company active only in the world of video games, but also in that of actual parks (for which it designs attractions) so it is normal that at a certain point it decided to pour its know-how in its other area of expertise, going beyond what all competitors have done. After all, he has been dealing with the genre since the Xbox port of Roller Coaster Tycoon and over the years he has also worked several times on titles that attempted to simulate the behavior of real animals, for example Zoo Tycoon, which has more than a few points of contact with Planet Zoo , but also Kinectimals and Dog's Life, albeit starting from completely different approaches. Campaign or sandbox? Planet Zoo is therefore the arrival point of a growth process that starts from far away. Once the game has started, let's immediately try to jump into the campaign, or Career mode, which also serves as a tutorial. The campaign is structured in single missions, in each of which we are given a series of objectives that can earn us a bronze, silver or gold star. To accompany us in the discovery of the game we think some funny characters, members of our staff, who illustrate us in detail what we have to do, at least in the first missions, however giving us more space in the subsequent ones, when theoretically we should be able to move alone. The objectives to be pursued are the most disparate and range from the simple reinforcement of a fence, to attracting a certain number of visitors perhaps by adopting some particularly loved species, or to accumulating a certain sum to demonstrate the success of our work. At this point we would like to confess that we have not reached the end of the campaign, because we preferred to focus on the sandbox and challenge modes (identical to the first, but with more economic problems to face), much more satisfying, as well as the real core of Planet Zoo As already mentioned, having missions to carry out can be good for learning the rudiments of the game, but having understood the economic system, only slightly more complex than that of Jurassic World Evolution and repeating some tasks several times, we decided to dedicate ourselves to something that was completely ours and that would allow us to put into practice what we learned freely. From our point of view, the only real reason to finish the twelve missions of the campaign is the unlocking of all the scenarios, in case you want to have a more structured starting point for the other modes mentioned. For the rest it is easily ignored, also because it offers nothing particularly brilliant. Gameplay In Planet Zoo, the player's main task is to prepare and optimize the artificial and non-artificial biomes of the park in which the animals will live. The options offered are really many, sometimes stunning in quantity. In general, every animal needs its habitat to be happy and, if necessary, reproduce, generating puppies. We have the obligation to balance their needs with the commercial needs of the park. So we must first build comfortable fences that are of the right height to prevent the animals from escaping, and then shape the terrain to create the most interesting environment possible for the specimen. Here we are now planting the right vegetation: just to give two examples, a brown bear likes to be surrounded by trees suitable for a cool continental climate, while a monkey prefers tropical trees, perhaps tall enough to be easily climbable. Once the vegetation has been decided, it is the turn of food and water, therefore it is necessary to build the right structures (for example a shelter), and then prepare the enclosure in such a way as to create observation points for visitors, so as to encourage donations to the park. Once all this is done, you can select the animals assigned to the enclosure, which must first be adopted in the game shop and made to be transported by the attendants, and see if they have any needs that we have not considered. For example, they could get bored, and therefore force us to buy them games, or they could feel lonely, asking us to adopt someone similar to keep them company, or they could still not likeire the food we are giving him, or this may not be enough and more. Zoo animals Listing every single function of the Planet Zoo editor is frankly impossible and useless, also because, as already mentioned, some menus compete with actual applications as they are complex and full of buttons, considering that they not only include animal management functions, but also those of the park, including buildings for the attendants, accommodation facilities and so on. However, the apparent coldness of the whole does not deceive, because we are faced with a title capable of generating conflicting emotions in the player. It will be for the realism with which they are represented, it will be for the care that must be given to them to make them live well or just survive, but by playing a strong empathy towards the animals of our zoo (not human ones) develops, especially in sandbox mode. We honestly don't know what else to call that urge that the Frontier game has given us to constantly check our animals and to start thinking of our every action in function of them. On the other hand, when the bear Pier, dean of our Nordic zoo, died, we were sad as if we had lost a loved one. Perhaps we are exaggerating, but there is no doubt that Planet Zoo allows you to interact with animals to such a level that you end up feeling responsible towards them, as if the game projected us through its mechanics into the function we are covering in the simulation, reinforcing the illusion through a plausible graphic side. From an aesthetic point of view Planet Zoo aims at realism, but it is a functional realism to the message, which ends up increasing the involvement. A monkey that looks like a real monkey, moves like a real monkey and acts like one is interesting to watch as well as pleasant to care for. After all, having a very complete editor at your disposal allows you to indulge yourself in creating something more personal and heartfelt, the potential of which is clearly visible in the variety of prefabricated zoos provided by the developers, ranging from the classic park to the European one, organized in well distinct, and arriving at spectacular zoos fused with wilderness that are a sight to behold. Finally, the fact that we will see some beautiful ones in the coming months should not be underestimated, with modders who will not fail to provide us with new parks to visit and manage.", "date": "2019-11-05", "grade": "8.8"}
