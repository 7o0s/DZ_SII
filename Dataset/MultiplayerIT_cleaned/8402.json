Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a cent. Updating is a powerful tool, especially on the App Store. Through the release of an update it is possible to literally transform a product, and this is exactly what happened to Major Mayhem, the frenetic touch shooter developed by Rocket Jump for Adult Swim. Available for iPhone and iPad since last November, the game was recently updated to version 2.0 and simultaneously also published on Google Play, switching to the freemium format and enriching itself with a large number of contents and modalities compared to what was the original structure . In short, at present it is not only possible to download Major Mayhem for free, but also to access new skins, new weapons and four different modes (Classic, Timebomb, Arcade and Survival) which guarantee hours and hours of fun. Suffice it to say that Classic Mode alone is currently made up of one hundred and thirty-five levels, divided into three scenarios and characterized by an increasing degree of difficulty, as well as by the presence of exciting boss fights that alternate with standard-type action. And by the way, what is the gameplay of this title? It's very simple: our character moves running from one location to another, finds shelter behind an object and at that point the firefights begin with the enemies, who emerge from various corners of the screen and must be hit (simply by touching them) precisely while I'm out in the open. Their projectiles generally don't have to worry us, unless they are highlighted by a red halo: in this case, taking damage results in the loss of part of the ~armor~, and the third hit comes the game over. In some moments on the battlefield, ~hostages~ also appear that we simply have to try not to hit: if they remain unharmed for a few seconds, they will be able to escape and leave us a gift for the inconvenience. Between ninja and men in black It only takes a few seconds to familiarize yourself with the mechanisms of Major Mayhem, but the simplicity of the gameplay does not imply a total lack of depth, indeed the focus on execution speed makes each level a challenge in itself, perhaps to be repeated in search of the perfect assessment and an additional gain in terms of coins. The latter are spent between games to unlock new weapons, skins and upgrades, such as aerial bombardment or invulnerability (with the character wearing RoboCop-style armor!). Using the service pistol or switching to a rifle produces substantial differences, therefore just experimenting with various equipment already translates into long-term entertainment; unless you want to reach out to your wallet and buy a pack of coins to speed up operations, a practice that is far from essential for entertainment purposes. As already mentioned, the main mode is made up of a large number of stages and is supported by three less substantial but equally exciting extra modes, capable of increasing the variety and providing us with new ideas. Finally, Adult Swim productions are always characterized by cartoonish graphics and a certain type of humor, elements that are not lacking even in Major Mayhem: the developers have used colors well, designed the characters in a nice and effective way and used a nice little imagination to put together scenarios that are always interesting to see.", "date": "2012-07-28", "grade": "8.6"}
