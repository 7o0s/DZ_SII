An example can be iDracula, followed by Minigore and Alive 4Ever just to name the most successful; this Inkvaders was born from the ~inspiration~ of Zombieville USA, Chillingo's latest offer for the Apple platform. The Martian Threat The setting is based on the always popular invasion of Martians threatening the beloved Earth; the hero of the situation as well as the protagonist of Inkvaders is Generic Marine (G for friends), a fearless soldier in charge of eliminating the entire alien army single-handedly through three settings for thirty total levels. The gameplay requires very little to be understood: basically the character must be moved forward and backward on the two-dimensional plane, knocking down anything in front of it. This through the 15 weapons supplied, attributable to 3 groups: futuristic energy, contemporary, and finally grenade launcher. So if the basic concept is nothing more than ~go to the end of the level by killing everyone~, fortunately the development that was done by the Games Faction Ltd team has ensured greater depth overall. First of all, weapons as well as upgrades and ammunition (which therefore are not infinite) must be purchased in a sort of kiosk present in each stage; money is collected simply by killing Martians, or by collecting precious immobile or flying rock fragments. To take the latter, or to temporarily and strategically escape from enemies, you can use the jetpack that G is in possession of, being careful not to run out of the limited fuel available. Along the levels you will also encounter crates, to be collected simply by touching the screen; in addition to simple supplies of ammunition and energy, those marked by the letter R instead activate the ~Rush Mode~, or a short but intense attack by dozens of Martians simultaneously. A way to increase one's earnings, but which could prove to be a double-edged sword when the supplies of bullets or health are not conspicuous. Basically Inkvaders is all here: a repetitive but fun arcade, ideal for short sessions and with a price, 79 cents at the time of writing, which frankly leaves little room for complaints. Furthermore, the urge to play is strengthened by the aesthetic component, particularly appreciable in its well-characterized comic style and enhanced by the large dose of caricatured ultra-violence with severed heads and torn bodies. A last note on the subsequent product updates promised by the team, on paper truly capable of transforming the contents by adding enemies, end-of-level bosses and weapons. A plus that underlines great respect for buyers. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-08-31", "grade": "7.7"}
