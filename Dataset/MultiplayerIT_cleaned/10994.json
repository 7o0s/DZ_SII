The superb presentation of the game in computer graphics deserves particular applause, which thanks to a typically Japanese emphasis manages to excite and introduce the war climate that forms the background to the whole series very well. It is difficult, at least initially, to understand whether it is a real film or computer-generated graphics. After the title, the selection in the player's hand is quite meager and includes the story or the multiplayer. Let's start from the first and after a brief introduction that broadly describes the geopolitics of Armored Core, we can choose the chronological order in which to tackle the various missions of the first level. Each of them has the objective of eliminating an enemy: we are mercenaries who must do their job, through three long levels filled with enemy bosses and mechanized armies. A brief tutorial shows us the potential of our mach, equipped with two primary and two secondary weapons, acceleration and the ability to take flight to bomb from above. thanks to a typically Japanese emphasis it manages to excite and introduce the war climate that is the background to the whole series very well The most destructive of the Machs is pink, with a violet tint. We are equipped with homing missiles, homing missiles, grenades, a lightsaber and cluster bombs. Depending on the mercenary faction chosen from a shortlist of four initials, the robot at our disposal is more or less fast, powerful, resistant. As in a role-playing game, every feature of our metal alter-ego can be upgraded, replaced, sold, bought. This feature allows us to create our favorite mach as we want, even in online sessions. The control is initially complicated, and some visual problems do not help to train our armored beast well. Especially during the flight, the view is partially covered by the mach which stops in mid-air with all its grandeur. Over time, buttons and triggers become more friends and allow you to perform freer and smoother movements. The structure of this Armored Core, like all the other chapters of the series, is purely that of a no-frills arcade shooter. If we exclude the customization options, which give a little creative freedom, the heart of the game is not that far from a classic shooter like Virtual On, but set on an open scenario. You can fly. Indeed, better not! Armored Core For Answer's multiplayer is definitely diverse and varied. There are many possibilities, starting with a system link that allows up to eight players (each with a TV, console and game) to compete against each other. On the same television it is possible to start a co-op with a friend alongside, or through the internet connection. Finally, there are the classic games in ranked death matches and games customized by the player. In the latter case it is possible to set each parameter on the game, on the mechs and on the customized maps. Through a special page you can then access the online rankings of all world players: every victory gives points and every defeat causes you to lose. Also during the story you get a classification score (which by the way is essential to unlock some achievements on Xbox 360), which is as positive as more side missions we manage to complete. Armored Core For Answer's multiplayer is definitely diverse and varied Instead, any repairs to the robot and the sparing use of ammunition damage us, the cost of which is deducted from the total score at the end of the level. The missions fail primarily if the energy drops to zero, if we leave the combat area but also if a primary objective to defend is destroyed. By the way, it should be noted that in some missions it is not possible to soar simply because the level design does not allow it, drawing the vertical borders at too low a level. In these cases we find ourselves with the writing -game over- on the screen apparently without reason and justification, as the tutorial had only taught us to fly just a little earlier. Invisible boundaries exist, and are sometimes ill-justified with choices that perplex the player. Combat mech mechanic is a complicated trade The possibilities for customizing your combat mech are virtually endless. From the ACSIS menu (this is the name of the ~shop~) it is possible to assemble the first Armored Core from scratch using the primary pieces and available weapons. With the tune, the fine-tuning, every single specific function of the robot is improved and perfected, from the jump to the boost, from theuse of weapons at speed. Finally, an optimal center of gravity must be sought with the use of specific stabilizers to be applied to the armor. The more virtuosic can also decorate and color each single piece with the paint function, choosing from a very wide color palette and being able to edit and modify the battle logos to be applied. Through the shop you can sell or buy new pieces. The more virtuosic can also decorate and color each single piece with the paint function Combat mech mechanic is a complicated trade A special combat arena can also allow us to test and prove the functionality and destructiveness of the equipped weapons. The setup is articulated and deep, worthy of the best of strategic games: it is possible to adjust every single parameter of the robot. Leg weight capacity, weapon reload speed, energy capacity, flight time, shooting accuracy, enemy lock speed, on-board radar range, jump height, power of the rear or lateral boosts, the landing stability, are just some of the many parameters that can be perfected, improved and set to our liking. The mech that will face the final boss will be far more powerful and capable than the one initially chosen. Comment Fans of Japanese robots rejoice, Armored Core is back! This new chapter will keep you busy in front of the television for many hours, with a decidedly long story mode in hard mode, cooperative and ranked online matches. Answer is an offshoot of Armored Core 4, and is a title recommended above all to those who have already bought and appreciated this last chapter. It adds little new to the traditional ingredients of the series, offering a fluctuating audiovisual sector, with barely discreet graphics and excellent audio, both in music and in speech. Too bad for some problems in the control of mach and view. Pros Lots of single and multiplayer modes Deep mach editor Story, dialogues, mecha design Cons Some visual and design problems There are no substantial innovations Technically fluctuating Xbox 360 - Goals Armored Core for Answer offers the player the canonical 1000 points to unlock, but they will be conquered one by one with great effort. The game offers very little and to see the first results you have to complete all the missions of each level. At the final gameover we will see only 100 points unlocked: most of the objectives, to be obtained, require many online matches in ranked matches, trying to make the most kills. Next-gen with reservations From a graphic point of view, Armored Core for Answer shows more or less positive sides. The technical crisis that has been afflicting Japanese productions for some time now, forced to chase Westerners and their state-of-the-art 3D engines, is clearly evident. The title developed by the capable From Software enjoys an excellent design and a superb mecha design, as on the other hand it was legitimate to expect, but it is lacking from a purely polygonal point of view. The brute power of Xbox 360 and PS3 is not exploited in the slightest: the 3D buildings present in the game are well designed but decidedly few, some enormous, and in the background there is often a desert or an infinite sea. The title developed by the capable From Software enjoys an excellent design and a superb mecha design Next-gen with reservations Some effects are well done such as the smoke unleashed by the collapsing buildings, effective lights on the sky and on the water, or the boosts that are activated by blurring the scene due to the high speed of the robot. Other effects are decidedly bad, a legacy of last generation libraries such as explosions, really bad. The audio sector is instead excellent, with tight and well-characterized dialogues (in English), electronic music suitable for the context and various and well-sampled effects, the result of the experience invested by From Software in the series. The overall package, considering that this new chapter is not a real sequel, is decidedly full-bodied and attractive, given the numerous single-player missions, the many possibilities to play in multiplayer and a deep and satisfying editor.", "date": "2008-12-03", "grade": null}
