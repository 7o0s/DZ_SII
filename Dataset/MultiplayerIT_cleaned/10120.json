Ports of the first two episodes for PSP have also been recently produced and it is clear that, at this point, everyone saw Sony consoles as the new home of a series that had been somewhat nomadic so far. It was therefore a surprise two years ago to discover that Star Ocean: The Last Hope, the fourth and final chapter of the saga, would have been an Xbox 360 exclusive. Rumors of a possible port for PlayStation 3 have been insistent for months, but denied from time to time by Square Enix executives. ~We could bring it to PlayStation 3, we might not,~ producer Yoshinori Yamagishi once said, further frustrating a split audience eager to get their hands on such a prestigious next-generation JRPG. What's left of the Box Of course in the end Star Ocean: The Last Hope also arrived on PlayStation 3, otherwise this article would have no sense to exist. The announcement was almost a bolt from the blue, it was September 2009 when the Japanese magazine Famitsu revealed the existence of a PlayStation 3 version of Star Ocean: The Last Hope, scheduled almost simultaneously worldwide for February 2010. And not a simple port, but an International version. One of the main criticisms addressed to the western edition of Star Ocean: The Last Hope for Xbox 360 concerned the heavy retouching made to some elements of the interface such as, for example, the main menu, whose brightly colored background had been transformed into a sort of psychedelic computer-graphics, or the portraits of the characters close to the relative stats during the fights, artwork originally hand-drawn and rendered in simple and cold CG to favor an alleged ~Western taste~. On the contrary, the choice was not appreciated at all, and therefore the International version of the game allows you to choose the preferred visual style, but also to select one of five languages (including Italian) for the massive amount of text to read during the adventure. The possibility of changing the dubbing to the original Japanese is also very welcome: the choice of American voice actors was not exactly shrewd and due to the particularly oriental style of the game and the design, the Japanese voices of the characters remain decidedly more spot-on. The frame-rate of the PlayStation 3 version is also more stable and less prone to slowdowns in the most chaotic situations, and it is finally possible to change targets during battles by pressing the Start button. In addition to these major changes, the International version of Star Ocean: The Last Hope includes some changes to the placement and content of various treasures, the materials needed to produce some items and the balancing of the statistics of some characters (Reimi in particular). Finally, there are a few more Trophies and, needless to say, the game is contained on a single Bluray disc. Playstation 3 trophies Star Ocean: The Last Hope International offers 47 Trophies of which 1 Platinum, 2 Gold, 14 Silver and 30 Bronze. The Platinum Trophy can be obtained by conquering the other 46 Trophies, which in some cases require the simple overcoming of some stages of the game or the execution of particular actions in battle. Other Trophies require, for example, the completion of the adventure on various difficulty levels, the vision of all the optional endings or the destruction of specific enemies. To infinity and beyond At the narrative level, no changes have been made, for example there are no new characters or substantial additional content. The incipit is rather singular: the planet Earth is devastated by the third world war and human beings are forced to look to space. The two protagonists of the game are Edge Maverick and Reimi Saionji, part of a fleet sent to explore the galaxy in search of new habitable ecosystems. Soon, however, our heroes come across a cosmic threat that will force them to travel far and wide to eradicate it, assembling a diverse team of extraterrestrial adventurers determined to help them for more or less personal reasons. The story is therefore the same and as per the tradition of the series, it mixes fantasy and sci-fi elements in an epic adventure that begins slowly to mesh decisively after about twenty hours. The characters are all well characterized, even if they fall into the typical stereotypes of jap animationponese: the insecure protagonist who matures during the adventure, the childhood friend secretly in love, the comic figure, the antisocial supporting actor and so on. All in all, the cast turns out to be really pleasant and varied, deepened by excellent interaction. The narrative sequences mostly take place through long dialogue cutscenes: the pace of the jokes and of the script is a bit slow and one gets the impression that some sequences could have been told with more skill, perhaps due to the English voice actors not always up to par (in this sense the Japanese dubbing significantly improves the final result) or animations that are not particularly convincing. Even technically the differences compared to the original Xbox 360 version are not many, the frame-rate drops are actually very rare even in the most agitated situations or in the presence of particularly large monsters and the loadings are decidedly faster, on the other hand the annoying pop-up of textures and creatures that makes the exploration of the large and detailed areas of the game a little frustrating. The soundtrack has not undergone any changes: it remains excellent and appropriate in any situation. Solid as a Rock (Space) Star Ocean: The Last Hope perfectly marries the capabilities of the new generation consoles with a typical system of the most classic JRPGs, to the delight of those who have perhaps been burned by the inaction of this genre in more recent times. Tri-Ace has come up with a really convincing play structure that mixes the best that this genre has offered in the last ten years, starting with a practically perfect battle-system for those who love real-time action. After coming into contact with an enemy we will be transported to an arena where we will face a variable amount of opponents by directly controlling one of the members of our party, made up of four characters. As always, this episode of the series also allows you to unleash combinations of attacks and special blows or spells (called Symbols) on enemies, but in Star Ocean: The Last Hope some factors come into play that are decisive for the outcome of the battle. The first is the Blindside mechanism, through which with due timing the player can get around the enemy and hit him from behind: it's a rather difficult technique to master but it is essential to avoid enemy blows and return them with interest. A Bonus Board on the right side of the screen will fill up by increasing the experience points and the money we will receive at the end of the fight based on our performance, but one mistake is enough to eliminate the accumulated bonuses. In addition to Symbol and special attacks, the player can also take advantage of a sort of temporary increase in offensive and defensive skills, which also allows you to perform combined attacks between party members. The possibility of changing the controlled character on the fly, while the others are managed by Artificial Intelligence, in compliance with general indications set by the user, makes the combat system of Star Ocean: The Last Hope a highly enjoyable element of the gameplay, which breaks the exploration of the various locations, often very large and filled with simple puzzles to be solved in order to proceed towards the goal, is pleasantly enjoyable. From this point of view, the shortage of save points is a bit heavy, usually placed at long distances from each other. As a corollary to an already excellent combat system, there is also a rather intelligent character growth mechanism, which allows you to distribute the points earned by fighting to improve the skills of individual group members, and a well-studied crafting system that allows the production of consumable items and equipment of exceptional quality, to satisfy even the player who loves to dissect a title and isn't afraid to spend hours killing the same monsters to build the ultimate weapon for his heroes.", "date": "2010-03-24", "grade": "8.0"}
