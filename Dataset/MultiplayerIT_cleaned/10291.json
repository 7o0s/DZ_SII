{"name": "Natale rosso sangue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73227-bloodyxmas-natale-rosso-sangue.html", "text": "The jingle of ~Jingle Bells~ cheerfully resonates everywhere these days: on crowded streets, in shopping malls, even in the speakers of our trusty iPhone after we bought the bizarre BloodyXmas for 79 cents. Developed by Mad Finger Games, this action game puts us in the role of a big man dressed as Santa Claus who must at all costs defend five gifts from the clutches of a horde of gruesome and mischievous creatures. The game is set up as the most classic of ~survival~, so there is only one scenario while the variables relating to the number of enemies, their type and the weapons we can use to destroy them change. Literally. If there's one thing BloodyXmas doesn't miss, it's the color red; which is still one of the Christmas shades par excellence, but which in this case more than anything else refers to the liters and liters of blood that we will shed to fulfill our mission! Ho Ho Ho! The action doesn't take place within the confines of the screen, but scrolls in four directions according to our movements. The gifts are located exactly at the center of the scene, and it is there that all our opponents intending to take possession of them converge. When an enemy creature reaches one of the presents, it grabs it and tries to carry it away; we can therefore reach it and eliminate it so that its precious loot automatically returns to its place. The developers have not opted for a classic virtual d-pad, but for a pointing-based control system: we have to ~indicate~ our character in the direction we want him to move, and in the same way touch the enemies so that he appears on them a ~viewfinder~. Once hooked, they will be reached by our fury in a matter of moments: just enough time to reach them. There is no way to move faster than normal, so we need to do the math well if we want to prevent opponents from moving too far after they have taken possession of one of the gifts. At the edge of the scenario, green crates appear from time to time, whose position is indicated on the screen by special indicators. Walking on them means acquiring a new and powerful weapon for a few seconds, and the choice is quite vast: from giant hammers and chainsaws to small vehicles capable of wiping out dozens of little monsters in one shot. I'll party you! Despite the ~survival~ structure, BloodyXmas is equipped with a progression system that divides the waves by stage and which gradually confronts us with more demanding challenges both for the number of enemies and for their type: more resistant monsters appear, smarter and faster to deal with. The gifts basically constitute our ~energy bar~, in the sense that once stolen they cannot be recovered: when even the last of them is taken away, game over will be inevitable. The game is ~single~ as per tradition, it is not possible to continue it and our results will be stored and uploaded to the servers of the social network AGON to be able to compare them with friends, as well as with players around the world. The sound sector of the game consists of a ~remix~ of ~Jingle Bells~, as well as a series of sampled phrases, while the graphics make extensive use of cel shading to obtain a nice ~cartoon~ effect which, combined with the ultra-violence, generates a visual contrast of a certain impact. Animations and scrolling are smooth, and even in the busiest situations there is no lag or drop in frame rate. Excellent use of colors.
