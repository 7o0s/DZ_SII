{"name": "The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episodio 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-walking-dead-the-final-season-episodio-due-recensione.html", "text": "It seems incredible to find ourselves after a month talking about the second episode of the last season of Telltale's adaptation of The Walking Dead, and to be forced to do it with a sense of bitter awareness that it could be the last time, well before it would have been lawful to do so. In recent days, the bankruptcy of the Californian software house has engulfed the virtual pages of sector sites, amidst the inability of a studio to manage its own productions and hundreds of employees in a rage over a quick layoff and the lack of economic coverage that it has sprung up. Our work of judgment is thus clearly diminished, and one almost feels defective in having to speak of a work which is certainly less important than the human aspect we are experiencing, but it is what we are called to do. Therefore, setting aside the premises and ethics, what we found ourselves faced with is a classic ~in between~ episode, which adds little and takes nothing away from an excellent start, certainly the best of Telltale for several years now. The story of how I became a murderer The second episode of the season begins exactly where Clementine, Aj and the new protagonists of the orphanage left us last August. With an excellent directorial work, the flashback that tells the moments immediately following Marlon's assassination at the hands of AJ, showcases Telltale's great ability to manage an alternating narrative, almost totally eliminating the presence of player choices, to immerse us in the tragedy of the event and smack in the face the difficulty of a group of kids to analyze and understand actions and consequences. Just the first quarter of an hour represents the greatest peak of an episode that offers little else, if not a couple of rather interesting twists and turns and the return of an old acquaintance, managed well but perhaps a little too hastily. The collectibles are reduced, the environments are also reduced to the bone and the whole direction plays much more on narrow planes, rather than on the airiness of the orphanage that we appreciated in the first episode. Let me be clear, this does not in itself represent an error, but a precise stylistic choice to tell, in a couple of hours, how everything can change for better or for worse, thanks to a single action. On the other hand, these are teenagers forced to survive in a world in disarray, where the biggest threat is not represented by the monsters that have destroyed society, but by the people who want to assert their supremacy, where the state of nature has now got the upper hand. It is in this infinite whirlwind that the development of the relationship between Clementine and AJ continues, ever closer to what was the first season of the Telltale series and which now reaches the point of no return. It's difficult to make you understand exactly what we mean without anticipating some of the key events of the episode but, never like this time, it seemed to us that the Californian guys tried to condense a couple of episodes into a single one, ending up belittling somewhat the events that mark the passage of time and the change of location. By adding little-developed characters and keeping in mind the few more or less strong personalities we met last month. In this way it manages a certain ~highlander~ who almost does not want to decide to die, a boy with a seemingly pure heart and the return of a figure from Clementine's past that could prove to be the best choice in terms of screenplay. All this does not represent a problem in itself, but it is the transience of the events and the total openness of the episode to the future, which prevents us from making an informed judgment of the narrative turns that do not find any conclusion (least of all the amorous ones). To crown the feeling of being even more ~in the middle~ than it was already legitimate to expect, there is an undoubtedly more dull and less successful ending than that of the first episode, despite an extremely interesting and explosive situation on paper. Everything is therefore postponed to the next episode, assuming and not granted that Telltale manages to find a way to close a series that deserves to see its own conclusion, if only out of respect for the characters and for that audience who believed in them all the way. The gameplay that tries From a gameplay point of view, this second chapter tends to reduce the sections of narrative choice to the bone. Not as regards the quantity of actual multiple answers, but more for their incisiveness in drawing the personalities of the protagonists. Also chosen as the daughter of an intermediate nature of the narrative, Lost Children (this is the title of the epishate) disguises itself as a TV series, embellished with a few dull and uninspired moments of action. There's time for a couple of zombie carnage, including one by means of Marlon's bow, poorly thought out and worse executed, and also for a classic ~puzzle week~ style connect-the-dots game, but none of these portions of adventure serves to add tension, reminding again how Telltale is a development house that has only the narrative in mind, and that this season seems to make the star of inspiration shine again. The number of collectibles has been reduced to three and the exploration sections almost non-existent, with the consequent impossibility of extending the stock. A few secondary interactions and a few crossroads, for a couple of hours of an episode that continues to bode well for the (uncertain) future, but which stops exactly where we were a month ago.", "date": "2018-09-29", "grade": "7.5"}
