This is not an innovative title, but an experience that seems to intercept the good things done so far within the cover shooter genre, framing these well-tested mechanics in a tremendously rich structure, which includes not only a single-player campaign fairly long player and equipped with two different degrees of challenge (with related prizes), but also a competitive multiplayer, cooperative missions, special events, challenges and daily raids. In short, a lot to do, and in the meantime you have a lot of fun thanks to the solutions used by the development team to make the game more solid and exciting. We begin first of all with the concept of ~heroes~, now widely cleared in free-to-play productions: in this case there are about forty, to be unlocked using virtual currency or real money, but without constraints or obligations with respect to progression. This means, in simple terms, that despite the presence of the dreaded action energy indicator that consumes a few points with each mission, in Hero Hunters you won't get stuck irreparably if you don't want to spend money, or wait hours for it to be possible to play again. The only exception from this point of view is represented by grinding, which enters a bit straight leg when we try to face enemies of a higher level than ours, pushing us to complete a few extra missions in order to grow before retrying the challenge. Nothing excessive, in any case, nor annoying: in the end we are still talking about a freemium. You shoot over him As already mentioned, Hero Hunters is a solid and competent cover shooter, equipped with an almost perfect touch control system and non-original but undoubtedly well-tested mechanisms, with which it is therefore very easy to familiarize yourself. Formed a team with the available heroes, our task will initially be to complete the missions of the single player campaign, overcoming waves of enemies by exploiting the abilities of each character and his special maneuvers, with a view to a system that allows you to enhance each unit in various ways, often leaving the task of assigning the best perks to an automatic device. You move from one cover to another by swiping on the touch screen, while by touching the left and right side of the screen normally, you can respectively move the reticle and open fire, all in a very precise way. There are elements that manage the effectiveness or otherwise of the attacks, according to a chromatic wheel that sees certain colors prevail over the others, but it is possible to remedy any drawbacks by changing the character on the fly and attacking the same targets. The strategic component of the experience is very interesting and gives depth to a gameplay which, however, limits the duration of the missions a little too much to avoid problems. In any case, it is a real pleasure to play: switch from one hero to another, take cover from the special attacks of the many higher-level enemies that you meet along the way, use the specials as needed and score the last one, important blow of the match are moments that transmit great satisfaction, and that apparently never tire. Also thanks, as mentioned, to a rich and varied structure, which alternates single-player missions with competitive multiplayer, cooperative raids and other modes, to be unlocked as you level up. As if such a solid and convincing system weren't enough, Hero Hunters can count on an excellent technical realization, which takes a clear step forward compared to the previous Hothead Games projects in terms of graphic style, effects and animations: a a bit Overwatch, a bit Team Fortress 2, the characters on the roster move convincingly on the battlefield and make their way through well-differentiated scenarios, with destructible shelters and the ability to freely control the view. The icing on the cake is represented by the audio sector, made up of good effects and excellent music with a heroic, not surprisingly, attitude.", "date": "2018-02-08", "grade": "9.0"}
