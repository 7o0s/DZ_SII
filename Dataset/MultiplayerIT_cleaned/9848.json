If in fact with the excellent Super Laser the galaxy had been secured by a fierce solitary spaceship, in AirAttack we return to the earth of 70 years ago, engaged in the terrifying Second World War. Setting never too abused (or maybe yes), the last global conflict saw in the confrontation between the air forces of the Axis and the Allied ones epic clashes, battles to the death that entered the legend as well as the names of their protagonists. The British Royal Airforce, the powerful RAF feared by Hitler but nevertheless underestimated, according to many historians was the last bulwark which effectively prevented the Nazi Lutwaffe from complete domination over Europe; however, the hero of this adventure will be an American airman, who will have the task of defending the skies of our iPhones from the German menace. Steel Eagle Once the AirAttack campaign has started, you will find yourself catapulted into various war scenarios around the world, some inspired by real episodes of the Second World War (there are quotes from General Rommel, the ~Desert Fox~), others more imaginative, but still well contextualised. The fulcrum of the gameplay is obviously the killing of all the enemies that you will encounter, even if there are some welcome little innovations. First of all, the control system, modeled in an identical way on that of the aforementioned Super Laser and therefore definitely already excellent, is here, if possible, even more precise and punctual. As usual it will be possible to choose between two types of interactions with the touchscreen (a standard one with the finger behind the plane that moves it, another ~Relative~ i.e. with the plane following the finger depending on where you drag it ), a virtual stick and the accelerometer, with adjustable sensitivity. Fortunately, here too it will not be necessary to shoot incessantly with a special button, but the small fighter will fire automatically. Another novelty linked to the gameplay is the possibility of attacking not only aircraft at the same level but also armored vehicles, structures, bridges and even running trains by bombing them on the ground with a double tap. The reward for these acts of war will be given by extra points but above all by the progress towards unlocking the bonus weapons. In fact, alongside conventional weapons, such as the classic front cannons and the aforementioned surface bombs, there will be much more destructive war upgrades, which can be purchased at the beginning of each level from an air support station, the Shop, using the money obtained from the various missions. The available weapons are lightning, which shoots an electric ray from the tip of the plane for a few seconds, increasing the damage caused, the shield, which, on the contrary, will make the aircraft invulnerable for a while, transforming it into a weapon (in fact, with the shield active simple contact with enemies will cause severe damage), slow motion, i.e. a power up that will slow down the opponents for a few seconds but will maintain the normal maneuverability of the plane, allowing you to dodge shots more easily and finally the Super Bomb, a devastating bomb multiple selectable after destroying 100 buildings on the ground. From the shop it is then possible to purchase upgrades for the basic cannon (which in any case are also released by destroyed vehicles), extra lives and two small appendage planes to attach to the wings of the standard one, which add two fire mouths to the original ones. However, with each kill suffered, the aircraft will lose the upgrades obtained and can only rely on those eventually released by the downed vehicles. With 8 missions available (and as many final bosses), 58 different types of enemies (including the Zeppelins, the airships that catch fire when they are shot down, citing the end of the famous Hindenburg and the strange flying saucers, perhaps evocators of the activities mysterious and metaphysical that have always been associated with the National Socialist ideology) and three levels of difficulty, the longevity of AirAttack can undoubtedly be defined as acceptable, especially considering the very low price. However, it is the technical sector that makes this title a real masterpiece: the environment in which the air offensive takes place is in fact alive, well-finished and detailed to the max. To avoid framerate drops in previous generation devices, it is possible to select two different types of graphic settings, medium or high, but already with the simple basic quality the result is incredible, superior for this kind of titles to what has been seen up to now. The soundtrack, full of instrumental pieces, is epic and evocative, fully placed in a context of heroism, able to give the charge evenand to the simple player who guides an airplane with his finger. Too bad for some small neo, such as the impossibility of selecting the missions once the game is over and the lack of the now widespread achievements, perhaps usable in future updates or directly through the expected Apple Game Center.
