The Devil in Me is preparing to arrive on the market, the last chapter in chronological order of the Dark Pictures Anthology published by Bandai Namco . At the end of these three-year project and with an eye to the future of the brand, in the review of The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me we are ready to give you our opinion on this latest horror, halfway between innovation and the will to refine what has already been experienced previously. H. H. Holmes The Devil in Me: Items are essential in trying to advance The Devil in Me starts from one of the most interesting assumptions of the series. We apparently abandon the supernatural hues, put aside local legends and folklore and thus return to the dawn of the very concept of serial killer. In fact, the story of this new work by Supermassive began in 1892 during the celebrations for the exhibition organized four hundred years after the discovery of America. Right in the middle of the demonstration in Chicago, a certain Henry Howard Holmes committed a series of murders (there are said to be about two hundred confirmed victims), although he was then tried and sentenced to death for only a handful of these heinous gestures. This is the first American serial killer, at least documented, who has remained a staple of American stories and culture for more than a century, certainly more than he did here in the old continent. Nowadays a ramshackle crew on the verge of bankruptcy is invited by a mysterious wealthy man to visit and film the places where he reproduced Holmes' Castle of Horrors, thus being able to create a breathtaking show capable of giving breath to the whole production and its workers. During the (too many) hours necessary to complete the adventure, with a duration that can range from six to eight hours based on the difficulties encountered and the desire to discover as much as possible, the protagonists will find themselves in the middle of their worst nightmare, dealing with someone who not only wants to quote such an uncomfortable character, but also to emulate him. It is not the assumption that The Devil in Me lacks, but rather a whole narrative construction which, and we say it with great regret, leaks from all sides. The five protagonists - Charlie, Mark, Erin, Jamie and Kate - never really manage to win the hearts of the players, to the point that it is difficult to empathize with them and trying to save them proves only an exercise in cunning, rather than a real ~affection~ towards them. This aspect represents an important problem for a title that makes narration its primary constant. Even more this time having chosen to reduce the action scenes to the bone and in which to keep your reflexes ready, sipping the QTEs and focusing everything on exploration and search for objects and clues. The Devil in Me: the five protagonists are less characterized than we would have hoped The figure of Holmes fails to bear the weight of the entire adventure, partly due to the nature of pale imitation, partly because the rules of the slasher - an important film genre in which (usually) a murderer represents the main threat he hunts and kills the protagonists - have changed profoundly over the years; equally because exploration is an end in itself and the discovery of a series of documents without which history almost does not exist. Although narratively justified, this aspect would require a superfine writing and characterization effort, which however in this case is almost completely missing and which the slowness and the small amount of truly frightening moments only amplify in the negative. It is a pity to note that The Devil in Me he betrays right there where he could have made a difference compared to the past, without becoming an experience to throw away, but which hardly manages to keep the public's attention high. Old and new gameplay The Devil in Me: Holmes Castle reproduction is very remarkable Speaking of the purely playful aspect, The Devil in Me is certainly not surprising. Those who have had experience with the Supermassive anthological series know perfectly well how the formula remains substantially unchanged, however going from time to time to optimize the gameplay and implement some new mechanics. If House of Ashes had finally given the player ample room for maneuver and movement, here they opted for even greater freedom of exploration and for the search for a series of clues, codes and holes useful for continuing in one's escape from the Castello. In practice, this will translates into the spasmodic search for a solution to the subsequent logistical impasse, all in the frantic succession of scene changes and points of view within the impossible level design of the Castle. Whether it's director Charlie, sound engineer Erin, operator Mark, electrician Erin or the show's protagonist Kate, as always, everyone can be saved or killed, in classic Supermassive style. Unfortunately, from this point of view we have to point out some problems. The Devil in Me: Torture is the basis of the narrative Often, in the few really risky scenes present during the campaign, a single choice - more or less logical - will be enough to lead your character to an early death. It could almost make it seem like this aspect increases the degree of challenge and replayability, but sadly it ends up more to create frustration. We don't want to spoil any scenes of the game for you and for this reason we will keep the events to ourselves, but we are sure that when you face these situations you will understand our words better. Freedom of movement and slightly more open areas compared to previous chapters are there really liked them, even net of an animation and control system that defining anachronistic would be a compliment. But what just doesn't turn out right is the continuous search for elements to advance which in the end always result in the need to use one of the specific objects of the characters or to find a new one suitable for the purpose. So don't be fooled by the substantially higher duration than the other chapters, because in this case it is often an artificial longevity and which also tends to be frustrating in certain situations. The cut of The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me is always cinematic All this does not exclude the goodness of the project itself and the coherence with the entire Supermassive anthological series, which could therefore easily satisfy and excite the big fan. We simply would have liked the amalgam between the narrative and the gameplay to be better and that the confirmation of a sensible work to rejuvenate the mechanics was clearly perceived. We point out that as always there is no shortage of secrets, collectibles and premonitions, which have always been at the base of this saga and of all the work of the team. Technical ups and downs The Devil in Me: technical ups and downs, but the cutscenes are always pleasant to watch From a technical point of view The Devil in Me does not differ much from what we have already seen. The engine behaves well and some environments and situations, especially when the image is cleaned of dirt in real time, send the player an important job of rebuilding the castle and some really successful atmospheres. An important repetitiveness in the environments cannot be denied , daughter of the location and the structural limits of an adventure that still continues to prove substantially linear, albeit more open in exploration. Unfortunately, the highs of the final part of House of Ashes are not reached, and you will never find that artistic flash in The Devil in Me. As a note of color we can tell you that we have also had the opportunity to play part of the adventure on Steam Deck and, net of a few technical precautions and the preference in the fixed frame rate at 30fps, the game behaved more than well on this occasion too.", "date": "2022-11-17", "grade": "7.0"}
