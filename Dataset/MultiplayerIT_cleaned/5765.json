Interactive's Batman: Arkham Knight. The new package, the sixth in the Crime Fighter Challenge series, is the typical extra content that from the point of view of interest ideally positions itself somewhere between a decent add-on and an unnecessary addition. However, even if it does not expand the stories of Arkham through the events of some supporting actor of the Dark Knight or the superhero himself, nor does it offer who knows what wonders or experiences, it could have its own why in the eyes of the fans. Also known as the Community Challenge Pack, Crime Fighter Challenge Pack #6 includes seven new AR Challenge maps, including a special one. All the scenarios in the package are fan favorites on the official Warner Bros. forum and are taken from the three episodes made by Rocksteady Studios. The locations from the titles released on the older generation of consoles have been graphically remastered to make them ~suitable~ for the Batman: Arkham Knight engine. What is described, together with the Batman Incorporated skin, until now available exclusively through a code found in the first issue of the official Batman Arkham Knight comic, can be downloaded for free from January 19 on Steam, and from January 26 on PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE. In fact, the development team wanted to release it a week earlier on PC to partially forgive the problems encountered by users of this platform in the full game. The latest AR Challenges for Batman: Arkham Knight feature scenarios from past games Playstation 4 trophies There are seven trophies available thanks to this DLC. To get them you have to fulfill the requirements of each scenario, such as for example completing the Silent Knight AR Challenge with Batman and Robin unharmed, using only overwhelming KOs, or in Wayne Manor, doing it without taking damage and without the help of gadgets, and so on . Requiem for a scoundrel In the first of the three challenges dedicated to naked and raw combat, available as always by accessing the appropriate RA screen, users find themselves in the Monarch Theater, busy beating their hands on dozens of criminals. This scenario, taken from Batman: Arkham City and with a very fascinating visual impact in our opinion, offers the classic battle where the opponents arrive in waves that are increasingly better equipped and resistant to blows. It is therefore useless to add how the combination of attacks, gadgets and combos is essential to get rid of enemies. In the simulation ~Requiem for a Killer~ (Batman: Arkham City), Batman is with Nightwing in the Iceberg Lounge. Inside the famous Penguin nightclub, the hooded hero has to contend with dozens of thugs and a well-known criminal (who we are not revealing to avoid spoilers) who, however, only comes into play by getting a certain score by eliminating the members of the gang, in a challenge that leaves no room for hesitation, in the sense that the user is called to give his best in freeflow combat to stay alive and well. The Caped Crusader is also the protagonist of the third challenge, located in an area of Gotham City certainly not dear to him, Crime Alley: it is in fact the one where Joe Chill killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. In any case, the objective of this mission is again to resist as long as possible the horde of enemies that follow one another on the screen and which become increasingly difficult to eliminate, also thanks to the presence of intermediate bosses and armed soldiers all the way. There are also three predator maps in the package: with ~What did the butler see~ (Batman: Arkham City) the gamer enters Villa Wayne in the role of the Bat Man to defend it in the shadows from the intrusion of his enemies. The action, which takes place under the monitoring of a stopwatch after having eliminated the first opponent, takes place mainly in the entrance area of the mansion, but this does not deprive the gamer of strategic points where to cling or corners where to hide so as not to be discovered during its movements and attacks. The clash remains quite tactical even in ~The secret of the Batcave~ (Batman: Arkham City), which as the title suggests takes place inside the lair of the Gotham superhero. The ~scheme~ of the game, if we can define it that way, is to position oneself in strategic points on the map and then silently take out all the opponents who patrol the area without being discovered by the others still around. THE In this sense, a particularly useful ally turns out to be the Batcave, with its spikes, handholds and areas suspended over nothing. Fascinating, given also the setting, reveals ~Silent night, night of death~ (Batman: Arkham Asylum),challenge that takes place inside the garrison in Arkham Asylum. The scenario takes up the theme of ~ambushes~, of hit and run attacks hidden in the shadows and on two floors, inviting the player to focus on quick and painless stealth action, but always keeping time in mind: the faster you are, the more points you get in the end. The last challenge in the DLC is ~Eternal Knight~: the scenario is well known, the one near Gotham station seen in Arkham Knight and other RAs. This time, however, the challenge is more complex, as you have to get rid of the Militia members patrolling the area within five minutes, trying to take out at least twenty of them to get the three stars. However, it is possible to gain additional time by eliminating the guards (twenty-five seconds at a time). At this point, summing up, we can safely conclude by saying that the Crime Fighter Challenge Pack n. 6 was quite interesting, not so much for the structure of the various challenges themselves, not dissimilar in this sense from the others already seen up to now, but rather for the medium-high level of difficulty, the settings and for the presence of Trophies, a couple of which are not as easy to take as it might seem at first glance. If we then consider that this time it's all free, our advice is to download it to take a leap back into the Batman: Arkham Knight universe.", "date": "2016-01-20", "grade": null}
