It is one of the first titles produced by Yu Suzuki, and in many ways it mixes the elements of the previous Space Harrier and OutRun to insert them in a context, that of the fights between fighter planes, brought to the fore the year before by the film ~Top Gun~. Converted for all systems of the time, After Burner was so successful that it pushed the developers to create a sequel after just a few months. In 2006, as part of a re-edition of the SEGA classics which also led to the release of the excellent OutRun 2006, After Burner was redesigned for a new distribution in arcades; and on PlayStation Network, just one year after OutRun Online Arcade, at the price of 9.99 euros here comes After Burner Climax in all the splendor of high definition graphics, with three selectable planes and the usual ~crossroads~ path that allows us to choose the scenario we prefer for our relentless air battles. Grab the Dual Shock and start the engines: we're about to take off. Fast and furious Once the game has started, the game allows us to choose our aircraft from three models: F-14D Super Tomcat (which replaces the legendary F14 Tomcat present in the original arcade), F/A-18E Super Hornet and F- 15E Strike Eagle, with the possibility of selecting the livery we prefer for each of the four available. Then it takes off: a terrorist organization has acquired the necessary components for a nuclear attack, and we must absolutely prevent it from being carried out. Our aircraft is equipped with a powerful machine gun for short-range attacks, as well as a homing missile array for more distant targets. Moving the aircraft, using the left analog stick, also means moving the crosshair in front of it, determining whether or not to hit an enemy. When we frame a target, even if only for an instant, it is automatically hooked by the aiming system and we can therefore launch one or more missiles to try to destroy it. The main buttons of the Dual Shock are used to operate the machine gun and the missiles: the former has infinite ammunition by default, the latter must be ~reloaded~ over time to prevent unscrupulous use. In any case, each stage is dedicated to speed and entertainment, with explosions that follow one another very quickly while we make a clean sweep of the enemy army trying, in the meantime, to avoid the many shots that are fired at us. In some situations, the gameplay is enriched by the presence of alternative missions (see the destruction of particular targets, or allied aircraft that must be protected) which give the game a minimum of variety and allow us to score a higher score at the end of the ~race~ . In this regard, it must be admitted that the After Burner Climax experience, despite its intensity, is presented in a form that is far too short to be fully appreciated: it is possible to complete the stage sequence in just over ten minutes, leaving all the weight of the longevity of the product on the replayability and on the EX Options, which once unlocked can make the games more or less easy. Too little, given the presence of only one mode. Playstation 3 trophies After Burner Climax includes a total of twelve trophies (eight silver, three bronze, and one gold) which can be unlocked by completing all stages, racking up fifty-hit combos, beating the game with each of the three planes, and achieving grade A in all internships. Climax! The novelties compared to the original After Burner, as well as obviously in the technical realization, are inherent in the gameplay and in particular take the form of the Climax bar, which fills up over time but above all when we eliminate enemies. Once full, it allows us to slow down time for a few moments and have an increased viewfinder, i.e. able to lock on to targets much more easily. Different from the classic ~smart bomb~, the Climax Mode should be used in the most crowded situations but does not guarantee the thinning of the enemy ranks by itself, however relying on our ability to hit a large number of planes in rapid succession. Our aircraft is not limited in its movements as in the past, and in fact turning suddenly from left to right and vice versa results in a spectacular evasive maneuver, which can get us out of trouble if missiles are arriving. Avoid enemy fireHowever, co is not such a simple matter, indeed in some cases it becomes truly an impossible undertaking and we can only resign ourselves to the loss of one of the three ~lives~ available. In short, the game is short but not too easy, and in this situation the inclusion of only three ~continues~ appears more than justified. As far as graphics and sound are concerned, a really great job has been done: the first is very fast, clean and spectacular, with some really evocative backgrounds and an excellent use of colours; the second can count on two selectable soundtracks (Climax or After Burner II) and effects of moderate impact, perfectly suited to the situation.", "date": "2010-06-14", "grade": "7.8"}
