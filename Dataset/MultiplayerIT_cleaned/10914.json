{"name": "FlatOut Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout-racing.html", "text": "Console and PC owners know it well: FlatOut means spectacular races, catastrophic accidents, impacts with everything on the edge of the track and challenges to the sound of the bank with your opponents to be able to cross the finish line first. The series has amazed and fascinated many people, and its latest incarnation (FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage), available for Xbox 360 and PSP, has ferried the franchise in the best way towards the new generation systems. The mechanics that regulate the game are simple: you have to prove that you are the best driver not only through brilliant driving, which takes into account the best trajectories as well as any shortcuts present on a certain route, but also and above all by exploiting accidents and collisions to your advantage. In fact, every time our vehicle collides with another or destroys barriers, windows and various objects, we will see the ~boost~ bar go up, which will allow us to get the cue necessary to carry out that last overtaking before the finish . In its 3D version for mobile, FlatOut has shown that it fears no one in terms of substance (with a large number of races and vehicles), but suffers from a series of technical limitations that have in fact distorted the gameplay: collisions were present and as usual they acted as an ~aid~ for the player, but the design of the circuits rewarded speed decidedly little in favor of a better approach in the corners. It is sad to note that the presence of numerous hairpin bends was due more to a technical issue (basically it was a subterfuge to avoid a heavy pop-up effect of the scenario) than to a real will of the developers. Will the 2D version fix the problem? Well, let's say it comes with a profoundly different approach, therefore difficult to compare: we will find ourselves driving our car in a two-dimensional context with a three-quarter view from above and a control system related to the vehicle. The dimensions of the cars (really tiny) allow us to come to terms with the maneuvers quickly enough, so we won't have major problems managing our vehicle and launching ourselves fearlessly in pursuit of our opponents. Once again, the collisions will help us to collect a certain amount of nitro, to ~shoot~ in the straights to carry out burning overtaking, with the wheels leaving a trail due to the sudden power supplied by the engine. However, even in this case the design of the circuits does not represent the strong point of the title developed by Xendex, given the small size of each track. However, the numbers of the version with polygonal graphics remain, so we will be able to really participate in a large number of races and get behind the wheel of vehicles with different characteristics, such as the ground conditions will be different, capable of producing plausible reactions. Technically, the game moves between ups and downs: on the one hand the vehicles, despite their extremely small dimensions, move in a convincing way and don't skimp on touches of class (skids, progressive damage, etc.), in an environment rich enough in interactable elements that yet never give up a certain fluidity; on the other hand, the limited extension of the tracks and the repetitiveness of the scenarios significantly reduce the global impact. The controls are precise and you can manage your car immediately and finally without problems. PRO Immediate and fun A large number of races Nice graphics...
