And this despite the more or less forced abandonment in some cases of the Stamford federation by athletes of the caliber of Batista, Jericho, Jeff Hardy and Shawn Michaels. In short, the sport-entertainment par excellence still appears to be in good health, as demonstrated by the data relating to the sales of DVDs, gadgets and themed video games. Precisely within this boundless world of merchandising, the series of games developed by the Yuke's team and published by THQ, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, which over time has been able to take on the features of any sports simulation that arrives at the appointment with fans year after year, bringing with it a wealth of new features and improvements, together with the usual addition of names and extras. And that's what WWE SmackDown looks like! vs. Raw 2011, a title that continues the path taken by the previous episodes of the series and combines all the options already present in the past with some interesting ways to try to repeat the success of its illustrious predecessor. But let's see what these novelties are and what those unpublished elements on which we will focus more in this article. The WWE universe WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2011 offers a respectable roster with about 70 athletes including Superstars, Divas and Legends equally divided among the stars of the various WWE categories. For Smackdown are available among others the World Heavyweight Champion, Kane, who in recent days has successfully defended the title at Bragging Rights against the great The Undertaker, also present like the various Dolph Zigglers, the new Drew McIntyre and Luke Gallows, and many others, while Randy Orton, Melina, Sheamus, David Hart Smith, Tyson Kidd, and even the ex Shawn Michaels and Batista are reported for Raw. Some wrestlers, such as Chris Masters, David Otunga of the Nexus or Layla, and several ring legends such as Lex Luger will then arrive in the form of DLC in the coming weeks, ditto Bret Hart, which is currently only available in the USA for those who have pre -Ordered the game in a well-known local distribution chain using a bonus code that serves to unlock it. To this plethora of fighters who already in themselves guarantee many variations and great longevity to the product, we add the possibility of creating many others from scratch using the usual powerful editor, customizing practically everything, from moves to entrances, from cutscenes to rivalries and friendships, and an infinite number of game modes divided into many sub-sessions in turn rich in options and content. Among these the most important of all, which is also the most consistent novelty of this year, is the new mode called WWE Universe. It is basically the combination between that Career and that Exhibition, which means that each match, regardless of the type of challenge chosen, will influence the development of the game itself by generating, in relation to what is combined in the ring, alliances or rivalries which could then lead to sudden surprise ambushes during subsequent encounters. In this way you have the feeling of being part of a real world, where friendships between athletes are formed and broken, the characters change their attitude from face to heel, belts pass from hand to hand. Road to WrestleMania But let's see how WWE Universe works in detail. In this session the user is called to play a practically infinite season that can last for the entire competitive existence of the champion he has chosen to impersonate, full of appointments linked to a calendar of events generated by the game itself, related to Raw, SmackDown , Superstars and various pay per view shows. Everything is also planned in relation to the ranking of the aforementioned athlete and his rivalries: in short, the more important the wrestler is, the more commitments the card has. If you decide to start from scratch with perhaps a customized fighter, the apprenticeship will obviously be much longer than normal. The various options of the mode in question and the statistics are visible in a special menu at the top left, i.e. which matches are scheduled for the evening or in the next few days (and in which the user can take part by siding with an athlete of his choice or by simulating the challenge), the complete program of the shows for the coming months, which however also appear at the bottom of the screen, the rankings of the federations concerning the various fighters, the news from the backstage with the related caseswhich, as mentioned above, gradually come to manifest themselves (quarrels, aggressions, alliances), or access My WWE. Mode instead simply renewed is that relating to Wrestlemania. In fact, this year, the session was no longer conceived as a simple Story Mode relating to some characters of the federation, but almost a game in itself with free-roaming elements. Before the matches it is possible to wander around the backstage in the role of the various Cena, Mysterio, Jericho, Christian or Undertaker talking to other superstars, trying to cultivate alliances or to hit opponents treacherously to gain some advantage in view of the challenge in the ring. Xbox 360 goals There are only 39 achievements to unlock in WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2011. They are distributed in both offline and online modes. Most are obtained with the progression in the various modes, especially in Road to Wrestlemania or Universe, others instead by satisfying some requirements required by the game in the ring or simply by carrying out some task, such as for example the upload of one or more contents created for each category in Community Creations. The ring Once you get on the square and start fighting, you immediately notice that the WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2011 refers in a very marked way to that of its predecessor, and perhaps it could not have been otherwise given the genre. However, there are some significant improvements here and there, starting with the grappling system which has been slightly simplified in terms of accuracy. To execute them, simply press the right analog stick of the pad in one of the four indicated cross directions. Depending on the movement and in some cases the pressure of the lever itself, it is then possible to perform different grip variations, overturning the opponent and crushing, as well as some submission maneuvers. It is undeniable how much all this gives greater physicality to the challenges. Sin on the other hand for the excessive ease with which with the simple pressure of the appropriate RT key (or R2 in the case of PlayStation 3) we are able to free ourselves from the grip of the opponent. This defect has been maintained since last year. Even the management of the combos, which involves pressing the same button several times to start a succession of moves, has been further simplified, which makes it easier to execute even the most spectacular moves, making the THQ title immediate and enjoyable even for newcomers to the genre. However, this does not mean that winning matches is very simple, but only that there is greater control over the athletes: the various characters are identical to their real counterparts and appear in the way of fighting better diversified than in the recent past as if the CPU were more consider the benchmarks for each of them so that they actually impact the way wrestlers wrestle. Furthermore, their artificial intelligence is quite good and, in principle, it will always be quite difficult to pin an opponent athlete. Thanks to the excellent use of the now famous Havok engine which guarantees extremely accurate dynamic physics in the game, complete with deformation effects of the environment where the clashes take place and greater interaction with the objects present therein, there is greater variability in meetings and greater realism. Just think of the improper use that can be made of the remains of a table that has just been crushed or of the damage that a fall from the top rope directly onto the steel steps at ringside can cause. Web In recent years, the online component has assumed an increasingly important role in the field of video game productions. Today, creating a product without this option, provided it is valid, means for a software house that the interest of a good portion of the public will be reduced. Well WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2011 in this sense not only proposes the same characteristics as last year, but also renews here by presenting an important novelty: for the first time in the history of this franchise it is possible to participate in any type of meeting on the web. Ladder matches, Six-man tag matches and even the Royal Rumble, with up to 12 contenders battling it out for the title. In reality, only six athletes can enter the ring at the same time, with the other six enjoying the show while waiting for the gong and their turn. But anyhow, it's a great addition. Not to mention that you can always share your creations with other users on the internet for fun file sharing. It should be noted that to use the online it is necessary to activate the Axxess service using the code found inside the game package (so be careful if you buy the game used), and that the unpleasant lag did registerdraw last year from our trials in this regard should be just a memory. Although it is advisable to evaluate the servers when they will be fully functional. As for the technical sector and the graphics in particular, here too we are witnessing a general improvement compared to the previous title, which in itself was not bad in this regard, with the athletes reproduced perfectly in every detail, from the faces to the physiques , from moles to skin imperfections, tattoos, sweat, with an attention to detail that culminates with the system of physical damage: when a part of the body receives too many blows, it is possible to see the signs on the skin of the athletes left, with localized redness or cuts. The animations are also excellent, perfectly recreated in every detail, including spectacular moves and less wooden than usual. The story is different for the public and for the secondary backstage scenarios, which appear poorer especially when compared to the main ones. The judgment on the sound sector was positive, in line with the excellent general quality of the game, with music, audio effects and dubbing, by the real wrestlers themselves, of sure impact. The much-vaunted commentary, on the other hand, is reduced to some sporadic and not very engaging comments on the most salient phases of the match by the dynamic duo of official WWE commentators. In short, the pyrotechnic choreographies, the shot changes and the sound accompaniment contribute to creating the right atmosphere and are the ideal introduction to the match.", "date": "2010-11-01", "grade": "8.0"}
