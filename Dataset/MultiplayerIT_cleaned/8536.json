Like the one offered by Swordigo, the new action platform developed by Touch Foo for iOS devices and inspired by classics such as The Legend of Zelda (which clearly mentions, even with some sound effects). The plot of the game begins precisely with the tragic disappearance of the master, who we find dying in the middle of the forest but has time to warn us of the impending danger, which immediately manifests itself behind us and attacks us, making us lose our senses . Upon awakening, our character finds himself in the village and is summoned by the old man, who tells him about a magical sword that could give him the power to defeat the forces of evil. At this point, a search begins that will lead us to cross scenarios full of pitfalls and enemies to face, the elimination of which translates into gaining experience and therefore enhancing skills. Furthermore, as we explore the map, we come across portals that act as checkpoints and allow us, if we wish, to quickly return to the village to use the collected crystals and buy new weapons, new armor and new bonus items. Noble of heart, pure of thoughts The control system of Swordigo, based exclusively on the touch screen, has a rather simple command layout: on the left side of the screen there are two arrows instead of a virtual d-pad, on the right side there are instead the buttons for jumping, strike with sword and use magic. The latter can be selected from four powers that we will acquire during the adventure, and which allow us not only to face certain opponents from a distance and / or more effectively, but also to interact with the scenario in new ways, destroying doors and walls that perhaps hide precious objects. The second spell that we will come into possession, for example, allows us to create light bombs that explode once thrown or deposited, and which can break ~fake~ floors or other background elements. Platforming mechanics are prevalent in the gameplay, with jumps and double jumps that must be used to avoid spikes and chasms, or to dodge the attack of enemies. The excessive proximity of the buttons on the right side of the touch screen sometimes creates some difficulties, and it is fortunate that in the face of a sudden game over, the game simply reacts by taking away some energy but allowing us to continue from where we were, returning us to 'last checkpoint only if we completely deplete the health bar. The fights are simplistic, considering the number of actions available, but quite challenging: hitting bats and flying threats is not easy, especially if you have to do it while jumping over a cliff, and the boss fights move up and down, with opposite trivial situations to other more interesting ones. Swordigo unfortunately falls on the technical front: although very fluid and fairly varied in the chromatic choices, the graphics are really ugly to look at, while fortunately the sound is pleasant. Nothing to say, however, about the body of the experience, which requires a few hours to complete and therefore can entertain us for a long time.", "date": "2012-05-17", "grade": "8.2"}
