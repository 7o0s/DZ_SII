{"name": "Warhammer 40.000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-soulstorm-recensione.html", "text": "The news As with the previous expansion, Soulstorm was born as a stand-alone add-on, which means that it will not be necessary to have the base game to be able to install (and play) it, at the only price of being able to use all nine game races only during the course of the game of the new campaign to be faced in single player mode and not during multiplayer games. In this regard, it should also be said that although there is a semblance of a tutorial capable of describing all the main aspects of the game, the medium difficulty and the very structure of the new scenarios appear immediately conceived and designed for veterans of the series. Furthermore, by installing Soulstorm together with all the other pieces of the series, you will find yourself in front of a real RTS blockbuster. Soulstorm brings a new campaign to the table, two new playable rockets and, for the first time in the history of the franchise, the introduction of aerial vehicles (one different for each race). For a level playing field the guys from Iron Lore, under the supervision of Relic, have seen fit to introduce a race for each faction: the Sisterhood and the Dark Eldar. Using the former, you will find yourself commanding an alternative version of the Space Marines, with a series of girls thirsty for blood and justice able to exploit the Faith instilled in their ranks to perform miracles. The Dark Eldar instead, will be satisfied with the souls of fallen enemies to give life to powerful and dark artefacts and curses. All these additions, on balance, however, fail to radically change the style of play of the previous chapters, quite the contrary. The flying vehicles themselves are reduced to being simple additional units capable of crossing any type of terrain and little else without introducing any added strategic value. Back to the origins The development of the campaign revolves around the Kaurava system and the need for each of the nine races to conquer it in order to then discover the causes that gave birth to a powerful space-time anomaly. Just like in Dark Crusade, Soulstorm abandons the development of a linear campaign told through various cutscenes of the basic title (and given the technical implementation of the introduction, we assure you that we have not missed much) to embrace the concept of meta-campaign. From certain points of view, we therefore return to the roots of the genre and, just like in Westwood's Dune II, the player will find himself in front of a map with different regions to conquer. Each region corresponds to a battle for control of the aforementioned and, if successful, the conquest of new requisition points that can be spent to purchase buildings or to hire special elite units. The use of this mode seems to accentuate the developers' desire to shape the game more for true hardcore fans of the series - and of the RTS genre - than for casual players. From a technical point of view, the title certainly fails to amaze: the graphics engine is clearly still the original one without any particular evolution, yet even if we are far from the scenographic impact offered by titles such as Company of Heroes - just to stay at Relic - audio, graphics and above all the quality of the animations still manage to recreate on our screens that grim and gore sense that has always characterized the stylistic imprint of the Warhammer 40,000 saga. Considering the almost four years behind him, it's still an excellent result. Comment Of the three expansions released for Dawn of War, Soulstorm is perhaps the least successful. Not so much because of its fault, but because it fails to renew and introduce new elements to the same extent as its predecessors. Despite this, all lovers of the genre, of the series and of Warhammer 40,000 in general will be able to find bread for their teeth, both in single player and in multiplayer, for many, many hours. For everyone else, despite the standalone nature of this expansion, we recommend starting with the main titles first. It's not an ending with a bang, but a worthy conclusion nonetheless.
