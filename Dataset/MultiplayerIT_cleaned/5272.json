With these succulent premises, the wait for the debut on Windows 10 has become even more exhausting, just to the desire to be able to get your hands on a work so valuable and enhanced by the technical possibilities that only a good gaming PC can offer. Unfortunately, our enthusiasm first of all had to collide with the Microsoft store, which due to continuous errors, unexplained restarts (from scratch) in the download process and the totally busted download bar, made us trash rivers of GigaBytes, among other things, forcing us to keep the PC on for dozens and dozens of consecutive hours. Unacceptable in 2016 and for an IT giant. Luckily, after a store update and using a cumbersome procedure, we were able to successfully install the 49 GigaBytes of data onto our SSD; an important step to return to the splendid Australia, but not the last, since the Playground games title requires painstaking adjustment of the graphic settings and some extraordinary interventions, necessary to circumvent some instability phenomena while waiting for the developers to intervene with a patches. Despite the adversities encountered, we can already anticipate that with our test configuration it was still worth it. Forza Horizon 3 on PC is a feast for the eyes, but requires sacrifices and a lot of power land of conquest Before launching into the technical analysis of the PC version, we believe it necessary to dedicate a paragraph to the online component of the game, which we could only touch on in our review for various reasons, fundamentally related to the difficulty of meeting other players in the days prior to its debut on the market. for Xbox One. The most interesting novelty lies in the cooperative campaign for up to a maximum of four players, with whom to share progress within the Festival Horizon. Usable both with the classic matchmaking and through the creation of a private game by inviting your friends, it is a mode that gives its best just by playing with known people, being a harbinger of many laughs but also a more ~intimate~ test bench where to showcase your talent, both on the track and as a designer, nurturing a healthy sense of challenge among the participants. In short, fun is always guaranteed, and for the first time, thanks to the Play Anywhere program and cross-play, it is also possible to share it between those who own different platforms. The main multiplayer mode is the so-called Online Adventure, a sort of open session where players, up to a maximum of twelve, are invited to participate in mini-championships of four events (called PE since they are based on the experience points accumulated by driving with style and speed) that follow each other without stopping. Among the peculiar characteristics of the online adventure there is the need to move around the map between one race and another to reach the venue of the new event; a challenge within the challenge which, in addition to allowing the conquest of additional XP for the final ranking, enhances the free roaming component of the Playground games title. At the end of each championship, the next series is voted on, which can include simple ~circuit~ races, point-to-point cross country, asphalt sprints and the hilarious arenas, made up of three specific alternative modes. In King and Infection, already popular in the past, players are committed to seeking or avoiding (depending on their status) contact with others, in order to get the highest score. The new ~Snatch the Flag~, as the name suggests, is all about collecting colored flags and taking them to the appropriate home base to rack up points. The flags can be stolen from the other contenders with a simple contact or collected in the points where they appear; this makes the new mode particularly intriguing and strategic, to the full advantage of the fun. The netcode is solid and stable as in the previous chapters of the series, and in the vast majority of cases there are no latency problems and in the search for sessions, which are always well populated. We close this paragraph with a nod on the gameplay, for which you can of course refer to the review for Xbox One. With our trusted Thrustmaster TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, officially supported by the game,we noticed a different arrangement of some commands compared to console use, it should also be emphasized the impossibility of setting the keys manually, a questionable choice especially for those who use other steering wheels. However, the release of an update that resolves the issue is conceivable. Beautiful and impossible Despite the stuttering problems encountered by some, the debut of ForzaTech (the graphics engine used by Turn 10 and Playground games) on PC with Forza Motorsport 6: Apex was very positive, boding well for Forza Horizon 3 and future chapters of the series . Although in our case we managed to obtain an overall enjoyable experience, it should however be emphasized that the days dedicated to the early access of the Ultimate Edition were particularly hot for Ralph Fulton's team, between reports of more or less important bugs and above all problems related to fluidity, caused by unexplained drops in frames - even on very high-end systems - and intrusive stuttering. Forza Horizon 3, as you can read from the box below, is an extremely demanding title in terms of hardware resources, and the minimum requirements must be taken very seriously, especially in terms of CPU and memory; in fact, it is one of the most RAM and VRAM voracious games ever. While respecting the required specifications, however, you are not immune to Forza Horizon 3 optimization problems, independent of the power of the system owned and the resolutions adopted. Ending up in the dock is mainly CPU mismanagement, where the first core is pushed to the limit while the others are poorly engaged; a situation that has already occurred with other titles. The file encryption system, the peculiar display of Windows 10 applications and the MSAA anti-aliasing filter have been indicated among the various culprits of the instability, but even the connected peripherals have ended up in the sights of some users, as well as GeForce Experience and Game Xbox Live App DVR. To eliminate the stuttering, it was sufficient for us to uninstall and reinstall the dedicated 372.90 drivers; others instead have improved their situation by intervening in the Task manager on the Forza Horizon 3 process or on the Nvidia panel dedicated to the video card. Beyond the results obtained, even excellent in some cases, the need for a patch is still evident. The game offers a wealth of basic and advanced graphics options, including the ability to opt for a dynamic setting (similar to Forza Motorsport 6: Apex) that levels the various voices to adapt them to the system in use. Among the basic options, beyond the inevitable resolution and vertical synchronization, we find the frame freeze (30 or 60) and the quality of the aforementioned dynamic optimization, as well as a mysterious ~frame rate leveling~ which does not seem to have any effect on fluidity . Among the numerous advanced options we have the classic anisotropic filter, the MSAA antialiasing filter (up to 8x) and the quality of reflections, textures, shadows and polygonal complexity, the latter divided into static, dynamic and ~World Car~. In short, a very rich dish. With our test system, equipped with an i7 and a 1070 from GigaByte, we were able to play 4K at thirty frames per second (nailed down) with all voices set to ultra and the MSAA filter maxed out. The result is simply extraordinary for the clarity and depth of the image, thanks to the magnificent work done by the British team's graphics. To aim for the sixty frames per second we went down to 2K resolution with dynamic settings, and while hitting them in most circumstances, there are some slowdowns especially in the urban complex of Surfers Paradise. These drops are also present by setting the 1080p and working fine on the individual graphic options, a symptom of the aforementioned optimization problems, which however, once the stuttering has been avoided, do not make the Playground games unplayable at all. The hope, of course, is that of a rapid and effective intervention by the developers. From a purely visual point of view, the title is already superb on Xbox One, and on PC what makes the difference is above all the possibility of adopting high resolutions, which make the Australian landscapes even more brilliant and defined. During our tests, the worst flaw we encountered lies in a very annoying lag while consulting the upgrade shop, with the image freezing for up to two seconds. Luckily several bugs such as not having access to VIP bonuses and Ultimate Edition pack cars have been fixed before dthe official launch, but other fixes are also expected for those who have experienced crashes and problems with some peripherals, in addition to the highly anticipated ones on the optimization front.", "date": "2016-09-28", "grade": "8.8"}
