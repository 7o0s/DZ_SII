To avoid doing like last year, with an instantaneous and destructive list of the defects of the game, let's try to be more coherent and orderly, starting from what FIFA offers, word for word, in this 2003 edition, also because there will be surprises. After an installation lasting approximately one glaciation we are preparing to launch the game. We start with the presentation of FIFA 2003 and the usual long, boring and obligatory fixed screens to remind us of copyright and licenses. Now, I understand the gratitude that there can be towards these companies that have provided names and crests, but something could have been thought of that would provide a little more entertainment. However, these screens are followed by the introductory animation, this time totally focused on the testimonials of the game: Edgar Davids, Roberto Carlos and Ryan Giggs. The footage, lasting around 20 seconds, shows Davids fiddling with the ball as Roberto Carlos headers a ball and Giggs frowns. An indescribable squalor. The game menus Amazed by this very uninviting start, a menu with 80s graphics opens (to be clear, graphics in the 80s weren't at their current levels), with four main options and a small list of items at the bottom. The first of these options allows you to play a friendly match or a ~Club Championship~ tournament: this ~Club Championship~ is the touch of class of FIFA 2003: take 18 teams among the best Europeans and equip it with personalized chants, official stadium and ad hoc audio commentary. Dedicating a menu only to these clubs, with the impossibility of adding or replacing others, is an idea that makes you think. The intent is clear: to give any player a group of reference teams to have fun with, a bit like the teams of various American sports: few but well done. And these teams, their stadium, their chants and audio commentary are beautifully detailed. The problem is the recipients of this brilliant idea. For example, the (many) fans of Milan, a team with no small reputation, will be disappointed not to see the Rossoneri among the elite clubs of European football. And I'm almost convinced that a Rossoneri fan or any fan of a team not on the Club Championship list will prefer to participate in other tournaments with his own line-up, totally ignoring this game mode. Another option is the classic Friendly match: you can choose a team you want among the over 350 present, club or national, and challenge another (or even the same, why not?). Also inevitable is the Tournaments option, which features various game modes and above all the option for the Championship: 5 consecutive championships possible with the support of national and possibly international cups in case of high positions in the standings. Finally, Multiplayer is also present this year: long uploads and prevailing lag will not favor this mode, but over the years it is slowly improving and I assume a year or two of waiting for something truly functional and well done. Before the game The decision to remove league or group information from the main screen of each match makes one puff. Now, instead of the league standings or tournament brackets, there are team crests. I would like to know what use such a screen could have... And so we have to go to another menu, inside which there is an option to view all the ~boards~ as well as to take a peek at the calendar, to the performance of their players (shooting and cards, nothing more), to team management (formation, tactics, shooters and a primitive transfer market), to the audio-graphic options up to an ambiguous ~Showcase of uniforms~, in which they will be able to see the jerseys of the various teams. Having looked at everything, however, it is necessary to go back to the crests screen again to continue towards the start of the game. Before loading, another thing catches the eye: in the preparation of any match there is the possibility of choosing which shirt your own team and the opposing team will wear. The reason for this option is not known: perhaps because in FIFA 2002 sometimes questionable color combinations occurred (I still remember a Bologna - Cagliari with red and blue kits for one team and red and purple for the other...) or ( and more probably) because, having some teams with three uniforms, the user can have the possibility to choose the favourite,as well as the most suitable for the challenge (for example Roma have a red kit at home, white away from home and the splendid yellow-red which in reality they only use for European matches). The choice lengthens the journey towards the start of the game, but over time it becomes a habit of little annoyance. In the case of friendlies, you can choose a stadium from the many available and once you have chosen the controller to use, the match will begin. Introduction In FIFA 2002 Bologna were the only Serie A team without a realistic kit and crest. The first thing I did when I saw FIFA 2003 at the Adriatic Lan Party in Cattolica was to verify the quality of Bologna in this new edition. Well, not only is the Felsinea team still without a crest and with an unrealistic shirt, but also Udinese and Turin are accompanying them in the same conditions. And Reggina thanks for the name of its team: ~Reggio Calabria~.", "date": "2003-01-03", "grade": null}
