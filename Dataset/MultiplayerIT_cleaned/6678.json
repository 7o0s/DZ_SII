{"name": "Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-recensione.html", "text": "DLC, as it has evolved today, has a considerable weight in the economy of a video game, expanding its scope and boundaries, sometimes proving to be as important in terms of production values as the original content that preceded it. This applies to all sorts of work, except perhaps for racing games, which in most cases are updated with car packs and new tracks, nothing too demanding when compared with broader expansions typical of other genres. This can be true for many automotive titles, but not for those of the Forza Horizon series, which thanks to their open world nature have received splendid additions over the years, capable of subverting the characteristics of the base game in an often very original way. After appearing in some chapters of the series, the Hot Wheels brand has recently returned to the mirrors of the automotive saga signed by Playground Games with an expansion that promises to make us melt the engine, between a parabolic curve and a loop the loop. Put on the helmet and delivered the last will to the notary, we launched into the exploration of all the contents of this DLC, eager to be able to tell you about it in our review of Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels. Will the expansion have managed to repeat the quality of the one that appeared in the third installment of the series? Neverland An example of the complexity of circuits As had already happened in the iteration set in Australia, the Hot Wheels DLC of Forza Horizon 5 once again puts us at the wheel of some of the most famous toy cars produced by Mattel, in a totally new setting suspended in the skies of Mexico. Here the Horizon Festival has built a boundless flying island divided into three main sections, dedicated to the Mexican biomes explored in the original game: one is wrapped in a dense rainforest, another develops between the slopes of an imposing snow-capped volcano while the The last takes us between the peaks of a desert mountainous area. The three areas are connected by a very intricate tangle of orange tracks, those made famous by the Hot Wheels brand, on which more than 15 races are run which manage not to seem monotonous even after several hours of play thanks to the strong presence of parabolic curves, laps of death and sections of track with special effects such as frozen or magnetic ones. The track design of the tracks is something that is difficult to compare with any other racing game on the market, as can be guessed from the very first moments of the expansion, when our adventure in the clouds of Mexico began with a short but intense introduction which led us by the hand to discover the most adrenaline-pumping sections of the map. In principle, the purpose of the DLC is to get us to the rank of Legend at the peak of a climb involving the beauty of five different skill ranks, each dedicated to a specific class of car. It starts with the Bs, and only after completing enough races and unlocking enough missions, do you then have the points necessary to continue towards the A-class, S1, S2 and X-class cars. There is so much to do The tracks are littered with crazy stunts If in the expansion the driving model continues to settle on that classic compromise of the series, attributable under the denomination of ~sim-cade~, while the climb towards the rank of Legend will instead be able to really put you to the test, since in order to accumulate progress the game will not only ask you to win all the races in which you participate and to submit to a systematic completionism of the other activities on the map, but also to satisfy very specific and sometimes particularly complex objectives. From a mere numerical point of view, the contents of the Hot Wheels DLC will be able to keep you busy for a good handful of hours, even if the races equipped with unique mechanics have not been as many as we imagined. There is a racing series that tells the story of the Hot Weels brand from the 1960s to the present, but other than these activities and the introduction of the expansion, there is a lack of races that offer a consistent variation on the theme. The rainforest biome is undoubtedly the most inspired The number of Hot Wheels cars, then, could have been considerably greater, even if the care with which the toy cars have been transposed into the game simply leaves you speechless. There are 10 cars taken from the models, and among these we find historical toy cars such as the Rip Rod, the Deora II and the legendary Bone Shaker, but also some more modern proposals such as the edgy Bad to the Blade, the fascinating cover car of thethe expansion. They are obtained progressively during the DLC arc, and are extraordinarily faithful to their miniature counterparts, to the point that we happened to play driving a massive monster truck only to find it identical in all respects in the home of the site of Hot Wheels.Once you have completed your ascent to the rank of Legend and obtained all the cars included in the expansion, you may find yourself only at the beginning of the experience offered by Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels. The fifth chapter of the series developed by Playground Games includes a full-bodied track editor, which is now enriched with all the characteristic elements of the Hot Wheels tracks. With the addition of the orange track pieces, the possibilities are now nearly endless for players, and we can't wait to see what crazy stunts the Forza Horizon community comes up with.", "date": "2022-07-24", "grade": "8.5"}
