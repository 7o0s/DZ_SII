{"name": "The Yakuza Remastered Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-yakuza-remastered-collection-recensione.html", "text": "The wait was long, but here we are now: The Yakuza Remastered Collection is available on PC and Xbox One, purchasable at the price of 39.99 euros or downloadable at no additional cost by Xbox Game Pass subscribers. which includes the remasters of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5, and which therefore allows you to resume the long saga of Kazuma Kiryu exactly where the owners of the Microsoft platforms had interrupted it, at the end of Yakuza Kiwami 2. Yakuza 3 Back at the Okinawa orphanage, Kazuma Kiryu leads a quiet life with his boys, until he discovers that the land on which the facility stands has ended up at the center of a dispute between politicians and businessmen. This is the narrative incipit of Yakuza 3, which naturally does not disappoint on the plot front, at the cost, however, of enduring decidedly dated rhythms and structural solutions. The entire initial part of the campaign is in fact dotted with trivial quests in which you have to interact with practically everyone the available characters, after having identified them within the scenario, in order to unlock a given situation. Unfortunately the fights in this case liven up the gameplay only relatively, as the game feels the full weight of its years: it originally came out in 2009. The fact of happening between two generations of consoles, PS2 and PS3, has inevitably limited the technical ambitions of this chapter and the remastering work has improved things only in a vague way, increasing resolution and frame rate, replacing specific textures too grainy but leaving the polygonal models of the characters and their ancient animations intact. Even in terms of the scenarios, there isn't much to say: we know the Kamurocho structure well, but in Yakuza 3 the streets of the fictitious neighborhood are too empty and lifeless, with passersby appearing suddenly with an annoying effect pop-ups. The additional Okinawa setting sadly doesn't improve matters, being quite small in size. Yakuza 4 A milestone episode for the SEGA franchise, Yakuza 4 was the first to introduce new playable protagonists besides Kazuma Kiryu, three to be exact: Shun Akiyama, who we see in the early stages of the campaign and who runs a mysterious financial agency, lending large sums of money but only to people he deems worthy; Taiga Saejima, the legendary killer friend of Goro Majima, who ended up in prison after killing members of a rival family; and Masayoshi Tanimura, a young dutiful policeman. However, the novelties are not limited to the cast, but embrace the game in its entirety, which abandons the technical and structural limitations of the previous chapter to introduce much more pressing rhythms and a solid combat system , made varied thanks to the different characters and the different moves that can be unlocked through the traditional upgrades. The setting in the case of Yakuza 4 is limited to the scenario of Kamurocho, which however appears substantially improved compared to Yakuza 3: many more passers-by, a pop-up still present but greatly reduced, more sophisticated effects to enhance the various surfaces. Several animations leave something to be desired, but the remaster gives some sequences a surprising charm. Here too the story is very beautiful, engaging and well narrated: net of some questionable and excessively ~do-good~ solutions, the characters are excellently characterized, the subquests are plentiful and so are the side activities. In short, if the third episode is a complicated recovery, the fourth will make you reconcile with the saga. Yakuza 5 Arrived in the West three years after the Japanese publication, Yakuza 5 represented in many ways the first step in the relaunch of the franchise in the USA and Europe. It was also the last chapter released on PS3, and thinking about it today, the level of attention to detail and the amount of content that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio was able to put into the project is incredible.As in Yakuza 4, here too the characters playable are different: in addition to Kazuma Kiryu we will be able to control Shun Akiyama, Taiga Saejima, the new entry Tetsuo Shinada and the young Haruka Sawamura, who in this game we will see striving to become a successful idol, grappling with a large amount of minigames based on music and choreography, but also with the most disturbing aspects of the Japanese entertainment world. However, the settings also multiply, as many as five: the inevitable Kamurocho in Tokyo, the return of Sotenbori in Osaka, the Nagasugai district in Fukuoka, that of Kineicho in Nagoya and the Tsukimino district in Sapporo. Likewise, the side quests, increasingly insane, and the acts increasecollateral vities with which we will be able to entertain ourselves during the exploration, including the SEGA Clubs with the possibility of playing with Virtua Fighter 2 and Taiko no Tetsujin. Despite some elements that already appeared rather dated at launch, in particular the car sections on the ring road and certain animations, we are faced with an extraordinarily full-bodied chapter, full of atmosphere and new locations, which thanks to the remastering are able to give very suggestive moments and glimpses. Xbox One goals There are respectively 50, 48 and 57 achievements that can be unlocked in the remasters of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5. In all cases, these are achievements linked on the one hand to the simple completion of the chapters of the campaign, on the other to everything that it revolves around: subquests, side activities, spending in shops and restaurants, upgrading characters and miles traveled exploring the scenarios. Technical realization, Xbox One VS PC As written at the beginning, The Yakuza Remastered Collection, in its entirety or in the individual episodes that compose it, can be downloaded at no additional cost by Xbox Game Pass subscribers, both on Xbox One and on PC. On the Microsoft console all three games run at 60fps, although it's not clear what resolution was used (it may be that some compromises were made for Yakuza 5). 3 and Yakuza 4 is quite evident, but the loads are fast and, in general, the conversion appears well done. Obviously, however, on PC it is a completely different thing: the graphic adjustments are not very many (in the case of the fifth chapter there is also an option for dynamic resolution), but with an RTX 3070 we obviously had no problems running all at 4K and 60 fps very stable with the Ultra preset.", "date": "2021-01-30", "grade": "7.5"}
