{"name": "Concrete Genie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/concrete-genie-recensione-esclusiva-ps4.html", "text": "Since its announcement, Concrete Genie has been able to fascinate the public with a magical, special aura, capable of conveying the idea of the authors with an almost disarming simplicity. In our review of Concrete Genie we confirm this feeling and indeed we reiterate how the latter never wanted to be a title with great ambitions, despite its magical simplicity that has led it to be one of the exclusive PlayStation 4 of this 2019. The small team of Pixelopus has created a unique journey through the suffering of a sick and ruined city, depicting the painful and tortuous path of escape and revenge from the oppression of bullying. Concrete Genie is not a title for everyone: it's a game that takes its gameplay time, focusing on a short and evanescent plot to leave room for the imagination and the intimacy of the moment. The flaws that the title carries with it are there, evident to all, as if to indicate that perfection doesn't have to be an obsession. Storytelling and art direction Concrete Genie immerses you in the city of Denska, a small urban agglomeration whose port and hydroelectric plant are the only two points of great interest, if we exclude the old lighthouse facing the coast. The city is now desolate, inhabited only by the evil that has made it unlivable and decadent: graffiti and vandalism distinguish the walls of the houses and structures of the town. Yet Ash, a young boy bullied and abused by the same vandals who disfigure the city, still believes in the hidden beauty of Denska. Through a journey made up of imagination and paintings, Ash will try to transport the colors from his notebook onto the walls of the metropolis, making us understand that imagination and dreams are sometimes the greatest medicine for the soul. Taking off the clothes imbued with the sentimentality proposed by the title and wearing those much colder than the objectivity required by this article, we must see how Concrete Genie offers very little concrete in terms of narrative. The story that forms the background to the title is only hinted at, hinted at, implied and relegated to a few small and sparse newspaper clippings here and there around the city. The potential of a more substantial study, through some more dialogue or some major interlude scenes would certainly not have been superfluous. Much of the focus is left on the relationship between Ash and the Geniuses he paints but also in this case, seeking a more visual rather than narrative emphasis. In contrast to the narrative choices, however, there are artistic and visual ones. The glance of Concrete Genie is certainly effective, more for the personality than for an actual graphic excellence. Always reminding us of the size of the development team, what we are offered is a truly incredibly magical title from this point of view. The two faces of Denska: the gloomy and bleak one wrapped in darkness, and the radiant and full of life created by the player's paintings, oppose each other in a balanced set of sensations. The visual imagery proposed by the title pushes the player to delve into what Denska seems to want to offer, only to unfortunately not always be able to satisfy the player's desire. The graphic style, the color palettes used for the different states of the city, are all small precautions that make the title extremely beautiful to play. The characterization of the paintings that can be made and the Geniuses that can be created add an extra quid to the artistic level of the game. Even in terms of sound, the title tries to immerse the player completely, however occasionally stumbling over some choice that does not always seem to be suitable for the moment proposed on the screen. On the other hand, we give a mention of merit to the dubbing (also present in Italian) given the quality proposed in relation to the number of speech sections present in-game. The gameplay and painting Continuing the examination of the title, it remains to analyze the gameplay. Concrete Genie wants to stimulate the player's imagination and to do so it limits the feasible gameplay choices by reducing the executable actions to the bone: in fact, there are only the jump and an interaction key in addition to the brush to use. The title alternates sections of painting with the pad (two drawing methods, one with the motion sensors and the other with the right analog stick) with others of city exploration and environmental puzzles. The difficulty is minimal and the puzzles require more careful exploration of the area than strong intuitive skills. So if on the one hand we have painting that thanks to a simple and intuitive system will satisfy even those who don't have ~Giotto's hand~, on the other hand there are exploration sections that probablymind they will not satisfy those who hoped for a more marked playful component. Concrete Genie is a journey into the magic of the imagination and as such minimizes any action section. The threat of bullies, always present at Ash's heels, are an example of this choice: if you were to be spotted by these vandals you will have to start over from the last save, the problem is that being seen is almost impossible since the title provides you with the possibility through the pressure of a button to attract them towards you, in order to use this ability when you are on the roofs to distract them and free the passage. Last note of gameplay are the collectibles, few, but still present to lengthen longevity. In the scarce ten hours that you will need to finish the title, you can easily recover all the collectibles, which demonstrates how experience is really more important than any other game situation.", "date": "2019-10-08", "grade": "7.3"}
