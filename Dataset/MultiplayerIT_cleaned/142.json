{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids_a.html", "text": "In spite of the convoluted technological creations that they field (bizarre flying machines and dangerous robots built in their image and likeness, up to the menacing final fortress full of dangers that you will have to conquer) the wicked rodents do not seem to be very smart and they will look quite dazed every time you defeat them. This brief plot conceals the most classic of Rayman's round and pacifying platform titles: within the eight game levels we find a wide range of special moves, combos and objects with which our darling interacts with unsuspected familiarity, making the most of every key of the mobile phone, in particular the use of the 5 key changes according to the context and passes from the simple punch, to the mega-punch, to the weapon in your possession up to a more unscrupulous use of the rings by Jury Chechi. Gameloft's graphics didn't spare themselves and the animations are both accurate and extremely varied in all the characters, the sound instead is composed only of effects apart from the initial jingles of each scene and the presence of a continuous background motif would not have clashed . RRR pays homage to the frenetic and fast-paced branch of platform games with nods from both classic and lesser-known titles (from the ~wheels of death~ to the evolutions around the pole), the first six levels literally roll by in a flash with lots of fun sequences, in fact automatic, in which we can leave the joypad except to reserve the toughest and most demanding challenge for the last two where the action becomes slower and more demanding and you will have to calibrate the precision of your moves to the pixel or you will pay with death premature consequences. I would have preferred a more homogeneous difficulty curve rather than compensating with infinite ~Continues~, perhaps checkpoints would have been the ideal solution, especially in the two final screens. PRO Rayman makes them in all colors AGAINST Unbalanced difficulty curve You will finish it soon", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
