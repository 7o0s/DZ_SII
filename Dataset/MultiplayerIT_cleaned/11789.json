If the world of cinema and that of television series are probably the most fond of the period that began in 1920, it must be said that throughout their history, even video games have not remained insensitive to the underworld charm of the gangsters of the last century. Among the many titles set in the American underworld, today has come the turn of City of Gangsters, a game not to be confused with the older Omerta: City of Gangsters released in 2013. The product we are talking about now comes in the guise of a strategic 4X and was developed by SomaSim, to arrive on Steam in these days. At this point, however, let's not waste any more time and let's see how it was for us to make our way to the sound of alcohol by becoming the new Baron Birra in the City of Gangsters review. Setting In City of Gangsters we will have to decide where to take root Before starting to play, City of Gangsters allows us to choose which city in America to move our steps among those available to us. In addition to the inevitable Chicago, land conquered by Al Capone, our choice can also fall on Detroit or Pittsburgh. The difference consists in the first place in the size of the map (Detroit is the largest), accompanied by the different ethnic groups present in the urban agglomeration, with which to deal with to develop our business. All three cases start in the same way, placing us in dressed as a youngster who has just arrived in the city to be hosted by a relative, who will immediately instruct him on how things are and route him towards the production and illegal sale of alcoholic beverages. This phase is entrusted to the tutorial, which we naturally advise you to select and tackle carefully before jumping headlong into creating your own criminal empire. In fact, the time to walk alone arrives anyway, but it is better to face it prepared (even if the aforementioned tutorial is a bit rough in the end). Once you understand how things stand, City of Gangsters shows itself as a title where the component management (and partly also the role-playing one, given the presence of simple dialogues and distinctive features of the characters) in creating one's own criminal network has the upper hand compared to naked and raw violence. Dealing with issues related to gangsters and illegal activities sooner or later the time will undoubtedly come to let the guns talk, but it is a last resort to resort to only if it is absolutely necessary, having failed with all possible alternatives. So if the possibility of unleashing any bloody wars for control of the territory is what made you approach City of Gangsters after reading its name, you might be disappointed. Gameplay One of the City of Gangsters game menus The game dynamics of City of Gangsters take place in the classic way through a series of rounds, thanks to which the player earns movement points and action points. The former can be spent to move around the city, a fundamental element for the growth of one's business considering that at the start we only know the four buildings that make up the small neighborhood where we are. Everything else is shrouded in a fog of war, which prevents us from seeing where the other businesses that could do business with us are located. Speaking of business, since these are illegal businesses, we certainly shouldn't expect to be able to do everything in the light of the Sun. In fact, we need to find places that are willing to cover our shady deals, for example by building a distillery in the back of a laundry, gaining the trust of those who manage the front business. Once our beer (or other) has been produced, we will then have to go and sell it to merchants who also trust us. To increase people's willingness towards us, it is possible to use the system of favors, ingratiating ourselves with the characters controlled by the CPU arriving, for example, to be introduced to a third person with whom to start the sale of alcohol or other material. A snowy landscape in City of Gangsters Considering the genre to which City of Gangsters belongs, even in SomaSim's effort there are many variables at play. The impression one gets after a while, however, is that some of these variables have been taken more into consideration than others, thus making that extra pinch of variety that would certainly not have hurt over time. Where the developers' work concentrated, City of Gangsters wasIt works quite well: creating your own ingredient sourcing and sales network and seeing it grow and operate at full capacity is undoubtedly satisfying. The same cannot be said, for example, of relations with the police: rather than a danger to be managed effectively to avoid problems for one's business, the presence of the authorities is in fact experienced by the player as a tedious activity to be managed from time to time. much. Generally speaking, there's nothing money can't buy, so by the time you do end up with a lot of it, the road will be quite smooth, thus missing the thrill that should belong to lawbreakers. Graphics and sound A gameplay screenshot from City of Gangsters As a strategic-simulator which it is, for City of Gangsters the goal is to make available to the player as much information in the least number of clicks as possible. From this point of view we can say that the interface developed by SomaSim succeeds quite well in its intent, offering contextual information every time we open a detail file. There is also a general encyclopedia, which we can refer to for further information any unclear topics. The aspect of the interface where instead something more could have been done is instead the one that leads us to discover new activities as we explore and make the fog of war disappear, forcing the player to go manually by clicking to reveal the commercial establishments present. In City of Gangsters it is necessary to build a dense network of contacts From a purely graphic point of view, City of Gangsters presents itself without infamy or praise. The representative style is in fact quite minimal and makes the various neighborhoods a little too similar to each other especially when the zoom level is increased. The soundtrack does its duty in the background, to take us back a hundred years ago. One last note regarding the Italian translation, unfortunately not present: considering the amount of texts present in the game, chewing a little English is undoubtedly necessary to be able to play City of Gangsters with full knowledge of the facts.", "date": "2021-08-16", "grade": "6.2"}
