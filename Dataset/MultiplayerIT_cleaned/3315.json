It is therefore our job to start the Football Manager 2020 Touch review by warning you about the effects this game could have on you: on the train or by bus, at your uncles' house or at the mall, nothing can stop you from playing a game and then another and another, traveling the road to the Olympus of football even when you are away from home and from your PC. A dream that for all virtual coaches has already come true for a few years, that is, since Miles Jacobson and his crew decided to create the Touch version of the football manager, which arrived this year as well as on the same PC (for the benefit of those wants to try a slightly faster experience than the full edition) also on tablets and Nintendo Switch. It is precisely this last console that we have chosen to deal with Football Manager 2020 Touch: here are our conclusions after a week of play. What's new: like the big brother Even if Football Manager 2020 Touch offers more accessible dynamics than the complete edition, the choice of Sports Interactive was still to keep the heart of the complete game intact, starting with the innovations introduced within it. Those who have read the Football Manager 2020 review will therefore already know perfectly what awaits them in the Touch version, starting with the addition of the corporate vision as a parameter for evaluation by the management. Once a team has been chosen, one is no longer evaluated only on the basis of the results obtained, because each club has its own yardstick which, for example, can make the composition of a youth team weigh more or the management of accounts beyond out of red. These objectives vary with the passing of the seasons, therefore making planning necessary. The addition of a code of ethics in the locker room is also particularly welcome, thanks to which any sanctions for expulsions and disqualifications can be established together with the players themselves. In fact, the introduction of this element eliminates the negative way in which players reacted in the past in the event of a fine, making us desist from making decisions of this type to avoid creating bad feelings in the locker room. From Football Manager 2020, the Touch version also inherits the new Development Center, dedicated to the evolution of loan players, plus some elements related to negotiating with individual players. As a year ago, the most evident absence compared to the full version is instead represented by the complete renunciation of interviews and interactions with the media, as well as with the players in the speeches before, during and after the game. If in Football Manager 2020 we would have liked to see something more evolved than the usual dynamics, we believe that in the Touch edition the presence of multiple answers would do its job well. It is probable that Sports Interactive has decided to eliminate this type of mechanic to give more rhythm to the game, associating it with the possibility of totally simulating a game, thus displaying its result immediately without taking the field. Graphics and performance - necessary compromises In the passage of the platform from PC to Nintendo Switch it is clear that the developers have had to compromise with some elements of the game, dictated both by the reduced power of the console and by its portable characteristics. The first limitation can be seen right from the creation of the game, when we are only allowed to choose three championships among the many present. If your favorite pastime is to scout for talent between Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, while keeping an eye on all the European leagues, in the Touch version you will find yourself a little more limited in your choices. The interface is completely similar to that of the PC version of the game, with respect to which Football Manager 2020 Touch on Nintendo Switch can make use of the additional controls offered by the two joy-cons. In particular, the latter offer important shortcuts to continue in the game, thus limiting the need to simulate the movement of the mouse pointer with the blue controller stick. The combined system requires an initial training phase but works quite well, certainly better than the touch support which is sometimes a little less precise than one would expect. Perhaps the fault of the different information present on what is a small screen like that of Nintendo Switch. The same goes for the graphics engine, although it is possible to note some progresstto a year ago. In particular, Football Manager 2020 Touch now allows you to watch the match even with different shots, while continuing to suffer in terms of performance. While it is true that the net slowdowns found in the 2019 version are no longer present, when there is a match in progress the game is tangibly affected in terms of fluidity. Some reservations also on the loads that are made before taking the field, a bit slow.", "date": "2019-12-18", "grade": "7.8"}
