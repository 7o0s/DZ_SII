You have to learn it right away and understand that you should never go beyond your limits, because these ancient rocks, cracked by ice and submerged in snow, don't care about our fate. This is as true in real life as it is in Insurmountable, the new rogue-like survival adventure from ByteRockers' Games. Has this fight against the cold, weather and nature been able to convince us? Find out in our Insurmountable review. Three mountains for three climbers What exactly is Insurmountable? ByteRockers' Games' game is a strategic rogue-like adventure that asks us to climb three mountains in a row, with one of three climbers. Our expert characters differ in their initial equipment (which includes items such as a tent for sleeping, gloves for warmth, food supplies...) and skills. Each of them has its own characterization and a reason that drives them to climb, but these are only a few narrative lines that kick off the game and which you will soon ignore. Insurmountable is in fact a game based completely on the gameplay: there is no plot or lore to explore, but only three mountains to climb one after the other. Obviously, each mount is increasingly complex, precisely due to a series of modifiers that add bonuses and penalties to give a little variety to each new game. We're talking about things like ~more cold accumulation during storms~, ~less energy consumption on snow~, ~more experience gained in events~ and so on. Insurmountable is a layered game and there are multiple elements to consider in order to complete your journey. Each character has various stats. We start with the life points, which if reset cause a Game Over and consequent loss of any progress. Then there is mental health, which drops regularly while climbing or performing certain actions. Energy is also very important, which is consumed with each movement. Don't forget to keep your body temperature under control and, once you've exceeded a certain altitude, your oxygen too. If one of these values reaches zero, you enter a critical state and events are triggered at regular intervals that cause you to lose life points. Insurmountable: The map is divided into squares As mentioned, the most important indicator is energy. Insurmountable is a box game. Each mountain is a set of hexagons and our task will be to create a path by moving from one square to another, moving on a flat surface or climbing. Each movement consumes energy, especially when changing height. The greater the height difference between two hexes, the greater the energy consumption. The game tells us how much energy we would consume, so we can decide whether or not it is worth continuing in a certain direction. Then there are different types of terrain that affect the difficulty of moving. The game allows us to create very long paths, but it's always better to move a few squares at a time to get a clearer view of what's in front of you. Insurmountable offers a view from above, but it is deliberately limited and uncomfortable (sometimes too uncomfortable), so as not to allow us to have a complete view of our surroundings. In addition, the game offers a night-day cycle and weather conditions (such as a snowstorm or strong winds) that decrease visibility and increase penalties (a snowstorm lowers body temperature much more than normal, for example). Insurmountable: to move we create paths between the boxes To counter the pitfalls of the mountain we will have to use a series of objects. We will be able to equip boots, gloves or an ice ax, for example, which will decrease energy consumption, body heat and so on. Then there will be disposable items such as food supplies or oxygen cylinders. To these are added passive skills (which have a continuous effect) or active (which require a recharge after use). Objects can be obtained through ~events~, i.e. boxes on which there are icons. Events always reward us with experience points: at each level up we will be able to choose a new skill. Each event also allows you to spend some time, energy, mental health, oxygen or body heat in exchange for a reward (items or regenerating effects), which will never be certain. As a rogue-like, Insurmountable indeed includes a random component that can easily put a spanner in our wheels. Insurmountable - a typical event of the game And here we run into Insurmountable's first big problem: randomness. As said, we speak of a rogue-like, but the mountains have the same structure to eachgame: a new map is not generated every time, but the events are simply placed in a partially random way (many squares are fixed). The differences are really minimal, so there's little reason to play the game over and over again. Even the events are very few and after two games you will have seen practically all of them. So you shouldn't think of Insurmountable as a true rogue-like, but only as an adventure with permadeath that, once completed, you will most likely put aside. We should actually say ~if~ you can complete it. Unfortunately Insurmountable handled the difficulty level poorly. In fact, the game first of all offers a ~normal~ level and, once you have completed a complete climb with a character, the ~hard~ level is activated, which in turn can unlock a third level of difficulty. However, ~Normal~ is very (very) simple and with a minimum of attention you can complete the entire game without ever activating a critical state or really being in danger. Insurmountable: the game intent ~Difficult~, on the other hand, turns the climb into hell. The penalties are brutal and completing even just the first mountain is really complex and not because much more strategy or planning is required. Randomness could easily prevent us from getting resources and would leave us with no chance of survival. In one game, for example, we reached the top of the mountain without oxygen and died shortly after because since the beginning of the climb we have not found a single event that gave us the possibility of obtaining oxygen tanks, almost the only way to catch your breath (literally). Rogue-likes, by their very nature, have ~unlucky matches~, but if the victory is linked more to luck than to skill, something has gone wrong. Also consider that Insurmountable is a very slow game, even increasing the speed of the character animations. The first mountain easily takes an hour and all three mountains added together take up to four hours. The pace itself is slow and we can often play for minutes without doing anything in particular except watching the character move and clicking the mouse a couple of times to complete an event that we've gone through over and over again. You understand well that being defeated because the game doesn't give us the tools to play leaves us with a bad taste in our mouth and the feeling of having wasted one or more hours. In addition to unlocking the next level of difficulty, Insurmountable also gives no prize for victory, other than a score. There is therefore no advancement or way to simplify subsequent games. Furthermore, the characters are not that different: on balance, only a single skill changes, which does not revolutionize the gameplay. Insurmountable: Events give experience and rewards Insurmountable is therefore a game with various problems. At least, it manages to recreate a feeling of inferiority towards the mountain. Seeing it from below is impactful and every step really seems like a complex undertaking. Looking back at the end of the climb, on the other hand, gives a feeling of vertigo and completeness that not even AAA games are able to give. Unfortunately, even these satisfactions will quickly diminish after a few games. Furthermore, the graphics don't help: they do their job but certainly don't strike the eye. Even in terms of sound there is little to comment, with just a few effects and a couple of adequate but forgettable background music.", "date": "2021-05-02", "grade": "5.8"}
