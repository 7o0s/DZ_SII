{"name": "King Arthur: Knight's Tale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/king-arthur-knights-tale-recensione.html", "text": "Do you remember the Italian acronym of the old anime dedicated to King Arthur? We are talking about Entaku no Kishi monogatari - Moero s, better known in our area as ~King Arthur's sword~. Surely if you are old and on the waning avenue like us, you will have encountered it in your compulsive bouts of television zapping, when in your childhood you lay abandoned in front of what at the time we considered a magic box. ~There is a great castle in the county of Camelot, with a thousand and more squires in the service of a great King, of blue blood... King Arthur... All the knights of the Round Table were corrupt bastards and murderers, who committed atrocity pa pa ra pa...~ Wasn't that so? Yet to introduce the review of King Arthur: Knight's Tale this is the most appropriate version. History Bad Arthur, good Mordred... who would have thought. Developed by NeoCore Games, the creators of Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Prophecy and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series, King Arthur: Knight's Tale tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in its own way, turning the tables completely: Arthur and his archenemy Sir Mordred end up eliminating each other on the battlefield. The problem is that Arthur, the noble, wise, generous King Arthur, has been reborn as a dark creature that threatens Camelot and the whole world, for reasons that are explained during the game, and the Lady of the Lake has the brilliant idea of using Sir Mordred to stop him, bringing him back to life as well. Thus the black knight finds himself reigning over Camelot and over a host of reluctant knights somewhat weakened by events, who do not trust at all those who once faced them and killed them on the battlefield. Our hero must choose in spite of himself: abandon the path of evil, to become an enlightened ruler, dedicated to the good and the sacred, capable of attracting all the scattered knights of the Round Table to his court? Or to remain as evil as ever, performing unseemly acts and endorsing every possible wickedness, so as to attract all the most wicked and corrupt warriors and magicians? In the meantime he must also go in search of the traces that lead to Arthur, fighting all kinds of infernal creatures. He has plenty to do. Explore the Kingdom of Camelot The battles take place in turns NeoCore Games knows how to master the Materia of Brittany well. After all, he boasts in his portfolio a miniseries dedicated to the son of Uther Pendragon, created for Paradox Interactive between 2009 and 2012. Evidently someone from the development team must have felt like resuming the subject to develop it in a completely different direction, realizing a strategic role-playing game with turn-based combat with a very strong narrative component, in which we are often called to make moral choices to direct Mordred's reign. The adventure begins in a cell, with Sir Mordred who still doesn't quite understand the situation. The first objective is to escape, with the help of another knight taken prisoner, Sir Kay. We soon discover that we are in the dungeons of Camelot and that the entire realm has been overrun by an as yet unnamed evil, so much so that the castle itself is in the hands of a disgraced knight corrupted by darkness. This first phase is useful for understanding how the game works, at least during the missions. The action is viewed from above and exploration is conducted either using the mouse, thus giving direction to the party by clicking with the cursor on the map, or using the keyboard. King Arthur: Knight's Tale The chosen system is indifferent, also because the things to do during the wanderings through forests, cemeteries, villages, dungeons, castles and any other iconic place in Brittany that can come to mind, are not very many: you can talk to the few characters who meet each other, via a multiple-choice dialogue system; you can collect loot from the various containers, whether they are richly decorated chests or the corpses of some unfortunate person; one can recover one's strength by resting at the bonfires or praying at the sacred altars; and you can fight, when you meet enemies. In general, the game is divided into medium-small maps, which must be explored far and wide to recover objects, perhaps find some secondary objectives (which always take place on the map itself) and to achieve the main objectives, well indicated by the classic placeholders. The atmosphere is great Note that the objects found during the missions, i.e. runes for weapons and armor, artifacts, potions and spells, can only be assigned to characters after the mission has ended. So nonte ongoing inventory management. On the one hand this eliminates all the micromanagement of the same, which is moved to the management section which we will discuss later, but on the other hand it allows you to focus more on the tactics to be used in combat, forcing you to be more careful in the use of consumables. The combat system Exploring can be both rewarding and boring The combat system is the core of the gameplay of King Arthur: Knight's Tale missions. Turning here and there, sooner or later it is inevitable to run into some enemies. At that point the game asks us to line up our party, made up of a maximum of five heroes (four selectable at the start of the mission and one that can be found during the same), to then begin the actual combat, which sees the game world divided into square boxes and the characters move by spending the classic action points, which allow them to travel more or less the road, to attack with the weapons held or to use spells and special abilities. The game system is quite intuitive in these phases and it takes very little to practice ... also because in reality there are not many options, especially at the beginning. Apart from direct confrontation, you can choose to drink potions, to put the heroes on surveillance, i.e. to have them automatically attack opponents who enter the covered area, or to keep action points for the next round. There are also extra large enemies It is interesting how the health of the individual troops is managed: each unit has a certain amount of vitality, which is what we can define as fixed health, ie which when it runs out involves death and which can only be healed inside the castle hospital of Camelot; then there are the life points, i.e. the variable salute, the one that is fully recovered after each mission and which can be treated with potions and bonfires; finally there is the armor, also recoverable after each mission, which represents the level of protection of each hero. The higher the armor value, the more it will protect against enemy hits. If desired, there are also magical effects that enhance health and armor, but they depend on the characters used. The classes of the characters are of various types: they range from the classic warriors equipped with one-handed weapons and a shield or two-handed weapons or two weapons (each configuration has its own class, actually), passing through archers and crossbowmen , arriving at mages and healers (spells are handled as if they were skills and can be cast indefinitely, after cooling). Go and trust death Each class has its own unlockable skills, divided into three tiers, to which points can be distributed as you level up. Experience, like loot, is awarded at the end of the mission, so the management of this aspect has also been diverted to the management phase, again for the same reasons that objects cannot be distributed during missions. Their enemies can be bandits, corrupted knights, undead of various types and many other creatures of different sizes, each with its own special attacks and patterns. The difficulty depends very much on the level selected at the beginning. We advise you to start at least from the third, if you have a minimum of experience with the genre, otherwise you risk getting bored due to excessive ease. Manage Camelot Recapturing and managing Camelot is crucial Another fundamental aspect of King Arthur: Knight's Tale is management, which requires us to manage the kingdom in various ways. The first thing to do is to win the trust of the knights who have joined our cause by growing their appreciation towards us, making decisions during some events, conveniently marked between the missions, rebuilding the various parts of the castle and assigning prestigious roles to the most faithful. Some moral choices can also be made during the missions themselves, just to make the system even more present. Be that as it may, following a certain moral alignment allows you to unlock dedicated secondary missions, which give various advantages, first of all the unlocking of legendary heroes such as Sir Galahad or Morgana. It soon turns out that having so many heroes has its uses regardless of the missions, where, as already mentioned, only four can be carried. These can in fact carry out autonomous missions, or they can replace wounded heroes who need prolonged treatments to recover vitality and to heal wounds. Camelot itself works better than a shopping center. With all structures rebuilt, it houses merchants, a magical tower in which to trade powerful artifacts, a training ground in cui train idle heroes, the Round Table, where to make the most political decisions and various other comforts that will help us during the adventure. A particularly horrific foe It should be specified that the game does not offer a real economy. Of course, you can sell and buy items and you can accumulate resources, but there is no real production to manage or costs to deal with: if you don't have enough money or enough manpower points, you have to wait for the end of the mission next to buy something. The management part also includes the game world map, where the events take place and where the primary and secondary missions are located. The latter are usually as big as the former, only that they are optional, i.e. they do not preclude the continuation of the story. In our experience it is better to do them all, in order to adequately strengthen the party, find new allies and discover some side stories, which concern the knights of the Round Table and their destiny. Technique and conclusions There is so much fog in this corrupt world From a technical point of view King Arthur: Knight's Tale is a fairly heavy title, while not showing itself graphically miraculous. Of course, the game world is well designed and some elements are well done, but there is nothing that surprises that much, both in terms of scenarios and characters, the latter made with skill, but sometimes too generic in appearance. On the other hand, the dark atmosphere is excellent, which somewhat compensates for the other shortcomings. Let's say that overall it is a good job and the gothic style that characterizes all the scenarios is appreciable, between the color palette tending to gray and corpses almost everywhere. Some levels are more beautiful than others, think for example of some catacombs with the walls completely covered in skulls or some particularly suggestive coastal scenarios. The same goes for enemies, who get better as they get bigger. Too bad for some fluidity problems, with some slowdown recorded here and there. Nothing tragic, especially considering the genre, but sometimes you notice. Arthur, is it really you? Overall we liked King Arthur: Knight's Tale, even if we would have preferred to see some aspects more in depth and we would have liked greater interactivity of the scenarios, which are currently only the way to go from one fight to another, with some variations that take over from time to time, as if to give the player a sop. The progression model followed by the developers doesn't work badly, but it produces differences in level of interest, above all when we find ourselves carrying out missions for which our party is of a higher level than that required (it happens, and even often, if you carry out all the secondary missions), which are therefore extremely easy and a little less engaging. In any case, it would be unfair to speak of an unsuccessful work, because in reality it has many valuable elements that do not make you regret the little more than forty hours spent to finish it.", "date": "2022-05-07", "grade": "8.0"}
