{"name": "Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is Electronic Arts' attempt to restore prestige to its road driving game franchise, whose latest releases, in particular the chapters developed by Ghost Games, have not fully convinced critics and players, often leaving a bad taste in the mouth for choices considered incomprehensible. Some weren't and aren't really even bad games, but wanting to transform them at all costs into service games, with the relative and discovery injection of predatory monetization systems, has often led to some forcings that are not liked, ruining those that otherwise they would have been very pleasant experiences. It is therefore not surprising that the American publisher wanted to avoid further missteps and start again from one of the most beloved episodes of the entire franchise, whose remastered edition does not disappoint expectations. Burnouts Need for Speed Hot Pursuit did a lot of good for the Need For Speed series. At least it allowed her to rediscover those roots that she had somewhat abandoned with the last few episodes. Criterion worked more by subtraction than by addition: the previous Need for Speed had become strange objects with narrative campaigns increasingly central to the game economy and a looser focus on the actual races, often sacrificed on the altar of open world and accessory elements. There were also some simulation drifts, excellently done, it must be said, but far from the spirit of the original chapters. Starting from the know-how accumulated with the Burnout series, Criterion therefore decided to create a pure arcade racing game, almost a Zen operation conducted to get rid of all those superstructures that were dirtying, and in many cases degrading, what should have been the core of the experience offered by a series such as Need for Speed. He obviously did it in his own way, injecting many elements of the Burnout series into the series, in particular the physicality of the cars, closer to that of a Destruction Derby than a Need for Speed. So even EA's racing cars began to shatter into a thousand metal and glass particles, transforming themselves into suffering and pulsating bodies during the spectacular accidents they are inevitably destined to encounter during the races, underlined by lightning-fast shots and well-integrated shots in the action, which made and still make the verse of the world of genre cinema (do you know the Fast & Furious?). Gameplay Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered takes exactly the experience of the original, enriching it with some extra content, but without trying to revolutionize it in the slightest. The career mode consists of a series of events selectable from the map of Seacrest County, a fictional region made up of different zones, where the action takes place. Luckily it doesn't pretend to tell any story: you play to run and conquer the many racing cars included in the game. By winning the various competitions, new scenarios are also unlocked, for a total of over 130 races. The game has a very particular structure, because it allows you to follow two careers at the same time: that of a criminal and that of a policeman, in the more classic dualism of cops and robbers, typical of the imagination of the world of extreme racing. Understanding if a competition is linked to one or the other career is very easy, since they have completely different icons. Each career offers twenty different levels of experience, which you climb by winning offline and online competitions. To the approximately 30-35 hours of gameplay of the original, at least another eight have been added, which we can essentially translate into the presence of new events, modeled on those already present. As in the original, to reach the maximum level it is not enough to win the races just once, but you have to play them again, possibly by participating in online competitions to be quicker. If desired, there is also the free roaming mode that allows you to go for a ride around the map freely, but without assigning points and without giving bonuses. Game mode The game modes are always the same, sufficient overall, but not many if we consider that some are simple variations of others. For the criminal career they are: the race, a race between eight competitors; the duel, played against another opponent; the timed race, which asks us to reach the finish line within a certain time running alone; the preview, essentially a solitary race in which we will be able to test a high-class car that we will unlock in the advanced levels; the Hot Pursuit mode that gives the game its title, in which we will have to escape the police and at the same time compete with other drivers and the chase mode, always a challenge againstthe police, but alone. For the career as a policeman, there are fewer methods: quick response is a timed race with penalties in case of accidents; preview is identical to the homonymous mode of the criminal career, only with police cars; Hot Pursuit is the same mode as the criminals, but in which you must capture the runaway cars; Finally, Interceptor is the fighter mode experienced from the other side of the fence. The driving model is also identical to the original version, which is not a bad thing, since it was already excellent then, especially if you like arcade racing games. At the time it was impossible not to notice the philosophical closeness, and not only, to that of the last Burnouts, with heavy cars, well planted on the track, which engage in long drifts with the simple touch of a button on the controller. Overall, it is very satisfying and manages to perfectly convey the differences between the different cars, simulating the response to the stresses of the terrain on which we will be racing in an excellent way. Even their tracks have remained those of the time, well designed and full of shortcuts, so much so that it is pleasant to repeat them several times even just to discover all the hidden passages. Autolog is also back, i.e. the system that allows you to compare in real time , through a rich alert system, your own results with those of your friends. We could define it as an asynchronous multiplayer, even if it is slightly more complex and multifaceted. To fully evaluate it, however, you have to wait for the game to be at full capacity, i.e. available to everyone. Graphics From a technical point of view, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is a good title. The rejuvenation work carried out by the developers has proved to be quite effective, in particular as regards the lighting system and support for higher resolutions, with the implementation of more defined 3D models, really beautiful to look at. In addition, the depth of field has been increased, with a noticeable reduction in object pop-ups and a greater number of elements rendered at high quality among those in long shot. Among other innovations, the resolution of shadows and reflections has also been improved, more particle effects have been added, which improve the sense of adherence of the cars to the ground, and some textures have been improved, now more defined. That said, overall there is nothing really revolutionary and the glance remains close to that of the original title, which in any case was excellent from a technical point of view. We are not saying that the remastering is not seen, but only that visually Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered does not distort the starting game in any way, limiting itself to tweaking it where necessary. The user interface deserves a separate note, also completely revised and now more suitable for the higher resolutions of modern monitors and televisions.", "date": "2020-11-05", "grade": "8.9"}
