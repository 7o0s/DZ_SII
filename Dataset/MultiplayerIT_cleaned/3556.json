{"name": "Bear With Me: The Complete Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bear-with-me-the-complete-collection-recensione.html", "text": "A detective teddy bear, a little girl looking for her brother and an old school point and click with an extremely noir atmosphere come together in the review you are about to read: if you believe that all these elements would make no sense within a single video game, then don't have you ever given Bear With Me a chance. Or more likely, since it is an indie title never particularly highlighted by the spotlights, you simply missed it along the way. And it's a long road, the one that accompanied the publication of the various episodes of the series, which currently has a main narrative arc, the Bear With Me itself, and then a prequel chapter in its own right. Why are we telling you about all this? Naturally because we thoroughly tested Bear With Me: The Complete Collection on PlayStation 4 (but the final package is also present on all other consoles and on PC). Plot: teddy bear detective, murders and kidnappings The Bear With Me: The Complete Collection contains the main adventure of Bear With Me, consisting of three connected episodes, and the prequel episode The Lost Robots. The choice of the best point from which to start is up to you: if you want to proceed chronologically you should start from The Lost Robots, if you prefer the ideal order thought by the developers then carefully choose Episode 1 from the main game menu. The latter, it must be said, is not particularly intuitive: it assumes that the buyer already knows everything about the series and its structure, all in all simple but put on the screen in a rather misleading way; on the left and vertically three episodes named simply Episode 1, Episode 2 and Episode 3 (with nice images, but not able to guide newcomers), on the right Bear With Me The Lost Robots, with a larger image of the others and which risks drawing all the attention of the players. Newcomers therefore look immediately to the left and up to start the main adventure of Detective Ted D. Bear and his friend Amber, in search of his missing brother. That of Exordium Games is, needless to say, not only the debut adventure of Ted and Amber, but also of the entire small development team, founded just in 2014. It is a linear and pleasant old school point and click , but above all with charisma to spare: in the approximately twelve hours required to complete the main adventure (excluding The Lost Robots, which must be calculated separately with another five hours or so) the player follows the girl's investigation in search of her missing brother Flint: it is an apparently only disturbing case, but which in reality is then linked to more ambitious plans of the local underworld of Paper City, an imaginary location in which the events narrated take place. Along the three episodes, the relationship between Amber and Ted strengthens and changes, the characters slowly show their facets, and the player immerses himself in an extremely fascinating and dark fantasy world, but told in a way suitable for everyone, a sort of fairy tale modern on genres. The prequel chapter follows the same line and deals with almost the same themes, slightly varying the main plot and introducing new characters and environments, but still all in Paper City: this time Amber is set aside and Ted is forced to work with Brother Flint. The developers, and this should be noted, have included extremely interesting themes relating to crime, the relationship between brothers and the world of adults, all duly veiled within the main dialogues. The observant player, however, will be able to catch them easily: so listen up and don't skip the texts on the screen (which by the way are in Italian). Playstation 4 trophies Bear With Me: The Complete Collection arrives on PlayStation 4 with a rich list of Trophies, among which the Platinum Trophy also stands out. Unlocking them all is relatively simple, as in most point and click titles on consoles - usually just completing the main narrative. In this case some optional dialogues will also be necessary, obtainable only in certain moments of the adventure. If you always analyze everything, listen to everyone and explore every corner of the scenarios, however, you will take it home even if you play the title only once. Gameplay: Old school point and click Bear With Me: The Complete Collection includes two titles that belong to the same genre and that share the exact same mechanics: old school point and click adventures, in which the player will find himself from time to time in different environments (all designed with a two-dimensional technique) and will have to be able to continue in the narmain ration by solving various problems and tasks along the way. Variety and creativity are basic elements of production and gameplay: the tasks to be performed are imaginative and in line with what one might expect from a story poised between serious and light-hearted. They range from the recovery of the victim's body parts (the various limbs of a robot) to the interruption of the show in a pub so that some of those present finally listen to us without being distracted by the artist on stage; there is no shortage of more original and amusing situations. If the recomposition of an incriminating document like pieces of a puzzle is a strategy seen and revised in many other point and click video games, the manipulation of an assembly line appears more inspired so that that cursed package on the other side of the factory finally arrives between our hands. The player controls a different duo of characters from time to time: Ted and Amber in the main adventure of the trilogy of episodes, Ted and Flint in the prequel episode; the many amusing dialogues between the two protagonists remain a constant, which insist on some clichs that are almost always able to elicit a smile from the spectators (the height of the stuffed detective, his dialogues modeled on those of the most famous detectives in history, stereotypes of various types, and so on). All this, we recall, is also accompanied by animated scenes and situations in which the tones of Bear With Me become more serious and melancholy, bringing the production to other levels: unfortunately there are few of them, and they are not enough to balance some important shortcomings. For example, the budget of the video game itself, which is visually limited. The developers themselves allude to it with irony in some dialogues, such as when Ted justifies the lack of animation by saying that ~apparently the budget was over~. However, we must consider that Bear With Me is fun, accessible to all and has a plot that may not be very original but which does its job, keeping the players' attention until the end. Of course, not all the backdrops of the play areas are equally cared for, the characters move in a wooden way and very slowly, and the animations (in fact) do not shine; on the other hand the artistic direction is very inspired, and as for charisma the main and secondary characters do not miss anything. Completed the main adventure you will still remember all the funny characters met along the way, even several months after the end credits. The difficulty level remains between medium and low, without ever really offering insurmountable or too demanding challenges. It is clearly a story designed to be completed by everyone, without ever really hindering anyone. The conversion on PlayStation 4 does not present any problems and also the loads between the various scenarios are decidedly fast: the developers could still have adapted the controls in a more intelligent way (especially in the selection of objects from the inventory) and above all add a damn key to the race of the characters, who float from one point to another on the screen taking up all the time in the world.", "date": "2019-08-07", "grade": "7.5"}
