For this second chapter, the developers of Xoobis have decided to add some meat to the fire while keeping the basic recipe substantially unchanged: let's see if it was the best choice... A clean job As per the textbook of the perfect mobile game, Zombie Wonderland 2: Outta Time! it doesn't get lost in chatter and immediately puts the user at the center of the action, making him select an internship and making it clear what the objectives are to complete it. Each level consists of a building containing a special object that must be defended from the undead that crowd the surrounding streets and will constantly try to enter through the windows. The user commands Chuck again, a cross between a zombie exterminator and a cleaner, through simple taps on the screen relating to the different actions he is able to perform. First of all, our hero can take advantage of the (few) wooden planks at his disposal to bar the windows, assisted by the player who will simply have to indicate the desired point and tap on the appropriate icon. In the early stages of the adventure it is also possible to place a turret to defend one side of the building, being careful to repair it in case it is targeted by enemy attacks. Once this is done, all that remains is to shoot back the zombies that come within range, touching them and letting Chuck's infallible aim do the dirty work. Again, in the event that a walking corpse that had managed to enter the house is taken out, it is necessary to perform a series of quick swipes on the screen to clean up the green pool resulting from the killing. The similarities with the aforementioned Diner Dash lie in the simplicity of the controls and in the need to act quickly by giving priority to the most urgent threats, all obviously inserted in a more action dynamic given the hordes of undead to blow their brains out. There is no shortage of upgrades for Chuck's paraphernalia - including buckshot with the most varied bonuses and real smart-bombs - which can be purchased in the appropriate store using the money earned in the various stages, and among the ranks of the same zombies there are very distinct specimens capable of special skills. On paper, it's really not bad for an App sold for 79 cents, but it's a pity that the good game doesn't last long due to the extreme repetitiveness of the action and the substantial lack of challenge. In the face of these aspects, the campaign proves to be even too long, so full of levels diversified almost only by the visual aspect and by an inconsistent plot narrated by an exaggerated amount of useless dialogue boxes. While far from being a bad title, Zombie Wonderland 2: Outta Time! it fails to leave its mark for the aforementioned reasons and for the inability to offer a minimum of strategic depth, reducing the experience to a mere running from one side of the screen to another until time runs out. At least from a technical point of view, there is little to complain about, thanks to clean and colorful graphics (albeit not very spectacular due to the bird's eye view) and a decidedly spot on musical accompaniment.
