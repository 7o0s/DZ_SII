{"name": "Beowulf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beowulf.html", "text": "It is established that originality does not exactly represent Gameloft's best virtue, but at the same time the French studio cannot be denied the undoubted technical ability in the development of games for mobile phones. This Beowulf absolutely does not betray the two statements above, presenting itself as a 2D action game that is as well-finished in form as it is conventional in substance. Right from the start, the title betrays a remarkable resemblance to God of War: in the role of the protagonist, the user therefore has the opportunity to wreak havoc on his opponents by slicing them well with the sword and then finishing them off with a bloody coup de grace (for example, tearing them literally in two, a practice already successfully adopted by Kratos). Beowulf does not deviate from the classic canons of the genre, offering the player the usual range of actions: movement, jump, slash, flying attack, launch of a long-range weapon (a hammer, in this case) and execution of a powerful special move after filling the appropriate rage indicator. To be honest, everything is delegated to a particularly efficient control system, which at least brings the Gameloft title a cut above many other competitors. But the content of the 14 levels is far from being amazing, limiting itself to the usual alternation of enemies and platform elements, with only a few certainly not revolutionary gimmicks to break the pace. Of course, the bosses could not be missing, an element thanks to which Beowulf manages to recover some points: to underline, among others, the impressive fight against a fifteen-meter-long sea serpent, which undoubtedly represents the climax of the Gameloft product. Unfortunately, most of the game is not so exciting, and indeed, the 14 stages flow away too quickly, also thanks to a level of difficulty that is far from insurmountable. Short and not always intense, Beowulf however boasts of a respectable technical realization: graphically, the title features detailed scenarios, a good variety of enemies and animations at the top of the category (both in quantitative and qualitative terms), not to mention the majesty of some bosses, primarily the snake mentioned a few lines above.
