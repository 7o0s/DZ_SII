In the case of the third chapter, focused on the Star Wars universe, the developers had it easy to create this type of product by cropping them around the three trilogies intended to make up the definitive work. With the World dedicated to Episodes I-III present in the Starter Pack and waiting for the one dedicated to the highly anticipated Episode VII to be released together with the film, here we are therefore discussing ~Together Against the Empire~, which is precisely the Play Set focused on the events of the classic trilogy, the most loved of all and on the basis of which the myth of Star Wars was built. Together Against the Empire is a Play Set to buy if you liked The Twilight of the Republic Word to Tom Williams, Game Director As with Star Wars: Twilight of the Republic, the creation of the world Together against the Empire was entrusted to the guys from the Gobo studio. It is one of the historical teams of Disney Infinity, which has collaborated on the project since the first chapter. ~We have been working with Disney for about ten years and we have an excellent relationship with Avalanche - explained Tom Williams, Game Director of the studio - there is a lot of trust~. Even when it comes to deciding the direction to give to the new playsets. We have no limitations in setting the theme of new game worlds, but development always takes place under the strict supervision of Avalanche and the owner of the IP. Because, as Tom explained to us, we need to check that the evolutions of the game remain consistent with the rest of the structure and faithful to the original material. The engine is in fact the same one on which Avalanche has been working for years and it is on this important basis that the various innovations are grafted every year. Like the flying sections of Together Against the Empire. Tom also revealed to us that this year the greatest difficulty was coordinating with the many teams working on individual aspects of the game: ~It was a great organizational effort, but we think the result is really good~. As for the story, we have already seen how the trilogy most loved by fans has been freely interpreted in some key passages of the game, because ~a choice had to be made, you can't put all the characters from the Star Wars universe into the game. So we consulted with Avalanche and LucasFilm to understand what aspects it was possible to change without distorting the canon of the series~. An attempt has thus been made to give a suitable cut to meet both the tastes of long-time fans, who grew up with the Legos of the first Star Wars trilogy, and those of the younger ones, who probably don't have the same familiarity with iconic characters such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. ~One of our goals was to try to convey to the new generations at least some of what the original Star Wars trilogy meant to us.~ use the force Also in this case we are talking about a package, sold at a cost of around 35, in which two new characters are offered (Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia) and the miniature to be placed on the portal to act as a ~key~ to access to the game. With another 15 each, you can also take home the figurines of Darth Vader, Han Solo and Chewbacca, which complete the group of figurines that were made for the occasion. Also on this occasion it is worth emphasizing the excellent quality of the same, which while confirming the stylized cartoon style that serves as the leitmotif of all those made for Disney Infinity, enjoy an excellent level of detail and an almost perfect colouring. In short, they don't disfigure at all even on the shelf in full view, just to be clear. The actual game was instead developed by Studio Gobo, one of the teams involved in the project and which in the past has already been active in the creation of many of the Worlds that have appeared in the various chapters of the franchise. Let's start from a fundamental premise: handling the matter of Episodes IV-VI is a difficult task to say the least, precisely because they enjoy such a level of adoration from fans that the risk of committing sacrilege is practically around every corner. In this case, the developers have chosen to adopt an approach so distant from the concept of fidelity to the original as to paradoxically avoid the aforementioned risk: although inspired by the events of the films, this Play Set in fact offers an alternative plot, highly simplified and condensed at most, which seems to take particular account of iyounger audiences rather than hardcore aficionados of George Lucas' work. So here the protagonists find themselves together from the beginning, Han Solo is never hibernated in graphite, the locations are reduced to a handful (Tatooine, the Death Star, Endor and Hoth), the figure of Darth Vader is trivialized and more generally there are very few points of contact with the original source. Patience, one might say: just put aside the Taliban spirit and accept the choice made by Disney, which in any case - it should be kept in mind - considering the various potential buyers of the product was not easy at all and would probably have dissatisfied someone in whatever way it was gone to finish. Although watered down, the charm of Star Wars is still very present in this case too, for sure. Turning instead to the actual gameplay, even with Together Against the Empire it was decided to adopt a mission-based development formula, a large part of which take place on foot in the third person playing the role of the character that has been chosen to be placed on the portal, in the classic style of toys to life: unfortunately the game design often demonstrates less effectiveness and variety than the already imperfect Il Crepuscolo della Repubblica, proposing a multitude of fetch quests (collection of a certain number of objects to bring back to the starting point) almost irritating. If we could give dispassionate advice to Disney for the next chapter of Infinity, it would be precisely to hire industry veterans capable of finally studying a mission development capable of proving to be appreciable even by the most experienced players. It would undoubtedly be a major step forward for the franchise. That said, even the combat system seemed to us less varied and enjoyable than the previous World, basically due to the reduced variety of enemies and their poor ability to offer a minimum of challenge. If therefore some moments of Together Against the Empire are of modest quality and even boring, it must be said that other sections - above all those on board the vehicles, much more frequent and consistent - are able to offer quality passages, counterbalancing in a way effective than the previous ones and helping to raise the final calculation above the sufficiency. Probably the highest point of the overall package is the attack on the Death Star aboard the X-wing, managed through a binary sequence limited in mechanics but absolutely spectacular, also on a technical level. It's just a shame that it's very short and detached from the rest, so much so that it almost looks like another game. However, this Play Set is ultimately a product that, while not surprising, largely confirms the gameplay and sensations transmitted by the World bundled inside the Disney Infinity 3.0 Starter Pack. This means that, if you liked that, you can safely proceed with the purchase without major fears. And may the Force be with you.", "date": "2015-10-26", "grade": null}
