{"name": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-iv-shivering-isles-recensione.html", "text": "Demented maniacs Finally, a full-bodied official expansion for Oblivion has arrived, which adds a lot of content and does not just take advantage of the original game world, as the previous micro-expansions did, but adds a new continent to that of Cyrodiil. After passing the portal, in fact, we will find ourselves in the presence of one of Sheogorath's servants, who will introduce us to the new world and will submit our first quest to us: to overcome the guardian protector of the gates that allow access to the realm of madness. Talking to the first characters you meet in the antechamber of the continent, you immediately understand that everything in this place is over the top. The characters are, more or less, crazy people who often speak in a surreal way with sometimes funny, sometimes uninspired dialectical games (a good part of the appeal of the dialogues is lost in the Italian translation... if you can, play in English). The landscape itself is much more imaginatively composed than in Cyrodiil, with the greenery looking like something out of a horror movie (Dementia) or a Lewis Carroll book (Mania). Extolling the qualities of Oblivion's graphics engine might seem superfluous, but, despite having played the base title for a long time, we couldn't help but be amazed by some truly excellent scenarios, above all thanks to a perfectly fitting choice of colors. PC enthusiasts don't worry about the boxers I won't mention them because it's obvious from them that everything runs smoothly) since the requirements have remained unchanged compared to the past... as well as some problems which we will discuss later. Postcards A very welcome addition is a completely new local fauna, with well-made enemies with often splendid polygonal models. There are many creatures added by the developers, from a whole series of rather horrific insects to a real new breed of enemies halfway between civilization and prehistory. There is no shortage of minor but still dangerous creatures, such as hell dogs or large reptiles. Among the new characters, the knights of order stand out above all, the main enemies of the expansion, with their crystal armor and fine, sharp swords. The armor of the guardians of Mania and Dementia is also very beautiful and at a certain point in the game... no, we won't tell you. Do not insist that we do not want to spoil the twists. The new continent corresponds to a new quest line and a whole series of sub-quests that can be collected by the various NPCs, especially by those who live in the only city present, New Sheot, divided into three areas: two districts plus the palace of the lord Daedra. Alongside the rather obvious quests that require, for example, to collect an object for a character or to go and kill some guy who has done something irreparable, there are other original and interesting ones. For example, you have to solve a problem of ~doubles~ in the village of ~Split~, where a magician had fun splitting all the inhabitants, or you have to find an outdoor bed for a character who is afraid of closed places, because he believes that the walls will attack him in his sleep. The main quest line, on the other hand, is all centered around Sheogorath and, despite being very long and articulated, it is made up of trivial missions that recalculate the classic stylistic features of the genre. Basically it will be a matter of exploring many dungeons, killing many enemies and collecting many objects. Only a couple of quests will deviate from the norm. Nothing wrong, for heaven's sake, after all, a nice extra dungeon is always nice, but having a world based on madness available, something more could definitely be done regarding originality. And shut up! As in the base game all enemies and items will be adjusted to the character's level. This means that you will be able to face the new world both with newly created characters and with others already advanced. As usual there will be those who will appreciate not having to bang too much to grow the character in order to adapt it to the challenge and those who, on the other hand, will criticize this choice as yet another concession made to the casual gamer. Unfortunately, while on PC it will soon be possible to install some mods to be able to choose how to approach the game (for example Francesco's Mod), Xbox 360 users will have to settle for the choice made by Bethesda and will have to keep the base game which, despite what one of the two factions, it's still a great game. Just know that, on average, the enemies of Shivering Isles are meaner than those of Cyrodiil and that, especially at advanced levels, they will often tend to attack in groups, making fights more complicated (our 40th level character was several hours of game that didn't have to drink hard healing potionsnot a fight). The extra game hours will be about twenty, exploring the map well and carrying out all the various quests. the enemies of the Shivering Isles are meaner than those of Cyrodiil Other extra content concerns the inventory. In fact, new ingredients have been added that will make alchemy enthusiasts happy, new weapons have been added, some of which are superior to the beloved Umbra, and two blacksmiths have been included capable of forging special weapons and armor starting from two ingredients: the mineral of madness and amber. Both are found in large quantities and you will have no problem taking advantage of these new possibilities. Unfortunately there are also some negative notes. The first is Sheogorath himself, one of the most talkative and annoying characters in the history of video games. We understand that he is crazy, but his way of speaking is so unbearable that we are often reduced to skipping his dialogues and limiting ourselves to reading the diary account. Another defect is the persistence of some bugs, which have been reported to the developers for some time, which seem not to find the way to fix. This translates into a few too many returns to the desktop, which is never a pleasure, especially when it hasn't been saved in a while. Otherwise it is an excellent expansion that will make Oblivion fans happy by giving them a lot of extra material to play with. System requirements The hardware requirements are, of course, the same as for Oblivion and those who have managed to run the base game well will have no problems with this. The only warning we can give PC users is to pay attention to the various amateur mods, especially those that distort the gameplay (such as the aforementioned Francesco's or the Dark One), because we don't know if they are perfectly compatible with the Shivering Isles. Probably the authors will soon release updated versions of their works, so just follow the respective official sites (or any of the portals dedicated to Oblivion). Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce 6800 series ATi X800 series with 128 MB DirectX 9.0c DVD Player Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Card Video: GeForce 7900 series, or Radeon X1950 series with 256 MB DirectX 9.0c DVD Drive Test configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 Ghz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Conclusions Shivering Isles is an excellent expansion that enriches the best RPG of 2006 in a worthy way and certainly deserves an even higher rating than that given if you own the Xbox 360 version. If you loved Oblivion you can't miss it. A new continent, new enemies, new items what more do you want? Pros Lots of extra material Well done some side quests Great characterization of the new world Cons Somebody bring down the talkative deity! Bethesda, how long will it take to fix all bugs? The leveling of enemies and objects is annoying to many The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles is available for PC and Xbox 360. The version used for this review is the PC version. What to do in Cyrodiil when the sun has gone down Cyrodiil was getting too small for our liking. From the Valus Range to the Gold Coast we knew every broken twig. Now we called the goblins by name before we killed them. With some bandits, tired of being cannon fodder, we went to have coffee on the walls of Leyawiin watching the sunset darken Blackwood. The card games with the Knights of the Nine had become real tournaments in which we had involved three other guilds (not that of the thieves, who can't be trusted when it comes to money). In short, having nothing left to do and having accumulated more titles than a politician with no use, we were almost about to change the world, when a strange little island appeared in the middle of the Bay of Niben with a big head on it with its mouth open. Inside the mouth a portal. Now, you will understand that under normal conditions no one would enter a similar portal, either because once these portals have a reassuring aspect, perhaps more pleasant and inviting, or because it is not that in life one can slip into all the portals that appear and you want because, usually, one has something else to do than go snooping around the various parallel universes. In short, we were about to go back to watching the scientific scopone final between two members of the warriors' guild and two of the magicians' guild, when a loud and powerful voice reminded us that after all we are still gamers and the portals that appear out of nowhere are ours daily bread. In short, continued the voice, life as a housewife / or in armor is not for you and virtual danger is your job. In the end,after cleaning a tooth with the Mehrunes' Razor and having collected the mota of our horse with Umbra (soul gems are excellent as ecological bags, you know?) we agreed with the mysterious voice and entered the portal, convinced above all by the fact that, after all, we spent about thirty euros to be able to make an island appear in the middle of the sea, so it's not nice to snub it. those who complained about the too realistic and in a certain sense banal geography of Cyrodiil, especially when compared to the geographical variety of Morrowind, will have to think again The Shivering Isles are none other than the realm of the Daedra Lord Sheogorath, the lord of madness. Some of you will surely remember his eccentricity already widely shown during the Daedric quest of the main game (the one in which an apocalyptic prophecy had to come true in a village full of bored people) but now you can verify it definitively. Those who complained about the too realistic and in a certain sense banal geography of Cyrodiil, especially when compared to the geographical variety of Morrowind, will have to change their mind. The territory of Shivering Isles is divided into two realms: to the north the colorful world of Mania; to the south the dark realm of Dementia. To be able to defeat the impending evil we will have to cross both several times, with great joy of our boots that protect us from magic, but which do not perspire sweat and make our feet weapons more suitable for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. than a fantasy game but let's not digress.", "date": "2007-04-02", "grade": null}
