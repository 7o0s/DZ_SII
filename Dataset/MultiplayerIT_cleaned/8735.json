And so, alongside the various Magic Carpet, Populous and Theme Park, Syndicate arrived in 1993, a real-time strategy title with a huge management component where the player found himself immersed in a futuristic scenario dealing with gigantic corporations that gave themselves a pity reason with the aim of dominating the electronic market. Their weapons were special agents enhanced with the help of mechanical grafts and chips capable of developing their abilities and vital functions beyond human possibilities: real unstoppable cyborgs a la the Terminator with at their disposal, among other things, an arsenal of weapons of enormous destructive power. The indisputable charm of the game must have stirred the souls of the Starbreeze Studios guys, known to the general public for the splendid work done on The Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness, to the point of having convinced them to ask Electronic Arts for the availability of the franchise to develop their personal remake of the opera. Will they have succeeded in creating a product that is attractive to the new generation of video games and able to not annoy the veterans of the sector? Let's find out together. Distinctly cyberpunk First of all, we must start from an assumption: the new Syndicate moves away almost completely from the original title by taking advantage of the interesting marketing move that allowed him to use a well-known name by exploiting the bare minimum in terms of universe. And let it be clear that we do not say it in negative terms or influenced by any prejudice because indeed the modernized vision of the developer manages to give even positive results on some fronts. However, the story remains anchored to the dictates of cyberpunk. We are in 2069, national borders no longer exist and corporations are in charge: huge companies resulting from continuous mergers between multinationals entirely focused on the production of increasingly sophisticated special chips capable of interconnecting the human population with the great network. Access to information is instantaneous and convincing people to use the chips of one rather than another company becomes the goal of these companies which soon begin to exploit the most advanced technologies to enhance real agents dedicated to espionage . It goes without saying but obviously the player plays the role of one of these, Miles Kilo, employed by EuroCorp, creator of the first real interconnect chip, the Dart, and equipped with its sixth version. This is the scenario that forms the backdrop to the single player campaign, made up of twenty levels including some wireframe-style environments that act as tutorials to practice the use of the ~powers~ of the chip and the inevitable narrative sections where we won't shoot a single gunshot but we will witness pivotal events in the Syndicate narrative canvas. Without risking ending up in spoilers, know that in the usual eight hours necessary to complete the game solo, we will find ourselves faced with numerous genre clichs, some reversals in the face and more generally we will experience a superficial and obvious story in many passages but with a good involvement, also thanks to the excellent scripting and acting of the characters on screen. Even if we are miles away from what Bullfrog told twenty years ago, the cybernetic science fiction poured by Starbreeze into his project makes use of an atmosphere well recreated by the Swedish developer both in terms of on-screen interface and in level design and technological solutions send to video. Virtual blows that inflict real pain If you still hadn't understood from the images, Syndicate is to all intents and purposes a first-person shooter that couldn't be more classic. At Call of Duty to be clear, with rather linear levels that leave little room for the player's imagination and freedom but which sometimes offer some very light stealth and interaction cues with the scenario to counteract the scripted sequences that invariably give depth to the sections more choreographed. In terms of controls, the title still offers some small deviations on the theme directly linked to the peculiarities of the gameplay. Therefore, in addition to the possibility of running and crouching with a sort of automatic cover when near an obstacle and which allows you to lean forward using the view fromviewfinder and reducing its footprint so as to be hit by enemies with greater difficulty, we find the two features of the chip. First of all, the Dart superimposed view, which is nothing more than a sort of bullet time that can be activated at will by pressing the right trigger and which, in addition to slowing down time, also allows you to be more resistant to enemy fire, to inflict more damage and to also see repaired opponents if already discovered previously. The upgrade can be used for a limited time and invariably recharges after a few seconds of rest, a bit like the protagonist's energy. The particular view is not only successful graphically and useful in the most chaotic shootings to have the essential time to catch your breath, but also serves to find hidden posters scattered throughout the game maps. These represent only a small part of the collectibles present in Syndicate that will surely delight the most fetishists of objectives, trophies and statistics, being composed of small holograms scattered around the play area, characters, weapons and secondary objects that must be tracked down to become part of the large encyclopedia of the game. In addition to the Dart view we find another peculiarity of the gameplay of this FPS, which can be recalled with the left trigger and concerning the interaction with the scenario and above all with the enemies. The latter can in fact be influenced through three particular applications that can be selected with the digital cross: suicide, persuasion or backlash. These are actions that are often able to twist a fight in our favor and will see us ~convince~ the opponent to blow himself up with a grenade rather than fight alongside us as long as there are soldiers in his field of vision. The recoil is then a sort of electronic interference capable of throwing two enemies to the ground to leave them at the mercy of our blows for a few seconds. These apps, unlike the Dart view, reload very slowly over time and much faster by killing enemies in rapid succession (an action that activates a sort of killing spree called destruction) or by hitting them on the head. The player's goal is obviously to manage these three powers sparingly and cunningly, always keeping in mind that the most powerful enemies, the armored ones and above all the sporadic agents of the opposing corporations that we will find ourselves facing as real bosses, they can be targeted. At the same time the left trigger can be used to hack some elements of the scenario: we will be able to move elevators, divert energy lines, raise barriers or on the contrary remove protections from enemy armor. This variety of actions initially gives back a feeling of freedom and tactics that is always nice to find in an otherwise very classic first-person shooter but soon everything tends to become repetitive due to a certain poverty of original situations. Among other things, in many situations we will be faced with ~simple~ moments in which we will have to defend ourselves from several waves of enemies before being able to proceed on our journey of liberation with a result that is not always so fun. However, the most important interaction we can have with the enemy remains the possibility of extracting the enhancement chip from his brain. It is a well-scripted event by the developers and that we will be able to carry out only in certain circumstances marked by the plot and in the presence of ~crucial~ opponents such as the bosses mentioned above. Deus Ex? No that's a whole other thing And here that microscopic role-playing component comes into play which for a moment made many players consider Syndicate a direct competitor to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. In reality, apart from some similarities in terms of atmosphere, the Starbreeze Studios title is far from the strong ambitions of personalizing the protagonist which instead distinguish the Eidos game. By collecting the few opposing chips we will be able to spend a point by selecting one of the 17 available upgrades visible on a dedicated screen. We find bonuses for damage, upgrades for the three apps, even a sort of shield to better resist enemy blows and a very short-lived invulnerability that activates a moment before losing consciousness. The player is free to choose which power-up to take each time but gains an additional health bonus if he selects adjacent bonuses to those previously chosen. The addition fails to make the gameplay deeper but still interesting for u's purposen enhancement of the combat system which is still excellent, frenetic and capable of giving more than a few adrenaline rushes to the player also thanks to the wide availability of different weapons: a good fifteen, some even with double fire mode. And we come to multiplayer, the second cornerstone of the video game offer of Syndicate which, in some respects, surpasses even the single player component in importance. The title exclusively offers online cooperative up to four players gutted through nine unedited and interconnected levels through a mini-campaign not without bosses. The gameplay remains practically the same with interactions on the scenario and very harsh fights that test the collaboration and coordination between the four players to the point of being a rather intense and engaging challenge. In fact, it will become essential to divide the tasks between those who, for example, think of hacking the covers to manage their deployment, those who will absorb enemy fire and those who will dedicate themselves to the care of wounded comrades, a fundamental action in order not to die with disarming frequency. Those who have already tried the demo therefore know what to expect and it is important to point out the possibility of developing your own agent by creating a real custom class with a specific loadout including your favorite weapons and obviously applications to use. All in function of an experience (research points) that is earned by completing the various objectives, killing enemies and interacting with one's companions, which can be spent to unlock all the available upgrades. In the latter case, among other things, the variety is exponentially higher than seen in single player with much more numerous or more effective applications such as the shield that can ~envelop~ the other team members as well. Even on this front, however, it is important to underline that we are not dealing with anything really innovative compared to the standards of the genre but there is no doubt that a cooperative campaign of this thickness is able to offer several additional hours to the longevity of the game in the name of a visceral entertainment capable of giving tactical satisfaction to the closest friends. Playstation 3 trophies The title offers the usual 51 trophies, of which 4 are gold, 46 bronze and the inevitable platinum. There are no silver trophies, let alone hidden ones. The golden ones are linked to killing two bosses in particular modes, completing the game at the maximum difficulty level, and collecting all the collectibles present. Most of the other trophies are tied to completing groups of single player campaign chapters and killing enemies under special conditions. There are a dozen trophies related to cooperative multiplayer. For a rather quick first pass of the game, including a few multiplayer games, you will hardly exceed 30% of unlocked trophies. Technically flawless The work done by Starbreeze Studios on the technical sector of the game is absolutely excellent. Graphically Syndicate is a nice little gem to see with light effects and technical tricks that manage to recreate the tangible sensation of being in front of some futuristic user interface on the screen. The protagonist is often blinded by very strong light sources that inhibit the cleaning of the visual field and all this is combined with the Dart view and the various overlays that constantly populate the screen, giving the game a unique aesthetic feeling. The animations of the bodies and faces of enemies and supporting actors are also very good and the particles and most of the volumetric smoke are of good quality. It's just a pity that this amount of detail goes to the detriment of the frame rate which barely manages to be stable at 30 frames per second and on PlayStation 3, the version we tested, is often the victim of quite evident fluidity collapses. In terms of artificial intelligence we have noticed a predisposition of the enemies, at the normal difficulty level (the second out of the three available) to remain a little too much in the open and more generally to have the tendency to always want to hit us very closely especially when they are armored and augmented by some armor. It therefore often happens to find yourself chased by the toughest enemies with the result of leading the player to carry out unrealistic runs backwards while targeting the unstoppable enemy. The audio effects are very good and the soundtrack is absolutely exceptional which, although not very present during the game, has a couple of very catchy recurring themes and absolutely in line with the cyberpunk atmosphere of the game.
