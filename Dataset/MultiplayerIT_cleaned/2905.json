{"name": "OkunoKA Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/okunoka-madness-recensione.html", "text": "OkunoKA Madness is the re-edition of Okunoka, an Italian hardcore platform released in 2018 which at the time of the review convinced us very much. Basically it's a big update that adds three game modes and some unlockable characters. Anyone who already owns the original will receive the new content for free and will automatically find the game with the new name in their library. For those who want more information on the main campaign, we refer you to our old review of OkunoKA, still very valid (the campaign has remained substantially identical). In general terms, we are talking about a platformer inspired by the genre inaugurated by Super Meat Boy, therefore made up of short and ultra-difficult levels. The protagonist is KA, a lazy and greedy creature of black souls (the fixed objectives of each level), which can make exceptional leaps, which can solidify water, fire and electricity to alter some parts of the scenario and which dies to the touch. After a certain number of levels you have to face one of the bosses, a particularly large and difficult creature to eliminate, which offers a unique challenge. Madness mode The main novelty of OkunoKA Madness compared to the original game is the Madness mode. Basically it is a collection of very difficult levels, designed for competitions between speedrunners. By very difficult we mean that they literally make blood, lungs and intestines spit out, pushing eye, hand, brain and swearing coordination to levels that after finishing a level Neo's dodging in the Matrix will seem as difficult as walking in the park. At the end of each level a judgment is given based on how long it took to get to the end. Taking D is often already a result, but getting to S means that you are ready to challenge players from all over the world trying to gnaw tenths of a second to reach the top of the global ranking. The traps are those of the main campaign, only used in a more creative and meaner way, so much so that each level requires you to develop your own manual skills to be overcome, although it is not difficult to understand what to do at first glance. Other new features include Time Attack and Custom modes. The first one describes itself: it's a time rush for the campaign levels. You must defeat at least one boss to unlock it. The Custom mode is instead a customized Time Attack with the levels decided by the player. It is also unlocked by defeating the first boss, but it works best when you have all the levels available (so when you finish the game).", "date": "2020-09-10", "grade": "8.8"}
