{"name": "Samurai Shodown 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-shodown-5.html", "text": "The ~grandfather~ of Soul Calibur The style of play, in fact, contrary to many other titles of the genre, presents a more strategic, more reasoned approach on the part of the user. Rushing like mad at an opponent nine times out of ten equals certain defeat. The best way to face an enemy therefore becomes to carefully calculate one's moves, also paying attention to those of the opponent. As Wang Tsung Yeuh said in the treatise on Tai Chi Chuan attributed to him, ~If you know your opponent and you know yourself, you will be able to fight a hundred times and you will win a hundred times~. For attacks, the game uses three basic keys: one for the light attack on the white weapon, one for the medium one and yet another to kick. From the combination of these keys, others can then arise, including the traditional combos. Mastering these actions is therefore essential. Each character has a different range of action, and appears well characterized from this point of view, even if many of them are, as we will see later when we talk about graphics, generally taken from the old episodes of the series. Unfortunately, the interesting option that allowed the user to differentiate the same Pg into two of his distinct and separate ~versions~: ~Slash~ and ~Bust~ was not revived from the previous episodes. This particular ~feature~ offered two different fighting styles for each individual character, effectively giving the feeling of having twice as many fighters available. The art of sword fighting Once you have chosen your favorite character and started playing, a similar ~scenario~ will appear before your eyes: the two opponents facing each other, on the screen, with indicator bars placed both at the top and bottom of the video . The one placed in the lower part of the screen is the one ~in charge~ of signaling at the right moment the possibility of carrying out a powerful attack. It fills according to the number of hits inflicted on the enemy. The more this happens, the more the character's complexion will become red to highlight the ~pumping-rage~ of the blood that burns in him, ready to give our hero the right fury to pour against the unfortunate opponent. In the upper part of the screen, however, we find the classic life bar and just below the ~Sword Spirit Gauge~: the more we attack, the more the latter will decrease, while remaining ~at rest~ the bar will fill up again. It goes without saying that during an attack with the gauge full, the power of our combos will have a more violent impact on the enemy. Also in that portion of the screen, at the end of your health bar, there is also an area that is red. During the final round this area can change in color from red to blue, and allowing you to perform the ~Mu No Kyouchi~, a move that will greatly slow down your opponent's time and give you the high probability of hitting him repeatedly filling the screen literally splattered blood, present in great abundance in the game. An effective 2D Samurai Shodown 5 can count on a fairly good 2-D graphics, even if in some ways ~incomplete~. From an aesthetic point of view, in fact, the SNK-Playmore title stands out for a satisfying cosmetics as regards the characters, made with a good number of details, even if for the most part they are wrestlers from the previous episodes of the series that have just been retouched and refresh yourself for the occasion, and for the very successful animations. The characters design is therefore splendid, especially in the Pg selection avatars. On the other hand, the backdrops are slightly inferior, which while remaining on an acceptable level are a little thin if compared, for example, to those seen in Samurai Shodown 2, with few moving elements in the background and in some cases the absolute absence of even the good old parallax to give at least the feeling of depth of the areas through the simple overlapping of backgrounds. Many of these scenarios are not new, but have been recycled ~likewise~ from SS4. To save everything, and to make it, therefore, acceptable, as mentioned earlier, the good ~design~ of the environments, the spot-on chromatic choice of the same and the nice idea of spending time during the fights, with the sun alternating , in its phases, with the night. Brief note for the sound sector: in this case we are faced with an average product, with music suited to the needs of the case, to the stages, typical of fighting games, and of this one in particular, useful for partially recreating the atmosphere of the period history in which the clashes take place, and background effects already heard in the previous chapters of the saga. Conclusions It's difficultIt is difficult to give an opinion on a title conceptually from ~another era~ of video games without risking making the mistake of attributing too low an evaluation due to a non-~128 Bit~ technical realization. Samurai Shodown V is an ~old style~ title, one of those that brings very few innovations to the genre and indeed, it looks like the traditional Capcom school fighting game, that is, the one that apart from the suffix in the title and some slight additions and improvements does not offer nothing particularly different from its predecessors. Yet the SNK-Playmore title is liked, perhaps precisely for this reason, for this reason that it does not detach itself too much from the past. So we can't not recommend the title to lovers of the genre and to those who don't have the ~problem~ of playing with a title with 2D graphics. Pros: Excellent use of 2D Level of difficulty well calibrated Cons: Few innovations Dedicated especially to fans of the series The Samurai Shodown series (Samurai Spirits in Asia) is one of the longest-running and most famous sagas in the history of video games. Born in the 90s on the Neo Geo console, a machine with incredible potential but too underestimated by the masses, SNK's slash'em up at meetings contributed, together with a few other titles always created by internal teams to the producers of the aforementioned machine, to keep alive the same without the help of external developers. And this should already make it clear how SS is a respectable saga. Samurai Shodown is also a rather particular series of its kind. Since the first episode, it has always stood out for an intrinsic level of difficulty such as to make it not ~suitable~ for an audience of occasional gamers, that is, people usually used to short gaming sessions perhaps just to have a little fun doing ~barreled~ virtually, without however being excessively involved in calculations, particular strategies. Samurai Shodown is a title for true hardgamer, for fans of everything ~bread & fighting game~, in short, not for people who press random keys to get devastating combos or sweep moves enemies.", "date": "2006-03-22", "grade": null}
