Realizing this is quite easy, given that it is enough to take a look at the number of games dedicated to these nice creatures without even traveling too far back over the years. In the last five years, the success of The Walking Dead has certainly been the most resounding zombie-themed one, but also surprises such as State of Decay and the first How to Survive have been able to exploit their respective strengths to be welcomed by players. As for How to Survive, he has carved out space for himself by leveraging a good crafting system, obtaining good numbers that first led him towards a third-person review, and then set up a real sequel. EKO Software and 505 Games have thus created How to Survive 2, which has already arrived on PC for a few months and has also been available for PlayStation 4 for a few days (soon also for Xbox One). With a DualShock in hand and a rifle in the other, we are therefore back to being guided by the good Kovac towards survival. In How to Survive 2 even deer have become zombies: once again, Kovac is the only hope! Playstation 4 trophies The PlayStation 4 version of How to Survive 2 includes a total of fifty trophies, divided between a single platinum type, three gold, six silver and the rest bronze. Their typology ranges from all aspects of the game, with particular attention to the crafting system. However, there are also those devoted to action, such as the trophy dedicated to killing 5,000 zombies: good hunting. global infection The events shown in How to Survive 2 take place about fifteen years after those presented by the first chapter, within which the spread of zombies was confined to the island that offered its settings to the game. As you can imagine, in the meantime the infection has spread all over the world, thus giving the Parisian team the pretext to move the place where the events take place in the southern United States, to be exact in Louisiana. As we have also seen recently in Resident Evil 7, New Orleans and its surroundings (the famous bayou) are one of the most suggestive places to face a zombie epidemic, as well as more difficult due to the swampy terrain. Fortunately, to bring light into our darkness we find once again the good Kovac, an inexhaustible source of advice to survive and thrive thanks to the construction of a field equipped with all the comforts. The starting point is therefore one of the many swamps that are part of Louisiana, in which to put down the roots of our field without giving up incursions into more civilized places. The cue to go around is offered to us as we said by Kovac, who provides us with important information to get everything we need, presenting the search for the various materials in the form of a real quest. The Russian is actually not the only person with whom we find ourselves interacting in How to Survive 2, a title in which the narrative component is reduced to a few exchanges with the various living characters who still populate the area. At the center of the experience, as we said, there are the construction and upgrading of our field, for which making your way through crowds of zombies therefore becomes a necessity. It's not actually the only one, because How to Survive 2 doesn't forget those of the primary type, also making it necessary to procure food and liquids to keep your character alive. Compared to the first chapter, however, the need to sleep disappears. Haven't we met before? The main flaw of How to Survive 2 is to drop the player into a circle that smacks of dj vu, made up of somewhat similar missions carried out in places that after a while will be familiar to you for all the time you dedicate to this title . All this in defiance of what is actually a dynamic generation of the maps in which the missions take place, thanks to which, at least on paper, anyone who wants to should be able to indulge in a little healthy grinding to move forward. The theory unfortunately does not coincide with the practice, leading the player to go in search of novelties in the setting and in the dynamics which, however, arrive with a dropper. From this point of view, the contribution offered by the four-player cooperative mode, both locally and via the Internet, is fundamental, thanks to which it is possible to add to the game that panache that in single ends up missing rather soon. The survival dynamics are also to blame, too elementary to constitute an element of tension for those who have the joypad in hand: in a world devastated by zombies we would expect scarce supplies from centellinare, however How to Survive 2 proves to be very generous. Even too much, transforming the moments in which the game reminds us to eat and drink into annoying obstacles that stand between us and the success of the mission, without adding additional pathos to this. The lifeline of How to Survive 2 is its crafting system, a fundamental aspect that acts as the glue for all the efforts made in the various missions. In fact, everything we collect becomes material to be transformed to build buildings in our field, whether they are defensive fences or an armory to be exploited to make different types of weapons. Kovac's advice immediately directs us in this direction, using the experience points we accumulate in quests to raise the level of the camp, consequently also making that of our character raiseable. The customization of the latter is not exceptional, but it is still possible to choose from a fairly vast set of skills, which among the various ones includes a better effectiveness in the use of weapons of different types and physical skills capable of making a difference when is surrounded by zombies. As for the enemies, the artificial intelligence developed by EKO Software is not bad: the creatures react in fact quite effectively to our presence, moving in packs when possible with particular attention to any noises emitted by us. The absence of a real aiming system (just point the right stick towards an enemy and wait a few moments to guarantee yourself a headshot) takes away a bit of tension from the clashes of How to Survive 2 which, thanks to a not exactly exciting variety of enemy creatures, are rather monotonous, even boring at times. Cuckoo, the brick is gone! At first glance, the technical sector of How to Survive 2 looks pretty good, with a particular attention to detail both in external and internal environments. However, it is enough to spend a few hours in the company of the game to realize that what you see is more or less always similar to itself, starting from the appearance of the enemies to finishing with the furnishing elements and so on. The worst aspect, however, is related to the way in which the graphics engine manages the exploration phases indoors: instead of immediately making the walls transparent to give the player a clear view of the environment in which they are located, How to Survive 2 li it ~decomposes~ progressively, following the movement of the character. With an isometric view and a zoom of the shot at only two levels, in the most demanding situations, unfortunately, we also have to deal with a confusion that could certainly have been avoided. As for the game interface, the console version of How to Survive 2 inherits from the PC version the presence of a pointer to move with the left stick, impractical to press on the various buttons that populate the screens. Even on the latter, perhaps a better job of optimization could have been done, given that not always what we are looking for can be found without having wandered through the various sections.", "date": "2017-02-15", "grade": "6.0"}
