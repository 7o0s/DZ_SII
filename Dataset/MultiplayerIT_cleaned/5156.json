There is nothing to do, it is a fundamental law of the universe that establishes that the shooters developed by Infinity Ward inevitably have a greater charm, an aura of greatness capable of making them totally distinguishable from the others made by studios such as Sledgehammer and Treyarch . This is demonstrated by the attention with which the community follows each publication belonging to the saga, but also by the resources that Activision reserves for these projects, often characterized by larger budgets and wider development cycles. The Californian studio still collects the fruits matured from that extraordinary trilogy of shooters, capable of indelibly marking the youth of at least two generations of gamers, but the other side of this very heavy legacy is that each iteration has a very hard test ahead of it, that is to prove truly worthy of its immense lineage. The 2019 reboot had the merit of flying very close to the light emitted by the original chapters, and for this very reason Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 arrives on the market today driven by a quantity of expectations that are difficult to quantify, which find reason in the incredible opportunity that Infinity Ward had to refine the experience of three years ago to now package an even better Call of Duty. With the analysis of the campaign put in the safe, we hoarded energy drinks and spent the entire weekend face to face with the multiplayer sector of the new Infinity Ward shooter, with the aim of verifying and consolidating all the excellent sensations that emerged in the trial phase to translate them into a final and definitive judgment. The premises could lead us to the best Modern Warfare ever. Was it really like this? Find out in our Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 review. Mexico and clouds The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign represents one of the high points in the history of the franchise It's true, we had already told you about the campaign in our dedicated special, but we think it might be valuable to dedicate a short paragraph here to what are the main strengths and weaknesses of the single-player sector of the new Call of Duty. This year's edition is supported by a splendid campaign that must have enjoyed truly stellar production standards, so skilled is it in staging a tight international thriller that will take us to battle in Holland, Spain, the Middle East and the violent and brutal border between USA and Mexico. The campaign continues in the story of the exploits of the legendary Task Force 141 led by Captain Price, and in this sense we were not surprised to find all the most famous characters of the original trilogy such as Soap, Gaz and Ghost, who are explored here thanks to a very effective. Unfortunately, the events at the center of the single player sector are completely unrelated to the history of the original chapters, so forget about experiencing the thrill of hunting down enemies of the caliber of Zakhaev, Al Asad and Makarov again. This time, Price and his companions will try to thwart the plans of a totally new villain, Hassan Zyani, an Iranian terrorist who has stolen cruise missiles and has every intention of aiming them at American cities. As we said in the article, from a purely narrative point of view, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a significantly weaker campaign than that of the reboot, since in addition to lending itself to a few too many plot holes, it chooses to abandon those dark colors that have always characterized the series and made its stories unforgettable. However, it is on the playful front that this year's mode is configured as one of the best single player modes in the entire history of the franchise: all 17 missions that make up the campaign are divinely made, offer a great variety of scenarios and situations, and they bring into play unique gameplay dynamics that run out within that same level, like when we had to wander around a Mexican town scraping together resources and loot to build the tools necessary to survive the enemy. Some Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 missions are distantly reminiscent of the most famous levels of the original trilogy In short, if it had succeeded in associating all these qualities with a bolder narrative, this year's campaign would have been able to redraw the hierarchies of Modern Warfare, and in this sense the feeling that a great opportunity has been missed making Call of Duty history is dominant. But net of what could have been our expectations, the single player component of the game is acegreat value, and represents one of the indisputable strengths of the Infinity Ward production. Multiplayer gameplay: small improvements, no revolutions Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is supported by gameplay that is now the state of the art of shooters While on the one hand it has happened to us in more than one juncture to be surprised by the quality achieved by the campaign, after an intense weekend spent on multiplayer we must admit that on the gameplay front we really expected nothing less this year from the Californian studio. Having used the already excellent gameplay foundations laid in 2019 has allowed this time to Infinity Ward to focus on the details and to smooth out all those small defects that characterized the previous iteration, to arrive on the market today with a formula refined and perfected in every point of vista.The novelties are not so many, but every corner of the multiplayer now represents the state of the art of Call of Duty, as refined as the gaming experience. As could be expected, this is characterized by all those philosophical elements that have always governed the shooters of the American company: the gameplay of Modern Warfare 2 is significantly slower and more formal than in Vanguard and Cold War, the time to kill is perceptibly more low, and generally the winners in a firefight are those who carefully control the lines of fire, rather than players accustomed to aggressively jumping and sliding around the corners of the environment. There are several new accessories and field upgrades that give a more strategic cut to the gameplay of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 The new movement system is perhaps the most accurate index to understand how the gameplay of this chapter is one of the slowest in the saga. Although the pace of the action still remains quite frenetic, Infinity Ward has chosen to radically modify the way in which one moves around the map, completely removing the slide cancel mechanic and significantly weakening the effectiveness of the bunny hop, two movement techniques much loved by the so-called ~rushers~, those players who tend to run around the setting to attack their opponents. As if that weren't enough, Modern Warfare 2 marks the debut of at least two new gameplay elements, which also refer to a style of movement oriented more towards the strategic exploitation of the setting than the frenetic race towards the next kill. The first is related to the unprecedented opportunity to remain climbed on a ledge, to peek on the other side and fire the secondary weapon at any enemies hidden behind it, while the second is the dive, a very different feature from the classic dropshot, which allows you to throw yourself on the ground to escape explosions or other threats. Both of these innovations, due to a latent static nature, often leave the character exposed to enemy fire, and it is precisely for this reason that we have seen them rarely used during the many hours spent in the company of Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer.The other faction which has always been opposed to the rushers, that of the campers, however, is not doing so well, given that now the perks such as Ghost and Cold blood are stuck between the shirts of a totally new system that regulates their attribution during a game. If in the past we had all the freedom to equip our class with three specialties that remained active from the start to the end of a match, now we can choose up to four, but they will begin to produce their effects in the course of a round. while accumulating match points. Those categorized as basic will be available immediately, while the bonus specialties from about mid-round, and include perks such as Cold Blooded, Inflexible and Quick Hands. The supreme ones, which instead are unlocked only in the last quarter of a match, also include Ghost among others, which means that in the new Modern Warfare we will inevitably find ourselves exposed to enemy UAVs for most of the match, for the sake of those who loves to hide and snipe. Game modes and map designs One of the most impactful settings of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 takes us to fight on the border between Mexico and the USA Like any self-respecting Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2 at launch also features the classic battery of 6-on-6 multiplayer playlists always present in any chapter of the series. However, alongside modes such as Team Deathmatch, Free for all, Domination and Search & Destroy, there are some noteworthy innovations that in some cases have also been able to win our enthusiasm. What surprises us most are the modes with the third-person viewona, which during the beta had instead left room for some perplexity. Infinity Ward has followed the feedback from the community and removed the aim through the viewfinder replacing it with a comfortable cross, and in this guise the playlist instead embodies a very fresh alternative to the typical gameplay of the series. The new Knock out and Rescue prisoners are also interesting: both have respawns disabled, and offer an exquisitely more tactical experience than the other modes. In the first, the two teams compete for a bag of money placed in the center of the map, while in the second, two hostages must be extracted while the opponents try to prevent it. 32 players which is presented here in a version not so different from the one encountered in the first Modern Warfare. Once again, vehicles have a huge weight in the economy of the match, and the good news is that the playlist indirectly benefits from the work that Infinity War has addressed in reshaping the guidance system of Warzone 2.0. The entire vehicle sector is much more refined, their maneuverability is light years ahead of the past, and there is a greater variety of vehicles available to players. Born as a rib of this playlist, in the new chapter we also find Invasion, a team deathmatch variation of War on Earth, which also includes the presence of bots governed by AI capable of offering a different challenge from human players. Invasion will never be able to conquer the more hardcore fringe of the community (as indeed Earth War never succeeded), but it represents a reference mode for those who want to take a break from more competitive games, and in this sense its introduction is very important. The new underwater gameplay is used very little, since water is only present in one map of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 The 2019 reboot had the same incredibly well-finished gameplay that we find in this edition, but combined it with a map package that never managed to be fully appreciated by the community. The settings had a great charm, it is true, but in an attempt to get away from the concept of the three lanes which already appeared very dmod in 2019, Infinity Ward ended up making the design of each map too complex and unbalanced. The studio has learned from its mistakes, to the point that each of the 10 6v6 arenas of the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a small masterpiece of level design and balancing, even if the charisma that distinguished the previous maps has been lost chapter. The current ones are in fact all a bit generic with some rare exceptions, and there is none, for example, taken from the legendary settings of the second chapter of the trilogy. New maps will arrive at the launch of Season 1 on November 16, and we can't wait to see if there are some old community acquaintances among them. Never before so much customization in a Call of Duty This is what the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 gunsmith looks like Up to now we have told you about a multiplayer sector that all in all goes in the direction of continuity with those of recent years, but what is really able to break with the past is the enormous amount of weapons present in this chapter, as well as the very high degree of customization that derives from a paradigm shift that is nothing short of epochal. Already in 2019 the reboot had revolutionized the way in which weapons are accessorized with the introduction of the gunsmith, and now Modern Warfare 2 is preparing to reveal to the world what the Call of Duty of the next few years will be like, because by this standard go further back.A good 50 weapons are included in this edition, and if this already represents a small record, wait to find out how many accessories each of these can wear in the new Gunsmith 2.0. Infinity Ward has chosen to transform what was the typical linear progression of Call of Duty into an intertwined progression between all the weapons present in the game, which means that to obtain all the accessories of a very common M4 we will be forced to level even very different weapons from assault rifles, as mods like silencers and scopes are now shared across platforms. This revolution, in our view simply brilliant, will encourage the community to try new solutions within the very large arsenal of Modern Warfare 2, and since the accessories are now shared between multiple weapons, their number has significantly increased. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 there will be different types of Kalashnikovs, but to unlock them where", "date": "2022-11-01", "grade": "8.5"}
