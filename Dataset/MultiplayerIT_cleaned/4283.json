Unfortunately, Clash But Whole didn't quite succeed: if you've read our review, then you'll know that we really liked the new combat system, while the story seemed a little more sluggish than the prequel. In the next few lines we will tell you if the long wait for the Switch version was worth it. Are you vulgar? It is difficult to place the South Park superhero stories in an official mythology, because these are deliberately exaggerated episodes that usually make fun of the Marvel or DC Comics franchises. In Clash of the Di-retti Cartman - back in the Coon costume - intends to find a lost cat and invest the meager reward in the cinematographic serialization of his adventures. Obviously it doesn't make sense and the children of the charming town seem to take the story a little too seriously, even going so far as to fight in a feud between the super group of the Coon and that of the Friends of Freedom. In the middle of this ~civil war~ is us, as the Newbie who arrived in South Park in The Stick of Truth. The Fractured But Whole is a true sequel but anyone can play it without having to complete the previous episode first. However, we must admit that the first few hours are a bit sluggish: the plot remains without a precise direction for a long time and develops in a succession of main and secondary missions that are almost completely unrelated to each other. Then, however, something clicks, and it almost seems that the two screenwriters decide to throw themselves headlong into the superhero storyline without paying attention to satire or moralism. Fans will probably love the quotes and the way their minions interact on screen, but admittedly, The But Whole is less laughable than The Stick of Truth and overall, Matt and Trey pushed a little more. on the ~politically correct~. In short, Clash But Whole is another super big bet in South Park, even if not among the most brilliant. You too! The Clash But Whole is also reminiscent of the ~Metroidvania~ style: as you complete the main and side missions, the Rookie unlocks specific abilities that grant access to previously inaccessible areas. His farts are capable of rewinding or stopping time, and he can summon supporting actors to reach elevated platforms, clear busy passageways, sabotage electronic circuits, or simply remove various obstacles. Each skill wheel involves solving a simple mini-game that makes the experience always interactive, even if a little repetitive in the long run. The process is more or less the same for the twenty hours necessary to complete the adventure, but there is no shortage of variety: in addition to the more complex main missions, we will be able to engage in the search for dozens of yaoi illustrations, souvenirs or lost cats. The Fractured But Whole also offers a fairly basic crafting system that allows you to craft consumables, costumes, or artifacts. The costumes are simple visual frills that serve to customize the appearance of the Newbie, while the artifacts represent the actual equipment, in fact they increase values such as damage inflicted, maximum health and so on. The leveling phase is also strongly interconnected with the development of the story, since the enemies that roam South Park are few and easily circumvented, the missions revolve more often around puzzles than obligatory fights and experience points are earned above all by completing the numerous objectives secondary. Despite this, the combat system is one of the best features of the game. By pressing the keys at the right time it is possible to increase the damage that is inflicted or decrease that which is received; during the turns of our characters - a maximum of four - we can also move within a limited area and employ various powers that profoundly differentiate the various protagonists and their roles in battle. Some characters possess very particular abilities and changing formations in search of the best synergies is a lot of fun, especially thanks to the arsenal of the Newbie, who begins by choosing a certain class and ends up learning the powers of a second, a third and finally , any other possible power. Experimentation is a must, especially during more challenging boss fights that require particular strategies, often centered around unique mechanics or locationstactical minds. The fights in Scontri di-retti are usually long but fun and never prohibitive, thanks also to a series of small tricks and touches of class that increase their strategic depth. The possibility of using the touch screen in the portable mode of Switch also makes them more interactive, but unfortunately this is the only exclusive feature of the Nintendo console: the Switch version of Clash But Whole is, in fact, absolutely identical to those already on the market , in every respect, except for the uploads that seemed significantly longer to us and some annoying bugs that will be fixed by an update already in the works.", "date": "2018-05-02", "grade": "8.2"}
