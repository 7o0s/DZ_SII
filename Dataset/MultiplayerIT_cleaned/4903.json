{"name": "Cuori di Tenebra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182570-outlast-2-cuori-di-tenebra.html", "text": "A few years ago the small American developer Red Barrels released Outlast, a first-person horror game set in a psychiatric hospital with a very simple structure and almost entirely focused on the idea of scaring the player as in the most classic tradition, by jumping on the chair , chases and a tension built solely through visual devices. In short, the developers were able to build a terrifying experience with a cinematic cut like few others, wisely using visually suggestive areas, the classic jumps on the chair and permeating the adventure with an oppressive and anything but delicate atmosphere that acted on the nerves and forced the player to be constantly on the alert and therefore very sensitive to any kind of sudden stimulus. In short, a simple, smart and perfected project, which proved to be a success and sold enough copies to guarantee the creation of a DLC first, and a sequel now, that is to say Outlast 2. We have already reviewed the title in PC version, but it's time to see how it performs on consoles as well. Outlast 2 s confirms a frightening roller coaster ride of terror on PlayStation 4 as well Blood red grain Outlast 2 follows a completely different storyline than its predecessor, as it tells the story of Blake Langermann, a cameraman who travels with his partner, Lynn, to a village located in the canyons of Arizona to investigate the tragedy involving a pregnant woman of unknown identity. However, the area where the town is located is quite inaccessible, so the couple decides to reach the objective by helicopter, which however due to a strange event crashes and ends up separating them. Blake finds himself alone, at the gates of a village much more disturbing than it was legitimate to think. A gloomy, dark place with a gloomy and ~heavy~ atmosphere, where the poor cameraman soon becomes the prey of dark forces and disturbing characters, and will therefore have to find a way to survive, find his wife and escape the horror in which he is been catapulted. Outlast 2 stages a story where the horror is more psychological, where the deepest abysses of the human mind are in some ways plumbed, with a plot partly inspired by real events, such as the Jonestown massacre (an alleged mass suicide whose details are still unexplained today), but which probably also winks at stories such as Thomas Tryon's Harvest Festival and Stephen King's Children of the Corn, just to name a few. All skillfully placed at the service of a gameplay that does not revolutionize the formula of the first chapter, but uses it as a basis for building a title with a solid structure and better finished in certain aspects. The game mechanics, in fact, allow as in the predecessor to do very little apart from running away and hiding, and the interactions with the environment therefore remain the usual ones: it is possible to hide in the tall grass, in barrels full of water, at least as long as breathing permits, and in the lockers, moving with circumspection, alert, often forced to stop for a moment in silence, to listen to a moan or footsteps that could betray the presence of an enemy not yet in range. This always with the awareness that sometimes it will be necessary to repeat the same area several times, given the ~trial and error~ mechanism and the ease with which one dies, which certainly feed a certain frustration. Fortunately Outlast 2 features a fairly generous checkpoint system. In short, in terms of mechanics there are no huge innovations, but simple as interesting tweaks. For example, to probe the darkness, as always, you need to use the camera, which this time requires the use of rechargeable batteries and therefore cannot be used constantly, but in addition to night vision, it now also has microphones that can be used to listen to the noises, very useful when Blake cannot look out of his hiding place to avoid being discovered but still wants to know which way some enemy has gone or is going. The camera is also used to film important sequences that delve into certain aspects of the plot and which also serve as collectibles. For the rest, dimensions of the areas and locations aside, nothing is missing from the first Outlast, from the ~jump scare~ intelligently managed by the developers to the artfully created moments of panic, when the user has to try to escape but taken by the anxiety and from the imminent threat, he does not know which way to flee. Playstation 4 trophies In its PlayStation 4 incarnation, Outlast 2 offers the public 25 Trophies: 8 are the bronze ones, 9 the silver ones, 7 the gold ones and one of Platinum. To get them you have tofollow the adventure and perhaps complete it at various levels of difficulty, or without hiding in barrels or wardrobes, by collecting a certain number of documents or completing all registrations. The children of Evil In short, the development team once again demonstrates its ability to play with the psychology of its users, leading them by the hand, almost, first to feel a false sense of security and then suddenly terrify them, or bring them to the limit of tension and then hit them when they least expect it. This is not only thanks to the structure of the game, but also to the skilful direction that ~moves~ the various elements that make up the story, and which rest the foundations on an excellent level design capable of proposing well-chosen scenarios and rather suggestive settings, where there are even disturbing images. The old Unreal Engine 3 (here significantly modified) does its job well, and guarantees a certain stability also on PlayStation 4, where at 1080p we have a stable frame rate at 60fps and a good general fluidity. The textures that cover the characters and the various areas are overall good, certainly favored by the presence of many dark areas which therefore allow the game to mask any imperfections, especially on those at a certain distance. Then the play of light and (a lot of) shadow, and the atmospheric effects which, especially in the external areas, characterized by gloomy and sometimes distressing atmospheres, where it almost seems to perceive a threat around every corner, further confer a terrible feeling of disorientation, of fear. Of a situation with no way out, with the darkness that envelops everything and a mist that when it appears seems to plunge the protagonist into a parallel world. Certainly also thanks to the good use of sound effects, which literally accompany the protagonist in his uncertain gait towards his goal with sinister and sudden noises, moans and other surrounding elements, in fact forcing the user to often strain his ears for fear to see some monster pounce on you. All of this is corroborated by a spot-on sound sector, able to really make the difference, which adds a series of atmospheric music to the background noises that go well with each area available in the adventure, when needed, capable of further pushing the gamer in an abyss of madness and tension, as well as making him jump on his chair even higher accompanying a scary scene. Of course, the tension will be the user's companion for the entire duration of the adventure, and the feeling of disturbance, of ~annoyance~ for certain events, will remain imprinted for a while in his mind together with certain music, even after having stopped playing.", "date": "2017-04-28", "grade": "8.5"}
