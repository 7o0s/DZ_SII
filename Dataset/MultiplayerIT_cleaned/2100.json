{"name": "Army Men RTS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/army-men-rts.html", "text": "Let's play The plot is easy to tell: due to an accident, a general who is a bit of a loser happens to have a piece of his head melt (they are made of plastic eh!) thus becoming a bit crazy. Surrounded by his most faithful soldiers, he takes the side of the enemy with the aim of conquering the supremacy of the home garden! An act of insubordination of this magnitude can only be seen very badly by the upper echelons of the army, in fact the foremen will instruct us to regain control of the situation, and above all to bring back the villainous general. All this will take place through fifteen fairly linear missions, but which will reserve some not bad surprises. Each mission will be considered concluded once the objectives established in the briefing preceding the battle have been achieved, it should be noted that there are two types of objectives; some fundamental ones without the achievement of which the mission is not declared completed, others instead optional, the achievement of which is optional, but which, if completed, guarantee the acquisition of medals, which are used to unlock the ~secret~ levels of the game. In addition to the actual battle, in fact, there is a section dedicated to ~historical battles~: special missions whose outcome is an end in itself and which can be played in any order, provided, however, that you have earned the necessary medals during the linear campaign . Either way, a real RTS Real-time strategy enthusiasts will be happy to know that although the concept of the game is much more goliardic and ironic than other titles in the category, Army Men RTS does not deviate from the standard of the genre at all. In fact, our tasks will be the same as with other titles: search for resources, produce units and evolve. As far as resources are concerned, only two are necessary for our purposes: plastic and electricity. The first (essential for building our units) can be found from the most varied objects scattered in the garden and in the house that form the setting for the entire game: toy robots, the container for dog food, even the corpses of war dead reduced to deformed plastic blobs. Electricity can instead be recovered from abandoned flashlights, batteries, radios, etc. In any case, the collection of resources does not represent a bogeyman for the player, in fact once the means suitable for recovering them have been created, one will no longer have to worry about following the progress of production. Naturally we will have to commit ourselves to building the structures suitable for the production of our units, be they soldiers or vehicles, and we will be amply rewarded by their evolution as they are upgraded. The typical mission consists in conquering and destroying the enemy base, but we will often find ourselves in command of a small handful of specialized men, to complete some special mission. The section dedicated to historical battles does not provide an edge to the game, but to the rescue of its longevity is provided by the multiplayer mode, which unfortunately remains the only reason to recall the title once the linear campaigns are over. Do we really have to make a judgment? Technically speaking, therefore, this title would have all the potential to establish itself. The background is gorgeous and full of humour, the game designer gave vent to all their imagination, giving us really well done settings (the kitchen table drove me crazy with the various pieces of food scattered here and there and the buzzing flies around seen from a microscopic view it's cool!) and full of well-designed elements, a pity however that most of these do not allow interactivity, thus doing only and exclusively for decoration. In a nutshell, it seems that the developers wanted to create the most classic of RTs, following the canonical rules of the genre, and not exploiting (in my opinion a masochistic choice) the potential that the title could have had thanks to its so ~playful~ background. In terms of game techniques and depth Army Men is not comparable to the champions of the genre, like many other titles it suffers from the ~crowd~, in fact many missions are resolved in a jumble of men and vehicles difficult to move along the field of battle, without the slightest trace of strategy. The difficulty of the missions is therefore minimal; we will almost always succeed in annihilating our enemy without losing much time, among other things. Sound is part of the standard, even if I found it a bit ~jerky~, in any case it's not bad. The sympathy and irony that characterize the various characters is undoubted, the interlude films and some missions are bursting with laughter; the clichs are all there, from the angry sergeant to the deminer who tries in every way to get away with it, to the rambo of the situation, etc. Conclusions If only sympathy were enough to make a game's fortune, then Army Men would become a success, but unfortunately this is not the case. Let me be clear, A. M. is still a game worthy of being included in the RTS field, but precisely because of its so ~user-friendly~ interface, its well-made graphics and its few pretensions, I would offer it to an audience for the first time on the world of RTS, A.M. in fact, it would be an ideal training ground before trying more demanding titles, the regret remains for the potential that the game's background offered, and which if they had been exploited properly would certainly have made it a game of the highest level. Fierce battles await usin the home Do you remember the multifaceted and colorful armies of plastic toy soldiers to which we devoted so much time during our childhood games? Well... dry your eyes from the tears and let's enjoy their return together this time in a form of game more suited to the times we are living... In fact, in March the fierce ~armies~ of the little green men invaded our screens, with the intention, it would seem, to be heard. Again, as in its predecessor (Army Men, ed.) A.M. RTS is preparing to make us relive the long battles simulated in our childhood, but the war theater will not be made up of beaches, airfields, hills ... etc., but more prosaic courtyards, gardens, bathrooms and living rooms. To a careful eye, Army Men RTS would seem to fully realize the real vocation of animated plastic soldiers, that is war, harsh and ruthless but always seasoned with a large slice of irony. The developers of the Pandemic, those of Dark reign 2 to be clear, had the brilliant and perfectly fitting idea of replicating some historical battlefields and the most famous titles of ~war~ cinematography, however adapting them to the home environment, the first clear proof of which is mission entitled ~The thin green line~, a clear reference to one of the most famous titles on the subject that arrived on the big screen.", "date": "2002-06-08", "grade": null}
