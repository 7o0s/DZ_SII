{"name": "Samurai Shodown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-shodown-recensione.html", "text": "The past two years have been a phenomenal roller coaster ride for video games, driven to breakneck speeds by the staggering growth of development teams across the globe. Japan, in particular, has contributed enormously thanks to a widespread desire for revenge by its software houses, which has led to the heroic rebirth of some big names (such as Capcom), and prompted the reorganization of certain houses plagued by the chaos of previous years (Square Enix). Even teams with fewer resources have bounced back strongly, and among these even a name has reappeared that fighting game fans can only remember with love: SNK. And please, in the specific case just mentioned it is not possible to speak of projects with the media buzz and the investments of a Monster Hunter World or a Final Fantasy 7 Remake behind them, but at least this team of development veterans is looking for to return to being a leading name in the genre where it previously belonged to the dominating group, relaunching some of its best known brands in a similar way to how some of their main rivals have revived theirs. To be exact, the ~copied~ strategy in this case is precisely that of Capcom, but we are not talking about recent successes, but about the choices made during the development of that Street Fighter 4 which according to many brought fighting games back into the spotlight by starting a second golden age for lovers of virtual beatings. However, SNK has not touched the King of Fighters, curiously going to act on a much more ~particular~ saga, although equally recognizable. Ladies and gentlemen, the name of the exhumed is Samurai Shodown, and today we intend to explain to you in detail what to expect from this new incarnation. The sword hurts more than the pen You may be wondering why we have united this reboot (if it can be defined that way) of Samurai Shodown to Street Fighter, and the answer is not simply ~the graphic style~, even if the game treated is inspired in turn by Japanese paintings and exploits a form of Cel Shading extremely close to that of Capcom's work. No, the reasons are to be found in the gameplay, because this new chapter in turn tries to embrace the roots of the original combat systems of the series, rejuvenating them with new mechanics and a general rebalancing of the fighters. The operation here is actually more nostalgic: Street Fighter 4 was very close to the classics, but remixed everything with rather unique additional mechanics; SNK's latest work, on the other hand, largely refers to the Samurai Shodown II system, and takes care of perfecting it by eliminating its weaknesses. Samurai Shodown, after all, have always been fighting games very different from the crowd, focused on the management of defense, distances and fundamentals, and capable of fielding battles strongly conditioned by the very high damage of the moves, and by the high possibility of discovering each other with many of the shots available to the fighters. This return does not stray from this formula, but modernizes it by handling things in a less crazy hardcore way (there are high-level fights from the old chapters where players literally stood still until the last second of the rounds, waiting for a tiny mistake calculation of their opponent). All this, of course, does not mean that the new Samurai Shodown is not a technical title, quite the contrary. Although slightly more relaxed than the very first chapters, we are still talking about a video game where the spectacularity of complex combinations and excesses in mobility have been completely replaced by a tactical approach to each attack and by the perfect management of defensive maneuvers, in order to deliver that blow decisive capable of closing a match. In short, we are faced with a fighting game where reasoning and patience are the masters, and hitting keys at random or getting nervous means certain death. If you don't believe it, just take a look at the defensive maneuvers on offer: perfect saves? There are, and they are very important for counterattacking (as well as offering the chance to immediately push the enemy away with a shoulder); do you dodge? Present even if only on the spot, and useful for taking an overly aggressive opponent by surprise; and to strain our nerves even more we also have the possibility of disarming the opponent with a technique that requires impeccable timing to be placed, as well as doing it again once we are left with our bare hands. One hit is enough, if you have the fury As for the offensive, as we said, the last Samurai Shodown is not designed for those who like to spend hours in training mode atthe search for spectacular combos, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't still allow you to bring attacks of rare spectacularity. The game has a system similar to that of many other Japanese fighting games, with four types of attack divided into light, medium and powerful, with kicks completing the circle. These strikes do not automatically link together however, and it is indeed extremely complex to execute series of more than two attacks with normal moves, therefore each combination is simply based on the execution of specific special attacks after some normals (usually only the power ones medium, because the strongest ones can almost never be canceled in a special move) or on maneuvers that launch into the air guaranteeing an assault immediately afterwards. Not bad anyway, because this is a title where a couple of well-placed hits or a basic three-attack combination can easily send you to half your life points, not counting the incredible damage of single powerful attacks (risky if parried even normally, but usually have enormous range and exaggerated power). In a nutshell, everything is designed to inculcate in the player a little healthy ~fear~ of enemy lunges, and the awareness that taking too many risks here costs much more than in other fighting games. Consider then that the game also offers super capable of disarming the opponent once the ~rage~ indicator is filled (the activation of which also increases the damage, just to round up the dose), specific specials that are enhanced when this is on fire , other alternate super moves that can be used only once that do not disarm but do even more disasters, and even a very fast ~execution attack~ that sometimes takes up to three quarters of life but sacrifices the rage bar; all mechanics perfectly capable of overturning a match that seemed already decided. The matches, in this very peculiar creature of SNK, can suddenly become absolutely unpredictable, and it doesn't matter if the ability to predict the opponent's tactics and adaptation often pay off more here than in any other fighting game. At times, Samurai Shodown really feels like a samurai duel to the death. Deprive yourself of everything, for bushido The gameplay of the game is therefore promoted as far as we are concerned: the Samurai Shodown system is undoubtedly an acquired taste not suitable for everyone, yet this adaptation is so solid and unique that it can serenely carve out a space for itself in a sector that is crammed with games high level. The problems of the SNK title reside elsewhere, in this case in the contents, rather reduced if we consider the trends of direct competition. The baby of the Japanese house is in fact not only classic on a mechanical level, but also in the approach, and outside of a list of traditional modes seen and seen - Time Trial, Survival, and the classic Tutorial - offers little apart from a basic online (ranked and unranked matches, end of surprises) and a story mode devoid of the slightest peculiarity. We didn't expect much else: SNK doesn't sail in gold, and it would have been impossible to produce a title with the production values of the last Mortal Kombat for the house; however we still naively hoped for a flash capable of surprising us, and we certainly did not find it in the (however interesting) Dojo mode. This latest gimmick is nothing but a list of clashes designed to train an artificial intelligence based on the tendencies of each player, thus creating opponents driven by the CPU but significantly more evolved than normal. The idea is curious in theory, and could increase the longevity of the game (although the data is retrieved online anyway, so it's not a strictly single-player option), however - most likely due to the limited number of players in the ranking on which to base the growth of A.I. at the time of writing - we didn't notice any major displays of cunning from the challenged ~ghosts~, not even from the few high-ranking ones we could find. The dojo has therefore left us a little chilly, and we doubt that things would have changed even in the case of extraordinarily difficult opponents; we therefore fell back almost immediately on online clashes, which as usual will be the only thing capable of keeping the title alive for a long time. And here we would like to be able to sing the praises of the netcode, and rejoice in your company of the impeccable maintenance of the servers, but unfortunately, having tested everything pre-release we have not found many opponents, and the games we played went from ~worthy~ to ~slightly unstable~. We want to be confident, of course... only that we have challenged European players, and we would have expected a better overall performance. Don't haveinstead I love nothing negative to say about the technical sector: SNK does not yet have an impeccable mastery of 3D and certain naiveties point it out, but Samurai Shodown still has an infinitely better visual impact than that of the last King of Fighters, and its ability to ooze Japan from every frame absolutely won us over. It may not be the prettiest fighting game around, but it's fluid, has style to spare, and is perfectly suited to the name it bears. Even the not particularly large roster convinced us, because we saw smaller lists at launch, we liked the chosen warriors more than ever and the first fighter pack (a gift in case of purchase before June 30th, which is good and right ) promises a significant increase in fighters in a short time.", "date": "2019-06-24", "grade": "8.2"}
