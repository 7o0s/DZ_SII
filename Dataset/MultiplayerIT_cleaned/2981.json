{"name": "Battle Legion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-legion-recensione.html", "text": "The Battle Legion review puts us in front of a new autobattler with a fantasy setting, in this case made for iOS and Android devices by Traplight and available for free in the traditional freemium format. The idea behind the experience is undoubtedly tantalizing: give life in fast clashes that begin with a few dozen units on the battlefield and then extend to much more numerous troops, which automatically face each other after we have placed them in the scenario. As per tradition for the genre, our intervention is limited to the strategic mechanics behind the release, selection, upgrading and positioning of the warriors, who can belong to many different classes. Gameplay A short tutorial quickly illustrates the main elements of Battle Legion, which from a stylistic point of view draws a bit from the blockbuster Clash Royale and a bit from other mobile productions, however putting together an interface that is immediately simple and easy to read . In fact, to change opponents, it is enough to ~scroll~ vertically to the right side of the screen, the one where the enemy army finds itself, and as mentioned at the beginning, the clashes are very rapid: they last twenty seconds or less. Exactly like in the classic Clash of Clans, the starting position of the units has an important influence on the possible outcome of the match, which takes place in the context of a strictly asynchronous multiplayer: on the other hand we will find the troops organized by a user, not himself but in real time manages them. It makes perfect sense, given that it is precisely an autobattler. In any case, once the battle has begun we will be able to do nothing but cross our fingers or, at worst, learn something: walls can create interesting occasions in which to inflict damage without suffering any, at least for a while, while dogs take out quickly the archers who are usually found in the second lines. Then there are the brutes who can keep several soldiers at bay at the same time: it is advisable to use them well. The problem with Battle Legion lies in a freemium connotation that is a little too stingy: the paywall can already be perceived after a handful of games, when our small army can no longer win and the coins and items earned are not enough to recruit new troops or upgrade those in our possession. There is a 5.49 euro Season Pass that solves many of these problems, but the concept is that playing for free is not very simple, on the contrary. Technical realization The introductory screens of Battle Legion suggest a title with a strong characterization and there is no doubt that the interface has been well done, however derivative. However, once in the middle of the actual action, one is left a little disappointed by the actual quality of the characters and scenarios, a disappointment mitigated only by the great variety of content. new scenarios, but also different skins and aesthetic elements with which we will be able to make our troops visually unique and different from the others. Of course, even here the attempts to monetize are wasted, but they are understandable: the problem, as mentioned, lies in the inevitable grinding that is already evident in the first hours of the game and which prevents us from proceeding quickly towards the phase in which the battles involve up to one hundred units per side.", "date": "2020-08-01", "grade": "7.0"}
