Electronic Arts has chosen precisely these disciplines to give life in a short period to a series of two titles capable of exploiting and showing off the capabilities of the new Nintendo peripheral, the Motion Plus. And if with Grand Slam Tennis the result was what for many it is the most realistic simulation ever made between balls and rackets, so it only remains to see if the American company has managed to reach the same heights of excellence with Tiger Woods 10. One more twist Just like Grand Slam Tennis itself, even Tiger Woods 10 does not necessarily require Motion Plus, but simply supports it by offering in this case a deeper and more precise control. What does this mean in practice? The differences are actually very substantial, and such as to transform a competent but ~traditional~ golf game into an authentic new experience. First of all, the leap forward is more than sensitive on the occasion of close-up shots, those that require greater precision; anyone who is familiar with golf (real or virtual), or simply who played last year's episode, is well aware of how important it is to perfectly calibrate the force impressed on the shot when you are on the green with putter in hand. If in Tiger Woods 09 the Wiimote was often not sufficient to translate the player's actions in an ideal way, on the contrary this year with the Motion Plus there is really no possibility of blaming the errors on the inconsistency of the controller. The new ~Precision Putting~ option makes the action practically identical to that of real sport, with centimeter detection of the opening of the shot and the impact force with the ball. In the same way, on the occasion of longer range shots, the peripheral comes into play allowing you to give the effect, draw or fade, with relative variation of the trajectory in a completely realistic way. In fact, it is enough to rotate the wrist and then the Wiimote inwards or outwards to obtain the result just described, thus amplifying the user's interaction and consequently his level of identification with the virtual alter ego. Certainly a fidelity of this level to the ~real~ experience also brings with it that physical commitment which for some could represent a deterrent; to make a swing at maximum power it takes a lot of energy, and in the prospect of a session of one or two hours the fatigue - we assure you - makes itself felt. Certainly Tiger Woods 10 also allows a totally classic approach, lying on the sofa in relaxation, simply by connecting the nunchuck; but frankly it would really be a waste given the quality of the control system via Motion Plus. Lots of irons in the fire We prefer to linger only for the time necessary on the flood of options and methods available; the amount of opportunities offered to the player that the guys from Tiburon have added over the years is truly incredible, and if you have the strength and desire to dissect them all, you can spend whole months in front of the TV. Among the most interesting features is the connection via the internet to provide the weather situation in real time on the various game courses; but obviously the support for the large network is not limited to this, and exactly on the line of Grand Slam Tennis also Tiger Woods 10 offers a robust, customizable and above all reliable online multiplayer. Sorry that the WiiSpeak is not supported in any way, but it is clear that discussing with one's opponents on the Nintendo console is still a concept often linked to science fiction. On the other hand, no Friend Code, in the hope that this anachronistic and very boring method will soon be destined for retirement. Exclusive to this Wii edition there is also the Disc Golf mode, in a nutshell a reinterpretation of the sport in which instead of a club and balls there is a Frisbee, and instead of a hole a kind of basket. To shoot the puck, the natural movement must be done exactly as in the similar mode of Wii Sports Resort; the result is a really fun diversion, especially in multiplayer. Speaking instead of the technical component, it is evident how the graphic engine is practically the same as in past editions, only minimally retouched; the result is satisfactory in practically everything except in the textures, washed out and with dull colors. Functional and nothing more the commentary, which unfortunately is completely in English exactly like all the rest of the game, with the only exception of the packaging and very thin manual; we understand forIt is clear that golf is not exactly the most popular sport in Italy, but avoiding localization certainly does not favor the opposite trend but, on the contrary, risks alienating non-English speakers.", "date": "2009-07-17", "grade": "9.0"}
