All's well that ends badly one would say, except that the pirates of Flotsam Island steal the old Threepwood to take him to court, where he will have to defend himself against charges of crimes never committed. Without going into too much detail, we tell you that this trial could have come from the pen of Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) in terms of bizarreness, paradoxes, and nonsense. The episode in question, which has the task of preparing the ground for the grand finale, brings back all the characters seen so far, and is in fact set on Flotsom Island, where it all began. Also making an appearance is another hurray, con man Stan, whose elegant gab is worth more than a smile. The fourth is also the most delusional episode - yes, it surpasses even the walrus - and puts a lot of irons in the fire; maybe too much. If it weren't for the hilarious trial, you might as well forget about this chapter soon. The background story develops well, but many elements are struggling to take off, especially in terms of humor. Let's just hope that this sense of dj vu that we felt in many sections disappears in the fifth chapter. It would be a shame if the series ended with dwindling applause. Curiosity Tales of Monkey Island is a series composed of five chapters and inspired by a saga of the nineties, The Secret of Monkey Island. The work is carried on by Telltale, with the collaboration of a large part of the original team. The episodes are released on a monthly basis and from time to time you can read the review on Multiplayer.it. NOTE: At launch, all Tales of Monkey Island episodes are available in English only. After some time, Telltale releases translations of the subtitles in other European languages, but there is still no official announcement about the timing. Those for the PC version cannot be purchased separately, unlike what happens for the Wii. Try again Stan The story written for Tales of Monkey Island Episode 4: The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood is wide-ranging and doesn't focus on just one character, making room for everyone from Elaine to De Singe. The puzzles seem to want to follow the dilated rhythm of the narrative, leaving us free to carry on more than one at a time. The best example is that of the trial: after we have managed to obtain the freedom to go around the island with a trick, we can decide which accusation to dedicate ourselves to, and move on to the next one if we find ourselves blocked. Even in the second part, when we set off in search of nutrients for La Esponja Grande, the path to follow does not have a pre-established order. It may be entirely subjective, but we also found this episode to be the hardest; we got stuck on a couple of puzzles for a long time, especially the one where you don't have to click on something very particular to solve it (would you like to know which one is true? But nothing). The fact of having numerous puzzles open in different locations virtually cancels the possibility of trying the objects empirically with all that is selectable, unless you want to spend a couple of hours like this - Umberto tried to extort the editor the confession that he used Google to finish the game, but the wretch resisted. This greater difficulty is a good thing anyway, given how quickly the previous chapters were chewed. Sadly not all ideas are brilliant, and with the exception of Stan, there is little laughing matter in episode four, even if these are factors on which it is difficult to be objective. The graphics engine is still the same, so you know what to expect from the game, and once again we have chosen the voice acting over the soundtrack. Finally, if it is true that this series is enjoyed much more in its original language, it is also true that this is the episode that requires more in-depth knowledge of English. Once this obstacle has been overcome, you can enjoy the adventure while waiting for the last, hopefully amazing, chapter.", "date": "2009-11-10", "grade": "7.9"}
