It is a natural evolution for a genre completely focused on narration, in which the authorial personality is still decisive and can really make a difference. Just look at the little marketing of Ame no Marginal -Rain Marginal- (henceforth only Ame no Marginal), in which it has been emphasized several times that it is a new work written by Tomo Kataoka, to whom we owe the beloved Narcissu, to realize of the force that is attributed to certain signatures to gain a hold on the public. In short, in addition to being niche, visual novels are also a genre in which phenomena can be observed that are now marginalized in other areas. Empowering authors has advantages that shouldn't be underestimated. For example, he is guaranteed greater freedom than those who create anonymously, and the ecosystem to which he belongs is also allowed to remain alive, leaving more room for maneuver for experimentation. Ame no Marginal is a short and intense story, with highly tragic traits, which probably would never have been produced if it hadn't been written by Kataoka. Not that the world of visual novels lacks oddities, but one thing is improvisation, one thing is the affirmation of a style. The latter is expressed not only in the individual parts that make up a work, but in the overall vision that holds them together. When the enthusiast starts looking for this vision, regardless of the individual details, he ends up establishing a deeper relationship with the creator, which he will give a mutually beneficial trust. Curiosity One of the unlockable extras in Ame non Marginal is none other than an episode of Narcissu. To access it, click on the image of the protagonist of the game in the chapter selection menu. The eternal rain All this preamble served to introduce what is a structurally essential visual novel, in which the user is only required to read texts and observe images, but which hides great depth inside. We will try to talk about it without revealing anything important about the plot, even if it is quite difficult to do so since it is the cornerstone around which to express an opinion. Ame no Marginal tells of a parallel world in which there is nothing but an eternal rain that wets everything. Living there you don't feel the pangs of hunger, you don't suffer and, above all, you can't die. The only inhabitant is Rin, a mysterious character whose story the protagonist will discover after having reached her for no apparent reason. Why is it there? Above all, why can't he leave? After the prologue you have to choose to follow one of the two stories that make up the plot. They are two different stories, but which touch upon events which will then intertwine in the final part and which will answer the questions we have posed a few lines above. The style of stage-nana, the development team, can be seen right away, with images in panoramic format that cut through the black background. The environments shown are empty and desolate, perfect for representing the desperation of the characters, victims of forces whose nature they do not know. Of course, the actors are there too, but don't expect them to be used like in other visual novels. Stage-nana considers them as if they were pieces of scenery, that is, it has created dedicated images for them, complete with backgrounds, to avoid overlapping them as much as possible. So there are no silhouettes that ~act~ in front of backdrops used as if they were theatrical wings, but there are images that form a story and introduce the characters only when required for dramatic reasons. It is a very different approach from the classic one, which in a certain sense helps to focus the viewer's attention on the story, while creating a more intense atmosphere. Atmosphere cradled by the soundtrack, mostly played with the piano and made up of delicate songs that perfectly accompany the emotions of the protagonists and the player.
