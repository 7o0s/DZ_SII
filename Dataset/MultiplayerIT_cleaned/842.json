SHORT INTERVIEW WITH DAVID KUSHNER The author of the book, David Kushner The author of the book, David Kushner, kindly answered a few of our questions. What struck you most about John Carmack and John Romero? Their passion and their dedication. Everyone has dreams and ambitions; these kids wanted to make video games and despite the many obstacles they faced, from parents to politicians, teachers to other people, they never lost sight of their dream, and managed to make it a reality. There are other personalities What's the video game industry you'd like to be able to talk about? Of course, since I will continue to deal with this industry. Since the US release of Masters of Doom I have had occasion to write about characters like Will Wright, creator of The Sims, and Bungie Software, creators of the Halo series. There are a lot of interesting people in the gaming industry, so I guess I have plenty of topics. Which other people you talked about in the book really impressed you? It's hard to pick anyone in particular. Most of the people I interviewed, from Tom Hall to Stevie Case, from American McGee to Trent Raznor, shared a love of video games and everything around them. I was very impressed, however, by the gamer, whose name I won't name, who played Doom so much that he wet himself in his underwear; that really is dedication. Is there anything you wished you could talk about in the book, but had to leave out because of space or time or other reasons? I wish I could put on my site (www.davidkushner.com) the video that featured Bill Gates in Doom, the one shown at the 1995 Microsoft party, but I couldn't find it. The Masters of Doom movie it is in the works. Which actors would you like to see in lead roles if you had an unlimited budget? Realistically, who do you think could play the Two Johns? I leave that decision to the producers!

The review The Two Johns. A similar expression might bring to mind the couple Lennon and McCartney, who revolutionized music in the late 60s. The protagonists of Masters of Doom, however, are neither English nor musicians, even if they can easily be defined as the videogame Beatles, for the innovations and revolutions they have been able to bring to our favorite pastime. John Carmack and John Romero, the two founders of id Software, creators of masterpieces such as Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, are the protagonists of the book written by David Kushner, a popular sector journalist, released in the USA at the beginning of 2003 and which will finally in Italy in the next few weeks. A very fascinating story, which tells the life of these two boys, united by a difficult youth, however lived in very different contexts, and by the passion for video games, which led them to join forces and to create some of the mostimportant in the history of video games. A passion which, however, has increasingly divided them over the years, due to their extreme character differences, leading them to separate after the great success and to go their own way, with the consequences of which the enthusiasts are surely aware.", "date": "2005-09-14", "grade": null}
