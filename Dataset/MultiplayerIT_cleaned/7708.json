Clearly inspired by a wide spectrum of Japanese anime, from Mazinger Z to Evangelion, passing through live action with Godzilla and all his relatives, the film stands as one of the most spectacular in recent years and does its job perfectly: show on the big screen battles of incredible visual impact, made plausible by terribly well done CG graphics. A video game that transported all this incredible show on iOS and Android devices represented the wet dream of any robot enthusiast, even more so returning from the cinema, and so the guys at Reliance Games got to work and created an Infinity clone Blade in which we control the various Jaegers by confronting the monsters of the moment, the Kaiju. The references to the plot of the film are quite vague, in truth, and without too many preambles the commander, Stacker Pentecost (played by Idris Elba) orders us to board our robot and beat the monsters hard by moving from one area to another of the planet. Pacific Rim is a gestural fighting game in the style of Infinity Blade, but with several problems It spits out gamma rays from its eyes Pacific Rim's problems come to the surface practically immediately, the time to increase the degree of difficulty just enough to realize that the touch control system occasionally falls asleep and, in general, is not precise and responsive enough to allow us to do what the game asks us to win fights, especially the more challenging ones. As mentioned above, the developers of Reliance Games have seen fit to work on an Infinity Blade clone, but the operation evidently did not go well, given the frequent difficulties with the commands and a progression that squeezes a nice keep an eye out for in-app purchases, even though the game isn't free. In fact, after having shot down some Kaiju, you find yourself in the situation of having to go back and repeat missions that have already been completed in order to be able to scrape together the virtual money needed to buy some upgrades. The risk is to find yourself controlling a robot that throws punches causing laughable damage, while the enemy doesn't have these problems and takes away a lot of energy from each successful attack. As in the title CHAIR, or in the more recent Avengers Initiative, you have to dodge the blows by acting on the arrows located at the ends of the screen, or lock yourself in a parade, trying to read the monster's movements and anticipate them, with the possibility of making parries on the fly . The problem is that the buttons are too small, sometimes they don't react (as already mentioned) and the ~combos~ available to us are really very limited to make the experience fun. Which is a pity, because the game obviously draws from the film's bestiary (both as regards the Jaegers and the Kaiju) and the opportunity could have been tempting to deliver us a new, valid gestural fighting game. As far as graphics and sound are concerned, we can't complain, but it is clear that much darker shades had to be used to make the most of that type of characters, who are instead trivialized due to excessive ~brightness~.", "date": "2013-07-23", "grade": "5.0"}
