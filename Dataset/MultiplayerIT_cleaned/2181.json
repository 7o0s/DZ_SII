{"name": "Star Trek Bridge Commander", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-trek-bridge-commander.html", "text": "NEWLY PROMOTED! With this background opens the new adventure of the Star Trek world, Bridge Commander. You have just been promoted to captain of the U.S.S. Dauntless and immediately you are assigned a ~hot~ mission. Investigate the facts of Vesuvi while bringing supplies to the remaining colonies. Rubbing your palms together, you wait to embark your guardian on this first venture, none other than the most famous captain in the fleet. Inflate your chest and wait for Jean Luc Picard to arrive in the transporter room. This game can be defined as a simulation of a starship, but even more in detail a simulation of life as a captain of a starship. Oh yes, because it is you in the first person who are called in the figure of the officer with the highest rank to command the crew of the Dauntless. Command an entire crew? But it's impossible, I barely juggle with a joystick inside a spaceship cockpit and shoot the bad aliens, how can I play commander? Fear not little adventurer of the cosmos. Bridge Commander is within everyone's reach, with the strengths and weaknesses that I will tell you later, and throwing yourself where no one has gone before will be almost immediate! FAITHFUL UNTIL THE END Your place is the captain's chair in the center of the bridge, and with your eyes you will give orders to the various stations. The pilot ahead on your left to move the ship, immediately to his left the tactical station that manages the ship's armaments. At your side, your number 1, the first officer who will be your advisor and executor, as well as a faithful subordinate (read: lackey). At the top right behind you is the scientific station, used to scan dangerous areas and behind you on the left the chief engineer will take care of managing the power flow of the ship to engines, shields and weapons. A panoply of dedicated and well-characterized characters, as in the Trek tradition, who will accompany you without hesitation, and without fear they will engage in battles, they will explore vast unknown systems with you, they will hunt down even the most concealed ship in the cosmos. FAITHFUL UNTIL THE END Yes, because there will be twists and turns, given that none other than D.C. participated in the drafting of the game's plot. Fountain! He says: ~Who is it?~ But of course one of the authors of some of the episodes of the famous TV series ST: The Next Generation. So fans of the series rest assured, we will encounter a deep and well-articulated plot, especially as regards surprise encounters with more or less hostile characters, promotions and assignments on ships of other classes such as the Sovereign. All that years of TV series a good captain had to face will be concentrated in the silver grooves of the Bridge Commander CD, the gospel for all aspiring budding fleet captains, or those who wake up in the morning and in their underwear on the balcony in the cold they shout ~Long Live and Prosper~ hoping the aliens will come for them. BEER AND POPCORN While on the one hand it now seems easier to navigate a ship of this size than pushing your little brother's tricycle down the slope, on the other hand it's difficult to always feel on the razor's edge, short of breath... in other words active. Often, precisely in the moments of greatest excitement such as the interstellar battles with the Romulans, you will be impassive spectators of the events, given that after having given the order to the tactical position to target the cloaking device as hard as you can, you will be happy munching on popcorn as the ship pitches and fires at the enemy and your officer lists what he's doing. ~I fire. I reload. Now I shoot again. Mo' I turn around and make another pass on the cap of those bastar Romulans... erm ok, we understand each other. Indeed there is the possibility of directly taking control of the ship, which, if on the one hand represents a ~bonus against the sedentary life~ of the captain, on the other it turns out to be of primary importance to get out of many situations. Stuff like: ~Stop these commands, now I'll shoot the photon torpedo over there where the light of the Vesuvi star doesn't shine!~. In reality, I also saw in this move a very polished way to initiate you even into the immediate skirmishes of multiplay. Uhu? Is there multiplay? Excitedly there is. PHASERATE THE SHIELDS A single imperative of the Bridge Commander multiplayer, in which you will see yourself as the protagonist of convoluted trajectories and phaser twirls together with other players who, like you, will try to pop you like you were a balloon. In this sense the external view is more fun, since in addition to the ships of the fleet, you cannaturally throw yourself into the fray with Romulan warbirds, Klingon birds of prey, Cardassian ships, Ferengi and so on and so forth. Thanks to the ~Quick Battle~ option, you can go into action without too much delay, setting the scenario with some base suspended in the cosmos, and decide in which star system to carry out the battle. Of course, the one who survives wins. Just one note... although there are so many ships to choose from, the inside of the bridge will always be the same, that of the federation. Boo!! Fiiii!! Come on, here you get boos... but how do you do it? I get on a bird of prey, and I want a dark bridge, red and black, full of Klingon writing, not the aseptic atmosphere of humans in ironed pajamas! GRAPHICS, SOUND AND IT'S WORTH IT I close the mission report by focusing on the technical aspects of this game, the ones that all the geeks within us hope to hear sooner or later during a review. From this point of view it can certainly be said that B.C. there is. Well-made graphics and faithful reconstructions of life on deck, with battles to the last graphic effect. Of course, I can't say too much, because we are certainly not at the state of the art, indeed in some points of the game we border on minimalism and all of us powerplays with easy accelerator cards will scoff at a few taps of the phaser in the starry darkness, however let us consider a moment that you don't live on graphics alone, although it is an aspect of primary importance these days. Let's talk about the music then. As always, the technique of varying the intensity and melody of the pieces is used, in order to underline the tranquility or increase the pathos in moments at risk. Vocally we are faced with a discrete test of quality, given that there are many sentences present and dialogues between members of different races, with good characterization (but don't look at the out of sync of the mouth, for heaven's sake, or it will look like a Bruce Lee film from the 70's). GRAPHICS, SOUND AND IT'S WORTH IT What do I mean by this! Palmiro Tangini  Bridge Commander is to all intents and purposes yet another case of joy for Star Trek fans. Although Paramount strives to make their games ~user friendly~ to broaden the circle of users, every time the situation that arises is that only a true trek enthusiast has the will to go on and feels at ease , at your own home. I don't want to appear excessively critical, because Bridge Commander is not a bad game at all, only that the strengths that should be the immersiveness in the role of captain of a ship and the freedom to make decisions as one sees fit are significantly reduced by the boundary elements, such as the plot (definitely good) and the situations in which you find yourself as a spectator. Ultimately a pleasant and flowing experience, but not overly engaging. Too bad, with a little more caution, a better title than this honorable and dignified Bridge Commander could come out. The throne of Elite Force is still unchallenged. THE CREW OF THE ~U.S.S DAUNTLESS~ As I said, at your side there will be the crme of the Space Academy, some nice nerds who this time will not be slow to throw themselves into the fray with you, and will follow you faithfully even where the etiquette of the Fleet requires not to go.

Ensign Serson protested, thinking back to the fact that it's not very exciting to be in a remote system like Vesuvi, studying comets and minor sidereal phenomena. Perhaps the only diversion would be to bring supplies to the inhabitants of the planet, if the Commander decided togive his approval. From the cockpit Wright observed the star Vesuvi, the main star of the Maelstrom system, brooding over matters concerning the fleet. A few more hours and even a Galaxy-class ship would arrive to support settler relief operations... he couldn't wait to get home. In a flash, the ship appeared out of cosmic nothingness, out of warp speed. ~They have arrived~ thought the captain, getting up ready to receive the new guests. Heat. Wright turns. Zero time. The star Vesuvi collapsed and exploded in an instant, a perception that lasted a few moments, which gave the crew of the Galaxy ship time to see the planet Vesuvi 3 completely invested and devastated by the explosion, together with a federation ship. Just a moment to reverse course, and ensure that by the skin of the nose only one of the two warp nacelles was scratched by the shock wave.", "date": "2002-04-02", "grade": null}
