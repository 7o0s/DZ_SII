A small spark of hope has reappeared on mobile platforms where, thanks to the touch controls perfectly suited to this category of gameplay, some developers have attempted to go down this path. Among the most interesting results of this trend we can undoubtedly include Agent A: An Enigma in Incognito, developed by the Australian team Yak & Co., actually composed of only two members; it is an episodic adventure that came out with the first chapter even at the end of 2015, with the next three following over time. August 29, 2019 marks the arrival of the fifth and final episode on iOS and Android, and at the same time the debut of the complete title on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch, obviously with digital distribution. It is precisely on the Nintendo console that we got to play Agent A in an attempt to put a spanner in the works of the evil plans of the spy Ruby la Rouge. Let's find out the result in our review. Point and click structure 2.0 The structure of Agent A is extremely classic, since it faithfully follows that of the great first-person graphic adventures of the past. We therefore find ourselves visiting the settings through fixed screens, looking for clues and elements with which to interact. The complexity of the puzzles is obviously destined to rise in the course of progression, even if the difficulty curve is very gentle and without peaks that can lead to frustration. This is probably one of the best qualities of Yak & Co.'s effort, i.e. the ability to place the level of challenge in a ~sweet spot~, a point that manages to prove to be stimulating for practically its entire duration, nor too complicated to seem out of reach nor so easy to insult the intelligence of the average player. Obviously those who grew up on bread and puzzles will have the road easier, but probably even veterans will find Agent A's virtues evident. So here is that, if the simplest puzzles are solved briefly perhaps in a single location, others require you to squeeze the brains more to find the correct use of objects in different places, perhaps connected to each other. Clearly it makes little sense to describe individual puzzles here, but suffice it to say that the years spent developing the entire adventure are a clear symbol of a creative effort and a quality of production that clearly shines through, leaving no room for criticism for the 'mobile origin of the game. Even with regard to the artistic direction and the graphic component, this reasoning is perfectly valid: the setting is inspired by the 60s, however declined in a very pleasant cartoon look. The result is above all very original, colorful but at the same time convincing and successful: it is perhaps only in the few animated sequences that you notice some limits, while in the static screens that make up the adventure you can better appreciate the artistic value of the work of the Australian boys . On the other hand, the plot is a little light which, despite being consistent in its frivolity with the affinity to the animated series, could have been more engaging. Touch controls The control system obviously finds its ideal expression on Switch, given that the touch interface on which the game was born and raised on mobile platforms has also been directly transported to the Nintendo hybrid. Therefore, a single touch allows you to interact with objects, manipulate them, manage the inventory and move to the other rooms, while a touch with two fingers actually ~backtracks~ bringing you back to the previous room. It is a simple and effective solution, which can be learned extremely quickly and which is perfectly functional to the game formula. Alternatively, you can also use the traditional controller, in this case the Joy-Con, by moving a pointer on the screen and delegating interaction and movements to the keys: an obviously obligatory option if you decide to play in docked mode, but proves much less immediate and effective. The translation of the texts into Italian is excellent. Longevity finally settles around 10 hours, with the variable positive or negative depending on the user's ability. However, more than enough considering the type of game and the sale price.", "date": "2019-08-29", "grade": "8.6"}
