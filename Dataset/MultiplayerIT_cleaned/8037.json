Not only that, the genre has managed in a short time to generate a whole series of currents that interpret its dictates in a different way, guaranteeing it that pinch of variety that so far helps to keep it in good health. So let's go and see which school of thought the present here Banana Kong by Gamaga belongs to. Donkey Joyride For every videogame starring a gorilla, the comparison with Donkey Kong Country is inevitable, and for the title subject of this review the comparison ends immediately, given that the only points of contact between the two products are the two-dimensional scheme and the presence of bananas as a substitute for the more classic coins. In Banana Kong, the user therefore has the task of leading the primate on the screen as far as possible, avoiding crashing or falling foul on pain of immediate game over. Among the numerous endless runners released so far on iOS, Gamaga's work is close from a conceptual point of view to the excellent Jetpack Joyride with which it shares several elements of its play structure. As in the Halfbrick title, in fact, even here for each game the generated scenario is totally random, and a strong emphasis is placed on the accumulation of bananas to then be spent on buying a whole series of persistent power-ups or gadgets useful for providing all a series of advantages for the immediately following match. Another analogy with Jetpack Joyride lies in the presence of some randomly appearing vehicles equipped with peculiar characteristics: if there it was motorcycles, mechs and teleporters, here the role is covered by some cute little animals, which can also be upgraded. Given the importance that the disbursement of bananas has in the playful economy, the addition of a section dedicated to in-app purchases is to be considered inevitable, which allows you to exchange real money with the currency used in the game, a trick that however the developers had the merit of not making it too invasive. Returning to the actual gameplay, Banana Kong is not to be considered a mere copy of Jetpack Joyride, however, proving to be capable of fielding a personality of its own. To begin with, the attacks on the protagonist's health come not only from a great variety of obstacles that fill the scenario (rocks, rolling logs, falling stalactites, puddles of water and so on), but also from the cascade of bananas that looms over the left side of the screen and from which you risk being swallowed if you slow down too much. Like all self-respecting endless runners, even here you use only one finger to play, in this case by touching the screen to jump, holding down the pressure to glide and swiping down to go down to the underlying platform: again, after having collected a certain number of bananas fills a special indicator which allows you to release a powerful forward thrust of our gorilla, useful both for getting away from dangers and for destroying any barrier in the immediate vicinity. All elements that contribute to making Banana Kong decidedly fun and frenetic, an enjoyable pastime, moreover, offered at such an attractive price that it can be considered advisable to anyone who does not feel a total idiosyncrasy for the genre. Finally, it doesn't hurt that from a technical point of view the FDG Entertainment product is a real gem: the two-dimensional graphics are distinguished by an excellent use of colors, vivid backdrops and above all the excellent animations of the protagonist gorilla, while the music punctuates the action with a cheerful theme that has the great advantage of not getting bored after a few games.", "date": "2013-01-28", "grade": "8.0"}
