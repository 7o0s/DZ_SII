On the strength of an excellent success with the public and critics, the Square Enix product has decided to take the plunge by coming out with the hereby Definitive Edition on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita: let's go, therefore, to find out what this deluxe version offers and above all let's see if the game manages to express its potential even outside the touch ecosystem that gave birth to it. The game works great, but Hitman GO: Definitive Edition is a bit of a comfortable conversion With the diorama you look like a god The aspect that usually suffers the most in the transition of a mobile title to platforms equipped with superior hardware is the graphics one, but the case of Hitman GO is fully one of the worthy exceptions. The very happy intuition of representing the playful scenario as if it were the replica of a real board game has in fact made it possible to exhibit a clean and ~plasticky~ look so convincing as to be very pleasant and current even after two years and on very more powerful than a smartphone. The various chapters that make up the adventure look like board game packs, levels are dioramas in all respects complete with a wooden base and plate that identifies their number, and the characters are reduced to very shiny plastic pawns : the final effect, despite its technical simplicity, is truly remarkable and the care placed in the realization of the smallest details makes the stages of Hitman GO appear almost tangible. The aesthetics of the Square Enix product therefore proves to be both essential and satisfying, two adjectives that can easily also refer to the gameplay, so intuitive that it doesn't even need a tutorial but at the same time capable of involving the user up to credits. The main objective of each level is to reach the finish line by moving the Agent 47 pawn from one box to another on the tracks drawn on the game board, avoiding frontal contact with the opposing stickers and eventually knocking them down by reaching behind them . The main element of challenge derives from the fact that for each move made, the enemies in turn perform an action determined by their class: in addition to the basic henchmen who do nothing but remain stationary on their position, we therefore find guards with the yellow jackets that move along a predefined path, those armed with a knife that rotate on themselves at every turn and so on, for a variety of respectable situations that help keep the play structure fresh for the entire duration of the campaign . Playstation 4 trophies Hitman GO: Definitive Edition has 17 trophies, including four bronze, three silver, nine gold and one platinum. Seven are obtained by completing all the objectives of the related chapters, while most of the rest are unlocked by performing certain in-game actions. It should be noted that a specific trophy requires not using a single hint for the duration of the campaign. More can be given Being able to count on an always inspired design and on a level of difficulty that progressively rises without ever reaching such peaks as to be frustrating, Hitman GO flows away in a decidedly fluid way, even if it runs into some small hiccups. The extreme linearity of the stages (the solution is almost always one and only one) could annoy lovers of free thought at all costs, while the control system manages to get stuck despite making use exclusively of the arrow keys, confusing the inputs on occasion particular changes of framing. It should also be noted how this Definitive Edition is characterized by an all too libertine management of the suggestions on which it is possible to rely in case you find yourself stuck in a certain situation: where in the original mobile version the help was limited and you had to pay to get more , here it is sufficient to press a key for the software to suggest the right path to complete the level, with the only side effect of not being able to unlock a specific trophy. It goes without saying that abusing this function ends up literally destroying the longevity of a product that was not already destined to be among the world's most durable strategy games (a situation that is only relatively compensated by the need to repeat all the internship to achieve all objectives), nonosmany this incarnation can count on all the DLC distributed later by Square Enix including three chapters inspired by some iconic scenarios of the main Hitman series. Considering all these factors, it is legitimate to turn up a little nose in front of the price at which Hitman GO: Definitive Edition is sold, which actually would have benefited from a little more effort in the conversion process: instead, we end up with a product that, if on the one hand allows you to load the saves made on another device, on the other it still has some - albeit very short - loading screens between one level and another that make you smile enough.", "date": "2016-02-25", "grade": "7.0"}
