Since the first version shown two years ago, it was evident that the developer's goal was to exploit the large multitouch screen of the iPad to offer a completely original gaming experience, characterized by a crazy and hardly replicable on other platforms. The result is a goofy and colorful arcade featuring the most unlikely threat the Galaxy has ever faced: the claws of a giant crab. Here Comes Crabzilla! The premises of Crabitron are a soup of nonsense, with the player playing the role of a mammoth space crab whose purpose is to bring devastation to the Universe by crushing, breaking and throwing away anything that comes within reach of its chela. Literally anything: from small taxis to police cars, from sharks equipped with jetpacks to cruise ships, passing through annoying UFOs and space cargo that seem to come out of Futurama. Meteorites, bullets and laser beams try to transform the protagonist into a fried fish, and so the aim is to survive as long as possible and score the most points. The incipit is atypical, there's no arguing about it, but what makes Crabitron truly unique, as we said at the beginning, is the tactile control system. The monster's body remains motionless in the center of the screen, and the only way the player has to defend and attack is to use the two huge claws, moving them anywhere on the screen as prey, objects and enemies appear. To do this, you need to use the thumb and forefinger of each hand (or the index and middle finger, if you prefer), spreading and squeezing the fingers just as if you were mimicking the use of the claws. It doesn't get any more intuitive  just place your fingers from the main menu and you're right in the middle of the action. The player can crush a car in one claw, destroy a meteorite with one sharp blow, or grab a ship from both sides and snap it in half. Every on-screen object can be grabbed and devoured for more points, but Crabitron challenges the player to be comically evil, opening up every vehicle and sucking people into them, as if they were oysters. Obviously the two appendages of the gigantic crustacean are also used in the defensive phase, to cover themselves from incoming missiles or to send the laser beams back to the sender. Unfortunately, the Two Lives Left game suffers a bit from the lack of visual variety in the backdrop, but it makes up for it as far as the contents are concerned. At the end of each wave of enemies you have to face a small challenge, including meteor showers, Arkanoid-style mini-games and boss fights, and especially for the latter the work of the authors has been impeccable: one of the most successful is a huge robot cyclopean equipped with a retractable fist, which must be knocked out using one claw to catch his jabs and the other to punch him in the head. Even if it forces you to keep your iPad on a stable surface, the control system makes everything natural and simple, although in some cases it ends up clamorously harnessing itself. Especially if you try to make too sudden movements or cross the claws, the game often gets confused and is no longer able to keep track of the fingers correctly: at best, just lift them for a few moments and wait for the claws to return to their position original, but in the worst case, and it has happened a couple of times, the arms of the monster are irreparably blocked leaving him completely defenseless. It's a rather annoying problem, not only because some games risk being compromised in the more advanced levels, but above all for the drastic way in which it eliminates that sense of involvement and light fun obtained only thanks to such a particular control system. It's a shame because Crabitron tries to put a lot of meat on the fire, starting with the gadgets and upgrades that can be purchased by spending the money accumulated between one game and another: from lightsabers with which to destroy anything to ambulances that allow you to cure any wounds, passing through the two claws that can be equipped with particular characteristics, such as the ability to cut objects with a touch or to absorb bullets and then shoot more powerful ones. An in-app purchase system allows less patients to have the best upgrades right away, but to tell the truth, they don't haveWe have never felt the need to resort to shortcuts, as a couple of well-played games are enough to get enough money for a new purchase.", "date": "2013-05-07", "grade": "8.5"}
