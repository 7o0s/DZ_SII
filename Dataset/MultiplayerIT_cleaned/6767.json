In fact, the concept of getting lost and then finding yourself is one of the keys to understanding the game, its brilliant storytelling, its tremendously fascinating atmospheres and an artistic direction which reviews real photographs in motion as we pass through the sometimes decadent, sometimes disturbing scenarios that form the backdrop to the countryside. So what was the story of the stray cat trying to save the world like? We tell you about it in the Stray review. History Stray, the protagonist grappling with one of the scenarios The protagonist of Stray obviously does not have a name: it is an orange-haired cat who lives in a peaceful feline colony, near an abandoned sewage plant. But one day something goes wrong, the cat falls into a drain and finds himself in pain and isolated, without the slightest idea of how to get back to his companions. Suddenly one of the heavy metal doors of the tunnels opens, the cat he enters the passage and thus enters the Dead City, the first setting of the adventure, where he is attracted by a series of messages on the monitors until he meets B-12, a small drone equipped with sophisticated artificial intelligence. The android is desperately searching for his lost memories, for a clue that can bring him back to his master, and so he forms an unprecedented alliance with the cat who, wearing a special harness, takes it upon himself to carry him around in search of information and to exploit its capabilities to interact with the environment. Soon, however, it becomes clear what the problem is with the city and what has happened to its inhabitants. Small but dangerous forms of life, the Zurks, have in fact taken control of the borders of this perennially dark and decadent place, preventing those who live inside to escape. However, can we call life that of a group of human beings who over time have agreed to transfer their consciousness into robotic bodies? Stray, the protagonist in the company of the B-12 drone Centuries have passed since this change occurred, yet someone has never stopped dreaming looking at the starry sky that overlooks the Dead City, and which in reality is simply the ceiling of an enormous metal structure: we are talking about the Oltreggiosi, a handful of androids determined to reach the Beyond, to find out what is hidden behind that gloomy appearance. It is the meeting with one of them, Momo, that directs the story in a certain way: the cat we control wants to return from its colony and this matches the Oltreggiosi's ambitions, which makes him a small honorary member of this particular club. Succeeding in the enterprise, however, will not be simple or painless, as we will be able to discover within the twelve chapters that make up the Stray campaign, the duration of which is around five hours or more depending on the collectibles collected. Gameplay Stray, the rooftop platforming stages in the first scenario are very enjoyable In terms of gameplay, the title of BlueTwelve Studio arises right from the start as an experience focused on narration, therefore not very demanding in an absolute sense, but at the same time able to field well-tested, almost always very solid mechanics ; starting with the platforming, which uses typical open world solutions to ensure that the character remains anchored to the platforms until you press the X key to jump to another foothold. The system works very well and soon highlights a clear potential which, however, is not expressed except up to a certain point: like other aspects of the experience, the feeling is that the small development team is well aware of its limits and has preferred not to dare too much, staging very environmental puzzles simple, some frantic but not too much chasing, situations of creation and delivery of relatively trivial objects, some code to decipher and little else. Stray the cat takes a nap next to a street musician Of course, considering that we are facing the French team's debut project, it is truly surprising to perceive such a degree of foresight, so much so that the sequences in which the game loses a little bit of lucidity, generally when you find yourself running while we are chased bythe Zurks, are reduced to a minimum and do not affect the excellent general impression. Placed within this picture we find many small goodies for cats, gestures reproduced in a surprisingly realistic way and which see the protagonist of the adventure get his nails done on carpets and armchairs, jumping into a box (especially during the stealth phases, after all it worked in Metal Gear Solid too...), rubbing on the legs of the various characters, wearing a paper bag and curling up for a nap. The DualSense purrs! The PS5 version of Stray, the subject of this review, can count on some features related to the peculiar capabilities of the DualSense. The developers have in fact exploited the adaptive triggers of the device to convincingly make the action of scratching the nails on different surfaces, but with the simulation of breathing during the nap they have surpassed themselves: at this juncture the controller literally purrs. Technical realization and artistic direction Stray, one of the ~moving photographs~ that characterize the aesthetics of the game Stray's best value undoubtedly lies in the excellent artistic direction that accompanies every single transition and confronts us, as mentioned at the beginning, with real moving photographs, extremely evocative and fascinating. Nothing is left to chance, the animations are very well done and the color choices appear as precise as they are varied, helping to maintain a solid atmosphere for the entire duration of the game. Beyond some typical themes of the cyberpunk trend, we have found in the title by BlueTwelve Studio a lot of Alita and clear references to the film A.I. - Artificial Intelligence, as well as games like Inside (although without reaching that level of creepiness) and the great classic Flashback. The developers have shown a remarkable talent and if this is the debut we can't wait to find out what they will be able to do in the future, perhaps with more resources available. Stray, another example of evocative aesthetics with the cat exploring an apartment Stray's aesthetic is the demonstration of how it is possible to obtain extraordinary results while remaining in a field far removed from triple A productions. It's all about finding gimmicks that on the one hand mask any shortcomings, on the other they are effective or even capable of enhance the story, and in this sense the work done is truly commendable. Furthermore, on PlayStation 5 the graphics move at 60 fps with an abundance of screen space reflection and very few uncertainties, which we already know will be fixed with the launch patch. As for the audio sector, the protagonist's meows are nothing but the smallest part of a stylish and solid sound design, supported by an ambient soundtrack that really interprets the mood of the experience very well and also contributes to the creation of certain atmospheres.", "date": "2022-07-18", "grade": "8.0"}
