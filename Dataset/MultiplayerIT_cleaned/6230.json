Now, the question of what a rabbit - and probably of high lineage - could ever have done to deserve hell, it arises spontaneously but remains essentially unanswered given that the narrative structure of the game is not exactly the cornerstone of the whole experience. We can only imagine that he has suffered some wrong and ended up there unjustly, also because in this way it is much easier to identify himself in the role of an aspiring fugitive from the circles of hell. Moreover, beyond the chubby and hairy appearance of the protagonist, the environment in which we find ourselves operating is anything but set on rabbit-like cuteness, with a somewhat Dantesque hell that appears before us amidst incandescent lava, flames, traps and so many cruel ways to eliminate the poor protagonist, stuff that in comparison the classic end in roast style with potatoes doesn't seem like the worst of possibilities. The aim of the game is therefore to guide the poor rabbit through various intricate levels scattered with various dangers, in search of a feather in each of these, which once collected guarantees access to the next level, all this to allow the protagonist to build a pair of wings and thus escape from the inauspicious destiny. Each level also offers additional challenges with the collection of further objectives in the form of coins scattered around the platforms, which probably represent the greatest challenges, suitable for players more inclined to complete the total gaming experience and in any case good for extending further longevity and provide the starting point to return several times to face the various sections in search of the perfect performance. Who wouldn't try everything to save a bunny from hell? Furdemption lets you try Bunny hell The scenario is virtually divided into boxes, with the rabbit being able to move an adjacent box in the four main directions, simply following the movement dictated by a quick swipe of the finger on the touch screen in the desired direction. The response to the commands is extremely reactive, which makes the control system very intuitive and pleasant to use, even if there is a marked drop in performance on slightly older devices, which makes the title much less pleasant to play in these cases (in this case, the problem was noticed on an old iPhone 4). In most cases, however, controlling the rabbit with rapid finger movements is an excellent experience, which also allows you to attempt risky and borderline maneuvers, which as you progress through the levels becomes more and more frequent, hand in hand with a remarkable inflexibility of the challenge, given that a minimal mistake leads the poor hairy protagonist to perish in the most atrocious ways among lava, flames, rotating saws and evil creatures. It's not just about speed and timing: you must move crates and transportable objects to avoid dangers and create your path to objectives, lure enemies towards dangers to eliminate them, move bombs to open new gaps, transform into dark creatures and in general learn to exploit the surrounding environment to your advantage, always using simply the touches on the screen in the four cardinal directions. The style adopted by RareSloth to represent the rabbit's adventure is also particular, with a stroke halfway between a soft design, in line with the figure of the protagonist rabbit and a certain arcane and almost disturbing angularity of certain elements of the scenario and adverse creatures .", "date": "2015-07-03", "grade": "8.0"}
