And unfortunately the situation does not improve much as regards the in-game graphics sector of the Raven title. Inconstant frame rate, jerky animations, very unimpressive polygonal masses and poor texture definition are the cornerstones of a too poor cosmetics for a hardware that easily manages much more graphically elaborate products such as Metroid Prime and TimeSplitters 2. In light of these facts, a technical realization like that of Jedi Outcast, rather dull and moreover penalized by a fluidity whose inconstancy is unjustifiable considering the relative polygonal simplicity of the game, can only be extremely difficult to digest. Of course, one could also postpone a disappointing visual sector resulting from a poorly cared for conversion process, if the gameplay proves to be at least satisfactory: but this is not exactly the case with Jedi Outcast. The Force is what gives the game power For a good part of the game, Jedi Outcast proves to be a decidedly flat fps. The objectives to be completed are extremely simple, the firefights with the opponents lack the right excitement and the level design leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and complexity. Fortunately, the situation improves once the lightsaber is obtained and the powers of the Force are regained: these are in fact the two elements that bring the gameplay of the Raven title back to an at least acceptable entertainment threshold, bringing complexity to an otherwise cloyingly conventional fps. By holding the lightsaber, the game switches to a third-person view, designed to facilitate both the clashes with white weapons with opponents (among other things made playfully interesting by the possibility of performing a good variety of different moves) and the process deflection of enemy projectiles, an operation as useful as it is galvanizing. The powers of the Force then add further depth to the game, providing the user with both new combat techniques and powers indispensable for solving certain puzzles or for overcoming otherwise unthinkable sections. However, if the powers of the Force are all in all decently manageable in single-player mode despite a considerable complexity of the control system, in multiplayer the situation changes radically. In a deathmatch, for example, where readiness and speed are fundamental requirements, the use of Force powers is decidedly not very agile, essentially denying the user a fundamental part of the gameplay of Jedi Outcast. Considering then that the multiplayer mode is limited to a maximum of two players via split-screen (moreover with substantial slowdowns and loss of frames), the abundance of modifiable parameters of the same is from a certain point of view useless. The large amount of different types of game and the various possibilities for customizing the character do not in fact serve to make a multiplayer mode that is not very interesting more enjoyable due to predominant technical limitations. Comment Jedi Outcast is a title that, substantially, would have done better to remain confined to the PC market only. This is because the Raven title features elements that are difficult to successfully convert to a console, both for purely structural limitations (never as in this case has the use of the pad instead of the keyboard-mouse combo appeared too inadequate) and for some gameplay features . That said, a careless conversion like the one Jedi Outcast fell victim to can only make the situation worse. The Lucasarts product therefore appears on Gamecube with a decidedly poor graphic design, a single player mode that is not very thrilling and a multiplayer section as rich in options and variables as it is useless in substance, as it can be used by a maximum of two players (complete with slowdowns , moreover) and not very enjoyable due to the aforementioned cumbersomeness of the control system. In short, Jedi Outcast, a title of undoubted quality on PC, reveals itself in this Gamecube version as an unattractive fps, which perhaps only Star War fanaticss will be able to appreciate. Pros: The lightsaber and the powers of the Force The immortal charm of the world of Star Wars Cons: Graphically poor Cumbersome control system Quite boring in single-player Multiplayer mode extremely unappetizing In addition to being a symbol of one of the most famous and appreciated cinematic sagas ever, the Star Wars brand also represents, in the videogame field, one of the longest-running franchises in history. But also one of the most controversial. Especially in recent years, and especially on consoles, in fact, the titles dedicated to Skywalker and company have not always proved worthy of the name they bore on the package. And the latest addition to the series, the Jedi Outcast subject of this review, seems to fully confirm the descending parable of LucasArts productions on consoles", "date": "2003-01-04", "grade": null}
