In short, ten good reasons to replay many old glories that accompanied us as children. Everyone's gameplay is practically universally known, and we will spend very few words during this review to remind you of it. On the contrary, it is good to dwell on the innovations that the characteristics of NintendoDS have allowed to take place. Basically the Touch Screen offers in almost all games a new player-game interaction system, a way never experienced before. ... ten good reasons to replay many old glories that accompanied us as children Vintage gameplay Some games, like ~Missile Command,~ seem perfect for using the stylus. Shooting on the screen by directly touching it is a nice novelty. In these cases it becomes clear that it would have been even better to have both screens sensitive to the touch. To shoot in the upper one it is in fact necessary to use the rudder by pressing any trigger. In short, a hybrid gameplay came out. In other games like ~Pong~, the use of touch seems absolutely superfluous. Indeed, using the directional cross directly appears preferable as the position of the hand is more comfortable. Graffiti artists don't scratch.. Another feature of the DS, better exploited this time, is certainly the wireless multiplayer. It is also possible to play in four people, in some cases as in ~Warlords~. In two in most of the others. Fortunately, the wireless download allows you to play together even with only one cartridge owned. ~Pong~ has been moved vertically, so that two players can play and control one screen each. Atari also demonstrates good intentions by proposing all the games in the compilation in a graphically modernized version. That doesn't mean modern, though. Three of the most famous American graffiti artists were hired by Atari and, given the conditions to reproduce the graphic style of each of these games in their own way, they created new versions. Atari also demonstrates good intentions by proposing all the games in the compilation in a graphically modernized version Graffiti artists don't scratch.. Basically all the sprites have been redesigned, making them more appealing and more modern. The result makes one's nose turn up, and if in some cases it can simply be defined as ~ugly~, in others ~bad taste~, in others it leaves rather indifferent. Obviously it immediately catches the eye that NintendoDS is capable of more, much more. Old 8-bit games given a modern twist still have 8-bit graphics. No polygons, no animations, no effects. Simply a makeover. It is appreciable, but absolutely not very incisive. The impression is that the simple and pure gameplay of each of these games, combined with next generation graphics, could really create something better. Speaking of the audio sector, the style of the music is very reminiscent of that of Space Channel Five already seen on the Sega Dreamcast, a little retro, a little modern. Even in this case, however, it was reasonable to expect much more. In fact, the music can only be heard in the menus, while the games reproduce the sound absolutely the same as 20 years ago, that is, just a couple of effects. Although the decision to leave the originals ~the same~ as the originals is understandable, it is not clear why it was not possible to insert a soundtrack at least in the ~Remix~ versions which should be considered the modern versions. Nowadays, given the complexity and depth of many games on the market, it is not easy to consider these games collected in ~Atari Retro Classic~ as something more than a series of harps or pastimes. Hit and run games, in the full style of puzzle games. Certainly also that in the face of yet another release of them it was legitimate to expect much more, especially considering the innovative hardware on which they run. Ultimately a title that expresses itself in ~hit and run~ moments, but which, being composed of games seen and reviewed, also manages to get bored. The Remix versions, which should instead keep the attention of the experienced gamer alive, fail to amaze and re-propose something visually beautiful. Pros Simple and immediate game mechanics Wireless multiplayer Cons The touch functions are not well exploited More was expected from the remix versions The gameplay is now well known The assist that Nintendo DS offers to bring back old classics from the 80s is greedy. A dual screen and a touch screen can coTo help perfect, improve and ~rejuvenate~ certain masterpieces of twenty years ago. Masterpieces of the time which, despite being such, remain perfect as they are, and anyone would turn up their noses finding them different or modified. However, using the lower screen of the Nintendo DS allows you to keep the feeling of these games intact by only changing the way you interact with them. Once with the Atari Joystick, today with the hands, or with the stylus, directly on the pixels. The compilation of great hits is called ~Atari Retro Classic~ and offers ten games in two versions.
