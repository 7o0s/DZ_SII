Army troops entering the abyss are decimated, until a mysterious warrior, Katrien, materializes out of nowhere and claims she knows how to put an end to the nightmare. Because it really is a nightmare; or rather, the materialization of the dreams of a sorcerer, whose mind is so powerful as to influence reality itself. After Zeno Clash and Rock of Ages, the developers of ACE Team have decided to change genre again and to propose a different experience from the usual, imbued with Chilean folklore and a peculiar artistic characterization, in which videogame strands such as platform, fighting game and RPG in roguelike sauce blend in the name of an absolutely hardcore approach. In fact, Abyss Odyssey has a lot of edges and above all it does not place itself in a conciliatory way with its interlocutor during the first hours of the game, in which it dispenses essential advice but leaves the user with the task of discovering everything behind it, as well as what are the fundamental elements to survive while descending further and further into the abyss, exposing yourself to threats that are becoming more frequent and dangerous every time. Take the measurements well It is not the destination that counts, but the journey: this is the concept behind Abyss Odyssey, given that structurally the game would not even be very long (it takes about two hours to get to the end), but its procedural connotation means that each step is different from the previous one, with the only constant of collecting coins and experience, respectively useful for buying more powerful weapons or points for the checkpoint (yes, you have to buy those too and place them in certain areas, or you will start over at each game over ) and to improve the skills of the three characters at our disposal. We are talking about the aforementioned Katrien, which stands as the most balanced solution between power and speed; the ghost warrior Ghost Monk, skilled in wielding enormous two-handed greatswords; and the agile Pincoya, capable of hovering in the air wielding spears, scythes and javelins. Special attacks fall within the scope of a combat system that has more than one element in common with the ~Mortal Kombat~ interpretation of fighting games, that is, it places an emphasis on timing and distances rather than movement capacity . Our warrior in Abyss Odyssey can double jump and climb hills, which helps to enrich the exploratory phase of the game as we come across chests that are simple or have a lock. But when the time comes to fight, all that agility gives way to a lot of wood and more than one uncertainty, such as the fact that dodging often leads us to look in the opposite direction to that in which ours is located. opponent. Abyss Odyssey is a different title than usual, a hardcore experience that mixes various genres Live or survive The clashes in Abyss Odyssey must therefore be interpreted with precision and a certain amount of strategy, taking advantage of the missteps of enemies who, however, immediately prove to be shrewd and far from clumsy, well trained to parry and dodge our attacks, even at 'inside those areas of the abyss where the degree of difficulty should be ~easy~. The layout of the controls, which perfectly supports the Xbox 360 controller (highly recommended), sees the presence of two buttons for attacks, one for throwing and one for jumping, while the backbones are used to block or sidestep. If desired, it is also possible to attack by moving the right analog stick in the various directions, because it is precisely by mixing movement and blow that different maneuvers are obtained, which imply a lunge rather than a sweep, a high slash rather than a rapid combo of jabs. The exact same mechanisms are available to enemies, and it is not a figure of speech, given that in some situations we will be able to capture their essence, use them as additional pawns (a bit like in Double Dragon III, for those who remember) and therefore also exploit their vital energy bar. During the adventure we will do this and more, since survival is everything in Abyss Odyssey and defeat is handled in a rather particular way: if our mystical warrior is killed, a Chilean soldier materializes in his place whose skills are clearly lower, but which will be able to bring us back to life by reaching one of the altars on the map. A less simple undertaking than you think. Alternate modes In addition to single player, Abyss Odyssey lets you tackle the abyss in two-player cooperative multiplayer mode, both locally and online, or battle against a friend in an arena. Unfortunately, both of these variations on the theme did not win us over, either due to the exasperation of angular mechanics (versus), or due to the presence of problems related to the connection (lag and bugs related to this phenomenon). Procedural swear words Explore, fight, die and repeat: the cyclical vision that is proposed to us in this case by the ACE Team guys doesn't initially have that much charm due to an abrupt and angular approach, as already mentioned above, which requires you to learn on your own skin the pros and cons of certain approaches to the game. After a couple of hours, however, the potential of Abyss Odyssey reveals itself quite clearly and the desire to do another round rises, try to get further, strategically locate the altars to place checkpoints or get an extra warrior , and in the meantime take care of the equipment and skills in the best possible way so as not to arrive unprepared for the difficult bosses that mark certain stages of the adventure. The experience is damned hardcore, which on the one hand constitutes a great attraction for those who appreciate this kind of production, on the other it inevitably cuts out those who prefer a more peaceful and linear progression. Of course, whatever the personal sensitivity, there is no doubt that on the technical and, above all, artistic front, we are faced with a title endowed with a certain personality, which perhaps does not exploit the procedural system in the best way but knows how to alternate very different scenarios and enemies that stay in the head due to their peculiar design, see the centaur or the armless anthropomorphic bird, the shadow warriors and the wizards that float in the air waiting to hit us with an energy ball. The action is also accompanied by a soundtrack of great atmosphere and excellent quality, perfect for underlining certain situations.", "date": "2014-07-23", "grade": "7.3"}
