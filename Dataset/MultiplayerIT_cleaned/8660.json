The plot of the game revolved around one Daniel Garner, who tragically died in a car accident along with his wife Catherine. The latter reaches the kingdom of heaven without problems, while Daniel ends up being stuck in Purgatory but he is given a chance to redeem himself and reunite with his beloved, or rather take up the rifle and wipe out the four generals of Lucifer and all the demonic creatures following them, so as to prevent Hell from opening its gates. Among the innovations introduced by Painkiller included some particular weapons, such as the ~shoot stakes~, and a remarkable graphics engine for the time, in particular as regards the management of physics. In the latest stand-alone expansion of the People Can Fly creature, Painkiller: Recurring Evil however, there is not even a shadow of novelty: the franchise has for years now passed into the hands of ~minor~ developers, let's say so, who they have done nothing but drag the series with simple mods and expansions based on recycled assets, many enemies and little substance, trying to monetize the attachment of longtime fans. Recurring Evil does not start from a real plot, rather it presents itself as yet another challenge for those who appreciated this shooter at the time and still want to play a few games with it, preferably after skipping all the ~sequels~ at the same time released in the meantime, the last of which landed on Steam exactly one year ago. A thousand and no more a thousand The character we play is no longer Daniel Garner, but Bill Sherman, introduced in the 2009 episode Painkiller: Resurrection. Sherman has come into possession of the Sword of Seraphim and should therefore reign over Purgatory, but the situation changes quickly and the enemy to fight turns out to be once again Samael, who aims to take over the throne of the Underworld. To prevent this from happening, we will have to face five levels for a total of as many hours of gameplay (perhaps more, depending on the number of attempts required), going from the initial catacombs to a dark elevated road, to then visit a large deposit, an abandoned cemetery and finally an ancient Buddhist temple. To keep us company there will be no puzzles or switches to activate, only thousands (four thousand, to be exact) of enemies and a series of checkpoints to mark one combat sequence from the other. As mentioned above, in fact, Painkiller: Recurring Evil offers only this: five scenarios divided into ~sections~ and filled with all sorts of demonic creatures, to be dismembered by resorting to an arsenal now far from boasting the charm of the golden age. made up of the ~painkiller~ (the rotating blade of the ordinance), the already mentioned ~launcher stakes~, the rifle, a grenade launcher and various types of machine guns. Each weapon has a secondary fire mouth that uses different bullets, to be collected around the locations together with bonus cards that can improve certain characteristics of our alter ego. Furthermore, when Bill gets ~angry~, he enters a sort of ~demon mode~ which allows him, for a few seconds, to destroy any enemy with a single blow: a pity not being able to recall it when necessary. Survivors and survivors In short, Recurring Evil turns out to be a sort of ~horde mode~ disguised as a game, in which gunplay reigns supreme and one moves from one part of the stage to another to try to escape the touch of increasingly numerous and insistent enemies; enemies who, however, do not have adequate artificial intelligence and therefore will only head towards the character we control, regardless of any obstacles in their path, so much so that they will often ~get stuck~ between two vehicles or hit each other. The original Painkiller, we said, was a great game for the time it came out and the traces of such splendor are still recognizable, but it is even more clear that the nature of productions like the one we are reviewing it is far from ~noble~, and that in the end recycling a scenario and filling it with thousands of enemies (also recycled) to induce us to shoot like madmen does not exactly correspond to our idea of ~excellent game design~. The technical sector, although extremely dated, does not represent the major problem of the product but neither can it be counted among its advantages: the graphics are the same as in 2004, with very simple polygonal models and limild, while the metal-style musical accompaniment accompanies the action in a more than discreet way.", "date": "2012-03-21", "grade": "5.6"}
