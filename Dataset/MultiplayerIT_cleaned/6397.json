After all, it literally costs nothing to download a game for free and give it a try, right? The trick lies in making sure that the title in question grabs the player, intrigues him and, perhaps, convinces him to spend some real money to play beyond the limit imposed by the free to play model in force. Pokmon Shuffle manages to balance this equation, more or less, but above all it is a well-crafted and fun game. Can we say the same about Pokmon Rumble World too? Pokmon Rumble World is free, simple and fun, but be careful not to play too much Rrrready to rumble! Developer Ambrella's Rumble miniseries has never quite convinced us since its debut on WiiWare in 2009. Subsequent iterations, for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, have underlined the underlying problems of the spin-off, especially the repetitiveness and the superficiality of the gameplay: the fact that the latest edition for the big N home console existed in conjunction with the launch of a line of amiibo-style figurines, when amiibo didn't even exist yet, suggested that the developer was now struggling to define the identity of the brand. Still, in some ways Pokmon Rumble has always been the ideal spin-off. It is not the first in which you directly control the little monsters (take Pokmon Mystery Dungeon) but it is one of the few fully action titles starring Pikachu and associates, moreover transformed into delicious stylized toys. The game system is very simple: as one of these toy pokmon, you have to beat up hordes of other little monsters and collect them all. Power levels and type ratios still matter, but RPG mechanics are bare-bones, if at all. Pokmon Rumble World clings to the simplicity of the original mechanics, however building a slender RPG structure around it that manages to give it greater prominence. Set in the Mii realm, the new Ambrella title puts us in the shoes of our Mii alter ego and spends a very few minutes explaining how to play, and then dives straight into the action. At first we will only have one Pichu available, but what game with pokmon would it be if we couldn't capture them? It's very easy, however: just press one or two keys repeatedly to step on the other toy pokmon and cross your fingers because they leave a figurine on the ground that we can add to our collection and control on the battlefield. The various pokmon collected show off different levels of power, so it's up to us to choose the best ones to keep in the collection and discard the others from time to time, while trying to expand the variety of types so as to always be ahead. Basically, to change the toy, just press a key, but you need to use a minimum of strategy because if the one we are using is defeated before the change, the game ends and you go back to the castle. The 3D effect Absent in some moments of the game, when there is the stereoscopic effect it is well implemented, but it does not add anything concrete to the gameplay and it is not missed. Diamond thieves Being basically a free to play title, Pokmon Rumble World features a ~gating~ system that progressively slows down the enjoyment of the game, trying to push the player to spend real money to buy diamonds with which it is possible to unlock new maps, objects and even more. Technically it would work like Pokmon Shuffle, but in this case the limitations are much less felt. In fact, the player spends the diamonds to buy hot air balloons, i.e. the maps - divided into three or more zones - in which to fight and capture new pokmon, from the first to the last generation of the mother series. Once you have used a balloon to reach an area, whether you complete the mission or not, you will still have to wait a certain amount of time before you can use it again, or spend more diamonds to immediately return to the area you just visited. The fact is, however, that once more balloons have been unlocked, the recharge time of each of them is absolutely individual, and this means that often one or more balloons will be ready to be used again even before all those balloons have been completed. already available, thus allowing us to play as much as we want. The solution, clever as it may seem, has two small drawbacks. Firstplace, belongs to a kind of gray area, in the sense that at the beginning, having few balloons and few diamonds to spend to buy new ones, it will be necessary to wait between one game and another; the situation clearly improves once more balloons are unlocked, to then inevitably get worse when we have unlocked them all but we will only miss pokmon from a few areas. The second disadvantage has to do with the simplistic gameplay: Pokmon Rumble World is effectively repetitive like the previous episodes, and you quickly get tired of pressing a button or two to defeat hordes of pokmon without artificial intelligence in tiny and linear maps. The end-of-level bosses designed by Ambrella are simply larger than normal pokmon but just as easy to defeat. Thankfully, the Miis we'll meet in the kingdom tend to liven up the experience a bit. There are those downloaded via StreetPass or SpotPass that we will meet from time to time in the various areas, and that perhaps will help us in combat, offering us small gifts once we return to the city, and then there is the king who will offer us missions every day with multiple objectives thanks to which to earn even more diamonds to buy new hot air balloons, costumes for our Mii or decorations for our toy pokmon collector's card.", "date": "2015-04-21", "grade": "7.0"}
