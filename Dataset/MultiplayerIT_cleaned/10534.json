{"name": "Unsighted", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unsighted-recensione.html", "text": "The life of an automaton is difficult. Always under the orders of disrespectful human beings, who unload all the anxieties, fears and responsibilities that they are unable to fan by themselves onto the shoulders of robots. Who knows what could happen if the automatons were to acquire a conscience, empathy, feelings. Over the decades, literature, cinema and video games have often wondered about the ethical and moral dilemmas of artificial intelligence. Remaining in the interactive area that most interests us, a name of little weight like that of Yoko Taro was able to tackle the issue masterfully, giving us a NieR Automata in 2017 that punched us in the face, sparing nothing and nobody The Pixel Punk guys seem to have moved in the wake of Taro's work, aware of their own means, avoiding overdoing it and hitting straight on the mark. Unsighted is in fact an extraordinary title, punitive but balanced and which owes as much to the recent history of the metroidvania as to another indie excellence that responds to the name of CrossCode. Even automatons have a soul Unsighted: customization is simple, but well structured The narrative premise of Unsighted is not original in itself. On the contrary, it takes full advantage of a whole culture of science fiction, more or less dystopian, which over the last century has abounded in all the major media. In an undefined future, human beings live in symbiosis with automatons, mechanical beings of the most disparate shapes and appearances, useful for carrying out actions and jobs without complaining and without getting tired. In this panorama not so far from what the real future seems to set for us, a meteorite hits the Earth and releases the so-called Anima into the air, a substance that overnight makes the automatons sentient and capable of thinking, reasoning, feel emotions and have ambitions. The Earth is now an inhospitable place and human beings have largely fled, aware and frightened even by the renewed consciousness of the automatons. For an indefinite time the robots live in community, until a tragic event, probably wanted by man himself, leads to the disappearance of the source of Soul. Assimilation is therefore impossible, except through a few remains that can be found here and there in Arcadia - this is the name of the entire game map - and each automaton is therefore destined to lose what it has longed for without even knowing it: its own humanity. Finishing the Anima reserve, quantified in number of hours, means becoming Unsighted, no longer conscious creatures who give their name to the title and who live on rage and death. Our adventure begins in this idyllic panorama, impersonating one of the last remaining automatons, who, as in the most classic of situations, has lost his memory, but is still aware of having to fight for the common good and for the continuation of his ~species~. . A Metroidvania with flakes Unsighted: Boss fights are memorable From Hollow Knight and Guacamelee!, up to Control and the most recent Metroid Dread, the metroidvania genre has seen a large number of excellent experiences and different interpretations for some years. In this thriving panorama full of ideas, the Pixel Punk guys have decided to aim high, taking many inspirations here and there and putting together a balanced and masterfully structured game. Anyone of you who has had the pleasure of trying Hyper Light Drifter or Cross Code in the past years will be able to feel at home in a short time. Unsighted is in all respects an action RPG with metroidvania progression characteristics and with a couple of elements that characterized Souls but which in the last ten years have become part of a common vocabulary among the most disparate genres. The map is unique but divided into zones and levels, with a percentage of total completion always visible and at hand. Simple but very clear, navigation is a pleasure, even and above all when acquiring new skills that allow you to explore previously inaccessible areas and which hide secrets or interesting upgrades. Unsighted: different biomes and each with distinct characteristics and mechanics Just the progression is so tangible and fun as to make anyone accustomed to the genre understand how the Brazilian team has studied at the home of the best, and has been able to put together an experience characterized by a superfine balance and a sense of satisfaction which, believe us, it is very unique. The personalization of the protagonist is another aspect not to be underestimated: a bit like in NieR it is possible to go and insert chips into special slots that must be unlockedi over time and which are used in the most disparate ways. Want to avoid spending stamina running? You can. Do you want to increase your health points or total stamina? No problem. What interests you is the defense? You can increase that too, and the possibilities are really many. Do not miss the crafting, possible through a series of projects that can be purchased from automatons in the city or found inside the chests, often after completing simple but fun environmental puzzles. Two weapons that can be equipped simultaneously, both at short and long distance , and with the ability to build and upgrade them you can dramatically increase your arsenal, so you can choose what to use in each specific situation. The combat system, on the other hand, is rather traditional: a few well-aimed shots to do damage, just as very few are those that it is possible to collect before dying. There is a parry system that allows you to counterattack at the right time and stun enemies, so as to score really critical damage, which is essential against the numerous and splendid bosses in the game. However, it will be inevitable to die more than a few times and, unless you have found the right chip and have spent a good number of slots at your disposal, this will lead to the loss of half of your possessions, useful for making purchases and increasing your skills. There is no leveling up, while fighting, exploring and solving puzzles in Unsighted is a pleasure, with a precise control feel and on which the team has clearly dedicated a lot of attention. Unsighted: Controls are precise and responsive Out of time Unsighted inserts into the equation of the game, unless the option is deactivated (but we do not recommend it), that of the time available. As we have already mentioned, the loss of the Anima source has put all automatons at risk, and this aspect is not left to chance in the gameplay. Every NPC you meet - and there are so many of them - will be entered into a contact register through which you can see the level of friendship and the hours available to them. Every second that passes in Unsighted is a minute in the game: once an NPC's time runs out, they become Unsighted and, in addition to the ethical and moral dilemma that can ensue, cynically this also means losing any help or upgrades that that character could have given. The Pixel Punk guys were bad in this respect, not even hiding so deeply a series of elements, be they chips or weapons, which can only be received by donating more time to live to one's fellow humans. Recovering the little stardust available on the map will increase the life of a single automaton by 24 hours. It will be up to you to choose, with all that it will entail humanly and in terms of progression. We played Unsighted on PC, but the game is available almost everywhere, including in Microsoft's Game Pass. The game performs very well both in terms of fluidity and input lag, resulting in a pleasure not only for the eyes, but also in the controls. However, a dignified but not particularly original pixel art is accompanied by refined stylistic choices and a great differentiation of the settings. The sound design is also excellent, especially as regards the effects, minus the soundtrack, probably the only less impactful element of the Brazilian production.", "date": "2021-10-17", "grade": "8.8"}
