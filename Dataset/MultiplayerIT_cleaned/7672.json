{"name": "Santi contro alieni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122018-saints-row-iv-santi-contro-alieni.html", "text": "If there is a common thread that has always linked apparently incoherent and crazy experiences such as those offered up to now by the Saints Row saga, it is undoubtedly the will to transgress, to break the rules, to subvert clichs, sometimes with courage, others in the grip of simple recklessness. This crusade against all that is ~normal~, even in a lively area like that of video games, found its peak in the second chapter, able to offer a remarkable drag throughout the single player campaign, not to mention a cooperative experience unrivaled in free roaming. Although clearly imperfect, due to the simplistic shooting phases and the subdued technical sector, Saints Row 2 managed to strip the saga from the annoying title of ~bad GTA clone~, and gave it reason to exist. After a third chapter not up to the predecessor, Volition has decided to aim high, including a large number of new features in this fourth release. With a single, skilful coup, Saints Row IV completely subverts the well-known premises up to now, throwing into the cauldron an alien invasion and a Steelport no longer ~real~, but the result of a simulation very similar to that of the film trilogy of matrix. If this change of direction may initially appear as the result of a simple desire, that is to offer more variety, it is also a move aimed at providing Saints Row with just what the saga perhaps needed least. Justifications. In Saints Row IV the funny moments are there, but the identity and the spirit of the gang are missing Red pill It was originally supposed to be a simple DLC for Saints Row: The Third, known as Enter the Dominatrix. Then, the standalone downloadable content disappeared from the radar, and Volition saw fit to use the idea to develop a full-fledged sequel. Although we are not given to know exactly what the original project was, the whole concept of ~virtual reality~ around which Saints Row IV revolves serves not only to properly introduce the superpowers with which the protagonist is endowed, but also to justify somehow, the excesses that have always characterized the brand. A narrative exercise that also opens up to a game of cinematographic and videogame quotations destined to be felt very strongly throughout the course, to the point of recalling the recent expansion of Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon. It would almost seem like a response to the criticisms that the series has always received, culminating in the ~case of the purple dildo~, which arose due to the marketing campaign created for The Third. In fact, there are no stimulators used to beat honest citizens in this fourth chapter and, more generally, the foul-mouthed humor has received a scaled-down, as well as the tone of the missions, almost as if the developers had wanted to prove they were capable of somewhat more mature humor. Thus, while once it was a question of drug dealing, stealing, polluting, mocking the police and eliminating rival gangs, here the story is very different, and sees the protagonist always fighting for the good of humanity. In the short prologue he will thwart a terrorist threat, obtaining in exchange the office of president of the United States, then, following a devastating alien attack, he will decide to take up arms and defeat the monsters from space, causing as much chaos as possible in the virtual Steelport which initially imprisons him. Without going into too much detail of the plot, this brief description is more than enough to understand how Saints Row, with this fourth chapter, is clearly transformed. The patina of relative normality with which Volition wanted to cover this sequel, which tries to let go of the follies of the past but without the same conviction, has also ended up involving the gameplay, with a large number of main missions that are all too linear and guided . There is no shortage of variety, but curiously many gameplay sequences linked to the plot take the player away from free roaming in the city, and lead him by the hand through guided tours on foot, or aboard vehicles, including a mech, actually fun to use. Unfortunately, as well known to fans, level design, artificial intelligence and shooting have never been the strong points of Saints Row, and this ends up trivializing a good portion of the missions related to the story, which moreover they always grant the use of superpowers. Super gangsters The special abilities that the protagonist will be able to use help to profoundly change the typical gameplay of Saints Row, with inevitable deja vu andvery strong productions such as Crackdown, Prototype and Infamous. Through a simple upgrade system, which involves the collection of ~data nodes~ around the simulation, it will be possible to improve the four powers unlocked during the dedicated missions, which will all involve eliminating the same type of boss to obtain a new specialty. Thus, the super jump and super speed will soon give the possibility of gliding across the city in a matter of seconds, the icy breath will allow enemies to be frozen, the flames will cover the protagonist's body burning everything around, the vehicles will be able being thrown with telekinesis and a powerful kick will create devastating shock waves. While it's not possible to use multiple powers at the same time (with the exception of the super rush, which will always be active), quick selection will allow you to quickly switch between them, wreaking havoc on the simulation. Although the balance of the individual skills and, above all, the response times of the commands given leave much to be desired, the creative use of superpowers ends up deeply characterizing the gameplay, and represents one of its highest points. Although in this way the originality factor is almost completely lost, and the concept of ~criminal gang~ characteristic of the previous episodes is completely sacrificed, fighting against hordes of aliens often reserves good satisfaction, and gives the cooperative a whole new rhythm. On the other hand, this complete novelty for the saga ends up distorting another of its main characteristics, namely the importance of the vehicles. While the Volitions have worked hard to add new ones, including a range of flying and non-flying alien combat vehicles, these prove to be almost completely useless, and even awkward to use when compared to the convenience of movement offered by the powers. The same, in part, applies to weapons, which despite their originality (Dubstep Gun above all) and, in some cases, their immense power, end up remaining in the shadows compared to the devastating attacks that the protagonist will have once unlocked the main powers. The impossibility of opening fire when in flight also contributes to this, which very clearly limits the combined use of the superjump and the arsenal. Perhaps this is precisely why we owe the missions without superpowers, which sometimes force you to use specific weapons and vehicles, however limiting freedom in a not always pleasant way. On the other hand, the considerable customization possibilities remain completely unchanged compared to the past, which begin with the modeling of the protagonist, as always exceptionally thorough and full of crazy details, continue with the many vehicles, humans and aliens, present in the simulated Steelport, and they culminate with the arsenal, with several fully upgradable weapons. Cooperative The two-player online cooperative has always been a significant plus for the Saints Row saga, and this fourth chapter is no exception to the rule. The superpowers used in tandem are capable of wreaking some truly remarkable chaos on screen, although, on the other hand, they make many missions even easier than the already not too demanding solo experience. During our tests, from the point of view of the netcode we have not encountered particular problems, if not the annoying deactivation of the integrated voice chat when one of the two players pauses the game. As in its predecessors, the cooperative is able to make the scrolling of the missions more pleasant and to partially compensate for the repetitiveness of many tasks, and comes supported by two dedicated secondary activities. The first, already seen in the predecessor and borrowed from GTA IV, sees a player on a helicopter chasing the other intent on fleeing by car, while the second allows the two participants to challenge each other in a timed deathmatch. Free time In the face of so many upheavals from the gameplay point of view, Saints Row IV does not give up one of the main characteristics of the saga, i.e. the secondary activities to be carried out freely between one mission and another, justified at the plot level with the need to destabilize the simulation as much as possible. From fight club with superpowers to basketball with humans dressed as rabbits instead of balls, there's really no shortage of fun ideas here, and they compensate for the flatness of a part of the story mode. On the other hand, the ~liberation~ of the city is decidedly less incisive, which involves the conquest of about twenty strategic points by eliminating all the alien presences on the spot. At allor useless to progression, and a harbinger of scarce advantages for the player, it is essentially an activity that is completely an end in itself. We were also perplexed by the need to ~unlock~ the shops in which to shop through a mini-game, rather out of place and all too simple to complete. More interesting are the secondary missions offered by the various members of the Saints gang, although, also in this case, on more than one occasion the objectives to be completed turn out to be anything but original, along the lines of ~reach point A and eliminate all enemies~. It is also worth reflecting on the rewards offered by the latter, in some cases really valid (such as the infinite sprint), in others much less, as in the case of the variations for the individual powers based on the elements, which do not add much to the system of fighting. At any time, the simulation can be abandoned to visit the spaceship on which the Saints are progressively freed from alien captivity, but unfortunately the peculiarity has not been exploited in the slightest. Apart from some dialogue and winks to the sexual adventures of Commander Shepard of Mass Effect, between the walls of the shuttle there are no interesting activities or customization opportunities worthy of the classic ~lair of the Saints~ seen in the predecessors. However, the overall longevity did not satisfy us, given that the missions related to the plot are completed in eight hours at most. Completing all the secondary activities will undoubtedly require several more hours, but, even given the not always attractive rewards, only a few players will let themselves be conquered beyond ten, eleven hours overall. From a graphic point of view, Saints Row IV takes a few steps forward compared to the past, while maintaining the same strengths and weaknesses as its predecessor. The good effects linked to the use of weapons and superpowers make each fight a triumph of explosions and chaos on the screen, with remarkable results, but the city undoubtedly remains very bare and poorly characterized, the polygonal modeling approximate, the textures of low quality. Even pushed to the maximum through the graphic settings, the game certainly fails to please the eye, especially in the break phases from the unbridled action, where everything appears constantly very static. Additionally, the constant alien presence and perpetual night sky robs the simulated Steelport of color and vibrancy, making it an even more barren environment from a design standpoint.", "date": "2013-08-14", "grade": "7.8"}
