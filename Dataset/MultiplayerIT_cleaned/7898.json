The game developed by Trion Worlds is in fact half of a project which also includes an unpublished TV series which in a few days will debut on the SyFy channel of the US broadcaster NBC. The beginnings narrated in the television series affect the game world itself which, being an MMO, will see the narrative change following the developments of the episodes that will be aired. The hybrid nature of the project certainly appears interesting and the possibility of relying on a solid narrative framework designed to last for numerous episodes and seasons makes Defiance a virtually constantly evolving game. Postwar California In the near future, a humanoid alien race known as the Votan has reached Earth aboard huge spaceships called the Ark, intending to make our planet their home following the destruction of their home system. Once the planet is already occupied and every attempt at diplomatic mediation has failed, the classic war can only unleash the Earth devastated by the conflict and the terraforming processes implemented by the Votans. The events of the video game begin exactly twenty years after the end of the conflict, when humans and aliens have found a fragile balance for collaboration in a San Francisco Bay Area rendered almost unrecognizable by its post-apocalyptic appearance (the events of the television episodes instead are set in the remains of the city of Saint Louis but in the game itself the protagonists of the series will appear from time to time in a digital guise). The player plays an Ark Hunter, the one who wanders in search of remains and wrecks of alien ships to obtain precious materials and resources, a sort of soldier of fortune engaged in a science fiction gold rush. The peculiarity of Defiance is that it is an exclusively multiplayer third-person shooter characterized by a persistent world. Therefore, since it is not an MMORPG, the role-playing component of character growth is decidedly essential while the dynamic ~hit and run~ action and the player's skill in shootings are the masters. In fact, in creating the character we will have the possibility to modify its external appearance without influencing its talents or statistics which in truth are not even present as values to be increased during the game. The only form of substantial characterization occurs during the initial tutorial when we have to choose one of the four starting skills, choosing between invisibility, increased damage, super speed or a hologram useful for distracting enemies. By increasing our EGO level (an indicator of our skills) we are given the opportunity to obtain other passive perks or to enhance those already unlocked, these are arranged on a tree diagram but to underline the more action inclination of the title it must be said that many of these perks offer rather negligible bonuses. The real difference in combat is the aim and skill of the player himself in managing firefights, as well as the type of weapon supplied, as in any traditional shooter. Pack of lone wolves Although it is an MMO in Defiance there is no real need to create organized groups to proceed in the game. Almost all of the missions are carried out alone and if there is another player nearby who is carrying out the same mission as us, his contribution will be real and concrete both as regards the killing of enemies and for certain contextual actions required that it will be enough that they are carried out only by a single character to progress the mission. Everything is based on a kind of tacit agreement with almost no form of communication: the text chat itself is almost hidden in the menus and is not always present on the screen. Once the quest in question is completed, everyone goes back to wandering their own way. Thus it becomes a particular game for lone wolves, a sort of ~massive single player~ that will appeal to players less inclined to join a clan but that will make those MMORPG enthusiasts who are decidedly more accustomed to a more form of cooperation turn up their noses. deep and organized. There are also rare instances to be played in organized groups of four players, as there is always the possibility of creating your own party by inviting friends to the game, but unlike Borderlands (from which Defiance seems to take inspiration) the approach to the game in a cooperative sense classesco is not particularly incentivized. Then there are occasions that capture the attention of many players, the so-called Arkfall. This is the fall of wreckage of alien spaceships left in orbit on the earth, which once highlighted on the map give way to dynamic events in which several dozen players get to participate at the same time. In these moments it is possible to create a discreet sense of camaraderie in facing the waves of enemies or the gigantic and tough bosses and at the same time the internal challenge between players remains since only the Ark Hunters who will be the best at the end of the event will have access to the loot more prestigious. Given the chaotic action and the large number of players usually present during an Arkfall, it happens to see drastic and annoying frame rate drops on these occasions. Wandering through the vast Bay Area there are also numerous sub-missions or challenges not related to the main narrative but which offer the possibility of challenging the records of players who have already faced such trials. The basic problem of this whole structure is the long-term tendency to repetitive action. The shootings do not shine for particular tactics also thanks to the bad artificial intelligence of the enemies and even the missions end up taking the form of the usual tasks without too much imagination such as cleaning up a certain area or pressing the X key to operate the object in question. Nothing new under the hot Californian sun then. Xbox 360 goals Defiance, like any exclusively online game, will require many hours to get a considerable haul of points. Most of the objectives (50 in total) are related to the progression of the main missions and the maximization of skill levels and obtaining legendary weapons. Note the 70g achievement which simply requires you to complete all other achievements to unlock. A world to save Useful and fun is the use of means of transport, which allow you to move quickly around the playing area and, why not, to run over some mutants during the journey. The peculiarity of the vehicles is that they can be recalled, literally evoked, in front of the player at any time, a feature that solves the problem of finding yourself stuck with the vehicle somewhere in the scenario. Initially we will have a modest quad but later we will also be able to access more performing vehicles including a particular version of the Dodge Charger. In Defiance there is also a PvP component represented by the classic modes such as deathmatch or capture the flag limited in maps with an excellent design and by the more interesting Shadow War that take place in the open world and which are nothing more than vast guerrillas for conquest of the territories. To enter these versus modes, select the required match directly from a quick menu during the game and wait for the match to begin once all the components have been found, in this regard you must be very careful not to have any missions in progress or to be in the middle of an Arkfall event at the time PvP starts otherwise all progress will be lost. To be reviewed is the structure of certain menus that tend to ~hide~ the fundamental options and in particular the inventory which is not very organized when you start having numerous types of different weapons, weapons that can also be modified by the player to improve their stats . Visually Defiance is a product that has to face numerous compromises, in particular for the vastness of the area and for the number of players present. In the console version we tested, low-resolution textures and aliasing are evident. There are also moments in which entire portions of the scenario disappear (although 10 GB of mandatory installation are required!), symptoms of a non-perfect optimization work, together with the instability of the frame rate in the most crowded moments we have already talked about . In the game there is also an internal shop where you can buy items with real money (or Microsoft Points) but these are only goods that do not offer advantages to the player, but rather mere aesthetic ornaments for the character or new fairings for vehicles, nothing therefore fundamental. Defiance is also one of the rare MMOs that doesn't require a monthly subscription. The game is completely in English.", "date": "2013-04-15", "grade": "6.7"}
