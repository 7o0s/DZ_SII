This is a statement that will anger some, but it's hard to see it any other way. Both console versions of RAGE will be able to target a more compared to PC. Today, the level of quality of a game depends on the efforts put into its development, not on the hardware it runs on. A game made with a tenth of the available resources, on a ten times more powerful platform , it would still be a poor product.~ These are the words that John Carmack pronounced just a couple of days ago, pressed by the trade press that he wanted to understand why the PC version of RAGE did not correspond to user expectations, to say the least. Here's what happened to surfaces before the patch There were indeed many controversies that accompanied the launch of the new id Software production, capable of imposing quality standards on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 that were in some ways out of scale, but at the same time disappointing those who expected a sort of new Crysis on the Windows platform. A situation that sees reasons that can be shared by both parties, and which can basically be tackled in two ways: the first requires the player to try his hand at the RAGE single player campaign with a grimace of intense dissatisfaction on his face, which given the duration of the title developed by Carmack and associates (about fifteen hours at least, at least three times the now sad average of the FPS genre) could lead to permanent facial paralysis; the second way consists in turning a blind eye to the objective technical shortcomings of the game and enjoying its undoubtedly ~old school~ charm, the structure that gives a nod to free roaming, the surprising AI of the enemies and their variety, as well as a level design so inspired that we almost forget (almost, eh) that there is no on-screen map for the scenarios, and that therefore you have to figure out which way to go on your own during each mission. Willy Signori and I come from afar As per tradition for id Software, the protagonist of RAGE does not actually have a face or opinions, he simply interacts with a series of characters and can agree or not to carry out missions on their behalf. Not that he has much to lose: part of a project intended to preserve the human race after the fall of a huge asteroid on the planet, our alter ego awoke later than expected from his cryogenic sleep, by which time the damage was done: entire metropolises razed to the ground, society practically wiped out and the survivors locked up in a handful of strongholds who must beware of the onslaught of marauders, mutants and groups of simple rowdies. The quality of the textures is fluctuating, unfortunately A scenario in which only the strongest survives, and where the nanotrites that flow through the protagonist's veins can make the difference between life and death, as they allow him to survive wounds that would kill a common man, as well as to revive in extremis using a sort of internal defibrillator (whose discharge, however, momentarily stuns nearby enemies). The adventure takes place in different locations, gradually larger, in each of which we can choose to complete only the main missions or to also dedicate ourselves to the ~side quests~, which RAGE encourages us to complete by giving away some interesting ~prize~. The course component also represents an extra compared to the shooter action, with a series of prize competitions in which in some cases we are forced to participate (to get more powerful and faster vehicles, for example) but which never turn out to be boring , rather they offer the right mix of arcade driving and ~on the fly~ combat between miniguns, rockets and pulse cannons. Beyond the races, it is necessary to get on board your own car to reach the place of the missions from time to time, avoiding all the pitfalls of the devastated area both on the outward journey and on the way back. The mechanics that regulate driving, the use of the boost and the weapons are simple but well done, and therefore running around the deserted lands even just looking for opponents to dethrone is a more fun experience than expected. Shoot everything The fulcrum of RAGE's gameplay clearly lies in the shooter sections, truly enjoyable both during the first half of the adventure, or when the acquisition of new equipment is the order of the day and the ~crafting~ component is discovered with the conversion of the materials collected in more or less useful tools, both during the second part of the same, con the level of difficulty that rises gradually (although without reaching impossible peaks, indeed) and you find yourself facing increasingly numerous waves of enemies, as well as some imposing bosses. Therefore, if the product of Carmack and Willits can be defined as ~console-centric~ in its technical aspects, it certainly appears ~PC-centric~ in terms of its approach to the genre, given that the behavioral routines that regulate the movement of our opponents appear immediately ~analogue stick-proof~ between somersaults, jumps and shots that are completely plausible for a beastly creature that wants to stand up to an enemy armed with a rifle. The mouse / keyboard combination therefore allows us to waste fewer shots and to be quicker in aiming, even if we do not feel at all advised against the controller for playing; on the contrary, the greater difficulty in framing the fastest enemies can have positive sides, especially if we want to test ourselves. The proverbial ~support~ of the analog stick then comes in handy in the advanced stages, when the opponents to be defeated are perhaps heavily armored soldiers and their strategy consists in taking a stand, opening fire but retreating and regrouping in case of trouble. The work done by the developers with regard to artificial intelligence is therefore excellent, and is undoubtedly one of the strengths of RAGE. The dismay of seeing an enemy that is decidedly tougher than usual appear in front of you is an increasingly rare sensation in the current panorama of first person shooters, and although between bandages and a defibrillator it is actually quite difficult to find the game over, the tension at each new encounter it certainly makes itself felt. And that's a great thing. The missions gradually become more substantial, but it is a gradual process, which does not traumatize ... unless you forget to save, of course. And here we need to open a necessary parenthesis: the exclusively manual saving system adopted by id Software for this title is at least anachronistic and often ends up breaking the rhythm of the action. We therefore hope that with the next updates we will switch to the classic automatic save based on checkpoints. The reference platform? And here we are at the ~speech~, in which we will not discuss bees and storks but rather the reason why we felt the need to dedicate a second review to RAGE after the very detailed one by the beautiful and talented Pierpappo. The words of John Carmack that we mentioned at the beginning raised a very predictable uproar, mostly because it was he who uttered them, but it must be said that during the same interview the famous co-founder of id Software also said that, in In this specific case, his team started with the console version of the game with the aim of ~powering~ it on PC as much as current technology would allow them to do. Unfortunately we can say that it didn't go like this, in the sense that as for ~brute power~ RAGE has nothing to do with the aforementioned Crysis nor with what was done at the time for DooM 3. The game turns out to be surprisingly light, so much to be shot at 60 frames per second on our test configuration at 1920x1080 pixel resolution in indoor scenarios (slightly less in outdoor ones), albeit with all the problems related to texture pop-in effect, which we have documented in some images and which fortunately was fixed with the release of the first patch. The update, which came out just before we got to discussing the technical sector of RAGE and which we therefore tried in extremis, finally allows us to activate vertical synchrony from the options (at certain resolutions the tearing, in fact, was all too evident ), as well as setting the anisotropic filtering and above all the texture cache on various levels. This last feature practically completely solves the problems of pop-in on surfaces, effectively eliminating the major criticalities of the id Software product. However, it does not suddenly become a graphically perfect game, and which indeed often gets lost in the details, with plots thrown there at random and ~hasty~ solutions that leave you genuinely dumbfounded: you can see some examples by clicking on the numerous images that we have captured for the review. However, we would like to say that beyond the mere polygonal count, the lack of support for DirectX 11 and what in any case presents itself as an excellent optimization of resources, capable of guaranteeing good fluidity even on medium-range configurations, the new creature of Carmack and Willits is equipped with an excellent level design, well-characterized and detailed characters and an unmatched artistic thicknessmune, which, moreover, always remains at certain levels of quality. Finally, the local edition is for once enriched and not spoiled by the Italian dubbing, created using a highly professional cast and even respecting the audio-video synchrony.", "date": "2011-10-11", "grade": "8.9"}
