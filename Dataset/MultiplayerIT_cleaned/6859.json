For this reason, many of them assume the role of forerunner for their older brothers, with ideas that perhaps in the future could be developed in a different way. Ed Heavy Bullets is a product that certainly knows how to take certain risks... Heavy Bullets is a risky title, yes, but also very interesting Two-dimensional worlds in 3D Taking drugs is harmful to our bodies (and our brains), but equally so is running at two hundred kilometers an hour on mountain roads or diving from a tower a hundred meters high to land on a hay cart. The beauty of video games is precisely the possibility of simulating, or at least returning part of the potential emotions, that the same experience could give you if you lived it in the real world. Heavy Bullets, by its nature or by indirect derivation from having spent time in its company, sets itself the difficult task of giving the player the same hallucinations of an LSD trip. The result is the same as observing a sixteen-color video game on a 286, i.e. seeing primary neon colors cloaking the meager textures of game walls, treading angular terrain bristling with improbable geometric figures, facing lethal dangers and advancing on a uncertain path. Remaining on the theme of graphics, it is surprising how setting the details to the maximum level sometimes creates slight drops in frame rate or occasional freezes of the image lasting a very few moments. Callaghan's dystopian dream When you start a game you will find yourself, armed with a revolver, in a labyrinth dotted with pseudo-tropical flowers and surrounded by high walls that prevent you from seeing further. The aim is simple: explore the area, eliminate hostile threats, collect coins and find sliding doors that allow you to pass from one area to another, until you find a trap door that will allow you to reach the next level. Said like this it seems all too trivial, but we can guarantee you that death will assail you almost faster than a game of Ghouls' n Ghosts, as a single enemy attack can mark a sudden, and premature for our videogame habit, Game Over. Once you get used to leaving the pens, you will learn that moving in this environment of botanical nonsense can also be done, albeit with due care. From the second game you will find that the title in question generates levels procedurally, so that you can not even afford to treasure the previous missteps, as you are used to do in the Demon's / Dark Souls series. The threats, which I mentioned, generally consist of lethal snakes hidden in the vegetation, hungry canids reminiscent of Super Mario's Categnacci and robots that shoot annoyingly treacherous laser beams in accelerating your departure. Each of them will be offensive towards you in a different way: the snakes will wait for you to get close to bite you, even ending up poisoning you, the hungry biters will run towards you very quickly, while the robots will be immobile, but will strike from long distances. All of these opponents can be shot down with a single pistol shot, but in the case of the robots, you have to look for some kind of control unit nearby, which means exposing yourself to potential enemy fire to finish off the despicable opponent. Each attack suffered will fully or partially reduce one of your three hearts available. In the case of snakes you could even be poisoned, and suffer a progressive loss of life. In your rescue you can take advantage of the equipment available which will make you, more or less, able to resist as much as possible, or at least try to reach the next step. Each of the enemies can be eliminated by a precise shot fired from the trusty revolver. Its magnetic projectiles, after hitting a target, ricochet in the surrounding area, until you are close enough to physically suck them into your weapon. If the ~lead~ ends, for having had the trigger too easy, the consequence will be that of being at the mercy of the fauna, be it biological or robotic. In extremis you could take advantage of other elements, such as mines or bombs to place, remembering however that, without your primary weapon, you will still be ~naked~. Potions can cure poisoning, but you can carry bombs or potions in your inventory, so you'll have to make a precise and, if you like, slightly tactical choice. Both by trampling the grass and by eliminating the enemies you will be able to wadegnare precious coins, to be spent in vending machines located along the way. The latter will release all the elements of care and equipment at a high price that you will be forced to invest in the course of the main mission. As a corollary to the above, we remind you that the title in question, along the eight levels available, will give you the Steam Cards as a reward for the patience you have shown.", "date": "2014-10-07", "grade": "7.0"}
