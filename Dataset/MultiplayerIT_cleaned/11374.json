{"name": "Ninja Gaiden 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-gaiden-2-recensione.html", "text": "New lineage? The most evident novelty inserted by Itakagi in this Ninja Gaiden can be summarized with an exchange of jokes that we had during a recent interview. According to the team leader of Team Ninja, the fights of the first chapter were too syncopated, interrupted as they were by the enemies who constantly parried each other. This time, however, this happens much less and the approximately 15 hours it takes to get to the end are carnage without interruptions, if not some platform phase, which is also valid, so much so that if the Team Ninja had inserted more they would do no one wrong. Far from it. The enemies tend not to parry, therefore, and to use the same techniques as the player to sell their skin dearly, with lowered guard and continuous and unstoppable deadly blows and which become increasingly lethal as the levels progress. Another novelty is the inclusion of the possibility of performing beheadings on enemies whose limbs have already been severed, by pressing the strong blow key, with which any opponent, regardless of size, is finished off in a single blow and with dozens of spectacular sequences, different according to the weapon in hand, highlighted by the camera that gets dangerously close to the action. The first hours with Ninja Gaiden are a continuous search for the fatal blow, obtained by jumping into the fray with some combos and pressing the button to trigger the decapitation and with excellent results, so much so that one thinks that Itakagi, to meet those who criticized Ninja Gaiden as too difficult, may have created a game that is too easy. Also because now the weapons that Ryu collects along his adventure can be upgraded and raised by three levels, and it is possible to obtain one with maximum power from the end of the second stage. The results are devastating for the poor ninjas who seem to have no escape and which suggest a gentle ride towards the end, with a plot finally told with complex cutscenes full of twists and turns. From the middle onwards, however, the difficulty rises, and already from the basic difficulty level some bosses and sequences have to be repeated several times before emerging unscathed (although the fact remains that it is a more accessible game than the previous one, unless jump to the last two difficulty levels). However, this does not happen only due to the strength of the opponents (whose artificial intelligence continues to be one of the flagships of the series), but also due to some flaws that have not been resolved even with this chapter. First of all, the camera, which seems to have improved as long as the action is relatively fast-paced, but which shows all its limits when things get serious. When the enemies begin to be dozens and to surround Ryu from all sides and without maintaining stable positions, there is a need for continuous framing adjustments to keep an eye on them and in some cases you give up, resorting to some combos that are sure to hit , hoping that they won't be interrupted by the beatings of the bad guys on duty. Added to all this are increasingly difficult opponents, such as some armed with missile launchers, who don't have attack patterns in which to be able to insinuate themselves in moments of pause. Simply, they continue to shoot preventing Ryu from moving, if not with the dash to dodge, only that sometimes you end up in really frustrating situations, especially at the higher difficulty levels with our poor ninja who takes them heartily without being able to move a finger. And all without forgetting a couple of bosses that will make you scream. Even with joy, however, once you defeat them. With Ninja Gaiden 2, several times you will find yourself exulting in front of the monitor for having finally overcome a battle that seemed insurmountable to you. Itakagi knows how to galvanize a player and this is probably his greatest talent, as well as having perfected a combat system that has few equals around. A macabre dance The animations of Ninja Gaiden 2  all drawn by hand, by the way  are the most beautiful aspect of the cosmetics. Spectacular, fluid and linked in the most homogeneous way, they manage to animate the idea of a continuous, brutal and merciless struggle. The sound effects do their part and the steel of Ryu's blade sometimes makes you shiver. This time, however, where the first Ninja Gaiden had left players from all over the world speechless, the magic does not repeat itself, and Team Ninja continues on the road all polygons and few effects, which it has traveled throughout this new generation of hardware, for a game that is still very pleasant to look at, but which never lands the knockout blow. Not all settings, by the way, are up to parof the situation and some of these are rather easily forgotten. Certainly, Ninja Gaiden 2 with flying heads, injured enemies crawling on the ground and blood flowing everywhere succeeds in hitting the player, involving him and dragging him into a frenetic and, at times, exhausting hyperbole. Provided you don't get scared and hold on, certain that the reward will be up to a lot of sweat, and turn a blind eye to some slowdown, especially when the enemies on the screen at the highest difficulty levels become too many and when the game hangs for a few moments while loading an area (a rather rare occurrence, by the way). To complete the package, a cinema mode that allows you to record entire levels, watch them and share them with friends, and online leaderboards with which to see who has achieved the most points and in how much time. Including the other difficulty levels, Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of the longest-running action games on Xbox 360. Comment Ninja Gaiden 2 is more violent, faster and more devastating than its predecessor, which had done so much to give an identity to the first Xbox. However, it also seems like a game with less clear ideas and which still doesn't solve some problems such as camera management. The long road that must be traveled to bring it to the end is paved with many highs, but also with some lows that do not allow Itakagi's new (and last) effort to leave the same indelible mark in the realm of action games, as happened previously. The best game of its kind on Xbox 360 and, for Ryu fans, Next Gen so far, but the dazzling animations and adrenaline rushes can't quite erase the memory of some unconvincing locations, and a fill the absence of the graphic impact with which Team Ninja was able to amaze thousands of fans. When Ryu's blade cuts, however, it leaves exhilarating marks and, if the demanding challenges don't scare you, there are hours and hours of lucid madness waiting for you. Pro Combat System almost perfect The animations The longevity Cons Some settings not up to par Difficulty not always calibrated to the best The camera Xbox 360 - Goals Finishing Ninja Gaiden 2 even at a basic level will take you to score around 400 points and it will take you about 14 hours. To get to 1000, the matter is much more complicated, because it must be finished at all difficulty levels and the last two are really prohibitive, and because it should be finished once using only one of the weapons available. The Tests of Valor, then, require a fair amount of effort, as well as the discovery of all the skulls.", "date": "2008-06-11", "grade": null}
