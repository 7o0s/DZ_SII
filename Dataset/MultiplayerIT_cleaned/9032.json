The game, released in 2004 for PlayStation 2, boasted its own iconography and a series of very bizarre and very ~Japanese~ characters: on the one hand, the entity called the King of the Cosmos, who exercises his power throughout the universe but he is fascinated by the little things that his vast realm manages to express; on the other the Prince his son, absurdly tiny in proportions but capable of rolling up huge ~katamari~, or agglomerations that starting from the most insignificant objects gradually become large enough to also incorporate cars, houses, buildings and who knows what else , exerting an apparently limitless action. The success of Katamari Damacy led the franchise to express itself with other episodes, also passing on PSP, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The landing on the App Store was therefore only a matter of time, which took place last year with I Love Katamari, a reduction mobile equipped with tilt controls which for a number of reasons made the historical fans of the series turn up their noses a bit. The publication of Katamari Amore is therefore full of expectations, with Namco Bandai having to demonstrate to old and new users that they have the numbers to establish themselves also on the iOS platform, effectively translating their most famous IPs on Apple devices. The game is presented for the occasion in a freemium format, or downloadable for free but in this case with rather limited ~free~ content: a single stage, which can only be tackled in time attack mode. It therefore proves to be an obligatory step to access the in-game store to purchase the first available level package, at the all in all popular price of 2.99 euros. A messy business Once you have downloaded the ~Have a Nice Trip!~ pack, Katamari Amore undoubtedly takes on the characteristics of a full-bodied product. In fact, there are six scenarios available included in the package, plus a seventh extra level inspired by the classic Pac-Man, in which our Prince will have to roll up but dedicating himself only to the ~yellow sugared almonds~ that we know well, guarding against the arrival of ghosts and therefore moving exactly like Pac-Man with the aim of collecting all the objects present in a psychedelic labyrinth. Apart from this nice extra, each of the six standard levels can be played in four different modes: ~story~, ~time challenge~, ~custom mode~ and ~eternal mode~. The first follows the ~plot~ of the game and therefore sees the King of the Cosmos entrusting us from time to time with the task of rolling up a particular object of his liking. To succeed in the enterprise we must therefore begin to incorporate the smallest things, within the reach of our katamari, and gradually increase the size of the ~skein~ until it is precisely possible to capture the objective of the mission as well. As per tradition for the series, we will find ourselves really ~rolling up~ everything, including many bizarre objects of which you can read a separate description if you want. The mechanics of Katamari Amore also provide for a progressive increase in our measurements, in the sense that if at the beginning we collect erasers and pencils, in the more advanced stages we will drag away entire houses and more or less large buildings. The ~time challenge~ mode requires that the Prince manage to obtain a katamari of a certain size within a limited time, while in the ~custom challenge~ mode the same mission will be characterized by strict limits regarding the measurements of the katamari, which must be exactly as indicated. Finally, the ~eternal mode~ will allow us to move and roll up everything we want in each stage, in order to capture even objects that we thought were immovable and perhaps discover some nice secrets. Unlike the previous I Love Katamari, in this new episode we will be able to use a control system based on the accelerometer but also and above all two methods with virtual sticks, the first of which (single stick) soon proves to be the most practical and accurate. For the rest, in terms of technical realization, style and inspiration, things have not changed that much: the graphics are functional to the action and know how to amaze, especially if we do not know this particular franchise, but longtime fans may be disappointed from the lack of a level design up to the situation, as well as dynamics that are not at all innovative.
