The transposition in the form of a mobile game could perhaps appear reductive compared to the console market, but Konami obviously thinks differently and in fact it is possible to perceive right from the the production value of a title with traditional implications, but decidedly ambitious: we talk about it in the review of EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy. History EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy, Rebecca and Shiki during a dialogue The story of EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy takes up that of the manga and anime, telling us about the mysterious planet Granbell and the population of automatons that inhabit it: it is a place born as a sort of theme park but abandoned over time. One day the pretty b-cuber (a sort of cosmic variation of the youtubers) Rebecca Bluegarden visits him together with her robotic cat, Happy, and that's where the adventure begins. Among the androids of the planet there is in fact also a mysterious boy , Shiki Granbell: a cross between Goku and Luffy who has never met other human beings and who was raised by the Great Demon King Ziggy, a powerful robot who, however, has stopped working for several years, leaving him the power of Ether as a dowry Gravity Gear and encouraging him to visit new worlds to make friends. Seeing Rebecca, Granbell's androids fake an insurrection to make Shiki leave with the b-cuber and thus fulfill his destiny, given that in reality the boy was not born in that place but very far from there. Registered in the guild of adventurers and became the captain of the ship Edens Zero along with some new travel companions, Shiki sets himself the goal of meeting the Mother: a cosmic entity that no one has ever been able to reach. Although inevitably derivative in some situations, the plot of EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy can be followed in a very pleasant way thanks to the well-tested characterization of the Japanese-style characters, which in the first missions sees the initial couple confronting new supporting actors who will join the team, such as Weisz Steiner, the little robot Pino, the gynoid Witch Regret and the warrior Homura Kogetsu. Gameplay EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy, a combat sequence The gameplay of EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy refers to the traditional mechanics of mobile action RPGs, with an approach that is therefore simplified compared to PC and console productions but not to the point of supporting well-known freemium dynamics such as the artificial increase in difficulty and, in general, the concept of paywall. The combat system is in fact characterized by fairly immediate and precise touch controls, with automatic couplings as regards the basic attack and the specials (but the ultimate from this point of view often ends up to go empty), as well as the possibility of jumping and above all of carrying out an evasive action to avoid suffering damage, especially during the numerous boss fights present during the campaign. EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy, Rebecca and the cat Happy True, the action often becomes quite confusing when the screen is literally filled with explosions and the control of ranged-type characters (therefore Rebecca and Weisz) appears approximate due to the automatic aiming, but the impact rendering is good and the maneuvers evasive techniques allow you to manage even the most difficult clashes without relying on chance or on a simple comparison between power levels, a mechanism that often refers to grinding. Structurally, the experience is very simple, with scenarios devoid of any interaction and delegated solely to clash with gangs of enemies to finally get to the boss fight on duty, so the feeling of excessive repetitiveness is literally around the corner, but the ability to switch from one character to another at any time, looting, customizations and everything else contributes to maintaining interest. Graphics and sound EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy, one of the first boss fights It is undoubtedly on the technical level that EDENS ZERO Pocket Galaxy reveals its great potential and an important investment by Konami. The game uses a modular structure, with separate downloads and medium-long uploads that are certainly annoying (also because it is a system that the developers could haveto optimize, and the hope is that they do it through updates), but graphics and sound are excellent. The first, rigorously in cel shading, refers to the style of the manga and not of the anime, without exceeding in the fanservice as it does ( and in abundance) the original work of Mashima, but the variety of characters and assets available is substantially above the average on mobile. Sure, the animations in the cutscenes and scenery have an obvious old-gen nature to them, but there are some interesting trebles. The sound, on the other hand, relies on fairly generic music but at the same time on a complete dubbing in Japanese, localized in Italian through subtitles.", "date": "2022-03-05", "grade": "8.0"}
