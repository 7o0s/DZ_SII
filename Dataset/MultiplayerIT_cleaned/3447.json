{"name": "Destiny 2: Ombre dal Profondo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destiny-2-ombre-dal-profondo-recensione.html", "text": "We already said it a few days ago on the occasion of the special dedicated to Destiny: New Light: the separation of Bungie from Activision represents a double-edged sword. Free but even more conditioned by an impact deriving from the judgments of the community, which in this specific case it is no longer possible to justify behind alleged forcing by the American publisher. The review of Destiny 2: Shadows from the Deep, the latest expansion of the looter shooter made by the Seattle boys, is therefore more difficult than expected. It is not a matter of affection for a title which, willy-nilly, has always convinced us to return to immerse ourselves in its world in the past five years; as much as a structure of expansion that inevitably will have to be analyzed in the long term, but which today requires a judgment linked to what we have seen so far. We spent about forty hours wandering around the solar system, divided between the campaign, the inevitable farming, high-level activities, exotic businesses and the brand new raid. The time has therefore come to sum up what this expansion has given us so far, also trying to draw a line towards a future that appears uncertain in quantity and quality, but never as strongly inspired as it is today. The trip to the moon The important and historic adaptation of the title of this paragraph derives from one of the first masterpieces in the history of cinema. In that (not so) short short film we were catapulted onto our satellite, giving us a fantastic and dreamlike perspective that until then we had never even taken into consideration. The Shadows from the Deep campaign does exactly this: it takes us back to a planet known to all the old players of the first Destiny, the Moon, and presents it to us similar but changed, the same in shape but extended, embellished with a whole series of angles and holes previously unreachable and packed by the signs of time and past battles. It is clear that the nostalgia effect only applies to old users, who however at the same time also experience a recycling of assets, elements, locations and historical enemies, which new players inevitably will not perceive. Here too lurks the specter, and never was a more apt term, than a double-edged sword. We are catapulted to the moon because in some way recalled by Eris Morn: a former guardian like us, who became blind and not entirely mentally stable after trying to overcome the abyss. The only survivor of her team, she is today one of the most particular and structured characters of the incredible space opera put together by Bungie. Eris has unintentionally awakened something by going to snoop where the pyramid ships are stationed, ending up filling the moon with nightmares. The latter are nothing more than emanations of the same deeds of the past of the guardians, which lead to finding on one's path not only the ghosts of many lost companions (Eris lives with these presences constantly) but also the nightmares generated by the enemies of the past, some the most fearsome that we have faced in these five years. Although this element may be interesting at first glance, and it actually looks splendid from a scenic point of view, one cannot hide one's head in the sand and not notice the re-proposition of old contents in a good half of the short campaign of Shadows from the Deep. A handful of missions that open up this new narrative arc, far from finished, and that put the player in a position to re-explore places such as the World Tomb, the Hellmouth, the Anchor of Light and many others which flank the new area where the Scarlatta Fortress is also located. What always seems difficult to understand, from the point of view of a progression devoted to narration, is the need to add more than one absolutely superfluous farming phase, capable only of breaking the rhythm of the action and which, among other things, annoys a player who finds himself spending half of the few hours of history, collecting materials for a freely explorable planet. To counteract this element, however, there is an expressive quality within the cutscenes and an artistic level in the creation of environments and scenarios, which still today honestly suggest that Bungie's artists are somehow ~wasted~ for an FPS . Some of the glimpses that you find yourself looking at during the story missions are truly jaw-dropping, marveling at that moving picture that turns out to be Destiny. Obviously, a deep and damned successful lore will help in this, which with this narrative arc would seem to reach a turning point for thehistory of the franchise and that Bungie itself considers a milestone in the continuation of the path. Gameplay: between recycling and renewal Did we mention how difficult this expansion is to judge? And so we repeat it loudly now that we are in the context of the actual gameplay and content. We believe it is now superfluous to dwell on the quality of a shooting system like that of Bungie. The Seattle kids have been teaching gunplay for fifteen years and still remain unsurpassed today for fun and gun-in-hand feedback. Shooting in Destiny 2 is a pleasure, even after several consecutive hours and this is certainly a big point in favor of a title that makes shooting its main fulcrum. However, we are talking about a looter shooter, a game that must convince its users to stay connected for a long time and to constantly return to orbit to repeat those activities already completed and possibly to find new ones. In fact, Bungie's key choice for this new development process of his creature is based on this last point. Already started last year with the seasons that followed the release of Forsaken, this new expansion pushes the concept of support over time to the limit, inserting a large part of the contents during the first three months of life. On the other hand, Bungie's road map for Shadowkeep has never been a mystery and we were all well aware of the arrival of some important content in the coming weeks and months. What the team was keen to underline is their desire to use this year to experiment with everything they have not been able to do up to now, carrying forward the horizontality of a narrative that will only close next summer, interspersed with small vertical plot step: like the one linked to the Vex which is the background to this first season. In this sense it is really difficult to judge as a whole a content that is far from finished and concluded and which will see new exotic enterprises, events and even the second dungeon after the great success of ~The Broken Throne~ added in the next period course last year. Net of this awareness, our task is to tell you if at present what is there is worth the price of the ticket and the answer, in general, is yes but with some due reservations. In fact, Shadows from the Deep is a deeply reduced expansion compared to what Forsaken turned out to be a year ago. Less content, fewer new objects and fewer activities, most of which are recycled from elements already present in the distant and recent past of the series. For this reason, what is most effective is Bungie's desire to repair some past oversights, especially related to the customization of weapons and armor, but trying the most difficult path: the long-term one. Speaking in practical terms, the adventure as we already know it starts for everyone at level 50 experience and 750 light. From this moment on it is possible to go up quickly and easily up to the first softcap set at 900. Here things get more difficult and, unless using practices that have to do with interchanging the use of various characters , we will find ourselves exponentially slowing down growth, until we reach the definitive maximum level of available light. Even this detail is not exactly true, because the expansion adds a specific artifact to the equation which allows, through the acquisition of experience, to reach a hypothetical infinite level of power, despite the fact that the request in terms of hours of play rises significantly exponential. The peculiarity of this artifact is that it will be reset and modified with each new season, thus making the acquisition of experience imperishable. Furthermore, it is an object linked to your account and as such available for all three of your characters, with a growth sharing that makes playing with each of them useful and comfortable. In addition to the increase in light, the artifact will also unlock a series of specific perks, some of which will be essential for the continuation within some activities such as the night falls and the raid. In fact, the game introduces a whole series of new opponents that cannot be knocked down except by using specific projectiles or modifications that can be activated on some weapon classes by unlocking their perks on this artifact. This is how armored or overloaded champions can finally be stunned and knocked down. This variable is interesting and is one of the examples of Bungie's desire to make Destiny 2 a title closer to an RPG. From this also derives the addition of armor 2.0, of the aesthetes customizationca and the possible points that can be spent to add the mods, now no longer consumable but applicable when needed by paying a certain amount of materials. The particularity of the product linked to seasonality also introduces a further novelty: the pass. Among the various menu options, it will now be possible to view the one hundred levels that your account will be able to climb during the season, including the rewards that each level will be able to generate. With each new step you will be able to accumulate up to two different objects, one totally free and the other linked to the purchase of the season pass (included in the purchase of Shadows from the Deep). This system loudly recalls that of many other free to play on the market, but we are not faced with a pay to win formula, at most only with a speeding up of growth and the accumulation of a certain quantity of materials. Individual seasons will cost around ten euros and will introduce each time a new subplot and a series of contents spread over the course of the reference quarter, until the new major expansion arrives next September. This now seems to be the path dictated by Bungie, with the hope that players can feel satisfied with this diluted use. We don't mind the idea on paper, above all because the drive to do well is immediately clear, having specified all the contents that will arrive, including the day of release, between now and December. However, what becomes difficult to judge is precisely the long-term stability and the quality of the activities that will arrive. For no reason can we take a leap of faith and believe the promises when we are in the review and, for this reason, giving Shadows from the Deep a vote today puts it in the unfortunate situation of being meager and unsatisfying. Certainly promising but far from the sensations generated by Forsaken upon its arrival on the market. We'll be back to talk about it when the time comes, and we'll continue to do so consistently in the coming months, convinced that we can give you the best coverage Destiny has ever deserved. The new raid We spend two words aside on the new Raid, as we often like to do. The Garden of Salvation, an activity without matchmaking for six players, was able to give everyone a little bit of great satisfaction. While not as prohibitive as the raid released a year ago with the arrival of Forsaken, which had taken a good 19 hours to be completed by the first team, what was positively surprising was Bungie's ability to play a lot on mobility. Anyone who has never faced a Destiny raid will hardly be able to understand the coordination and harmony required for a team to understand and complete its various sections. Each step has its own unique and unrepeatable mechanics, which is not explained but must be understood by trying and failing, trying again until you understand how to get out of it. All this raid combines coordination with mobility, making the arenas large and connected by rough terrain or long treacherous corridors. An important but rewarding challenge for all Destiny players. Technique We want to say the last words about the technical and artistic aspect of the game, as we always do. Destiny 2 remains an aesthetic jewel to this day. The settings, the sound effects, the work on manual skills and the control of the different classes, represent the flagship of the genre to which they belong. If a slight lag is still perceived on the console when opening the menus, the title remains extraordinarily optimized on PC even in this transposition on Steam. Compared to the past we have noticed a loss of a few frames, but these are really imperceptible trifles unless you have an FPS counter always on the screen. The glimpses that the game puts before us regarding the new settings on the Moon, the horizon visible from the Scarlet Fortress and the skilful use of canyons and high rock walls to then hide wide views that open up in an instant before our eyes, are the calling card of a team of artists who are difficult to recognize elsewhere. yet another small masterpiece linked to the soundtrack, with melodies that recall the past and totally new pieces, which exploit the idea of darkness and nightmare to instill that pinch of tension typical of horror with distressing sounds alternating with large orchestral parts. A feast for the eyes and for the ears.", "date": "2019-10-08", "grade": "7.5"}
