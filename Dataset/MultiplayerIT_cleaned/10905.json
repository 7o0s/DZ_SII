{"name": "Platinum Solitaire 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/platinum-solitaire-2.html", "text": "If for old cell phones card games were perhaps the only possible type of playful application, today the situation is very different; and if someone decides to develop such a title for Java-compatible devices, it certainly doesn't do it for technical needs, but rather to retrace paths already trodden, which often ensure an economic return given the accessibility and everlasting charm of this type of productions. Gameloft has proven countless times that they ~know their stuff~, and the quality of its catalog amply demonstrates it. In the specific case of Platinum Solitaire 2, the French publisher has done nothing but operate as per tradition, transforming a single title (Platinum Solitaire, in fact) into a series that will become richer, more engaging and technically valid from episode to episode. The main menu of the game allows us to start a quick game, with random parameters, or to try our hand at the ~world tour~, or a ~career~ mode that will see us visit six locations around the world. Each setting has ~favorite~ card games as well as different settings regarding bets, with the stakes which can be more or less high and will determine the degree of our victories or defeats. Once we have chosen a type of solitaire, we will have to place our bets and play accordingly: the greater the money up for grabs, the more moves we will have to get right, with the level of difficulty increasing accordingly. As mentioned at the beginning, twelve types of solitaire are available. The first one we'll have to deal with is the one that everyone knows, with a deck of reserve cards, four boxes to stack them in numerical order, according to the suits, and various columns filled randomly: our goal will be to fill the boxes, but to do this we will first have to sort the cards in descending order, mixing the ~red~ ones with the ~black~ ones. In the so-called ~pyramid~, we will instead have to pair two cards to reach the sum of thirteen, eliminating them to make room through a sort of random pyramid. The ~Monaco~ solitaire will see us check the cards on a table to eliminate those numerically equal that are in an adjacent position horizontally, vertically or obliquely. In the ~black hole~, on the other hand, we will have to start from an ace of spades placed in the center of the board and stack all the cards on it in ascending or descending order, with the goal (far from simple) of eliminating them all. Among the twelve games there is also a couple of alternative applications, such as the one that presents us with a riddle based on the challenges and locations unlocked up to that point. The technical realization of Platinum Solitaire 2 is excellent, in the classic Gameloft style which sees the characters drawn on the basis of photographs, with a clean, readable and visually very pleasant interface. It's a shame that the uploads are so frequent and also quite long, but it's a flaw that can be overcome. The sound consists of some fairly good quality MIDI music, which accompanies our games without infamy or praise, while the controls are very simple and are based almost exclusively on the d-pad and key 5. PRO Twelve different solitaire games Technically well done Each game features a great tutorial AGAINST Rather invasive uploads Some games are much more difficult than others Games tend to last a long time", "date": "2009-01-27", "grade": "S.V."}
