{"name": "Ricomincio da Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-zero.html", "text": "A train is attacked by numerous vermin-like creatures, who exterminate the passengers and conductors, apparently under the control of a mysterious individual. This happens just as a STARS helicopter is flying over the forest of Raccoon City, to lead a team of agents to investigate the strange happenings in the area. Suddenly, the helicopter's engine fails and the pilot is forced to make an emergency landing. A little bruised but still whole, the STARS agents exit the vehicle and begin to explore the area, immediately finding the remains of a police cell phone and the bodies of the drivers. They were taking a former Navy SEAL, Billy Coen, to the institution where he was to be executed for the murder of twenty-three people. Under the command of the young agent Rebecca Chambers, you start searching the area, paying attention to the possible presence of the escaped prisoner. On your way, however, you don't find a man, but a train... stopped on its tracks. Once you enter the convoy, you find that you can no longer get out because the hatches are locked. Of course, that's not the worst news. The passengers of the train, in fact, turn out to be quite lively for being corpses. Something turned them into zombies, and the problem with zombies is that they're always hungry... for living flesh. The strange couple Making your way through the undead won't be a problem at first, thanks to the service pistol and a certain amount of ammunition. As in the other Resident Evils, to knock out a walking corpse, it will be enough to hit it a few times, or inflict a targeted shot on the head. Trouble is, the pistol won't help you much, and you'll quickly find that saving ammo is your top priority. After an initial inspection of the wagons, you will have contact with the creatures that caused the disaster: small organisms with teeth, capable of grouping together to form dangerous bipedal monsters. Just when the situation gets critical, Billy Coen rushes to your aid... So the multiple murderer you feared so much doesn't seem like a bad person at all, and you decide to act as a couple. Just as the train mysteriously resumes its journey. At this point you will be able to take advantage of the innovations of Resident Evil Zero, which basically concern the management of the characters. Unlike the other episodes of the series (apart from a short experiment with Resident Evil Code: Veronica), in fact, this prequel does not allow you to choose whether to play as Billy or Rebecca, but lets you control both at the same time. How does all this work? Let's see it in detail... Capcom satisfies those who have always wondered about the origin of the Virus T, with an outstanding prequel Who goes ahead? Character control hasn't changed one iota. The left analog stick of the GameCube pad is used to move our alter ego, referring to himself and not to the screen. The back keys are used to aim the equipped weapon and to change targets, while A allows us to fire/hit or check the scenario for objects. By holding down the B key we will be able to run, while using it in combination with the analog stick (back) allows us to turn around quickly. Finally, the Y key lets us enter the classic inventory, while the X key is responsible for changing the character. In fact, the pressure of the button is enough to alternate control of Rebecca and Billy. When you control one of the two, it is possible to issue orders to the other: make sure that he follows us or that he remains where he is (option that can be activated quickly, thanks to the Start button), and that he attacks with us or stays away from the fights. The novelties of REZero also concern the management of objects. If previously you depended on the ~crates~ scattered throughout the settings, even if only to be able to make some space in the inventory, in this case it is possible to drop the objects wherever you want (they will then be indicated on the map, which can be consulted by pressing the Z) and even swap them with your partner. The game itself will force you to exploit this multiple times, forcibly splitting the two characters and requiring you to search for items separately. These new possibilities pave the way for a much more strategic approach than in the past, also and above all encouraged by the difficulty of the game: if at the beginning it will be relatively simple to find the usual healing plants and ammunition, later on you will have big problemsthis sense. Therefore, it is better to limit the intake of medical kits to cases of extreme need, and above all not to waste bullets... However, this also gives rise to potential problems of a certain size, which the Capcom developers could have avoided. The influence that our every move has on the continuation of the story is far too marked, and in the management of objects this translates into the possibility of finding yourself in the intermediate and final stages of the game without weapons and without energy. At that point, the only choice is to start over... Graphics and sound Already from the long animated introduction, which shows Rebecca's finding the train, we understand what Resident Evil Zero is made of. It's a damn atmospheric game, an atmosphere that is anything but ~quiet~ and built through countless elements. Apart from the elegant direction, which we can admire both in the many interlude sequences and in the management of the shots (some of which are truly brilliant), the new Capcom product boasts a superior graphic realization to the already excellent remake of the first RE. The characters have been designed with an obsessive attention to detail, and the number of polygons that compose them is incredibly high. We also find the same cure for zombies, as well as for the various creatures we will face. In this regard, it is a pity that the developers have chosen the path of ~giant insects~, which obviously do not inspire who knows what fear in the players, despite being rather difficult opponents to eliminate. If we want to find a fault in the technical aspect of Resident Evil Zero, the first thing we think of is the lack of polygonal environments, already successfully implemented in Code: Veronica. A precise choice, perhaps waiting to make the ~bang~ with the fourth chapter of the saga? No one can tell. The fact is that the developers have all the same been able to equip this ~weak point~ with interesting features: animated objects, shadow projection and scrolling of the view in some locations. The sound sector proves to be up to the task more than ever, and contributes not a little to the atmosphere I was talking about earlier. The simple silence, the sound of footsteps, the moans and the music, deliberately rare but impactful when needed, manage to immerse the player in a disturbing world, transforming the gaming experience into something truly unique and exciting. The voices of the characters, as usual in English, manage not to spoil everything, with well-acted dialogue. On the other hand, the quality of the localization in Italian is poor, which is limited to subtitles afflicted by more than one error: a truly unforgivable lack given the high quality of the product.", "date": "2003-03-18", "grade": "8.0"}
