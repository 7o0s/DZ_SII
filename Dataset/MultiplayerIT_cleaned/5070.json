And so the series that began with the drawings of Kazuki Takahashi and supported by Konami playful productions has reached its twentieth anniversary, deciding for the occasion to land in the rich mobile landscape, where a collectible card game always has an excellent chance of playing well own ~cards~, in every sense. Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links was released in Japan to great acclaim, and reaches the West with lots of localizations in different languages, including a complete translation into Italian which makes it particularly interesting for users of all ages even in these parts. It is a free-to-play, as is often the case with games of this type, but the large rewards that are obtained by playing remove the specter of buying in-game currency through the classic micro-transactions, requiring only a little bit of commitment to a decidedly fair contract with the player, at least for a rather long first phase. The biggest problem within such a game is being able to welcome new users into an already so strongly structured and rules-based universe that one takes for granted, among longtime users. On this front Konami has done a great job of adaptation, making the approach to Yu-Gi-Oh! simpler welcoming even for newbies, a very smart move considering the large pool of new users that a trading card game of this type can draw on in the mobile sector. For the rest, beyond a somewhat schematic interface, this chapter fully falls within the spirit of Yu-Gi-Oh!, with excellent reproductions of characters and creatures and a very accurate representation of the game elements both in terms of drawings in 2D than the three-dimensional elements.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links is specifically designed to welcome newbies inside and the structure of the card game appears considerably simplified and streamlined compared to the original, with the reduction of playable cards in combat, a lowering of the life points of the fighters, the decrease of the cards in the deck and the removal of some game phases, such as the one after the battle. All this has the dual function of simplifying the introduction of new players into the gameplay mechanics and significantly raising the pace of the game by reducing the time it takes for battles to take place, which is essential in the mobile context. For experts, this reorganization may seem like an impoverishment of the typical structure, but there is still plenty of room to delve into the various nuances of this trading card game. Beyond the complex and engaging dynamics of the card clash, the backbone is obviously collecting, and on this front there is truly ample room for enthusiasts: the rewards are quite generous but the construction of a deck really competition can lead to the temptation to buy the missing elements and the pay to win is revealed when the requests start to become expensive. The presence of a double progression line, one for the character through duels and one linked to the account which is based on the achievement of various objectives, tends to complicate the situation a bit but also represents a good way to keep the game alive. interest and create diversions to the normal course of battles.", "date": "2017-02-01", "grade": "8.3"}
