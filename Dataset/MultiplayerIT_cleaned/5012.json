Yet amidst this bustling chaos of creativity, it's often nice to rediscover the simpler, more laid-back setting of older mobile games from its origins, as we see in this Stitch review. The title of Lykke Studios is a puzzle with an apparently basic structure, but which nevertheless hides a well thought-out mechanism, which is inspired by a quiet and romantic activity such as embroidery, reproduced in a very particular way through various drawings to be composed with increasing difficulty. It is fundamentally an exercise in mathematics and geometry, which has little to do with manual skills, but is nonetheless capable of giving a satisfaction close to that which one might experience by completing a complex embroidered design, seeing the fabric and the stitching compose under the fingers. This is also a game that makes us appreciate Apple Arcade and its catalog, which among the many ups and downs often manages to offer experiences perfectly tailored for mobile use. These are the non-trivial result of a truly curated collection of productions that look to an effective quality of gaming experiences, without ever disregarding a certain eye for style. Gameplay between math, geometry and embroidery Stitch is all about discovering hidden designs based on numerical clues The gameplay is very simple: in Stitch. (the dot is part of the title) we have to discover the drawing that is hidden under various quantities of squares with single movements of the finger, following the numerical indications that are found above the covered grid. This is the classic case in which the game is much easier to try than to explain, which is easily experienced in first person by starting the well done tutorial, which makes it clear how everything works in a few practical steps. Each level is composed of an embroidered design, covered by a more or less complex network of squares arranged in various ways. Numbers are visible on some of these boxes, which indicate the quantity of boxes to be discovered in one fell swoop, through a single movement of the finger, to be performed including the same box with the number. The game therefore becomes a sort of puzzle geometric joints, in which we have to understand the exact position of the various portions of the drawing to be discovered from time to time, calculating the spaces based on the visible numerical clues. In a certain sense, it is a mixture between Tetris and Picross, so to speak, which starts in an extremely simple way but manages to reach an unsuspected level of difficulty in the more advanced figures. One of the complete embroideries in Stitch. What remains constant, beyond the progression of the challenge, however, is the relaxed atmosphere that exudes from Stitch, with its staid pace and the sense of satisfaction that comes from bringing out the fabric design hidden under the squares. There are also various game modes that offer slight variations on the theme such as ~marathon~, ~free stitching~, ~puzzle~, which can introduce small digressions, as well as the division of levels by subject represented, but the mechanics remain the same and it always remains surprisingly pleasant despite its simplicity. Stitch's graphics contribute perfectly to the creation of its particular atmosphere, with drawings that are always very pleasant and a very convincing representation of the fabrics, which accurately reflects the appearance of the seams and textures with which the various embroideries are constructed. The response to tactile controls is also reactive and precise, although it perhaps requires somewhat large screens to be fully appreciated (despite the zooms that the game makes to frame the individual parts of the drawing to be discovered). The soundtrack, on the other hand, is not very convincing: the melody on the piano is initially relaxing but too monotonous, so much so that it pushes you to turn off the volume after a few minutes of play.", "date": "2022-11-06", "grade": "8.0"}
