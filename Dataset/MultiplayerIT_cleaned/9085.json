Son of Aeolus and Enareta, he dared to challenge the gods more than once. Upon death, which affects all living beings, Zeus condemned him to push a boulder along the ridge of a mountain for the rest of eternity. Now, this story of the stone can go well for a couple of millennia, also because it gives satisfaction to become the protagonist of a proverb, but then the day comes when one watches it roll for the umpteenth time at the foot of the mountain and begins to wonder if there is no escape from so much suffering. Sisyphus, whose cunning must have been enormously overestimated by the gods, given the time it took him to elaborate a plan (or else the gods are idiots, there's little to argue about), after the umpteenth harassment suffered by the thugs of Hades understands that he can use the boulder to break down the gates of hell and get out into the open air. From here begins Rock of Ages, with the player called to use the boulder of the mythological hero to open a rift between the world of the living and the dead. As? Causing him to slam violently against the doors of Hades. Back in the vast world, the son of the god of the wind begins to challenge historical and mythological characters to accumulate wealth and live in comfort that was denied him by the gods. On his way he will meet bad guys like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo's David, a giant putto, Pope Julius II, the Sun King and so on. How to defeat them? Obviously crushing them with the trusty boulder. Obviously, between saying and doing there is something in between... ...the gameplay Rock of Ages is a conceptually very simple title, in which you have to roll a boulder along different paths, to break through the gate of a fortress where the enemy is holed up. Obviously a single shot will not be enough to make it and the opponent will not stand by and watch. Thus, epic challenges will arise between the player and the CPU (or another player), in which whoever manages to crush his rival first will win. The paths are all quite intricate and, above all, will be littered with traps and destructible objects. The traps are of various types and range from those inherent to the scenario (chasms, mythological monsters, giant cannons and so on) to those that can be placed between turns. But let's explain better. Practically the game is divided into two distinct phases: the first preparatory, with the boulder being carved and the contender deciding how to spend the accumulated credits by destroying the buildings along the way or by placing worker units (not immediately available); the second of real action, in which you control the boulder. Credits can be invested in various trinkets belonging to two macro-categories: traps (catapults, cows, barrage towers, fans and so on), which as you pass the levels are enriched with ever more powerful pieces; or the upgrades of the boulder (a coating of fire, a kind of armour, wings that allow you to make a double leap and tar that allows you to corrupt the areas that can be built by the enemy), more or less useful depending on the conformation of the path. David's parcel The main danger is wasting time, for the reason that should be clear to you if you read the previous paragraphs. An additional risk is to see the boulder, made up of different layers of rock, destroyed. At the bottom left is the bar showing its status. If it is emptied, you have to start over with a relative loss of time (which usually completely compromises the game). In reality, complete destruction is a very rare eventuality, but a boulder in bad condition is still a disaster because it is not able to cause major damage to the door, forcing you to work harder with the next throw or having to throw an extra boulder to make it (another deleterious eventuality that can give victory to the rival). Every number of levels you have to face a boss, for a total of four. The bosses aren't fought in the normal way, but they all require a special approach. For example, the first, a large dragon, is hit on the big plaster attached to his chest, while the second, the aforementioned David by Michelangelo, is hit on the... ahem... package (yes, right there). In addition to the levels that make up the story mode, there are several extras to consider in the overall longevity calculation. For example, three keys are hidden on each path, which are used to open advanced levels and unlock some bonuses in the main menu. Some are positioned so as to be easy to catch, while others are well hidden or placed in such a way as to force the player to do real stunts to reach them. Understand for yourself that whoever wants to collectall, he would have to spend several hours replaying the levels. Another extra is the racing mode, which basically requires you to run through the levels as fast as possible to get one of the three medals (bronze, silver and gold, of course). Do not miss the online mode more fun, which compares with another human player. Renaissance-Baroque Visually Rock of Ages is outstanding. No, it's not a matter of texture size or general detail. Indeed, from that point of view it is rather average. Giving it an extra boost is the creativity demonstrated by the developers in taking some of the most famous works of Western painting and transforming them into pieces of the scenery and to give life to some characters. For example, the final boss is taken by weight from a painting by Goya, while the protagonist was extracted from a Greek vase. The winning idea was to transform the protagonists of history and mythology into actors of comic skits, building levels around them characterized by recognizable architectural pieces, always drawn from European culture. What can we say in front of a Leonardo da Vinci who speaks like the architect of the second Matrix surrounded by an infinite number of reproductions of the Mona Lisa? And of characters to crush to accumulate credits cut from Botticelli's paintings? Obviously the fun of being immersed in a magical and surreal world, which reserves surprises at every turn, allows you to overlook some little problems that you end up not paying attention to anymore. The sense of wonder is increased by the excellent soundtrack, made up of masterfully played classic songs and amusing little voices. Also noteworthy is the excellent Italian translation, accurate and highly sought after in terms, which adds an extra touch to the game and does not make you regret the English version. Indeed, perhaps when you hear Leonardo speak, you will agree with us that it is the English speakers, in this case, who are missing out on something. The defects that must necessarily be noted are the relative ease of the game and the brevity of the story mode, which by going straight keys takes four to five hours. It is also true that it would be a crime not to try the other modes and, above all, not to dedicate a few hours to multiplayer. It should also be considered that the game is sold for  7.99 and that, after all, it lasts like many triple A titles that cost seven or eight times as much.", "date": "2011-09-19", "grade": "8.2"}
