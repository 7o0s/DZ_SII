We have numerous examples, also and above all on the eShop, of games created for a digital delivery service that are decidedly superior, for fun and creation, to various titles designed for the traditional retail market. Rather, and this is even more true for a portable console, one can reasonably expect that an exclusively DD product is less rich in content and various features, and it is no coincidence that there are many developers who get around this obstacle by equipping their productions of a higher-than-normal difficulty, or paying special attention to replay value, and so on. Shin'en, the German developer known to Nintendo fans for several years now above all for the technical aspect of his games, always at the maximum allowed by the specific hardware, however he doesn't fit: in 2011 he came out, on cartridge and only in North America, Nano Assault, spiritual sequel to the 2 impressive Nanostrays for DS, of which this Nano Assault EX is the ~enhanced~ version, with more modes and better controls (there is also compatibility with the Circle Pad Pro), and, lo and behold, available only and exclusively on eShop. The frontiers of medicine In a futuristic/sci-fi setting, the first screens of Nano Assault EX closely quote the very first scenes of Star Wars, but it is only a misdirection because, as anyone who knows the two Nanostrays well knows, the closest film reference is without a doubt another Hallucinatory Voyage, in which a miniaturized spaceship entered a human body to eliminate an embolism. In this case it is the fearsome ~Nano~ virus that threatens the very survival of mankind, and thanks to the technology of the future there is nothing better for scientists than to enter various infected cells to collect as much information as possible about the agent. pathogen (represented by segments of DNA) in order to synthesize a cure. The problem is that the virus will defend itself from any attack through a whole series of various creatures and abominations that just don't want to abandon cells that have now become their private playground, and the heavy armament of the miniature spacecraft is justified, and the 'plant shoot'em up altogether. A very varied shooter system, dividing the levels substantially into three different cases: missions ~on the ground~, or rather on the surface of the cell, missions with a view from behind the Star Fox and the classic boss fights. Let's analyze them in more detail: the first type of missions, the ones that see us engaged on the surface of the infected body, basically looks like a classic Geometry Wars twin stick shooter, with the ship capable of shooting in four different directions. It is here that Shin'en's desire to introduce the support for the Circle Pad Pro, inevitably absent in the first edition, was born, but it must be said that even without the crouch, the control - the direction of the shot is entrusted to all face keys - it's surprisingly smooth. The enemies, who must all be eliminated, are divided into various types, from those that are not very dangerous to intelligent creatures that chase you by subjecting you to bursts of bullets. Then there are the ~on rail~ sections with a view from behind: graphically incredible and even more majestic with the 3D effect activated (but we'll address the technical issue, probably the greatest asset of Nano Assault EX in due time), however they are perhaps the weakest in terms of gameplay. Dedicating yourself to eliminating enemies, also in this case many and very varied, is almost counterproductive, as the best tactic is certainly to avoid them and their bullets; these are also the sections, paradoxically, where the Circle Pad Pro is more useful, allowing you to control the viewfinder independently of the spacecraft, and greatly increases playability and enjoyment. Finally, the clashes with the bosses: mammoth, monstrous and menacing, they are more reminiscent of the bosses of an adventure (Metroid Prime, for example, comes to mind) than the classic ones of a shooter, as each of them requires a precise strategy to be defeated, combining reflexes and eye-hand coordination with a considerable dose of strategic thinking, and on balance they are the most pleasant sections of a game whose gameplay, despite being very varied, always remains at high levels, adrenaline and reasoned at the same time. The 3D effect Truly calibrated to perfection, the 3D effect adds another dimension to the already impressive graphics, making them even more enjoyable. With stereoscopy turned on, the cells spin spectacularly in the ground levels, glielements meet you with absolute naturalness in those on rails, and the bosses stand out in all their majesty, danger and sick design; all at the small price of a slightly more pronounced aliasing and a fluidity that doesn't decrease, but can occasionally suffer a few hits. To be activated absolutely to enjoy the full experience. The unbearable power of the 3DS The Story Mode missions are 32 in all, to be played even individually in the Arcade Mode, none of which are very long, but whose difficulty gradually increases in a decidedly pleasant and apt way (subject to a couple of falls every now and then), allowing you to familiarize yourself perfectly with the various game concepts before facing the fiery inferno of the last stages. Once the main mode is finished, a whole series of alternatives are unlocked, some already present in Nano Assault such as the Boss Rush in which the bosses are faced one after the other with lots of online rankings, other new ones, such as the difficult Survivor Mode which offers you only one life and the Nano Shop where you can buy, using the coins collected in the Arcade, the 3D models of spaceships and enemies to rotate and zoom at will and the songs from the beautiful soundtrack. In short, a quantity of content of all respect and for all tastes, and for perfectionists longevity will increase considerably. Beyond playability and longevity, what immediately catches the eye of Nano Assault EX, however, is the incredible graphic component, and in general the whole aesthetic department, including music and presentation. At first glance it seems to be neither more nor less in front of a game for the current generation of consoles, the graphics are so rich, detailed, clean and fluid: lots of elements on the screen, very high quality textures, various effects ... Everything contributes to create a show that at first seems unreal to be able to arrive from the small 3DS, especially later with the help of 3D; sure, if you go to analyze well you can see the ~tricks~ used by the very talented Germans, such as the two-dimensional backdrops, the light effects that cover some textures that are not exactly perfect, or the number of polygons of spaceships and opponents that it's as tall as it sounds, aided by the small screen size. And yet the ability to create such a show by meeting and indeed pandering to the limits and strengths of the hardware can certainly be considered a success on the part of the development team; after all, care, attention and intelligence transpire from all the aesthetics in general, which counts, for example, on elegant and modern animated and static screens, well-acted speech, very atmospheric music and, for once on the eShop, also numerous.", "date": "2013-03-14", "grade": "8.7"}
