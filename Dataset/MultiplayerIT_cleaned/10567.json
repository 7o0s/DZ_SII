In the first place, psychology has chosen the name of the Roman emperor Caligula to describe the syndrome in question: it is (obviously we are simplifying a bit) the desire to experience extreme situations, to break taboos and most of the rules imposed by society to individuals. The characters of the first and second chapter of the series, in fact, find themselves in the alternative world following the experience of one or more traumas; moreover, life itself in the virtual elsewhere is, on balance, a limit experience, normally impossible and transgressive with respect to normality. But there is also another aspect curiously on the subject and possible only in our language. The ~caligo~ is a fog that rises from the sea. According to popular tradition, the spirits who rush to kidnap the souls of the departed, still stuck between earthly and afterlife, manifest themselves with this mist. Which is the same condition of suspension of the protagonists of The Caligula Effect 2, whether it is the protagonist or the members of the rediscovered Go-Home Club. Apart from these curiosities that you might find interesting for a full understanding of the work, The Caligula Effect 2 is officially the second chapter of the franchise launched on PlayStation Vita in 2016. The positive feedback from the first The Caligula Effect, which also landed on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2019, justified the development of a substantially very conservative sequel, in which returned to collaborate, among others, Tadashi Satomi (expert in the world of Persona) and Takuya Yamanaka in the role of director. Plot: In the alternate world The Caligula Effect 2, Regret is the creator of the virtual world The plot of The Caligula Effect 2 plays it safe by proposing largely derivative situations, characters and atmospheres, perfectly relevant to the first chapter of the saga. You may rightly wonder if it is possible to start directly from the sequel, ignoring the existence of the first The Caligula Effect at the same time. The answer is the following: in theory yes, it is possible to do it, also because various characters (without anticipating too many revelations) will directly refer to the previous events. However, given that, in fact, the plot picks up right where it ended in the first chapter, it would be advisable to have first concluded the original episode, and then move on to The Caligula Effect 2, so as to better grasp all the references. However, it is not so obvious that after 40 hours you are willing to face as many in the sequel: think carefully about the most appropriate option. Amazon offer The Caligula Effect 2 - Playstation 4 49.99 See Offer In itself, however, the narrative context of the title proves to be more than valid. We find ourselves in Redo, a virtual simulation in which various individuals from the real world have been trapped. Basically, either thanks to technology or due to some unforeseen mistakes that have led to its excessive mass application, people have been ~subtracted~ from their existence and transported to another fictitious world. Fictitious in every sense: the simulation proposes a banal cycle of typically Japanese school life, with an eternal repetition of the same moments, the same actions, the same interpersonal relationships. Moreover, those present do not remember their previous life: they believe that this is their real world. For some it is a dream; for others (the few who know the truth) a nightmare. Ruling over Redo is Regret, a virtual doll who welcomes and places newcomers in the right place. Until the protagonist arrives who, just like a good self-respecting protagonist, turns out to be special: in fact he realizes that this is nothing more than a simulation. As a result, the narration soon becomes more complicated: an external being also arrives in Redo, X, another virtual doll intent on bringing Regret's creation to collapse. X allies himself with the protagonist, the two gradually find new allies from the Go-Home Club group (against the simulation) and all together they try to dismantle the whole shack. Don't expect great revelations or who knows what intrigues, but everything is still pleasant; perhaps even less obvious for those who have not played the first chapter of the series, in fact, because it is really easy to guess who the bad guy is and what his intentions are. We just want to point out that, apart from the good characterization of X, Regret and a few other supporting characters, the other members of the party and soabove all generic enemies and NPCs are immersed in the most complete banality and predictability. Playstation 4 trophies The Caligula Effect 2 offers a rich list of trophies, including the Platinum Trophy. To get them all you will have to complete the eight main chapters of the story, then all the side missions of the various protagonists, win over 200 battles, dedicate yourself to collectibles and much more. After all it is a J-RPG, what did you expect? Nothing too complex, but certainly a long and potentially tedious operation. Gameplay: exploration and combat The offer of The Caligula Effect 2 linked to the gameplay is also very conservative. Except for partial changes, the J-RPG-style turn-based combat system has remained almost the same. The player enters battle against any enemy encountered along their path and from there on must choose the next actions, organized into four categories: Catharsis Effect, Support, Action and Items. Basically it's a bit of the usual ~attack, defend, perform particular action, or use an item in inventory~ strategy, nothing to tear your hair out about. But everything works, thanks to the existence of a chain of actions (which is called its Imaginary chain system) which allows us to predict how our shots will hit and how the enemies present will react. Every single action you have in mind has a cost in MP, whose indicator will always be present on the screen during combat. Through the predictive chain, before executing each action, the player is encouraged to calculate and recalculate the effectiveness of his moves: in fact, a minimal error would be enough to facilitate the enemy counterattack and, potentially, the interruption of the offensive. In truth, all this is more useful in boss fights than for those with common enemies, usually all the same and equally weak; the difficulty level in ~normal~ mode in The Caligula Effect 2 is non-existent, so we encourage you, if you are looking for a healthy challenge, to opt directly for the higher ones (~difficult~ or even ~extreme~). What has been said so far is valid both in the case that you use only the protagonist in combat (i.e. your alter ego, mute and slightly customizable) and in a real party, with various members of the Go-Home Club to the rescue, who will be unlocked and recruit yourself calmly, continuing in the main storyline. Exploration and technical sector Apart from that of the protagonists, the character design of The Caligula Effect 2 leaves something to be desired Apart from the storyline and the fights against sometimes all too improbable enemies, the rest of The Caligula Effect 2's offer consists in exploring the environments of its virtual world. In itself it would work well, were it not for the banality of the proposed environments (a railway station? A school? Wow), and for their extreme linearity. Getting lost is practically impossible and the objects of interest on the screen are basically indicated with real reflectors, so that it is impossible to lose them along the way. Having everything at once and so easily does not translate into a fulfilling experience at all. Interacting with the secondary characters and their stories helps quite a bit. The technical sector is also just discreet and certainly not memorable, essentially stopped at the first experiences of the genre on old gen. It's okay that J-RPGs usually don't focus on graphic detail, frame rate, resolution and objects on the screen, but here we're really talking about bare, empty, bare-bones environments, where the only thing vaguely different and in a certain recognizable way are the faces of the protagonists and the antagonists; all other NPCs and locations are identical. On the one hand, this enhances characters like X, Regret and the protagonist himself, on the other it belittles and demeans everything else.", "date": "2021-10-15", "grade": "6.8"}
