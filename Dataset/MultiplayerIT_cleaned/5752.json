With this simple hint, the narrative component of the Lucky Kat Studios title begins and ends, which does not need any plot to support its playful structure: in fact, we are talking about an action game that starts from premises already explored by various other mobile products, giving the whole his own personal interpretation. Let's go see what it is. Sky Chasers tackles a theme already seen with personality and good technical means Make your own rockets Sky Chasers is part of that specific category of titles in which you have to control a propulsion vehicle by tapping on the sides of the screen to dose the thrust of the rockets, with the aim of moving forward as much as possible while avoiding crashing into walls and obstacles various genre. Nothing particularly new or original under the sun in terms of concept, but with some distinctive features sufficient to pique the interest of those who have already extensively tried similar experiences. To begin with, Sky Chasers is not an endless runner nor does it rely on randomly generated scenarios, but prefers to do things the old-fashioned way by offering three worlds (destined to increase with future updates) specifically designed to challenge the player. A detail not to be overlooked, given that it contains what is perhaps the best part of the product, namely its pleasant adventure nuance: one must not only be careful to survive, but one must also commit oneself to passing the simple but stimulating tests devised by the developers, whether these involve picking up a key to open a passage or overcoming a series of rhythmically closing presses. All with the constant nagging of the fuel that is voraciously consumed by the spacecraft of the protagonist at every solicitation of the rockets, an element that forces the propulsion to be dosed carefully: fortunately there is the support of a control system as basic as it is precise and effective, which replicates without too many compliments the scheme already successfully proposed by numerous other titles. Even the mechanism behind the checkpoints is not new, with the platforms distributed at more or less regular intervals along the way that allow you to save progress and fill the tank of the spacecraft, obviously at a price: you can decide to pay with the coins collected in the game or to watch an advertising film, unless you want to reach into your real wallet and shell out the 2.99 required to be able to use the checkpoints unlimitedly. The system works in an absolutely honest way, allowing those who want to play for free with some extra hassle and instead providing the right reward to the buyers of the premium package. Whatever the choice in this area, the fact remains that Sky Chasers is undoubtedly not among the longest-running titles currently available in the mobile sector, with the three basic worlds that are finished quickly enough and without too many headaches: since there are not even large stimuli to retrace one's steps, the game proves to be very short even for the not exciting average of free to play. Having said that, it is still quality time spent with a product that is not very original but well done from all points of view, not least the audiovisual one: while exploiting the much abused theme of pixel art inspired by the 16-bit era, the work by Lucky Kat Studios denotes a genuine style and a good variety of scenarios, enemies, obstacles and ships. The sound is in the same line, with effects that seem to come directly from a platformer from the early 90s and chiptune music that manages to be captivating without boring.", "date": "2016-01-26", "grade": "7.7"}
