{"name": "Just Dance 2019", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/just-dance-2019-recensione.html", "text": "There are series that try to renew themselves year after year, and others that don't need it: their game formula is so immediate and functional that the slightest tweak could even ruin the gameplay and disappoint the public's expectations. In this second case, the Just Dance franchise is fully included, or at least Ubisoft allows it to be abundantly included: every 365 days exactly a new title from the series arrives in stores for almost all existing platforms, mixes the ingredients a bit to look different and continues have been offering variations upon variations of the same main course for more than nine years. But as long as the players continue to like the recipe and it proves to be valid, why on earth should the developers distort the gaming experience? Just Dance 2019 proves once again that it knows how to satisfy everyone a little, changing very little what we have already seen in Just Dance 2018: we tell you about it in our review. Gameplay: good old Just Dance 2019 Just start Just Dance 2019 on your game console (it's available everywhere, even on Nintendo Wii U) to realize that it's ~still~ him, the good old Just Dance. Yes, because even if it has just been published, there are very few new and original elements compared to Just Dance 2018, 2017, 2016 and back in time. Immediacy is fundamental in what has been the living room party game for the whole family for nine years now, capable of making friends, mothers, grandparents and children get up from their seats without distinction, all ready to challenge a controller (or their own smartphone ) and start dancing like there's no tomorrow. This is the magic of Just Dance 2019, the red thread that ties it to the past and that will continue to tie it to the next titles arriving in the future which, we bet, will proceed to consolidate the gameplay formula without ever really refreshing it for a while longer . Because after all, what can ever be innovated in a game system that pushes the player to dance, dance and dance, imitating the movements shown on the home television? The movement detection sensors in Just Dance 2019 seemed more precise and accurate than the 2018 version, and we found ourselves punished in some cases for a wrist gesture or a positioning of the upper limbs that did not perfectly coincide with what was shown by the funny mannequins at screen while the musical performance is playing. It was no coincidence, because the same also occurred in subsequent choreographies: probably the calibration based on the motion control of Nintendo Switch is really the most reliable currently on the market, and the gaming experience on the Nintendo platform in TV Mode remains one of the best methods to enjoy Ubisoft's music title. Especially considering that it is possible to take it with you on vacation, and wanting to use the console even in tabletop mode; even if here, especially for the four-player choreographies, following the directions becomes really more complicated. The purpose of Just Dance 2019, like that of its predecessors, and always wanting to admit that the Ubisoft party game has a purpose, is to perform as precisely as possible what is shown on the screen by the professional dancers, all naturally to the rhythm of music . From time to time the screen indicator will show us how well we are doing through a few words of encouragement that alternate Ok, Good, Super, Perfect and for the less good a very sad X, to indicate that while the dancer was asking us to perform A we, on the other hand, will have achieved something between X and Z. After all, don't the best satisfactions of Just Dance 2019 come in showing one's skill to everyone present, to the sound of bright stars at the end of the song? Contents: tracks and game modes Does Just Dance 2019 really need a new edition every year, especially considering the existence of Ubisoft's Just Dance Unlimited subscription service? The latter offers various monthly and annual packages, offering access to hundreds and hundreds of streaming songs, old and new, immediately usable within Just Dance 2019. It would not simply be possible to ~update~ your version of the game year year after year with new songs, instead of selling a ~new~ product at full price? A mystery that will remain so; in any case, Just Dance 2019 offers the player 40 unreleased songs for the series, among which we mention at least the most important, such as Finesse by Bruno Mars, Bum Bum Tam Tam by Mc Fioti, Bang Bang Bang by BIGBANG, Mad Love by Sean Paul , OMG by Arash Ft. Snoop Dogg and so many more. One month of Just Dance Unlimited can be activated for freefrom your own version of the game, so that you will certainly have fun for at least thirty days; then eventually it will be possible to evaluate the renewal, given that the catalog is updated more or less constantly. Of Just Dance 2019, however, it is important to underline above all the new game menu: that of Just Dance 2018 has been completely revised and now made more streamlined, intuitive, fresh and functional. It is one of the aspects of Ubisoft's annual production that we were really pleasantly surprised with this year: few sections, all of which can be immediately recalled from a practical lineup on the left side of the screen. There is the World Dance Floor, from which we will be able to access choreographies where the other online players will also be present in real time, to then view our performance within a convenient ranking; there is the new section dedicated to playlists, where we can group our favorite songs; there is the actual list of songs, many of which will be unlocked simply by dancing, dancing and still dancing; and again, a last entry dedicated to our profile, where we will be able to customize avatars, background, view postcards and collectibles unlocked by spending Mojo points, and a few other little gems. There is also the Just Dance Kids 2019 designed exclusively for the little ones: you will be asked to access it right after the start of the title, clearer and more precise than this you die and the organization of the new edition is the best of the titles of the last years. On Nintendo Switch, this must also be said, Just Dance 2019 has one more negative element but also other aces up its sleeve that can compensate. The ~bad luck~ of the players is that four Joy-Cons will be needed to play in four: there is no support for the smartphone app to use the latter as a controller. However, the use of the Joy-Con gives the Ubisoft title a couple of extra gears: first of all the HD Rumble, which renders the rhythm of the music and the movement of the steps through tactile feedback with simply excellent accuracy. Then, the Double Rumble Choreographies already present in Just Dance 2018 return (at least the latter have been updated): these are original and fun ballets in which two Joy-Cons will be used simultaneously to mimic the movements of the protagonists in a very faithful way.", "date": "2018-10-29", "grade": "7.5"}
