Scattered around the backdrops of the Dark Sector, you can collect rubles to spend on the clandestine stalls of the black market, reachable through manhole covers stamped with the lotus flower, symbol of the game. Here it is possible to buy the main weapons that match the Glaive, the blade of our hero, and it is possible to apply weapon upgrades, to be collected in the furthest corners of the levels. The whole thing is a bit grotesque, but it works, just as the merchant worked in Resident Evil 4, from which the team was clearly inspired by both hands. Son of a greater God The protagonist of the game is a soldier, Hayden, sent to a region of Russia to try to stop a scientist about to spread a virus around the world capable of genetically mutating human beings to make them uncontrollable monsters. Between twists and cut scenes with a sure visual impact, we arrive at the end of a story that is narrated in a rather superficial way and with several ~gaps~ which, in addition to leaving the player with a few too many questions, do not help in identification , so much so that the ending comes without a bond with the characters worthy of a title with this potential having been created. From the point of view of gameplay, things are much better and Dark Sector, without proposing anything original, manages to skillfully mix elements taken from different games: the shot of Resident Evil 4,  behind the protagonist, and the mechanics of Gears of War, complete with running, interaction button with the backdrop and melee shots (which are, however, the weakest part of the whole game). The distinctive element is the rotating blade generated by the protagonist's arm, which can be launched to decapitate and mow down opponents and which, as the stages go by, is enhanced with some, to say the least, exciting capabilities. So much so that it becomes a real remote-controlled projectile, which can be steered thanks to a camera that closely follows it as it flies across the seabed, with the action slowed down like a bullet time, enhancing the impact of the blades with the flesh of the soldiers and monsters that appear in the path of the protagonist. In Dark Sector, the expedient of the blade has allowed the developers to insert even slight hints of environmental puzzles, given that, by throwing it on elements such as ice, fire and electricity, it takes on their characteristics, freezing, burning or charging himself with current, allowing him to increase the damage inflicted on enemies and to activate switches or sources of gas that operate doors or gates that block the way. Some of these puzzles are quite fun and serve to mitigate the repetitiveness of the action which basically boils down to a linear progress through rather narrow environments, shooting and throwing the blade at anything that moves on the screen, up to the end-of-level bosses , gigantic creatures or military vehicles that for the most part have to be shot down with bazookas. The blade, however it is useless to deny it, gives immense satisfaction from the beginning to the end of the game. Especially when you hear the screams of the soldiers who fall to the ground, mutilated in the legs and arms, with a show certainly not suitable for the little ones. Even more in hand-to-hand combat with the fatalities with which you can sever the opponents' limbs cleanly! Even the weapons have been inserted properly with the right balance, and, if you don't find yourself using them often in the dozen hours necessary to complete the Dark Sector, it is only for the pleasure that the Glaive gives. The multiplayer Dark Sector also has a multiplayer component, rather questionable though. Two modes: in one there are soldiers, those in full nuclear power and gas mask, who chase a player in the role of Hayden who can become invisible and has the glaive at his disposal. Whoever kills Hayden wins the round and becomes one in turn in the next game. In the other mode, there are two teams made up of soldiers in overalls and one Hayden per team, in a kind of VIP mode that ends when one team kills the leader of the other. The judgment is not very positive, because, apart from the small number of modes and maps (there are only five) and the few people who play on the servers, the roles are not well balanced, given that playing Hayden is much more satisfying than the simple soldier. However, getting in tune with the multiplayer mechanics and trying to have fun in some way, there are still big lag problems that make collisions and movements somewhat inaccurate, as well as the player who plays Hayden virtually immortal to the blows of the poor soldiers armed with simple weapons. The multiplayer Watch out for the cunicusthe! Digital Extremes have done a really good job, that's for sure. The engine created to move Dark Sector closely resembles the Unreal Engine 3 and the results are comparable to those obtained by Epic with Gears of War, with due proportions of course. In some situations, one certainly thinks that Dark Sector is one of the most valid products released for the Next Gen. Then, unfortunately, the limits of a team that did not have unlimited funds available during development emerge, so the environments struggle to differ from each other without memorable settings, some textures are clearly repeated (as well as in low resolution) and the interactive objects and enemies to face can really be counted on the tips of the fingers. The end result, however, is certainly impactful, especially during the clashes with some bosses who literally tear the seabed to pieces, throwing rock debris everywhere, or even during the phases in which you play with the elements, when ice, fire and electric current give life to plays of light and reflections that never fail to amaze. The frame rate is always stable, the animations are discreet and only in the ~fatalities~ do they lose a bit of shots, as if the director of the action did not have in mind what to frame, generating a few moments of confusion, never able to compromise the good feeling that accompanies the whole gaming experience. The sound effects are also discreet, especially the cries of the monsters and the cries of the soldiers, as well as the music which is, however, really reduced to a flicker. Comment Dark Sector may not be an original game, but it's a lot of fun and it's also long-lived, since it takes more than ten hours to complete, despite the action shooters of recent months that can't last more than a breath. To get to that point, however, Digital Extreme have cut short on the variety of locations, enemies and on the narration of a story that is difficult to get passionate about. The protagonist, his powers and above all the blade with which he slices the monstrosities he meets are an irresistible mix that keeps you glued all the time. Dark Sector, if you don't expect revolutions and you like the genre, will give you excellent satisfaction, leaving you with the feeling of having played a fun title, which you can wait for in the next few years. There is online multiplayer, but it should be forgotten. Pros The Evolution Engine The Glaive The longevity Cons Lack of variety in the settings The narration of the story The multiplayer Xbox 360 - Goals Finishing Dark Sector, at the standard difficulty level and achieving the most immediate objectives, leads to obtaining between 500 and 600 of the 1000 points available. For the others, you have to find all the weapon upgrades and, above all, finish it on the difficulty level that is unlocked once you finish the game. For online achievements, patience will be needed due to netcode issues and the difficulty of finding players on the network.", "date": "2008-04-17", "grade": null}
