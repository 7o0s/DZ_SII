{"name": "Guerra cubica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122088-guncraft-guerra-cubica.html", "text": "The main peculiarity of Guncraft is to exploit the voxel graphics technology to create a completely destructible environment accompanied by the possibility of digging tunnels and building structures in the middle of the fight. But it is not a game with a simulative attitude, which is evident from the Minecraft-like aesthetic setting, and it is certainly not suitable for those looking for a realistic war experience. Given the level reached by EverQuest Next, which exploits the peculiarities of the voxel with a decidedly superior technical cut, the day is not far off when there will be realistic shooters based on the total destructibility, even of the terrain, capable of wiping out, at least from the point of technological point of view, even Battlefield 4. But for now we have to make do with cubes, coarse particles and spartan animations. These limitations undoubtedly weigh on the aesthetic component of Guncraft but have allowed an independent team to create a shooter that includes structures buildable in battle by the players, destructibility of the terrain, various game modes and a powerful and versatile editor. Guncraft is all about the freedom to create, design, build and then destroy Reporting cube soldier At the base Guncraft works like a common military-style shooter with characters that automatically overcome the lowest obstacles and sprints, all seasoned with classes and modes with objectives of various kinds. The mechanics are not as refined as those of triple A shooters but they do their duty and are supported by a decidedly varied offer. The means and the numerous bonuses are linked to the killstreaks, in Call of Duty style, and culminate in the summoning of the AC-1337 gunship which is obtained by shooting down 12 opponents. In between we find a tank and a helicopter, freely controllable by the player, as well as bonuses such as infrared vision, the jetpack and the radar jammer which makes us invisible to the dangerous motion detector included in the standard equipment of all soldiers. To this we must then add numerous classes, complete with perks that include bonuses to the speed of construction of structures, and decidedly peculiar gadgets such as the grappling hook or the bouncing grenade. The result is a rather rich recipe and this richness also extends to the game modes. In fact, the ability to dynamically change the environment has allowed the creation of unusual modes for shooters such as Lava Survival which sees the map gradually sinking into magma. Players must, of course, survive and can do so by leaping onto the roofs of pre-existing structures and building further elevations. And the environment is once again the protagonist in the Meteor Survival mode which, in relation to the aesthetic modesty of the title, also shows off a discreet spectacularity with meteors piercing the ground in a frenzy of sudden chasms and incandescent cubes. On the other hand, the racing mode is less spectacular, but it is sufficient to show the level of customization of the title. Finally, to close, we find the Onslaught mode which is a variant of the classic horde that can be tackled in four. To attack us are droids of various types, science fiction monsters and even helicopters and the goal is, needless to say, to survive as long as possible. To do this it is necessary to kill the enemies that guarantee money that can be spent to activate the various killstreaks. The thoughtful use of the latter is, of course, the key to going where no cubic nano has ever gone before. Prisoner freedom As we anticipated, Guncraft allows players to build and mine during combat, Ace of Spades style, but these possibilities are limited by timers and constraints in order to keep the games balanced. Fortunately, in order not to limit the creativity of the players, the developers have made available a free-to-build mode. It is, in a nutshell, a dynamic editor that allows you to build, together, maps of all types and invoices. Starting from simple colored cubes, on the other hand, there is no limit to the imagination, which is reflected in the extreme variety of maps created by the developers. But Guncraft goes further by also allowing you to create skins and weapons, which makes it possible to generate environments that are completely different from those imagined by Exato Games. Everything is possible, from the Caribbean islands full of smugglers to space bases, the possibility of creating weapons consistent with a certain era, such as grappling hooks or crossbows in the case of pirates, makes everything more intriguing. But in this case there is also a limit in the editor with a maximum of 100 points to be distributed in the characteristics of the weapon. An obvious choiceterly necessary to avoid excessive balancing problems, even if the amount of points available is generous enough not to block the player's creative ambitions. All these possibilities are, of course, supported by a hosting system that allows others to play with their own creations. But the developers have also made official servers available, so as not to leave players alone. Despite this, the population of Guncraft, even after the title arrives on Steam, is not large enough to support the huge variety of the title. Most of the servers dedicated to ~special~ modes are deserted and in the populated modes, ie deathmatch and CTF, the potential of the gameplay depends on the inventiveness of the players. Inventiveness that is often not exploited since the bonuses of the killstreaks are more useful than building entire castles whose walls are pierced even by the weakest of firearms. And here, in these cases, Guncraft turns into a common shooter, enriched by destructibility and peculiar weapons but characterized by rather limited visuals and subject to limits that are in total contrast with the formula of the title. Formula that, we are sure, would be more consistent with itself by increasing the number of players per server and implementing a crafting system that allows you to build vehicles and gadgets. Furthermore, the number of active players could increase, populating the editing community and the secondary modes, if the numerous and serious optimization problems from which the game, although improved with the latest versions, still suffers, are finally resolved.", "date": "2013-08-16", "grade": "7.0"}
