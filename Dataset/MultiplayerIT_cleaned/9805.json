Even those that in theory would least lend themselves to a control system based on the touch screen (and possibly on the accelerometer), albeit with not always exciting results, make a fine show among the thousands of apps available on the Apple virtual store, and among these must also be included in the genre of ~pistol shooters~. In fact, how to solve the dilemma that sees a product of this type excessively simplified by the possibility of touching one's targets with one's fingers to eliminate them? If in a context with screen and lightgun factors such as aim, dexterity and reflexes make the difference, on the iPhone the elements involved are inevitably revolutionized, returning a profoundly different and in many ways less fascinating experience. The developers of Artematica have not been intimidated by these considerations and have packaged a good-looking shooter, which finds its strengths in the number of modes available and in the diversification between the characters. Tell me how you shoot and I'll tell you who you are The initial squad is made up of four elements: the Cowboy represents the balanced solution, as it has an average-capacity magazine and more than fair accuracy both for fixed and mobile targets; the Bandit is much less accurate about stationary targets, but his pistol can hold a large number of rounds and therefore has to reload less frequently; the Cowgirl also has more abundant ammunition, and compensates for the poor aim on stationary targets with a good ability to hit moving ones; the Sheriff, on the other hand, has opposite abilities: excellent aim at fixed targets, but the rest leaves something to be desired. These four characters are subsequently joined by two others: the Indian (very accurate, but with a short magazine) and the Gravedigger (infallible on moving targets). You will certainly have guessed that the characteristics of each shooter affect the work we do with our fingers during the game: if our character is very precise, touching a target will almost always prove lethal; if, on the other hand, his aim is poor, we will often have to insist on the same enemy to bring him down. Similarly, those with a larger magazine will have to stop less often to reload, conversely those with few rounds in the barrel will often find themselves in difficulty for this reason. The ~story~ mode is the fulcrum of the game and sees us engaged in a series of shootings divided between various locations, interspersed with special assignments that bring the types of missions present in the Artematica branded product to as many as seventeen. The character we've selected ~grows~ as we go along, earning money and respect rather than controlling entire towns. Even if the scenarios begin to repeat themselves after a while, therefore, the action is always quite varied and encourages us to continue the adventure. The secondary mode, ~challenge~, offers us eight extra missions in which we have to eliminate a series of targets within a time limit to earn a different trophy depending on the performance. Finally, there is an ~extra~ section in which all the unlocked elements are collected, in particular a series of really nice artworks, which reflect the excellent work done regarding the technical aspect of Spaghetti Western Shooter: the design of the characters is excellent, the locations appear well diversified and even the enemies have decent animations. The sound is also nice, with country music accompanied by average effects. The tested version is 1.0 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2010-09-16", "grade": "7.0"}
