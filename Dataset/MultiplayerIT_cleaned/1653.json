Let's try again. Once upon a time there was a very cruel emperor in a very distant country, now called China, who was so eager to increase his earthly power that he did not hesitate to commit heinous crimes and even betray his people. But however great this man's power was, he could not prevent the Lady with the Scythe from coming to collect her tribute from him too and so a large tomb was built which, even today - in 1936 - still remains unexplored and surrounded by darkest of mysteries. According to the legends, a jewel of unimaginable powers would have been placed together with the tyrant's body and, obviously, a host of criminals and scoundrels will do anything to get their claws on it. And so it will be up to us, fearless adventurers, to recover it before the bad guys do it. Naturally, as already mentioned, we will visit a good portion of the globe and there will be no shortage of surprise encounters and twists worthy of the best film script. Both the inevitable Nazis and an unspecified Chinese organization, halfway between a triad and a revolutionary army, will meet our Indiana Jones for the powerful artifact. But let's not dwell on the chatter and let's delve into the intricacies of the game system... naturally, without forgetting the whip and the hat. Indiana Croft and the Recyclers of the Lost Game. The distinctive trait of this game is the highly action-oriented setting, where we'll have to juggle traps, cliffs, fights and many linear levels to explore. Basically Tomb Raider without boobs. Oh, mind you, we're joking here but we don't want to say it's bad: for the comment, wait until you get to the end of the review! Therefore, our Indy will face a long sequence of maps, or levels if you prefer, filled with action, some puzzles, many enemies to teach good manners and lots of exploration. The game system is the usual: go ahead, jump the gap, hit the bad guy, pull the lever and go on, jump the gap, hit the bad guy, pull the lever and go on... in short, this is the way through every possible combination of enemies, levers, ravines and suspended platforms. Put like this, the gameplay can be repetitive, but in reality, Mr. Lucas' designers are not rookies and we can see it from the very first moments, when we will be given the tutorial directly by facing the first scenario. The difficulty increases as we progress through the game and we'll have to wait a while before more serious challenges are presented to us. This allows even novice players to get acquainted with the game system and, above all, with the control system. In this regard, I would like to point out that the mouse management system of the camera will force us to test patience, given its incredible imprecision, due in part to an effect of initial 'inertia', and often this fact will backfire when we find ourselves facing jumps to the millimeter or particularly difficult fights. There are many keys to press but fortunately it's not crazy, while the inventory system is rather spartan and often forces us to make too many maneuvers to prepare one weapon rather than another. Indiana Croft and the Recyclers of the Lost Game. The maps are very varied and the entire development of the plot is divided into a series of chapters, each consisting of several levels and a final boss. To make it tiring to continue in the adventure, however, the fantastic save system adopted intervenes, which will allow us to record our progress only between one map and another. So, if we fall into a torrent of lava just two steps away from the end of the level, we'll have to replay it all. This is undoubtedly a questionable choice, but in the meantime it's there and we have to keep it. An interesting variation on the theme is given by the combat system. Indiana Jones will be able to throw punches, kicks, headbutts and grab any type of enemy with solid grips, but not only: in our collection of blows we will find a huge variety of hits, projections, grips and dates, based on the combinations of the keys pressed. Also thanks to the excellent animations created for the occasion, the fights, or rather the fistfights, add a substantial adrenaline-pumping component and give the game a respectable added value that will be able to break the repetitiveness of the action very effectively. But if we don't want to get our hands dirty, we can easily use one of the many weapons ppresent in the game, from the whip to pistols with silencers, up to machine guns, hand grenades and fixed positions, but also the objects present in the scenario can be used to distribute good manners left and right. Thus, a chair, or a table leg, or a bottle, for example, could become our precious allies in times of need. Indiana Jones, however, will inevitably suffer from abrasions, bruises, allergies and hemorrhoids during clashes with his enemies, but luckily he will be able to refresh himself through the water bottle he always carries with him. The water bottle is the system used by programmers to make us carry our personal supply of health and it will have to be filled with water to work (Lourdes water, I assume), so when we are low on red blood cells, a good gulp will be enough to become healthy again like we haven't been since the tutorial. Scattered throughout the levels, we will find health vending machines, commonly referred to as 'fountains', through which we can fill our water bottle hoping it will last as long as possible. But, if you prefer the more traditional methods, between a kick in the zebdeans and a finger in the eye you can always resort to the very useful medikits, found around here and there. What dress am I wearing? Ah, the eternal dilemma of the party dress: which one do I wear for the occasion? This shirt with the sweat stains or this one with the marks from the last fall into the lava? In short, let's face it, we certainly don't dust off our best clothes to go and explore ancient ruins, right? And instead, for this latest Lucasarts adventure, a tailor-made suit has been packaged for our charismatic Doctor Jones, which takes the name of Collective Engine and is a very honest graphics engine capable of managing a good dose of polygons and effects but without exaggerating . In short, it's nice to see and makes a damn good impression, as long as the levels are designed without overdoing it. The character models are well turned and rich in nuances and details, while the animations deserve a separate discussion. During the game phases, the animations are - alas - woody and often ugly to look at. As if that weren't enough, the movements are accelerated and by combining the two you certainly don't get a particularly nice effect. Ironically, enemy animations seem to be better! Furthermore, during the interlude scenes, we can witness disturbing phenomena of diabolical possession of inanimate objects that should remain such: inanimate, in fact. But no, because when the characters involved will find themselves interacting with these objects, for example holding one in the palm of a hand, the latter suddenly come alive, starting an incredible 'San Vito dance' as if music had started invisible or as if they had peppered the vines. In fact, not even the facial animations come out well, misled by a lip that, for very mysterious reasons, almost never closes the lips of the characters who speak. Try to speak without pronouncing your lips, perhaps in public, you will see what a beautiful figure... What dress am I wearing? On the other side of the balance, at least, we can put decidedly spectacular scenarios built in a skilful way, where the typical colors of the made in Lucas productions intertwine with the suggestive architectures and more than once, peering from behind a corner, Istanbul , for example, will look like Tattoine to us. Even if it doesn't exactly concern the graphic aspect, I want to say a few words about the sound. The music, as already mentioned, is done really well, where the march composed by John Williams predominates and which is undoubtedly the trademark of the vein linked to the adventures of Indiana Jones. The effects are convincing and in the fights we will enjoy hearing the noise of the blindfolds that we will throw at our enemies (and that they will throw at us). So far so good, if it weren't for one small detail: the game is entirely localized in Italian. Certainly the less Anglophiles will take the right advantage from being able to listen to the dialogues in our beautiful language, but it must be said that very few dubbings have been done in such a coarse and superficial way. The voices seem to belong to characters that have nothing to do with those appearing on the screen: where a minimum of participation is required - I would say pathos, but let's not exaggerate - there is only the flat repetition of jokes written and repeated in front of a microphone. It's sad to have to be so harsh in a review, but I really can't associate those voices with those characters and thatand situations. Too bad, because all these things (the bad dubbing, the scandalous animations, the lip synchronized with an inflatable doll) heavily penalize the final judgment of the game. If nothing else, because the level of player involvement drops below zero. Comment. What about this Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb? The game is fun, even if the save story is a great annoyance and significantly reduces the playability. Unfortunately, it seems that the developers have not yet understood that a game must be fun and not frustrating. The fights are certainly the best part and we will never get enough of fighting with Nazis, henchmen of the Fuhrer and slant-eyed mobsters. The interaction with the environments is good and everything can come in handy to be broken on the head of someone not very welcome. Furthermore, ups and downs in the graphic design of the game, which overall looks good but is penalized by poor quality animations, woody and too fast, not to mention the bad lip and expressive faces like cans of tuna. And, as if this weren't enough, the coup de grace comes from the little more than flat and approximate dubbing. Fortunately, by playing, all these flaws can be overshadowed by the well-tested gameplay that alternates exploration phases with more excited moments, without forgetting, in some cases, to tickle our last remaining neuron with some never too difficult puzzle. All in all, then, what to think of this game? Of course it's not the best out there, but it's definitely a fun game and, managing to get over the flaws mentioned above, it can entertain even the most experienced player for several hours. Pros: nice fistfights nice levels nice music Cons: lack of saves makes it frustrating outrageous animations bad voice acting We meet again, Doctor Jones? Here is once again the indestructible Doctor Jones, illustrious archaeologist and adventurer known throughout the world. George Lucas' second son returns to do damage to our monitors with a brand new adventure and more than tested gameplay. After unraveling the mysteries of Atlantis and having transformed into the clone of himself, that Tomb Raider who first inaugurated the genre on PC, Indiana Jones will once again transport us to the four corners of the world to unravel another incredible mystery. As per the script, there will be no shortage of classic Nazis, nor the usual movie fisticuffs and not even the incredible music by John Williams, in short, it's practically always the same story, but, you know, the team that wins doesn't change and therefore the new chapter of Adventures of Indiana Jones was written under the banner of creative conservatism, rather than innovation.", "date": "2003-05-23", "grade": null}
