{"name": "Sei tu un dio?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88346-thor-il-dio-del-tuono-sei-tu-un-dio.html", "text": "Tested version: Nintendo WiiThe filmic storyline that sees the birth and affirmation of the various members of the Avengers group is advancing with great strides, and after the productions that saw Iron Man and the Hulk as protagonists it is the turn of Thor, the god of thunder of Nordic mythology, probably the least plausible among the characters who, in one way or another, will help defend the planet from a mysterious threat in the ~choral~ film dedicated to them, already in production. On the big screen, the adventures of Odin's son are set partly on Asgard, the city of the gods, partly on Midgard, or our Earth; and the same happens in the tie-in developed by Red Fly Studio for SEGA, which however does not follow the plot of the film directed by Kenneth Branagh and rather proposes its own, basically based on the comic, as already happened for the Iron tie-in Man and Hulk. The story, narrated through a series of very well-designed static cutscenes, sees Thor's half-brother, Loki, god of deception, organizing an attack on Asgard in the shadows and taking advantage of the thunder god's wrath to try to get hold of weapons that they could make him more powerful than Odin. However, things do not go as Loki imagined and from the destruction arises a seemingly invincible enemy, which can only be stopped thanks to the joint effort of all the gods. The twenty levels that make up Thor: God of Thunder in the Wii version have a rather linear structure: our character moves from one area to another without particular variations, marking his progress by eliminating many more or less cunning enemies . At regular intervals we are asked to try our hand at a quick time event based on the movements of the controller and there is no shortage of alternative sections (made exclusively for the Nintendo console) which see us fly through the scenario as in a Space Harrier shooter and eliminate every threat at sound of lightning, but it can be said without fear of contradiction that the juice of this new tie-in produced by SEGA lies in the fights, which allow us to hold the Wii-mote as if it were the mighty Mjolnir and use it to knock down anything stand between Thor and his next target. Thunder and lightning! Thor: The God of Thunder undoubtedly stands as the best transposition of a Marvel Studios film, at least in the Wii version; and the reason is obvious: shaking the Wii-mote as if brandishing Thor's hammer is damned fun, it works very well and gives great satisfaction also thanks to the presence of ~slowdowns~ that emphasize effectiveness and spectacularity of the blows struck. We can therefore point the finger at the work done by Red Fly Studio with regard to the linearity of the experience, but if the goal was to make the powers of the god of thunder available to players, well, it was achieved in full. Our character can perform a basic combo by alternating between holding the A button and tilting the controller forward, flicking it sideways twice to spin the hammer, swinging it downwards to send an opponent flying into the air, then volleying at them and ~ crush it~ loudly to the ground. Or still hold down the C button and perform the ~throw~ gesture of the hammer so that Thor throws it towards an enemy, hold down the Z button so that the same rotation becomes a shield against the blows of the opponents but can produce a strong gust of wind (shaking the Nunchuk), capable of propelling ice giants, trolls or fire creatures off a suspended platform in the void, or extinguishing flames blocking a passage. And that's not all: by pressing the ~-~ key on the Wii-mote it is possible to direct lightning bolts at the target indicated by the controller's infrared pointer, by pressing the ~+~ key you perform a similar maneuver but creating a small tornado, while acting on the various directions of the d-pad you can produce rapid lateral swerves, in a frontal dash or in the loading of further, devastating special moves: a huge tornado that sweeps away enemies, a storm of lightning that strikes everything on the screen or still the ability to further enhance Mjolnir, because its blows (especially the throw) are even more fearsome and can scratch the armor of the most gigantic enemies. My god has a hammer! To such an abundance in terms of available attacks is added an upgrade system which is based on the ~tokens~ earned in battle and which acts on three fronts: the finding of new moves (well yes), the improvement of Thor's abilities ( from the bar of the salute to that of mystical energy) and the activation of special runes that imply extra abilities. In short, arriving towards the end of the game, we will be able to literally perform a flood of maneuvers that are as spectacular as they are effective, both in an offensive and defensive key. Just in time for when we will unlock the Ragnarock difficulty level, with the possibility therefore of re-tackling all the stages with a higher degree of challenge. The rewards for completing the game aren't limited to this, however: you get different costumes for Thor, an entire episode of the Avengers cartoon and a series of interesting artwork for the stages and enemies. And speaking of scenarios and enemies, the work done by the developers of Red Fly Studio seemed excellent. They didn't have to invent anything, that's true, drawing the appearance of the ice giants, trolls and other creatures that we will face from Marvel comics, and the same can be said for the settings, very suggestive, even with some interesting ideas (see the long descent on board a sheet of ice); however the whole is very pleasant and manages to convey a certain impact despite the well-known technical limitations of the Wii. The Infernal Engine developed by the guys at Terminal Reality works really well, therefore, with the only negative note in the frame rate, which in itself is not subject to particular drops but fails to go beyond 20-25 fps. and that can certainly be annoying. No notes, however, for the sound sector: the music and effects are adequate for the action, and the Italian dubbing is of a good standard.", "date": "2011-05-09", "grade": "7.4"}
