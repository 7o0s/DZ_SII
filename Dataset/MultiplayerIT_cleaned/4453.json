However, what is usually not considered is that, within a multifaceted and unpredictable medium such as video games, disaster is often just around the corner even for products that are apparently perfectly calculated. Just think of Metroid Other M - which at the announcement had blew the heads of Team Ninja fans, only to then turn out to be rather disappointing - or the reboot of Thief, good but not excellent ... all clear evidence of how even with the best intentions it is often not possible to create a masterpiece on paper. Precisely because of these borderline cases we approached the Dragon Ball FighterZ review with lead feet, because despite the presence of the talented Arc System at the reins of the project, and their incredible mastery in the use of cel shading and in the management of the mechanics , there was the possibility of being faced with a fighting game unable to convey to fans the passion for Toriyama's work, or to deal with the more ~technical~ series of the Japanese software house. Yet today we are here, after having played the game for more hours than it was sensible to do for our health, ready to tell you that there was no need for lead shoes: Dragon Ball FighterZ is a video game of excellent quality, and we intend to explain the why in the slightest detail. Three androids went to Trent, all three trotting The nature of Dragon Ball FighterZ is very peculiar within the panorama of fighting games: at the base it is a classic three against three  la Marvel vs Capcom, with a combat system focused on crazy combinations, the possibility of calling assists on the field of companions and to take turns in battle, and generally more accessible mechanics compared to less ~boisterous~ competitors. However, the work of Arc System stands out from the others for its drive towards the simplification of the basic mechanics. Better explain in more detail: in Dragon Ball FighterZ the inputs for the execution of the moves are among the simplest ever seen, to the point that almost every special attack can be performed with the quarter moons (the typical movement of the hadoken), and there is practically no ~dragon punch~, winding blows, or combinations of crescents. Anyone, therefore, is perfectly capable of using every move within the game without tying their fingers, where the basic combinations do not require NASA calculator timing to be performed (typical of Japanese fighting games of this type, indeed). That wasn't enough, every single character has two automatic combos available, which can be performed with the repeated pressure of the medium attack or the light attack. Using them ensures that even newbies can do moderate damage with ease, even if they are practically always less efficient in attack than advanced series of blows. At first glance - and after testing this kind of find - FighterZ could therefore seem like a game for beginners, designed for fans of Toriyama's epic and completely unrelated to the harsh world of competitive. But if you haven't already noticed from the beta, this is as far from reality as we can get: Arc System is a team that has always created some of the most elaborate and refined fighting games around, and Fighterz is no different. Just fiddle in training mode for a few minutes with a little experience on your shoulders, in fact, to realize that this title does not eliminate the typical technicalities of its genre, it is only slightly better at hiding them than others. Ki-ko-ho The nature of three against three fighting games already thinks about building the first barriers: in games of this type the offensive pressure is very important, and with the prudent use of assists it can become unsustainable, not to mention that with the right timing these are even in able to increase the length and effectiveness of combos. The skill level required to execute such maneuvers is higher than we expected, however, and requires not only a decent memory, but also sufficient reflexes to connect the necessary attacks in the space of a few frames. Just to make matters worse, the title is mathematical in everything it does: in each combo the damage scales in a powerful way, and there is a limit of rebounds on the ground or on the wall, super dash (automated shots that reach the 'opponent) and throw in usable air, which pushes to find alternative ways to lift the enemy off the ground to carry out the worst atrocities. Still dissatisfied? Fantastic, because in addition to all this, the game allows you to activate super moves in series, to perform quick substitutions as defensive maneuvers, to bring your teammates' super into the field after a throw on the ground (it's practically the only maneuver that requires a full crescent to perform), bypassing normal projectiles with the aforementioned homing dashes, using ~cancel~ of certain shots in the air, teleporting behind the opponent, and a long series of other bad things that require many hours of practice to be fully mastered. All within a structure that is brighter than normal, since a large part of the damage suffered can be regenerated over time by changing characters, and this gives battles a discreet tactical element that makes it mandatory to consider the best options to save a fighter or use the ~sparkling blast~ (a powerful mechanic that quickly regenerates lost health and temporarily gives the ability to cancel certain moves with a dash). Observing such a good thing, only one problem can be noticed, even quite unexpected if we consider who FighterZ was developed by: the tutorial does not worthily explain the more complex mechanics. How to stop a Genkidama In their best fighting games - especially the recent Guilty Gear - the Arc System have always had an eye for the tutorial. Aware of how difficult the genre can be for a player unaccustomed to its complexities, the developers have practically managed to create frighteningly complete training modes (practically small fighting game encyclopedias), and have even stuffed them with tests capable of absorbing to the player some of the less intuitive mechanics. Dragon Ball FighterZ instead, for who knows what motivation, takes a step back in this field and offers a skin-and-bones tutorial that explains only the fundamentals worthily. The tests dedicated to individual warriors are a little better, which although very easy to complete for an expert player, reveal some of their interesting characteristics (for example some moves that can be connected in combos that normally would not seem such), but don't expect anything revolutionary Also here. The other modes of the game are much more curious, also because FighterZ does not go absolutely lightly as regards the contents. This is a massive game compared to most beat 'em ups, boasting among other things a massive story mode and divided into three different arcs. Now, Guilty Gear had been criticized in the past for shelving gameplay in favor of a few hours long anime that took advantage of the splendid game engine; Dragon Ball does the exact opposite, but stumbles dangerously in its attempt to offer many hours of playable battles. In fact, the game's campaign boasts a myriad of chapters in which the player is faced with various fisticuffs in preparation for the inevitable clash against the ~boss~ of the area: these fights have modifiers similar to those seen in the M.O.M. Mode proper to Guilty Gear - and it is possible to enhance your characters with the same modifiers, obtaining them after certain victories - however they quickly lose their verve due to a really too permissive difficulty. Simply put, the opponents found are helpless for most of the story and only become aggressive in the final stages of the last arc. Not a good thing when you consider that it takes several hours of silly battles to get there, and that the next level of challenge (capable of making sense of everything) is locked behind the wall of total completion. A new level of power Not that the story mode is unpleasant: it's a bit repetitive but still able to give satisfaction if taken in small doses. On the other hand, the Arcs have structured the entire storyline on the fanservice, starting from a new threat, Android 21, and building around it a plot told in three alternative versions that clarifies its origins and true nature. For heaven's sake, you shouldn't expect great narrative from FighterZ - we're still talking about stuff at the level of the Dragon Ball movies, and it's generally a very low level - but if nothing else, you're pushed to use various combinations between fights of characters to get extra cutscenes, which see the protagonists exchanging jokes and are sometimes very funny. It's another element that demonstrates the team's love for the source material: each character is treated with care, to the point that these short sketches are in the long runand even more pleasant than the actual story. As for the arcade mode of the game, however, we have no complaints whatsoever: it is branched, with opponents that vary according to your evaluations at the end of each fight and three different lengths. Already at the basic difficulty it becomes extremely difficult on the final, but when one of the choices is completed, its difficult version is unlocked, and let us tell you that these variants touch levels of challenge comparable to the old SNK fighting games. Perfectionists will take a long time to get decent scores. The rest of the contents? All dedicated to online and aesthetic customizations. In fact, the game has online challenges with a matchmaking structured around various skill levels (similar to that seen in many recent fighting games, but with an apparently clearer subdivision). Online it is also possible to face tournaments, but in general the skeleton of the whole is quite classic outside the game menu, which is nothing but a three-dimensional lobby with super derformed versions of the various protagonists and emotes in the form of unlockable stickers. This thing also connects to the customizations we were talking about earlier: completing the battles of Story Mode, Arcade Mode, challenges and local clashes in fact gives Zeni, which can then be spent in capsules in the game shop. The items are obtained completely randomly, and when you find duplicates you get premium coins with which to buy additional capsules (which, for the record, do not seem to contain rarer items, but only prevent you from finding more duplicates). At the moment we don't know if it's possible to buy these coins with real money, but doing so seems absolutely useless... in the game you earn hundreds of thousands of Zeni easily, you can farm them in story mode like there's no tomorrow, and nothing you get with the capsules is particularly attractive to a serial spender. In all honesty, even if they were actually microtransactions, they would be the most ignorable ever seen in a video game, almost a free offer inserted at random. A colorful roster, a colorful roster We wish we could tell you more about online, but the truth is that before launch it is impossible for us to assess its actual stability. The problems of the beta are known to all, and although they have been a serious alarm bell, they could repeat themselves. Having said that, in the days when the test worked, the netcode seemed more than stable, with lots of lost frames visible on the screen and a latency that was often acceptable even with overseas players. Overall, therefore, we have some fears, but we remain confident. As for the roster, however, there is no criticism that holds, if we consider that we are dealing with a technical fighting game. Now the end the game boasts 25 fighters, three of which to unlock (Android 21 is obtained once the story is finished, while Goku and Vegeta super saiyan blue require you to earn a large number of Zeni, or complete the arcade mode on hard with a high rating): not a huge number for a three against three, but the characters are so well done that we have rarely been so indecisive in choosing a team. There is no warrior equal to another in FighterZ: all have their own specialties and characteristics, and even if there are combos that can be performed in more or less the same way by each one, Arc System has never failed to add to each choice extra solutions or ~unique~ normal moves able to diversify the offensive. If the roster reaches this level of variety already now, we dare not imagine after the eight additions expected later. Instead, it is much more difficult to express oneself on the balance, since in a title of this type months must usually pass before understanding if there really are ~broken~ characters or heavy imbalances in certain combinations. However, we want to warn you: the impact with FighterZ online could be traumatic. If you should find someone capable of dribbling you like there was no tomorrow and abusing assists, don't be discouraged, because there is always a suitable answer (and the title is particularly well thought out when it comes to putting clashes on the same level after the loss of a fighter). The one mechanic in the game that doesn't feel like adding much to the system? The Dragon Balls: Activated by dint of automatic or high-count combos, and designed to obtain one of four notable bonuses with a series of light attacks when you have seven energy bars. They seem a bit excessive to us as requirements, and in fact we believe that it will be difficult to see the green lizard appear in high-level matches", "date": "2018-01-22", "grade": "9.0"}
