There are many examples, but what interests us right now concerns exclusively the Resident Evil series. The Capcom-branded survival horror, which took so much from the masterpiece of the then Infogrames, Alone in the Dark, what it has given to its numerous fans through three technological generations, has always been characterized by a slow and wooden control system, which contrasts claustrophobic visuals with a ~character-relative~ solution which in fact puts players in difficulty when they have to escape from dangerous situations. Indeed, as the zombies graze our character on the screen, his inability to coordinate somehow reflects the tension and fear that we ourselves felt in his shoes. It seems like a stretch, yet in this case a mere ~defect~ takes on the connotations of a prudent choice, capable of multiplying the involvement and therefore of fully enhancing the gaming experience. Well Resident Evil 4, in its Mobile Edition for iPhone, consciously or not ends up offering us a woody, very woody control system, bordering on claustrophobic despite the open and sunny scenarios. A great advantage? From console to iPhone Anyone who has played Resident Evil: Degeneration for iPhone already knows the control system developed by Capcom to make the most of the touch screen. It is to all intents and purposes a virtual joypad: at the bottom left there is the ~analog stick~, which must be operated with the thumb but requires a little practice to be mastered; on the right, however, there are the buttons that are used to hold the equipped weapon and to open fire. Once the gun button is pressed, for example, Leon stops and we can just move the laser sight to frame the target before shooting. Finally, shaking the device allows us to recharge. It is a solution that on paper ensures a certain adherence to the original Resident Evil gameplay (in this case, to the one introduced from the fourth episode onwards), but which in practice proves to be very cumbersome. Our dear Leon, a special agent in charge of finding the daughter of the president of the United States, ends up in a situation that is unfortunately not new to him: the inhabitants of the remote village where he was sent have been infected with a new variant of the T virus, and their violent behavior favors the wishes of a mysterious leader. In this context, due to the controls, even the apparently simplest situations end up becoming difficult and we have to take into account the bites and ax blows that follow the most unscrupulous approaches. During a fight, even just turning to distance yourself from the enemy becomes a feat, hence the similarities with the first Resident Evil in which the woodiness of the movements was absolute. As in the console version, killed enemies leave weapons, ammunition and money that we can collect and spend in the breaks between the twelve stages available. Our gunsmith friend, quieter than usual, will offer us the usual catalog made up of pistols, machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles and grenades: our task is to manage resources in the best possible way, evaluating the purchase of a new weapon rather than the enhancement of one that we already possess. Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition presents itself as a ~reduction~ in the true sense of the word: Leon moves within much more bare and poor scenarios than seen on the console. The stages have the flavor of small challenges to be completed without suffering too much damage, and the ~textual~ interludes only accentuate this impression. The graphics generally look better than in RE: Degeneration, in particular due to the polygonal models taken from RE4, which appear simplified and angular here but retain their excellent design. The worst thing are undoubtedly the textures, rather confused and of low quality, which make the scenarios look flatter than they actually are. The sound is functional to the action, but it doesn't go beyond that. The tested version is 1.00", "date": "2009-08-07", "grade": "6.0"}
