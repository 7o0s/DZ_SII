{"name": "Happy Lines", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/happy-lines_a.html", "text": "Within the videogame panorama of the iPhone, Happy Lines arrives late compared to a competitor with which it shares most of the gameplay elements, or Fuzzle. In both cases, it can be said that the leitmotif of the game lies in moving colored balls from one point to another on a grid - following straight lines only - in an attempt to place five or more identical units side by side in order to make them disappear from the screen. The difficulty lies in doing this despite the new spheres that appear regularly with each player's move, an aspect of anything but trivial importance: each movement must therefore be reasoned, otherwise the grid will be too crowded and a premature game over. Unlike Fuzzle, Happy Lines uses colored smileys instead of simple pawns, but the result in playful terms does not change: we are therefore faced with a puzzle with simple premises, but absolutely not immediate. On the one hand, this is an undoubted advantage, which makes the HeroCraft title a deep puzzle game that forces the user to think constantly, but on the other hand, it also makes it a product that is sometimes frustrating due to its difficulty, and which might put off less genre-inclined gamers. Also because that of the spheres that appear with each move performed is not the only danger to face: there is in fact an indicator that decreases as time passes, and which must be refreshed by aligning the various smileys, with the final aim of filling it completely and thus moving on to the next stage. Not only that, in the more advanced stages the game grid abandons the classic square shape to embrace more complex structures, obviously aimed at further embarrassing the user. Happy Lines consists of 40 levels, which can be tackled in the two distinct Arcade and Classic modes and with the Lines and Squares variants (with which it is determined on the basis of which shape the balls disappear from the screen). A good amount of content, which however less savvy users could get lost, in reference to the aforementioned basic difficulty of the HeroCraft puzzle. Another not exactly exciting aspect of Happy Lines is to be found in the technical realization, little or nothing superior to that seen in the mobile version: the developers seem to have done the simple homework, re-proposing the 2D graphics both functional and sparse of the original in a slightly more defined. Instead, the control system is better, which finds a valid ally in the touchscreen: instead of damning yourself using a directional cross, here you just need to touch the smiley you want to move and drag it to the desired box.
