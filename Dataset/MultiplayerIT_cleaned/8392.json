Yet, if we were to count the times our small planet has been involved in destruction or decimation of its inhabitants thanks to the work of imaginative screenwriters, we certainly could not get over it in a short time. A little to exorcise the catastrophes that unfortunately happen seriously, a little because destruction always makes news (and entertainment), basically seeing the Earth in danger and thus trying to stand up as heroes to save it by now everyone likes it, both cinema, where superheroes of all kinds go crazy, both in video games. Of course, on a narrative level it is undoubtedly a repeated and perhaps abused clich but it undoubtedly maintains a certain charm, especially in particularly unhappy periods such as the current one. In Strikefleet Omega, however, the hour is late: the poor Earth has already been destroyed and hope lies only in the salvation of the colonies. Control with one finger Starting from a rather classic setting of the RTS genre, Strikefleet Omega makes the player retrace the exploits of the captain of the military division of the same name of the colonies, made up of a series of very powerful interceptors and aircraft carriers capable of guaranteeing the defense of the skies from dangerous troops enemies. Commanded by the evil Queen of the Hive, the adversaries will try to erase the remaining humanity from the colonies, as already done on earth. According to the tradition worthy of any self-respecting strategic player, the player's task is to manage and coordinate the troops available, launching them to attack a particular objective or relegating them to the defense of a certain area. To be able to unleash an attack, simply ~plug~ the departure site of the aircraft, usually marked by a circle and the number of vehicles available, and trace their route without ever taking your finger off. This is where the first little perplexity arises, especially for iPhone and iPod Touch players: in fact, it is necessary to be very precise in marking the approach route to the objectives because if the first tap does not take place exactly within the selected area, the final result will only be a shift of the shot towards the corresponding playing area. Ultimately camera and route use the same finger movements, the difference is given only by the starting contact. In addition to the mother ship, always available and equipped with a permanent air defense service, it is possible to call into combat other types of support ships, such as the Starfighter Carriers, which provide additional war fighters, artillery ships, with a powerful ranged cannon, storage ships, bombers, etc. Resource management is entrusted to some indispensable blue vectors, useful for finding and transporting the precious crystals obtained from asteroids; accumulating crystals allows the creation of new ships, to be ~summoned~ according to the use necessary for the current mission. Both the experience system appears to be very accurate, which after each success allows you to reach an ever higher level by unlocking ships and economic resources, and above all that of vehicle upgrades, truly formidable. In particular, each single vehicle is given the possibility of strengthening itself, investing the resources won in battle; the player's choice consists in identifying the most correct destination for these resources each time, avoiding imbalances in the fleet but at the same time trying not to waste money on unnecessary ship upgrades. As easily understood Strikefleet Omega, sold in theory at no cost, represents the in-app purchase fair, a whirlwind of microtransactions so inviting that it is difficult, especially lovers of the genre, to let them escape. And the reason is easy to understand: finding economic resources and experience is a long, tiring and often repetitive process if done for free, hence the incredible temptation of the small anti-stress investment. However, there is the reverse of the medal, which this time must be considered: the title is in fact very beautiful and fun, even at a technical level, made with care in every detail, a product therefore far from the quality standards of ~free games~ , which is why the undeniable invasiveness of microtransactions appears truly justified this time around. It remains to point out an excellent system of objectives within the application and the presence of some ~perks~ that can be activated before each battle, to be selected based on the available resources.", "date": "2012-08-01", "grade": "8.5"}
