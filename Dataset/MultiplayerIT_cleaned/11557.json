{"name": "Sudopix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudopix_a.html", "text": "Picross for the Nintendo portable is just one of the latest expressions, among the best ever in videogame terms, of a puzzle game that has been in vogue in Japan for several years, and has only recently arrived here too through some newsstand magazines of pastimes and crossword puzzles assorted. Riding the wave of novelty and unprecedented western success that this game is gathering, In-Fusio has well thought of rolling up its sleeves and making a version for mobile phones, entitled Sudopix. The rules are the classic ones, as simple to understand as they are complicated to explain in words. In practice, each level offers a grid, of variable dimensions based on the complexity of the puzzle, made up of squares. Numbers are indicated next to each row and column: these represent the number of consecutive squares that will be filled, spacing at least one empty space between one group and another. Let's give an example: if 3 7 is written on a line, it means that on that same line three cells in a row must be filled first, and then 7. which squares to fill; once the whole grid is completed, an image will appear, in the form of animals, objects, musical notes or whatever. Confused? Don't worry, once you pick up the phone it will take very little time to fully understand the mechanics. It is precisely in the simplicity, however combined with the high challenge factor and the great satisfaction linked to the completion of a level that the goodness of the Picross / Sudopix gameplay is hidden; it is a puzzle game that, very quickly, can become a real obsession for those who are at least remotely interested in this kind of product. And the challenge factor is certainly not lacking: the grids soon increase in size and complexity, and each action must be carefully evaluated in the face of the fact that one wrong move determines a reduction in the overall time allowed to complete the level. The programmers wanted to create, with this version, a streamlined product, without unnecessary frills, and immediately usable but not poor in content; in fact there are 90 schemes, divided into 6 ~themes~, capable of engaging even hardened players for more than a few days. However, it is evident how In-Fusio has packaged a title aimed at those who already have a certain smattering with this type of puzzle; in fact, even a meager tutorial is completely missing, and moreover the difficulty is fixed at the top as soon as you pass the very first stages. Nonetheless, it would be a shame even for a complete beginner to give up Sudopix just because of the not particularly smooth learning curve; in fact, a minimum of effort is enough to be able to enjoy one of the most successful and enjoyable puzzle games of recent years. Needless to talk about graphics and sound, reduced to a minimum as the product requires but absolutely suitable for the purpose. PRO An excellent puzzle game 90 levels Finished in every respect AGAINST No tutorials On small screens it suffers a bit", "date": "2008-03-18", "grade": "S.V."}
