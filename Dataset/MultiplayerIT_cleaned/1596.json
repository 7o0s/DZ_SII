{"name": "Recensione di Roland Garros 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-di-roland-garros-2003.html", "text": "Options and menus I actually have to admit that it wasn't for the ~Wanadoo~ branding on the packaging, the features of the classic ~EA Sports~ game are all there: anonymous introduction, essential menu, ~classic~ game modes (exhibition, tournament, career, etc. ) and skimpy options. Actually the real options window, which defines the video detail and the commands, is found in a separate menu, which appears with the CD autorun or at the end of the installation. Certainly in an illogical position. However, a brief reading of the manual (quite complete, for what little there is to write) is enough to understand what happened to the options for screen resolution or for changing the keyboard configuration. The various game modes, mentioned before, in detail are: Arcade, where you face a series of increasingly difficult opponents, single or double; Exhibition, for a singles or doubles match; Tournament, where you create a custom tournament for up to 7 players to compete against; Resistance, like Arcade, but with a ranking of the most ~resistant~ players; Tutorial, in which you achieve specific goals to learn how to play better. As mentioned, there is also the ~Career~ mode, certainly the most important in the game and which has the task of making it as long-lived as possible. game system The player moves using the cursor keys, and the ball can be hit in various ways: topspin (the most classic shot), lob, flat shot (fast ball) or cut ball (slow ball). During the impact of the racket against the ball, using the cursor keys it is also possible to decide where it will be directed. What is surprising is that in reality, after a few hits, it becomes clear that the cursor keys used to give direction to the ball are not based on the player's position at that moment, but on the opposite field: hit the ball by holding down the left button does not make it go to the left, but to the left side of the field; using the right arrow the ball will not go to the right, but to the right of the field, while if you don't use any key, the ball will not go straight but to the center of the field. The ~depth~ of the shots is added to these keys: by holding down the up arrow, the shots will be on the end of the line, near the net if you use the down arrow. It is a curious system, which can be exemplified in this way: if you are on the right side of the field and you want to make a straight pass, you have to direct the cursor to the right: the ball will not go out to the right, as one might expect, but flies straight along the sideline, until bouncing inside the opposite field. This means that sending the ball out, in addition to being a real rarity, gives too much the impression of being the result of chance. And already 'here is lost in realism. Perhaps a functioning system such as serving, where the more you hold down in one direction the more the ball will go in that direction, with a high risk of going out of bounds, could have been a better solution. An ~innovative~ career Let's now see the ~Career~ mode, which as mentioned is the cornerstone of the game. Having created a character and assigned him the basic characteristics, which will improve with training (and only with training), you will be able to decide what to do through four windows: the first will allow you to decide who will be your partner in the doubles and you will be able to see the season objectives (for example win two tournaments and complete all levels one of the trainings). The training mode, arcade at the highest level, will allow you to improve your forehand and backhand, knocking down targets placed on the other side of the field, perfect your volley, hitting arrows that will move a spaceship on a screen at the bottom (sic !), and to enhance the serve, hitting the explosive barrels placed in the square of serve. Completing a workout, whether successful or not, will (sometimes) improve the related ability score. With the earnings from the tournaments it will be possible to buy items in the ~shops~, at crazy prices and with ambiguous utility: a new dress, some colored balls, and new fields (not new tournaments, but fields with different grandstands) to use with other game modes. The last choice of Career mode is the World Tour. Unlike what happens now with almost all sports games, this mode is not based on a realistic calendar of competitions, with many tournaments, tables with qualifications, final stages and challenges with variable durations. In reality, the World Tour mode is as arcadey as possible: there areor four fields, one of grass in England (evidently there weren't the rights to call it Wimbledon), one synthetic in the United States and two clay, one in Australia and the other, the only official one, in France: the Roland Garros. You can choose any of the single or double tournaments of each field. Once the choice has been made, three games will have to be played in the best of 4 games as a rookie, 5 if ~professional~ or 6 (one set) if ~champion~. Once this ~surrogate~ tournament is finished, if it has been won, a gold star will appear next to it, otherwise there will be a ~dirty~ star. A sport for a few... Therefore, if the tournaments are few and moreover not even arranged in chronological order, one will at least expect to be faced with the greatest tennis champions and at least the first 50 or 100 seeded players. Now, unless tennis is a failing sport, I don't think the five men and five women (albeit famous) that Roland Garros 2003 makes available are a sign of a great variety of players. Moreover, the game lets you play matches with random players, even creating duplicates! So don't be surprised if, in a doubles match, you find yourself against Alex Corretja and Alex Corretja and, in the next game, hoping to have eliminated some unusual twins, another clone turns up... called Alex Corretja. I forgot! Guess the name of your doubles partner... Graphic compartment The graphics are of a good standard, with well-designed fields and impressive grandstands. Unfortunately, the camera that frames the match all too often tends to zoom in on the field, with the risk of seeing the ball and the player disappear because they ran into a corner of the baseline. Furthermore, when changing sides, you find yourself with your player on the opposite side of the view. After learning all the proportions of the field, what's the point of placing the player on the other side? So it's up to you to learn all the new perspectives as well. Audio compartment In the audio field, taking for granted the shots on the balls and the cheering of the public between one play and another, everything ends. There is no play commentary, and the voices of the referees, who summarize the score after each rally, become annoying after a few minutes. Added to this is that the female voice has a strong French accent which tends to distort all surnames. And it all ends with a bad integration of the voices, which makes the sentences as fluid as the automatic response of the 412 service. Final considerations Roland Garros 2003 is a bad tennis arcade. Lucky game system, only four tournaments, just five players for each gender, confusing shots, ambiguity of the options and unrealistic career mode... with the result of a longevity of a few hours, counting that the other game modes, purely arcade, they have no developments that allow you to have something new over time. Characteristics followed by an ellipsis are mentioned on the back of the pack, as if there were so many other game possibilities. In reality there is nothing else. Fortunately, looking up, there is ~other~ stuff: Tennis Master Series, by Microids. For Carapace the road is still long. Pros: Graphically pleasing Quickly assimilable game system Cons: Few tournaments and few players Career mode incomprehensible Lack and ambiguity in all game features Introduction The Rome Internationals are beginning to be a distant memory for us Italians, also because abroad they have already forgotten it for some time. Now we are in the middle of Wimbledon, the tournament on grass that fascinates tennis fans so much. On the occasion of the previous Grand Slam tournament, the French Open, Carapace and Wanadoo have respectively completed the development and distributed Roland Garros 2003, the new chapter of the most famous tennis game for PC of the moment.", "date": "2003-07-09", "grade": null}
