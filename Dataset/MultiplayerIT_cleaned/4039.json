For those looking for a classic, one might even say classicist, graphic adventure on Nintendo Switch, this conversion comes at just the right time. Broken Sword 5 was born from the desire of the original authors of the series, Revolution Software, to go back to the origins and propose a classic point and click adventure capable of recovering the atmospheres and characteristics that made this series unique. After the first two historic chapters, the fourth and fifth had somewhat watered down the original magic, when the videogame zeitgeist had imposed a shift towards 3D action adventure, inevitably losing sight of the foundations on which the success of broken sword. Graphic adventures have never completely disappeared from the scene and the productions of Daedalic, Wadjet Eye, King Art and others are there to constantly demonstrate it, however their importance in the videogame market has significantly decreased, which is made clear by the methods used by some of the most important authors to be able to go back to dedicating themselves to their own genre: the good old crowdfunding. Having undermined the standard system of financing projects through the classic publisher, famous names in the adventure environment such as Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert have managed to re-impose traditional point and click on the public's attention, passing through the thrust of historical fans but exploiting it also to carry the message to new users. Revolution Software has also moved exactly along this path, which with the Kickstarter of Broken Sword 5: The Curse of the Serpent was able to provide fans of the series with an authentic return to the origins but also demonstrate how the original mechanics of the game still have something to say Nowadays. Gnostic intrigues Therefore, all the typical ingredients of the series return in Broken Sword 5, starting from Paris to arrive at the usual international intrigue based on some obscure apocalyptic theory on a more or less historical basis. Just to give you an idea, the first chapter of the series proposed to a shocked public in 1996 a gripping ~archeo-thriller~ style story with conspiracy grafts almost ten years before the international affirmation of the Da Vinci Code, all perfectly packaged on a good basis of puzzles to solve. In short, while not reaching the glory of LucasArts adventures, Broken Sword has earned its prominent place in the history of video games and its fifth official chapter represents an event not to be underestimated. To remain perfectly in line with tradition, the story starts once again from Paris, where the two historical protagonists George Stobbart and Nico Collard meet by chance during the opening of an art exhibition in a gallery. As happens with disturbing regularity when the two characters find themselves side by side, drama erupts with a masked thief who shoots the gallery owner and steals a particular painting, ~La Maledicci~. Obviously this is not just any painting, as can also be understood from the animated prologue: the painting represents the key to reaching a higher level occult truth, connecting to a complex plot of revelations, sects, orders and obscure knowledge that lead, through relics mystics like the Tabula Veritatis, to awaken the enormous power of the devil himself, or something like that. The story collects information and suggestions from the various theories on Gnosticism, mixing historiographical elements on this complex religious and philosophical current with an obviously fictionalized reconstruction of the events, in that typical mix that made Broken Sword famous, managing to enrich an original story with elements drawn from the most mysterious and controversial folds of history and religion. From this point of view, the recovery of the narrative and stylistic elements of the series is perfectly successful in Broken Sword 5. Back to point and click As well as the narrative component, the interface is also taken directly from the classic episodes, returning to the old point and click after the action-like digressions of the last two chapters. Revolution has always developed rather simple and intuitive control systems for its adventures, especially compared to LucasArt's SCUMMs, however a certain parallelism can be found between the complexities of the interfaces and the openness of the puzzle design in the two different development styles: the system used by Revolution adapts perfectly to a more linear structure, far from certain typical complexities and opennesses of productions by Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer, for example. Broken Sword 5, like its predecessors, is largely focused on dialogue and interaction between limited elements of the scenario, usually proposing sequences of actions to be performed within the same setting or contiguous scenarios, before paving the way for new locations . This does not mean that the puzzles are not well thought out and stimulating, despite being rather simple on average, but their compactness in terms of distribution on the scenarios and their logical linearity (in principle) work perfectly to keep the script cohesive within of a setting that is obviously anchored to reality more than what happens in other adventure titles. This is particularly evident in Broken Sword 5, which tends to limit the geographical extent of the puzzles by concentrating the action in a few settings at a time, also resorting to a lot of backtracking especially in its first part. The game opens clearly in the second half (corresponding basically to the second episode of its initial release), when the locations become more varied and the interaction on the elements of the scenario and on the characters is distributed on a greater scale, also improving everything the pace of play. In short, the puzzle design is less creative and original than in other titles, but it must be said that everything contributes to keeping the narrative cohesive and efficient, as befits a screenplay written with a certain rigor. The construction of the various characters is also good, which as per tradition often stage a theater of specks and characters somewhat out of the norm, giving rise to non-trivial dialogues, albeit with ups and downs. However, the light humor that pervades the whole atmosphere is appreciable, also deriving from the more classic tradition of Broken Sword. The Nintendo Switch version The Nintendo Switch version of Broken Sword 5: The Curse of the Serpent follows those consoles previously released on Xbox One and PS4, in terms of content and interface. The point and click mechanics here can be replicated through two different systems, expanding the sketch seen in the PS4 version with the use of the touchpad: on Switch it is in fact possible to control the cursor through the analog sticks or by directly touching the screen in portable mode. This last option is obviously closer to the standard use of the mouse and is very intuitive, but it must be said that the adaptation to the sticks is done so well as to make them preferable, in terms of reaction and precision, with the value Added vibration to highlight various items you can interact with. For the rest, the use of 2D scenarios with 3D inserts given only by the characters makes this version practically the same as the others, with the added value of portability, of course (although this is already evident in the mobile and PS Vita versions ). The reference to the hand-drawn scenarios is another homage to the classic tradition of Broken Sword, which emerges clearly above all in the Parisian settings. It is a style that keeps its charm unchanged even after all these years and the integration with the 3D characters with a splash of cel-shading represents an intelligent choice to give continuity to the series and also find a good compromise in economic terms and animation technicians, demonstrating how the project has been well studied by Revolution since the early stages of crowdfunding. Also in this case, the game is entirely dubbed in Italian: the solution is always appreciable even if there are some convenience solutions in this area, with great care especially given to the pair of protagonists and a rather limited number of voices distributed between the various characters of the cast, so many of these find themselves having practically the same vocal characterization.", "date": "2018-09-30", "grade": "7.8"}
