We had a little sneak peek in our special of how all the cards would be revealed between late July and early August, culminating with the last 40 shown by Hearthstone lead designer Ben Brode and pro-player Brian Kibler (ex-pro also Magic player) in a special event where they played four games with different decks. During this summer period of waiting for the release of the new expansion, Blizzard has organized two special events to prepare players and has also ~revolutionized~ the system of finding legendary cards. But first things first: the first of these events, the Fire Festival presented by the Fire Lord Ragnaros himself, was the richest event with daily quests giving double the gold for the entire period of this holiday (approx. three weeks). The second event was the Frost Festival, represented by the Ice Lord Ahune: for all the weeks involved in this holiday, Blizzard ensured the first victory of each Arena and made players benefit from a mission in which to play three games in this modality gave an envelope of the new expansion as a reward, moreover, on two occasions, it gave entry to the Arena. As for finding legendaries, the possibility of finding them with the guarantee of at least one in the first 10 open envelopes has certainly been increased, moreover, you will no longer be able to find legendaries that are already present in your collection. The Knights of the Ice Throne introduces some interesting innovations that we will see in the rest of this review but at least two, one of which has a particularly impact on the dynamics of the game, we will highlight them immediately. First, the new Vital Steal keyword: both spells and minions that have this ability, when they deal damage, heal you for the amount inflicted. The second novelty is given by the fact that Knights of the Frozen Throne represents the end and at the same time the beginning of a new way of conceiving the Hearthstone adventure that is no longer paid but is, instead, included for free in the expansion . The wings will be released weekly, and the Prologue and Lower Keep were made available at launch. Let's take a closer look at what news awaits us. The Lich King corrupts the heroes of Azeroth As we mentioned in the previous article, in the Knights of the Frozen Throne, a legendary card has been inserted for each class that transforms your hero into his Death Knight counterpart and modifies his hero power. Each of these cards has a different mana crystal cost, provides armor and has a different effect depending on the class and only the hunter was initially revealed. Now that we are aware of all the remaining ~knight of death~ cards, we will only limit ourselves to making an initial consideration, emphasizing which of them have impressed us the most. Obviously, being only in the very first days of the expansion's life, everything is constantly changing and the metagame changes even several times within the same day, however the transformations that have impressed us the most are those of the shaman and the warrior. Thrall, in his corrupted counterpart Thrall the Deathgazer, costs 5 mana (he's the lowest cost death knight), provides 5 armor points, and as a battlecry, transforms all his minions into random minions that cost 2 mana in moreover, his hero power allows him to transform one of our minions into another that costs 1 more, just like the Evolve card does: this effect is really very powerful, especially considering that the evolution deck was already itself very powerful before the arrival of this card. Garrosh the Scourge, on the other hand, costs 8 mana, provides 5 armor and, upon entering the field, equips a 4/3 weapon that damages all minions adjacent to the one attacked and his hero power can deal 1 damage to all minions present on the game table. Considering that in this set there are many useful cards that take effect if they take damage (like the new legendary of the warrior Rotface which is 4/6 for 8 mana and every time it takes non-lethal damage it summons a random legendary minion), we are sure that the new version of the first historical leader of the horde of World of Warcraft will be played a lot. In general, all death knight cards are quite slow and cost between 8 and 10 mana, indicating that Blizzard definitely wants to slow down the metagame and counter aggressive decks by proposing cards like Druid of the Swarm (for the druid), which for 2 mana can become 1/5 with provocation, the Drakkari Defender (for the shaman), which for 3 mana is 2/8 with taunt but has a heavy 3 Overload, or the new neutral minion Chained Slave, which for 4 mana is a 2/3 with Taunt that summons a copy of itself as a battle cry (without repeating the cry). It must be said that the attempt to slow down the game seems to be implemented with each expansion but that players, until now, have always managed to find a way around it by creating very effective and fast decks. We won't make a list of the corrupted counterparts of all heroes but, it is useless to hide it, we were disappointed by Gul'dan the Bloodreaver: his 10 mana cost makes him very slow and his battle cry with which he summons all dead demons in this game he ~drives~ him too much towards a deck with demons. Honestly we would have hoped for a hero that synergizes with the discarded cards (be careful, being disappointed does not mean that the card is poor but simply that we expected it to be different). More and more in Arthas Adventure included, we said, and our first encounter with the Lich King, Arthas, takes place right in the prologue, in a pre-set clash where we play Jaina who, awaiting the arrival of Tirion, is beaten and transformed into ~Jaina the Lich of Frost ~, the death knight version of the famous sorceress which, when played as a card, costs 9 mana, provides 5 armor, summons a 3/6 Water Elemental, and changes the hero power to Frozen Touch: this ability allows you to inflict a damage to an enemy, and if the minion dies, a Water Elemental under your control is summoned. In your next playthrough, as the new Jaina, you'll have no trouble beating a ~not-so-legendary~ Tirion Fordring, and this easy match will net you the first randomly chosen death knight card out of all classes. The first boss to face in the Inferior Rock is Sire Ossa Morte with his zero-cost power that heals him entirely: the cards that the boss uses, and which you must keep under control, are the dangerous Bone Spike, a 0/8 which at the start of his turn deals 15 damage to you, and the Bryntroll, a 3/6 windfury weapon that will easily kill all of your minions. We beat him with an ~Otk~ type priest deck (One turn kill, therefore who wins in a single turn) using the Divine Spirit / Inner Fire combo, to create a minion with very high strength and toughness, and cards like Mind Vision, Thought Steal and Convert (which costs 2 and adds a copy of an enemy minion on the field to your hand). The second boss is Facisaure who can only take damage from weapons. Obviously, you will have to use the paladin or the warrior and we have used Garrosh himself, filling the deck with weapons and minions that benefit from the use of weapons, such as the Pirate Blackwater which reduces the cost of weapons by 2 or like the new neutral magic Forge of Weapons which for 2 mana draws two from the deck. It will take a few tries but you will be successful. The third available boss in the first wing is the Lady Deathwhisper (before the nerf, word of the Lich King!) with her hero power that deals damage to enemy minions bringing them to 1 health. The peculiarity of this clash is that you have the dragon Valithria Vegas at your service, every one who is 30/5, which cannot attack if it is damaged but which, obviously, starts the game with only one life point left; that's not all, Lady Deathwhisper has 30 life points and 90 armor points. To win this particular fight we used a priest deck with lots of healing cards, like Flash Heal or Combo Heal, in order to replenish your mighty dragon's health and then allow it to attack. You can also decide to silence it, but in that case the enemy minions will attack it, so you'll have to protect it by healing it or through the other minions in your deck (put some with Taunt, such as the Nuisancebot or the Firmstone Defender, and you won't have any particular problems). Beautiful the rebuke of the Lich King who takes it out on the boss for not having put an Arcane Explosion in the deck, not making it possible to kill minions at 1 health. Completing this wing, in addition to giving you access to the next one, will give you a booster pack of the new expansion. We still don't know exactly what the clashes in the next wings will be like, what we are sure of, given that Blizzard underlined it in a special, is that the final clash with the Lich King will be particularly difficult and different for each of the classi who will face him and, if you manage to beat him with all your heroes, you will receive as a reward the aspect of Arthas paladin, before corruption, to be replaced, if desired, by that of Uther. Knights of the Frozen Throne, let's take stock To discuss the future of the metagame and for the description of the most used cards, we give you an appointment for a subsequent special but some of them are absolutely to be highlighted immediately. The most representative of the expansion is certainly the neutral Lich King: it is an 8-mana 8/8 with Taunt who, at the end of the turn, puts a special Death Knight card randomly chosen from eight different ones into your hand . These powerful new cards are seven very powerful spells and one weapon, Frostmourne, which is 5/3 at 7 mana and summons all slain minions when destroyed. Examples of the Death Knight's powerful spells are Army of the Dead, which for 6 mana removes the top 5 cards from your deck and summons all removed minions, and Death Grip, which steals a minion from your opponent's deck and adds it to yours. hand. The Lich King is ultimately a sort of ~Ysera 2.0~ and we're already seeing him used in all the control decks of the new metagame. The only other way to get Death Knight cards is through the neutral minion Arfus (the Lich King's dog) who for 4 mana is 2/2 Deathrattle puts a random Death Knight card into hand. The Arena has also been updated with new cards and some of them are already having great success, such as Enlightened Val'Kyr which, in addition to being a 5-mana 5/4, gives +2 health to minions adjacent to her enters the field or the Necroratrix which at 3 mana is 2/4 and when it enters the field, it makes one of your minions immune until the end of the turn. The attention to detail in the creation of the cards, both from a graphic and sound point of view, remains of a very high quality standard; there are many references to Icecrown Citadel, one of the most famous raids in World of Warcraft and, if you are a player of the Blizzard MMO, you will easily recognize many of the minions that the bosses will play against you. Even the new unfailing ~frozen~ themed game table is made with care in both the PC and Mobile device versions and does not disappoint. This is definitely the most enjoyable period for all players, with dozens of decks following each other daily until, as usual, the win percentage of some of them will rise and some archetypes will become more played and, therefore, will wait again for the next expansion, due out later this year, which will serve to complete the year of the Mammoth. As a last note, and as we often say, Blizzard has absolutely no intention of abandoning the random element present considering it a ~fun part of the game~, therefore a certain percentage of the cards present in this new expansion have the C factor included in the price .", "date": "2017-08-14", "grade": "8.2"}
