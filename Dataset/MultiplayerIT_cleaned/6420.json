But let's go step by step and, before delving into the wonders of this title, let's give it the right presentation: its conception dates back to Ludum Dare 28 held at the end of 2013, during which Mark Foster with the nickname Claw created the first working prototype in 48 hours . After having already gathered acclaim in its very first incarnation, Titan Souls then became a real commercial project thanks to Devolver Digital, which dealt with the publication of the game developed by Acid Nerve, the name with which we can now identify the trio composed by the same Foster together with David Fenn and Andrew Gleeson, who joined the team to deal respectively with the soundtrack and the artistic aspect of Titan Souls. The game then made a new appearance at E3 2014 further fueling expectations, until arriving tomorrow on Steam, where a few days ago the demo version was released, an ~enhanced~ edition of what was seen at Ludum Dare. Sensitive to the pains of the nameless hero, we wanted to help him accomplish his extremely difficult mission dotted with violent deaths and new attempts. Does the name of Titan Souls remind you of From Software's Souls series? Here too we die... and a lot! Die, die and die again Let's say right away that the plot is not the strong point of Titan Souls: in fact, the game immediately puts us in the shoes of its protagonist, without explaining more than its description on Steam says. We resume it to briefly mention a sort of intermediate layer between our world and the one that lies ~beyond~, within which the Titan Souls dwell, components of a spiritual force to which all things owe their existence living. Our task is to put the various pieces of Titan Souls back together, fighting against all the keepers / titans in a series of one-on-one battles that in fact make up the entire gaming experience. To describe the effort of Acid Nerve, a masterpiece such as Shadow of the Colossus has even bothered over the months, precisely because of the presence of a sequence of enemy-bosses interspersed with a few stages of walking between one place of battle and another, with occasionally some very small puzzles that can be solved in a matter of seconds. At this point, however, we can clarify the sentence at the beginning of the article, given that the name of the game clearly refers to the famous Souls series by From Software, with which joypads and curses have flown into the homes of the bravest, or most masochistic, gamers. You decide. With due proportions, Titan Souls is no less in proposing a ~trial and error~ system in which death is largely the mistress: for the writer, the completion of the main line made up of 14 titans has seen the beauty of 251 deaths (actually a part of these deaths also concerns the ~secret~ titans, faced a few times but left aside to complete the adventure first), in a series of attempts, sometimes even desperate, which however give way to appreciate the essence of the game created by Mark Foster. It goes without saying that in such a game there is no shortage of an abundant sense of frustration, which however becomes sublime in its union with a desire for revenge which with each failed battle brings us once again to face the enemy on duty, even without having a very precise idea of how to plant the only arrow we have straight into its weak point. One shot, one kill The idea behind Titan Souls is to put the player in front of a series of challenges of decidedly high difficulty, but of elementary complexity: the hero we find ourselves impersonating has a single weapon represented by his bow, for the which also has a single arrow that you can use. To shoot it you have to release the appropriate key, after holding it down as much as the power you want to give to the shot; the aim is instead taken with the analog lever, while to return to attack it is necessary to recover the arrow from the place where it fell, passing over it or using the same button to recall it through a telekinetic power. As for the commands, the bulk is practically all here: the control system in fact provides for the presence of only one other button, to be used instead to perform a quick somersault in a specific direction with a quick press or to run by holding it down. The methods of killing the bosses are just as simple, at least in theoretical terms: each of them has, as already mentioned, a weak point, by hitting which it instantly arises.and or the word end to the clash. The problem is that each titan has different appearances, also accompanied by different powers and, therefore, by different ways to be adopted to successfully shoot the decisive arrow. Just to give a few examples, we find the gelatinous being that hides its heart inside, the seemingly impenetrable stone cube and a jumping mushroom that shoots hallucinogenic spores, in a partially viable series in an order to your liking. And fortunately, given that the presence of alternatives can help us just when we feel blocked by a certain titan. The beauty of Titan Souls, or the ugly for those who find themselves fighting the same enemy several times, obviously lies in facing the new opponent for the first time without having any idea of what they will be facing, and then going through a study phase characterized by further deaths up to the one where instead we will have figured out how to hit the weak point, thus implementing our strategy with a mix of dexterity and timing, sometimes also helped by a pinch of luck. The desire to curse and throw the joypad against the monitor can become great, but the satisfaction in landing a masterstroke with the bow is also great after having finally understood how to defeat the titan, feeling a bit like Neo who sees the Matrix code after having encountered several times in the slaps of Agent Smith. Between fire and ice From an artistic point of view, Titan Souls certainly deserves a long applause, which starts from the decidedly accurate 16-bit style graphics and arrives at a soundtrack that accompanies every single moment of the adventure in an excellent way. Acid Nerve proves that it does not want to neglect absolutely anything, also offering in technical terms a little jewel that lends itself well with its retro graphics to recalling the games of the past, those in which the game over was an integral part of the progress and it was necessary to try again a certain sequence over and over again. It goes without saying that we are talking about an exclusively single-player title, to complete which the average player needs, according to the developers, between 3 and 5 hours: it took us 4, pausing however also to look at the various settings, which deserve sure to be visited without worrying about just running to the next enemy. Having to find fault with the way the developers conceived the game, sometimes the checkpoint that precedes the bosses is a little too far from the place where they are located, leading to paradoxical situations especially during the first attempts, in which the time to return to the fight can be longer than the duration of the latter. In some cases, however, this can also be a way to dwell on the latest attempt, developing a new strategy. In any case, to please the most masochistic, Titan Souls allows you to unlock three additional modes after the first complete game: hard, steel with only one life (good luck, you'll need it!) and another in which you can neither roll or run.", "date": "2015-04-13", "grade": "9.0"}
