{"name": "Echochrome - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/echochrome-recensione.html", "text": "Mysterious mysteries Announced for the first time during E3 2007, Echochrome presents itself as an atypical and original puzzle game. The world represented on the screen is governed by very particular physical laws, in this case by five ~mysteries~ that a guide-voice in Italian will illustrate to us during the first game. First point: if two separate sections appear to be connected, they really are; second: if an empty space between two sections is somehow hidden from view, then it does not exist; third - if visually one section seems to be located above another, then this is exactly the case; fourth: if a hole is hidden from view, it does not exist; fifth: if the character makes a jump, he will land in the section below the starting one. The fundamental assumption is simple: reality is what we see. And the peculiarity of Echochrome is that the player can and must modify this reality, tilting and rotating the scenario in three dimensions to achieve their goals. In each stage, the goal is always the same: the echo (ie the protagonist) must touch his shadows during his predefined path, and must do so in the shortest possible time. The stages vary in the arrangement of objects and platforms, acquiring complexity as the level of challenge rises: at the beginning we will find ourselves faced with a few divided sections, then holes, jumps and a series of increasingly more elaborate. The fundamental assumption is simple: reality is what we see. And the peculiarity of Echochrome is that the player can and must modify this reality. Escher: who was he? Anyone familiar with the works of Maurits Cornelis Escher will find many similarities with the world of Echochrome. Sony's puzzle game is clearly inspired by certain drawings by the Dutch artist, drawings that for one reason or another we have all seen ~mentioned~ in the most disparate ways. Above all, the lithograph ~Relativity~, printed in 1953, which shows us a cross-section of an absurd world, where nothing is what it seems, with different scales that intersect each other, without giving references. Appearance is everything In Echochrome, the action takes place in very similar ways: the echo materializes in an area of the scenario, and from that moment we can see exactly where its shadow is. The character starts walking in a predefined direction, and we'll have to rotate the entire stage using the analog stick or the d-pad to find a way to bring the two figures together. If only the division between the zones separates them, then we can take advantage of a column and rotate the scenario until it covers, in perspective, the missing part of the path. As if by magic, the echo will not fall into an abyss but will continue its walk until it meets its own shadow: stage completed! Clearly, with the passing of the levels, more complex environments will also arrive, consisting of several divided platforms, perhaps with the addition of holes or jumps, with the latter perhaps representing the most complicated element to manage. In the event that a good job has been done in arranging the path, we can decide to accelerate the path of the echo by holding down the X button, or take a break for reflection, observing the scenario carefully, by pressing the Triangle button. The game not only asks us to ~compose~ the protagonist's journey, based on the five laws that govern his reality, but also to do it quickly, mixing reasoning skills and shrewdness in a similar measure with controls: completion times are memorized, and the voice-guide will express his degree of enthusiasm according to the results achieved. Form and substance At startup, as mentioned, we'll have to grapple with a short tutorial that will explain how things work in the world of Echochrome, what the ~five mysteries~ are and how to rotate the scenery to build the paths. After that, we will be able to choose whether to play a stage at random or select it directly from the list of fifty-six levels available, arranged in order of complexity. We are not in the presence of a ~reward~ structure, and even in this the Sony title chooses the path of originality: we have ~everything and immediately~, we can face any stage and any successes will not translate into anything other than the simple personal satisfaction. Too little? Then the editor for creating scenarios comes in handy, which represents a bit of a ~challenge within the challenge~. With a series of elements available (cubes, stairs, basic structures, holes, etc.), we will have to put together a construction capable of putting us in difficulty when we go to ~play~ it, and the concept itself appears anything but obvious. In this sense, the PSP version of the game lacks the support of the PlayStation Network, which on PS3 allowed the player to download new stages at will and to share their creations with other enthusiasts. Technical realization A title with such a particular concept could only present itself with out of the ordinary graphics and sound. Echochrome isn't spectacular, far from it: the environments and characters are represented completely in wireframe, black on white, as if it were an architect's drawing board. It goes without saying that the rotation of the scenarios is always very fluid, without ever an uncertainty (the opposite would have been absurd), with the PSP screen resolution which proves to be sufficient to make the segments of the various areas collide without particular problems. The echo has a rather small set of animations, which do not go beyond the essentials. As far as the sound is concerned, the action is accompanied by a series of music played with the violin alone: an undoubtedly original choice, which gives a great sense of ~peace~, together with essential effects. The game has an excellent localization in Italian, both as regards the texts on the screen and the voice guide, well interpreted. Comment Echochrome is certainly one of the most original titles of recent years, a puzzle game in which we have to shape reality so that the moving character reaches his goal in each stage. The concepts behind the game are simple and interesting, in particular the references to the perception of things and optical illusions, and the technical realization follows hand in hand, with truly essential wireframe graphics. A masterpiece, in short? Well, never as in this case we are faced with a controversial product, which can conquer in an instant or be beautifully ignored. If you love original puzzle games and want to try your hand at a different experience than usual, you won't be disappointed. Pros Original basic idea Immediate and engaging A large number of stages... Cons ...but no ~progression~ Essential graphics Love it or hate it", "date": "2008-08-07", "grade": null}
