Placing yourself in the obvious role of the protagonist, we face an alternation of sensations that draws strength from the contrast between the extreme solidity of the game situations and the apparently intangible mystery that surrounds us. a soldier with exceptional abilities, thrust into a world of visions, psionic powers and disturbing characters From stars to rags Without any doubt this is the heart of FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) which does not make originality its banner, neither considering the technical side nor going through the plot which makes extensive use of famous and abused images of contemporary culture. Images that start from the very American special team ready to face the unknown and arrive at a representation today associated with oriental horror: a little girl with a white and lifeless complexion, a ghost of flesh whose features are hidden by dark hair like the abyss. How all this involves us represents the fulcrum of the plot that puts us in the shoes of a soldier with exceptional abilities, thrown into a world of visions, psionic powers and disturbing characters. But this is only a piece of a design of which we can only see a few fragments and which becomes all the more vivid the more we manage to immerse ourselves in the title by fully accepting the heavy atmosphere that characterizes it. How much does lead weigh The weapons, which I have already mentioned, are powerful, heavy and lethal. Nothing to complain about then, except that even the enemies make extensive use of it against us. And these are particularly intelligent enemies, in fact, FEAR stands out in particular for the excellent use of artificial intelligence, even more articulated than that seen in titles such as Halo. We are faced with adversaries who care about their own skin, shoot like new Rambos sheltered by safe protections and are able to interact with each other by calling and organizing real encircles. Although most of the opponents are made up of squads of soldiers armed to the teeth, there is no shortage of surprises capable of throwing us off guard, particularly fast surprises that enjoy unlimited freedom of movement and that take advantage of pipes, furniture, false ceiling panels and generally every hole imaginable to catch us unprepared. We are faced with opponents who care about their own skin The weapons we have are both the familiar chunks of metal with a trigger, barrel, and muzzle, as well as amazing strength and speed. The latter, in practical terms, translate into the familiar slow motion, the slow motion effect, which in a title like FEAR is enhanced by the quantity of objects and projectiles continuously projected in the air. A familiar bar warns us of the time available to us in super-fast mode, but this bar drains in seconds and refills just as quickly, unlike in other titles. In this way it is possible to draw on this power in almost every fight but it is always necessary to plan its use due to the limited time available. Also in this case we find a small addition to the PC version and it is an extra weapon or rather two since we can hold a pair. It is a machine pistol or a pistol capable of firing even short bursts like the infamous Robocop's enhanced Beretta 93R. Some data The most relevant novelty concerns a mode that allows us to play parts of the game decontextualized from the plot and transformed into independent maps. In a mode comparable to the time trial we have to complete the mission in the best possible way by totaling points that will be collected in official rankings that can be consulted through XBox Live and are now familiar to users of the service. There are also some rather short bonus missions that tell parallel events to the main story but are so underdeveloped that they leave you speechless, unlike the campaign itself. Another small change concerns the saving of the game which has given way to the checkpoints, much more suited to the console environment and above all comfortable in case you have to resort to a memory card. The title offers 4 difficulties and of course it is the highest to guarantee the best possible performance of the artificial intelligence and it is also a good way to increase the longevity of the title which lasts from about 8 to 12 hours depending on the player's familiarity with shooters in first person. Getting into itin multiplayer instead we find exactly the modalities of the PC version and specifically deatmatch, capture the flag and elimination and there is also the peculiar modality of FEAR which allows a player to use the super speed or to benefit from the slow motion effect, but on the other hand the it also transforms into the goal of all other players. The graphics sector is almost identical to the PC version. We note a greater use of chiaroscuro and perhaps a slightly more complex lighting, but the overall effect is what can be found with a high-end computer. Overall, therefore, a valid title, full of fluttering objects, limbs and debris, which certainly does not exploit the machine on which it runs, but which is still in step with the times. Even the sound is unchanged, but there's no reason to complain wrapped in disturbing music and effects and shaken by the excellent sampling of explosions, shots and gunfire, each of which can be heard distinctly even in the most chaotic situations. Dealing with a late conversion while consoles are literally flooded with first-person shooters is no easy task. Many harbor the doubt that F.E.A.R., already painted as a classic, cannot stand out in a panorama so inflated as to include representatives of the genre in the launch of each of the three nextgens. My opinion, rather shared on the surface of the planet to tell the truth, is that it succeeds great and I will try to explain why. Comment F.E.A.R. debuts a second time and for the second time it does not disappoint despite being in direct confrontation with decidedly more advanced titles from a technical point of view. Its strengths are artificial intelligence and calibration of physics and weapons, and they are points that fortunately age more slowly than the purely graphic factor and which generate a damn intriguing mix of frenetic action and tactics. If you don't disdain the genre and haven't tried it on PC, it's a highly recommended purchase. Pros: Extremely convincing artificial intelligence ~Dense~ gameplay Cons: Not too imaginative Aesthetically starting to show the first signs of old age Goals 360 Getting the bulk of points in F.E.A.R. it's pretty hard. In fact, while it is quite easy to accomplish the usual micro-objectives related to particular performances with a particular weapon or by completing the campaign acts, everything becomes more complicated when it comes to completing the campaign without dying or using special abilities and above all completing it on difficulty extreme. 225 points are linked to multiplayer and are obtained by capturing 50 flags, playing 1000 (!!!) ranked matches, or by winning a match for each mode. First Encounter The first time I played fear, bullying between two lockers without paying too much attention to my movements, I felt something move behind me, I turned around and saw nothing. The first thought that popped into my mind was: The usual bogus noise trick set in to generate tension. Yet the explanation didn't convince me much and the atmosphere was serious enough to make me fear that the noise responded to some sudden threat typical of horror titles. The fear of being fooled by my presumption was enough to induce me to turn around a couple of times, until I realized that those noises came from my carelessness. I was just bumping into a couple of cans leaning against a piece of furniture. Here, Fear, getting to the core, can be summed up in its ability to make us feel present in the game world, using a series of ad hoc devices that have little to do with technological innovation. Compared to the PC version bodies and objects seem to have gained weight. Even the ragdoll, the famous mannequin effect that manages body physics, has undergone a marked improvement with a decisive gain in credibility. Of course, the disruptive effect of explosions in rooms full of decidedly spectacular objects and enemies is reduced, at least in part, especially when slow motion is active, but the more realistic behavior of the objects increases that sense of physicality that permeates FEAR and which I have already briefly introduced. Simply put, FEAR has just the right weight. The roar of the shotgun, the kicks in the face, the weapons that throw or nail to the walls are all elements that add depth to the sensations of the game or rather, create them. To play FEAR is to launch yourself guns blazing into a room and throw yourself into a mess of debris, explosions and tossed bodies, and then find yourself silent with a feeling of concrete power.", "date": "2006-11-23", "grade": null}
