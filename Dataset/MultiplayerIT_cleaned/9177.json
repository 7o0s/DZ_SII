In the case of Two Worlds 2: Castle Defense however, it was not necessary to carry out a complicated conversion and adaptation work because the typology of the title already lent itself, intrinsically, to being a perfect tenant of the most famous online store for applications in the world. Ogre you will not have my scalp The excellent plot of the original Two Worlds II (for which we refer to our review), classic but decidedly well narrated, is revisited in this ultra-mobile version by focusing the attention on the battles supported by the army of Gandohar, engaged in the defense of the its emperor in various places of the kingdom of Antaloor. Orcs of all types, undead and mummies, giant scorpions and the most repellent imaginable represent the best of the enemy armies, to be faced in special sections located on the main game map. The peculiar feature that immediately makes Two Words II: Castle Defense a particular tower defense is the obligation to arrange the various defense units only in pre-established points of the game arena, located in strategic but not always optimal areas; indicated by circles on the ground, the troop generation points can be of the normal type if colored blue or enhanced if red, capable of increasing the statistics of the fighter thus created by 50%. In addition to the emperor (much stronger than his soldiers), the selectable troops in his defense are the swordsman, ideal for melee with medium or small enemies, the archer, useful for precise attacks from a distance, and the heavy knight, robust and violent even against more important opponents. To these are added three important ~metaphysical~ support elements, namely the indispensable Priest with healing abilities of allies, the Necromancer who curses enemies slowing them down and finally the powerful Fire Mage, whose incandescent balls produce enormous damage to enemies within its reach. The human and magical militias obviously have the possibility of being upgraded by spending the gold accumulated in battle: in fact, each kill increases the hoard dedicated to upgrades, thus allowing to increase both the health points of the various fighters and the damage inflicted; in the case of the emperor then, against a disproportionate amount of gold required to bring him to the maximum level, the result is a formidable fighter with 68,000 hit points, truly almost invincible. A tap on a single warrior (even if engaged in battle) will open the management menu, from which it is possible to choose whether to heal health, teleport him to another regeneration point, hide him from view and then throw him back into battle when needed, exchange him place with another soldier or sell him for 75% of his summon value; available to the player there are also three magical attacks to hurl against enemies if you find yourself surrounded or in particular difficulty, free in terms of resources but subject to a recharge time after each use. The campaign is therefore quite long and well structured, a pity for the impossibility of resuming a game from where it left off in case of closing the application (from the multitasking bar); in this way one of the reasons for the success of the ludic Apps is lost, that is the possibility of playing them, suspending them and resuming them as many times as you want without paying attention to saves or other similar ~boring~ things for hardcore players. Good news also comes from the technical front, where Two Worlds II: Castle Defense shows off its best, thanks to real-time shadows, high-resolution textures and fully three-dimensional models of the troops, rich in detail; the audio sector is also excellent, with the remastered version of the original soundtrack. Finally, the double Social support for the ~old~ Open Feint and Game Center is positive, in order to embrace as many people as possible.
