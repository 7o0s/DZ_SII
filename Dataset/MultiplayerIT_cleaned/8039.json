You insert a coin, turn the metal knob two or three times and pick up the toy which, more often than not, is not the one you wanted. In short, a real package, but in the meantime the token is gone and the desire to insert another one to get a second chance is getting stronger. Recently landed on the App Store among the thousand farts of fans, Final Fantasy: All the Bravest is without too many words a terrible attempt to disguise this money-pin mechanism within a tribute to the history of its franchise. A sneaky and ingenious concept, mind you, but completely disrespectful towards the mammoth community of enthusiasts who are always hopeful that the historic series can return to its former glory. Those who have already peeked at the vote on the side will wonder if this microscopic mobile game is actually worth such a low rating. A tribute from the Moogle Final Fantasy: All the Bravest was presented as an engaging journey through most of the historical chapters of the saga, starting from the first Squaresoft works for NES and Super Nintendo up to the more recent Final Fantasy XII and XIII, obviously passing through the much beloved seventh chapter. All the heroes of the franchise thus unite to fight a battle against an army made up of the most iconic enemies, but if the premises can recall the excellent Dissidia Final Fantasy for PSP, the final result is nothing further away. Made with retro graphics and nostalgic music, the game is nothing less than a series of battles one after another, where your party consists of a horde of ten, twenty, thirty, or more heroes. In addition to the simple number of characters deployed at the same time, the particularity of All the Bravest lies in the combat system. Forget the classic turn-based structure in which to decide, for each party member, what action to perform, what object to use, who to attack or who to heal; here all the user is asked is to rub his finger on the various characters, activating them and making them automatically attack a random enemy, after which he has to wait a short period of time before the attacker becomes active again. Every three hours a Fever mode can be activated, thanks to which, for a few seconds, it is possible to cancel any loading time and consequently cause more damage in less time. That's it: you obsessively scrub the screen until all opponents on screen have been defeated, hear the usual victory fanfare, and then move on to the next battle. The fact that it is impossible to lose and that the party regenerates over time, means that All the Bravest has no depth or a minimum of strategy, and in the end everything turns into a sort of Fruit Ninja played in the dark: right to make the idea better, we were able to eliminate the last boss without even looking at the smartphone screen, while we did something else altogether. You will have understood by now that player interaction is completely useless, to the point that it would have been better if the developers had automated everything: the result would have been identical, but at least we would have saved ourselves a sore thumb. The work done by Tatsuya Kando and Kyohei Suzuki does not just trivialize the typical structure of Final Fantasy, and certainly goes far beyond what would have been a parody of the franchise. The mechanics of All the Bravest exploit the player into believing that they have an active role in the game experience, when in reality this is absolutely not the case. But if only for this, Square-Enix's new mobile game would have been just the latest in an increasingly frequent series of slips made by the Japanese company in the mobile market, an insignificant title and a grease stain on the shirt of one of the sagas most loved by JRPG fans. Instead, one of the most critical elements of the entire game is represented by the monetization system through micropayments, which in All the Bravest scrapes the bottom in an all too brazen way. For those who expect to be able to take on the role of Cloud, Squall and Terra immediately after purchasing the game we have bad news: the basic version of All the Bravest allows you to unlock only the classic classes of the job system, from Warrior to Black Mage , from Berserker to Dragoon. The only way to enter the historical protagonists of the various chapters is to pay 89 cents and cross your fingers: it would be too fair, too sensible, to be able to at least have the freedom to choose your favorite character, but in this case the unlocked hero is chosen in mcompletely random way. And let's go back to the speech made at the beginning: hoping to unlock Lightning or Tifa and find yourself with a ridiculous Imp or a Pig leaves a bad taste in the mouth, to put it in a sweetened way. The microtransaction system isn't limited to characters, nor special hourglasses to give you an advantage in battle; in order to access the three most interesting worlds (Midgar, Zanarkand and Archylte Steppe), and therefore to be able to challenge the most memorable bosses of the franchise, it is necessary to purchase them individually at a cost that is almost equal to that of the complete game. The result? To be able to access all the contents, tens and tens of euros are spent, but while in other games such as Theatrhythm Final Fantasy one has at least the possibility of choosing the contents to buy, here they are completely ~surprise~. And what a surprise.", "date": "2013-01-25", "grade": "2.0"}
