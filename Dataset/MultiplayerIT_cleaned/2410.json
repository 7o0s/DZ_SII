{"name": "Breath of Fire IV", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/breath-of-fire-iv.html", "text": "It's always Breath Of Fire! As can be seen from the opening of the FMV (anime style), ~BoF4~ wants to belong to that type of games that tend more to the fantasy genre, and this can also be understood from other elements such as the people you meet, the means of transport , usable spells, etc. But on the other hand, the beauty of video games is precisely this, namely the fact that you can ~escape~ from reality. The game system remains unchanged from previous versions. The actions that can be performed are not very many and are limited to walking, running and interacting with people, objects, etc. All ordinary for an rpg. Obviously in battle the fights take place in turns, and it is also possible to combine attacks of several characters to inflict greater damage on the enemy. This possibility further deepens the playability as it is up to the player to decide the best attack strategies among the multitude of available combinations. The gameplay also benefits from the possibility of the protagonist Ryu to take the form of a monster capable of using various spells and Summon (the invocations of superior creatures). While exploring the map, this one with a predetermined destination, question or exclamation marks often appear where, by pressing the X key on the pad, you access some areas intended for the collection of some power-ups or for the enhancement of the characters which increase the experience level through random combat. Fundamental to the continuation of the game is the dialogue with the men of the various villages, always ready to give useful suggestions or to sell some useful object or weapon. As for subgames, such as e.g. fishing, a separate discussion must be made. In fact, it could be considered a game in its own right both for the structure and for the care with which it was made. Before trying your hand at the best Sampei it will be necessary to obtain a rod and bait from some shopkeeper, existing in different species. You will see how gratifying it is to catch some nice fish to roast at the end of the evening... It has also been shown that there are so many people who, like myself, could spend entire days just dedicating themselves to the fishing contained in ~BoF4~. That's why no one leaves the house anymore. A great adventure In addition to being very fun, playable and flowing, the Capcom product is also remarkably long-lived. This aspect is justified not only by the amount of time needed to complete everything (about forty hours), but also by the magnetism with which the title manages to attract the gamer. Anyone who is a fan of this type of game will have many difficulties when he has to turn off his PSone after starting a game session at ~BoF4~. That's why so many people wear glasses These people will also find it difficult to go and feed themselves. This explains many nutrition problems... The fact is that the programmers of Captive Communications have managed to recreate the same magical atmospheres of the first three episodes of the saga and to maintain that feeling that so many people have enthralled. All this also varying some elements, but only at the level of the story and slightly on the gameplay. The same goes for the sound, which is truly captivating. The music that will accompany our virtual ego are very refined and tasty, and the fact that they are well suited to the atmospheres that permeate the entire adventure only further increases the goodness of this videogame product. Even the sound effects are well thought out even if it is sad to say that the speech is silent and moreover in English. We must therefore be content with the usual subtitles in balloons. This could be justified by the low capacity of the CD support, but it is only a hypothesis. Old school graphics We are in the Sony galaxy, planet PSone. What can you expect graphically from a now obsolete Psx? Certainly not a high resolution or the presence of anti-aliasing. However, the Capcom title defends itself very well as it has no significant graphic defects. The backdrops are entirely in 3d and for this you have the option to change the view at any time, except when you are on the map. The characters, even if two-dimensional, have a characterization worthy of the best self-respecting fantasy cartoon. It won't take long to warm to the mysterious Ryu. The resolution stands at good levels but what immediately catches the eye are the beautiful graphic effects that come into play when certain spells or special powers are invoked. The colors are masterfulnts used and conform to the comic style of the game. On a cosmetic level ~BoF4~ behaves very well, doing its job very well, always keeping in mind that we are on the planet Pso now at sunset. If the previous chapters have fascinated you and you love old school RPGs, Breath of Fire IV is the one for you. Besides, it's not that many good titles are still coming out for Psone, but this one from Capcom is an exception. A nice exception. Thoroughly recommended. Pro: It's always Breath of Fire! Colorful graphics Very long-lived Cons: Forget it if you are not a fan of the genre The long road to peace Many months have passed since our Capcom, mother of the various Street Fighter and Final Fight, made us enjoy the previous episodes of the Breath of Fire saga. History seems to repeat itself and a new old school Rpg is ready to give days of fun. The structural elements of the past remain unchanged (including the legendary subgames) in a game that fans of the genre just can't pass up. The narrative methodology, even if linear, is multifaceted, and the plot is built as you progress in this mystical adventure. Purpose of the game? Restore peace between two peoples who, after years of long battles, sign an armistice. The calm after the storm seems to have arrived and instead Princess Elena, who is part of one of the factions, is mysteriously kidnapped. It will be the younger sister Nina to investigate what happened and set off on a long journey in search of many answers. During his journey he will meet a boy of unknown origin: Ryu. These, being also endowed with strange powers that allow him to transform into a man-dragon, will accompany little Nina in her recovery action. From this point it will be up to the player to start this long adventure.", "date": "2001-08-30", "grade": null}
