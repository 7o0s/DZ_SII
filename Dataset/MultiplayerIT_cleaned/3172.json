It is no coincidence that Gearbox decides to launch the second DLC a few days after its release on the Valve platform. In this review of Borderlands 3: Guns, Love and Tentacles we try to sum up these first six months of the US team's latest looter shooter. I pronounce you husband and wife Forever abandoned the ghost of Handsome Jack, this second add-on tends to profoundly different atmospheres, almost horror and disturbing, but always maintaining the irreverent style of Gearbox. Arms, love and tentacles starts from its own subtitle, the need to move to a new planet with an unpronounceable name to celebrate the wedding between Hammerlock and Wainwright. Once the destination is set on the galactic map, you find yourself on an icy and inhospitable planet, which appears good for everything except the celebration of a wedding. However, the Borderlands universe is so crazy that it can justify anything and it takes just a few minutes to (re) get to know Gaige, a former crypt hunter and now a full-time wedding planner. Anyone who has played the second chapter will know the crazy girl accompanied by her robot Deathtrap, unable to regain her sanity but certainly taken heart and soul in making the best marriage possible. After meeting the newlyweds inside the Lodge, we soon realize that something is wrong on the planet and that the town that serves as the location for the wedding is somehow the victim of some curse. The inhabitants all exhibit strange behaviors and their faces don't exactly seem full of life. Trying to investigate the matter we will learn about an ancient ritual perpetrated by a couple of new bad guys, who will give life to the entire narrative arc of this DLC. An average of five hours are required to complete the campaign alone, which vary drastically based on the chosen difficulty and how much you intend to explore the new maps. Given the particularly Lovecraft-inspired atmosphere, this is certainly a less colorful DLC than the previous one, but which can count on better narration and the right rhythms, avoiding that sensation of acceleration that had gripped the final stages of Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot. From the point of view of the characters and situations, we are quite certain that the only assumption from which this expansion takes its cue is sufficient to push fans to go hunting, if only for the affection that the unlikely love story has generated in players during the base game campaign. If we were to look for a lack from a narrative point of view, this could be found in the very scarce presence of Claptrap and his situations bordering on the ridiculous, but which are well balanced by the madness of Gaige and that of the inhabitants of the planet. Unfortunately, the villains leave the time they find and their narrative background proves to be useful almost exclusively to show off the new faction of enemies present, however excellently made. Still tons of weapons, but with tentacles As we said previously, the DLC is strongly inspired by the atmospheres of Lovecraft and by that imaginary that makes anguish, madness and psychological grayness its best weapons. In the game this translates into dark shades, a series of maps full of tentacles (as the title suggests) and a cult that makes black magic and necromancy its main characteristics. The extension of the new planet is respectable, with a good number of maps (we do not reveal the precise quantity) and a more than considerable surface for each of them. What is most surprising in this sense is the quality of the individual areas, within which there is also a lot of play in terms of verticality and environmental variety. It is true that this creates a strange feeling of alienation when you go from the sun and the prevailing ice of the landing to the dark and stormy town where the wedding venue is located, but over time you get used to it and begin to love the atmospheres disinclined to Borderlands but masterfully adapted. In addition to some creatures belonging to the local fauna, it is obviously the new faction of cultists who are the masters. A series of shady hooded figures who enjoy playing with black magic and with the awakening of their dead companions. They are a class of adversaries that have almost always convinced us, and they vary from small sneaky beings to brutishequipped with a shield. During the campaign you will also have the opportunity to clash with some new bosses, including a figure dear to folk legends. Too bad in this case for a damned subdued final boss, a feature that unfortunately has marked this Borderlands 3 since its base campaign. We wouldn't have minded a little more variety regarding secondary tasks. Some always reach extraordinary peaks, but overall you no longer breathe the freshness and writing noted last September. This detail combined with a total longevity of around ten hours makes the fifteen euros of spending perhaps not very sustainable. The steam version We also take the opportunity to add a few words on the fly about the Steam version. We got to play the new DLC on the Valve platform, also managing to manually move our saves and resume the progress already achieved. Unfortunately you will not be able to carry the additional content already purchased, forcing you to repurchase both the base game and the related expansions. In our case this has turned into the impossibility of using a series of weapons obtained in the first DLC. You will be able to collect, sell and collect them, but it will not be possible to equip them. Curious that even during this second expansion we continued to receive some of these weapons sporadically. Nothing to say on the optimization front: the game is exactly the same that we have learned to appreciate in the past months and, since the cooperative is managed via the internal SHIFT platform, crossplay between the Epic client and Steam is present without any problem.", "date": "2020-03-26", "grade": "8.0"}
