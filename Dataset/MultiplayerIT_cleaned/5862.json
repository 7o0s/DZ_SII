A result certainly due to the charm of the Games Workshop franchise and to the choice of basing the game on the Imperial Knights, huge mechs controlled by a human mind that has given up its mortal body to serve the Imperium; but also and above all to the use of the 3D Touch function in a playful context, which as we know detects the intensity of pressure on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus screen to open up a whole series of new possibilities. In the case of the Pixel Toys title, this feature has been exploited to add facets to the shooter mechanics: to open fire with the main weapon, just touch the screen and thus determine the trajectory of the bursts, while a greater pressure will allow you to increase the zoom on targets for higher shooting accuracy. Finally, an even more marked pressure will activate the secondary weapon, which can consist of a quick barrage of bullets, devastating cannon fire or automatic shots capable of decimating even large gatherings of Orks. In short, it is a very interesting feature, which in fact streamlines the interface and allows you to perform multiple actions without having to act on different buttons and icons. Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade is a solid, spectacular and fun on-rails shooter The touch of the Freeblade The technical aspect in Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade is predominant, beyond the 3D Touch: the game developers have been able to make the most of the technical capabilities of the new Apple terminals to deliver us a visually impactful, fluid and detailed experience, which it uses defined textures and excellent reflection effects on the surfaces, but which is particularly enriched by a precise direction, which despite the brevity of the missions always manages to choose the right times to introduce this or that event. Freeblade is a game that has something to tell, and during the forty missions that make up the single player campaign, between main and secondary levels, it does this job very well. Although the gameplay is systematically limited by belonging to the rail shooter genre, there is a fair variety in the missions, the setup of the Imperial Knight is free in terms of equipment, so as to experiment with different weapons and accessories, and there are many possibilities to customize its appearance. The structure of the game uses a system with the traditional stars to certify the goodness of our performances, allowing us through their collection to gradually unlock all ten chapters that make up the story mode, supported by extra challenges, events and patrols useful for the possible grinding. The gunplay is pleasant, and the richness of the arsenal, together with a rather rich loot and crafting system, draw the picture of a solid, fun and even challenging product. It's a shame that hand-to-hand combat, spectacular as it is, boils down to pressing a single gauge at the right time and doesn't range into something else instead. That said, what strongly characterizes the offer of Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade is also its belonging to the typology of freemium productions, with all that this model implies on the balance of difficulty and on any limitations on the use of the game. In this case the factors to pay attention to are many, and after the fourth chapter it is actually more complicated to move forward. However, the aforementioned presence of extra missions, the many possibilities to collect free credits and items by watching short trailers, but also the all in all reduced times for crafting (which can be completed immediately using a little gold, as per tradition) make the Pixel Toys title enjoyable without too many problems and without particular sacrifices, positioning itself from this point of view in the average of the most famous freemiums. Moreover, the strengths of the game are many and such as to make us turn a blind eye to these elements, which will continue to rage until the market is ready to embrace more mature business models.", "date": "2015-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
