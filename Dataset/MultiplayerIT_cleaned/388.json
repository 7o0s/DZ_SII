If you are over 20 it will be impossible not to feel a leap of heart in front of the historic introduction, that city brawl, the camera lazily showing a skyscraper of dizzying height, the hypnotic tune. It's Street Fighter 2, it's history, and it's on our TV. But new exquisitely consular menus remind us that this is also the present, and is expressed in the presence of special options for adapting the old 4:3 format to the new LCD displays, with very encouraging results. Full Live support and leaderboards remind us of Capcom's invitation to relive the past from a new perspective. And the protagonists of the myth are all still there: Dhalsim, Ken, Honda, ready with their funny, cartoony avatars to rekindle millions of stories in millions of hearts. It is the appointment with a former historian, so familiar and unpredictable, capable of showing you how a thousand adventures are not enough to forget her. And that's exactly what happens during the first city brawls of the game, savoring the arcane mechanisms of the gameplay with unexpected amazement towards any, never discovered, possibilities. SF2 comes from an old school, austere, funny, magnetic. The school of a playful craftsmanship unknown in these modern times, a work of finishing, of scrupulously orchestrated polishing, ahead of its time, sharp as a razor in playing between indulgent nostalgia and unprecedented criticism. And it is this perfect balance that represents the best weapon of this revival, to avoid the feeling of a bland attempt to flesh out the Live Arcade offer. The truth is that SF2HF hardly shows its age. Although undoubtedly backward compared to the last chapters, Zero or Alpha, it remains a masterpiece that still leaves very little to be desired, and shows just as little side to the new generation fighting games. And again, it's a testament to how much the bitmap still has so much to say, how electronic entertainment isn't an exclusive affair of polygons and bump mapping. The perfect artistic direction which, today as in the past, offers characters with an irresistible oriental cartoonishness, as charismatic as the scenarios that host them, second only to the timeless tunes that embellish them. But it's arcade perfect! Each Haduken and Sonic Boom found are not simple probes in the memory to find the key combinations suitable for executing them, but small footprints on the beach of the experience of every self-respecting gamer, evidence of the countless coins consumed in cabinets of every shape and taste. Reliving this milestone today, in a system as strongly contextualized as Microsoft's, releases such an emotional force that no emulator will ever be able to match. Force that unfolds on two distinct levels: on the one hand the uncontainable flow of memories, which refers to the unacceptable compromises on the Commodore 64, to the extraordinary fidelity of the Snes version, to the never hidden dream of having the perfect arcade in your hands. On the other hand, the new online identity, a dimension where these memories can be related to those of the world out there. It is the appointment with a former historian, so familiar and unpredictable, capable of showing you how a thousand adventures are not enough to forget her. But it's arcade perfect! Capcom's choice in the Hyper Fighting version was significant, a demonic remix of the Champion's Edition, bastardized beyond measure and accelerated, so much so that upon its release many doubted its legitimacy. But it's the best one, today, to elevate Live Arcade to new heights, heights populated by an ever-increasing number of nostalgic and rabid hardcore gamers. Leaving a small window to the new generations, who will have the opportunity to discover a classic. And if you please. Of course, a graphic restyling would have been desirable, but abandoning yourself to memories is easy and painless, especially when you find a visual sector so little permeable to today's glories. That magnificent parallax of the floor still amazes today, and the infinite intercalations in the animation of the fighters are no less, from the nervous bobbing of a Guile, to the perfect trembling of the muscles of a Blanka, to the contrast between the femininity and the robustness of a Chun There. And that's all, locked up in 800 mp. Summer hits It is obviously online that Sf2 offers the strongest emotions, in addition to the canonical versus mode, it is worth mentioning the unprecedented possibility of clashes up to four players, called quarter match. While the first two fight, the others wait their turn as spectators, in order to analyze the technique of the opponents. The avatars ofthe contenders are always in full view on the sides of the screen, while the loser is promptly replaced by another challenger. Inevitable online rankings and meetings functional to the world ranking. Unfortunately it's not all rosy, we encountered some slight lag problems in some matches, which cause slowdowns and delays in the commands. In a nutshell, to run in complete fluency the game requires full bandwidth availability of the players involved, a sign of non-optimized code. Nothing tragic, but in any case it is an inconvenience that we hope Capcom resolves soon. Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting is XBLA's first real killer application, much more than a sterile revival of a seminal masterpiece, but a very tempting opportunity to put fighters from all over the world face to face. Demonstration of how this Microsoft project, far from unrealistic, will pave the way for similar operations, exciting returns to the past in the online conception of the present. The Multiplayer vote doesn't claim to judge a timeless classic, reproduced in total fidelity in your living rooms, a home cabinet, to all intents and purposes, at a very affordable price. The only reservations are in the lack of graphic update, which in any case still looks good today, and which is also effectively presented on the new generation displays. The Live mode is more worrying, afflicted by sporadic lag, linked mostly to the band of players involved, which causes a slight delay in response to commands. Considering the absolutely small workload (it's always a 2D fighting game) we can hope for an optimization of the servers by Capcom, in order to tolerate less generous bandwidths. Regardless of this, it is a title that everyone, passionate and not, should have. Pros: It's the Street Fighter 2 cabinet, in your home Mythical and still unsurpassed today Widescreen and online support Cons: An updated graphic version would have been appreciated, together with the classic one Some lag problems Imagine a cabinet in your room, a cabinet costing 10 euros. A harbinger of 15 years of gaming history. Imagine a very special cabinet that connects with millions of other cabinets around the world. Now stop fantasizing, Capcom makes all this possible today, releasing on the market place an exactly identical version of its historic coin op, with the addition of the coveted Live support. How many hours, days, months, years have you spent perfecting your virtual Ryu? And how much desire to show your skills to the unfortunate person on duty? This time there will be no need to go to smoky bars, invite the company for bloody challenges. The Live bar is always open, and all of your friends are ready to take on the challenge, or you can decide to throw yourself headlong into the net, savoring its galvanizing randomness. The Live Arcade project is now even more substantial, respecting the original intentions, are you ready for the definitive virtual arcade?", "date": "2006-08-10", "grade": null}
