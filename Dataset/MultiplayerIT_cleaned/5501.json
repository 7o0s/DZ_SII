The two protagonists, the shrewd Dawn and the bewitching Higgs, can be carried forward in the single player campaign at the same time, thanks to the presence of two different save slots. Choosing one or the other produces differences in terms of repertoire and equipment, but the missions remain the same and take place over three fairly full-bodied chapters, with the addition of some extra challenges that can be accessed from a some point on. The first stages of the game recall the traditional tutorials, where you learn the basic commands and then, gradually, the use of objects, inventory management and weapon crafting; after which you can devote yourself to completing the stages, characterized by small locations, practically ~rooms~ that are cleaned from time to time by increasingly stronger, more numerous and more resistant enemies. To complete this task we will be able to count on a set of touch controls that are quite precise, albeit without some tricks, such as a virtual stick that dynamically repositions itself. Never Gone is a fascinating and challenging side-scrolling beat 'em up with strong RPG elements The never gone However, the absolute protagonist of Never Gone is the combat system developed by Hippie Games, a mix of rather spectacular and effective combos, which are performed simply by pressing the attack button or by combining it together with the directions of the virtual d-pad, with also the possibility of performing a running attack, an instant counterattack after a parry and a special that is charged by filling a special indicator. Both the characters we control and the bosses and mini-bosses have a resistance bar available, which we will have to be able to ~break~ with our shots in order to open the enemy defense and inflict damage of a certain importance. This approach gives rise to challenging and exciting duels, especially starting from the end of the second chapter, with non-trivial behavior patterns, albeit spoiled by the enemies' tendency to ~hide~ off the screen, forcing us to wait for them. Precisely at this stage, however, the game's attempt to monetize is also evident, leading us to buy crystals useful to immediately return to life in case of defeat and thus have a few more chances to defeat the toughest opponents. It is unlikely that it is a simple sensation, given that the panorama of freemium productions is full of such solutions, which see a sudden increase in the challenge and a lower incidence of hits than enemies. Of course, it is undisputed that you can complete the game by paying only 99 cents of the purchase price on the App Store (originally they were 2.99), but it becomes practically mandatory to do a lot of grinding to get the coins needed to buy equipment decent and more powerful weapons, without which getting the better of certain bosses becomes almost impossible. The visual characterization of Never Gone, another ace up Hippie Games' sleeve, presents a truly appreciable noir style, supported by a very good soundtrack, but the work done on the animations only hits half: the basic movements are very fluid and pleasant to see, but as soon as you start fighting the frames are drastically reduced, also leading to quite chaotic situations (and some uncertainty of the commands) when there are many opponents.", "date": "2016-05-18", "grade": "7.8"}
