{"name": "Marvel Nemesis: L'Ascesa degli Esseri Imperfetti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvel-nemesis-lascesa-degli-esseri-imperfetti.html", "text": "The Imperfects At Marvel they have the ~Inhumans~, the ~Defenders~, the ~Invaders~, the ~Avengers~... let's say that the ~Imperfects~ were missing, and this video game makes up for it. Written by the exceptional Mark Millar, the story of Marvel Nemesis is not only apocalyptic (whereas usually this kind of situation compensates for the lack of ideas), but it is also well researched and of great depth. While the Thing strolls quietly near the Brooklyn Bridge, a terrible and exceptional event occurs: hundreds of small space ships emerge from the sky, which immediately begin to sow death and destruction over the city of New York. As the practical man he's always been, Ben Grimm begins dispensing blows left and right to demonstrate typical Yankee hospitality to the aliens. But the general picture is much broader and more worrying: the news broadcasts images documenting the defeat of the Hulk, Captain America and the Punisher. The invaders strike hard and the problem is that they are not the biggest problem, but the so-called ~Imperfects~. It is a group of superhumans further enhanced by alien technology and gathered by Van Roekel, an individual with mysterious origins, whose task is to put together a team of soldiers with exceptional abilities, it is not known for what purpose. The ~Imperfects~ are so called because they are experiments that are not perfectly successful, whereas the lethal Paragon instead represents perfection in the form of a warrior. With captivating storytelling and goosebumps-inducing presentation, Marvel Nemesis is sure to appeal to Marvel Comics fans ~no matter what.~ The game To shed light on this story and free the city from the invasion, the Thing (here resembling its film version more than that of the comics) will have to coordinate its work with various other characters belonging to the Marvel Universe: the Human Torch, Devil, Spider-Man, Elektra, Venom, Magneto, Iron Man, Wolverine and Storm. And this is the mechanics of Marvel Nemesis: the player, already after the first stage, is given the opportunity to choose his own character among those available up to now, and face the missions assigned to each of them or make ~alternative~ choices, in a structure that in practice boasts of possible crossroads and that occasionally will also put you on the side of the ~bad guys~, in command of one of the Imperfects or a superhero psychically controlled by alien devices. As you progress through the game, you unlock characters and extras. The former are used in the encounter mode, while the extras are represented by thematic cards and comics in an electronic version (in this case a story of the Fantastic Four and one of the X-Men, both however in the ~Ultimate~ version). Once all the missions have been completed, perhaps twice to access all the possible situations determined by the ~crossroads~, what remains of Marvel Nemesis is the versus mode, in which it is possible to choose one of the eighteen available characters (between superheroes and Imperfects ), in the normal or ~controlled~ version, and face another within one of the seven scenarios that can be seen in the story mode. It is possible to play in two or access the online multiplayer, which in this case appears well done and represents a welcome bonus. The substance With captivating storytelling and goosebumps-inducing presentation, Marvel Nemesis is sure to appeal to Marvel Comics fans ~no matter what.~ The reality of the facts, however, is that the game developed by Nihilistic Software, in essence, does not live up to the expectations that are created in the early stages. After what was seen in Shadow of Rome, Capcom would have done a really good job with Marvel Nemesis, giving depth and ~sense of impact~ to the fights, which instead Nihilistic made ~slippery~ and not very incisive, perhaps to respect EA's style . The characters have an overall sufficient range of attack maneuvers, which for the needs of the story mode are always activated with the same key combination. This, however, represents a weak point in the versus mode, given that there is no substantial difference between the various Wolverines, the Thing and Iron Man. The number of enemies that appear in the game is discreet, and generally each stage is full of them, with a difficulty that increases as the conclusion of the story approaches. There is also another thing that the stages are full of: interactive objects, of various kinds, which can be used in battles. Very effectively, by the way. And we're not talking about clubs and sticks: depending on the strength of your character, you can lift dumpsters, cars, trucks or huge tanks. And pottear off the net and use beams, lampposts and a whole series of blunt objects as weapons. This is a strong point of the game, which only proves to be counterproductive in the more advanced levels: with explosive drums everywhere, sometimes you risk losing all your energy while bouncing from one detonation to another, all due to a just hit right away. Characters, control system and technical realization As previously written, the characters that the game makes available are eighteen in all, even if the last of them, Dr. Roekel, you can only control in versus mode. Each one has different characteristics and powers, but they are always managed in the same way: one button to attack, one to jump, one to parry and one to grab the opponent. Things change when you press the button to activate the spiritual energy bar (let's call it that), which gives rise to a series of different and more effective maneuvers, even from a distance: Spider-Man shoots web projectiles, Devil throws the stick, Iron Man fires his repulsor beams, etc. etc. There is also a third bar in play, namely that of anger: the more you fight, the more it increases, until it is possible to enter a sort of ~rage mode~ for a certain period of time. Too bad that in this condition there are few advantages: the spiritual energy bar is not affected and therefore you produce numerous special attacks, but you do not become invulnerable to enemy offensives. The graphics engine of the game undoubtedly boasts great power: the characters are really nice to look at and move well, with a fair number of possible actions. The enemies are quite varied and well done, and the locations are no different, with a good level of detail, a myriad of interactable objects and of sufficient size for the development of the action. During the fights, the game takes place in spectacular shots, showing for example the enemies that are thrown into the air by our shots or by an explosion. Too bad that these purely aesthetic ~interludes~ make us momentarily vulnerable to other opponents, a situation that unfortunately ends up happening in the final stages. The technical differences between the PS2, Xbox and GameCube versions are represented by the presence, on the Sony console, of sporadic uncertainties in cases of particular crowding and of a higher quality of textures and effects on Xbox and GameCube. In all cases the cutscenes are of excellent workmanship, especially the first; and the audio commentary turns out to be of good quality, with well-acted speech, functional sound effects and valid music. Comment Let's take it positively: Marvel Nemesis: The Rise of Imperfect Beings has the merit of creating a ~precedent~ for a tie-in with a very interesting plot, as well as an extremely varied and important list of characters. If it had been developed by a team with more confidence in scrolling fighting games (but in the polygonal field the only one that has obtained certain results is Capcom), who had also given more depth to the missions, we would not have had just a beautiful game to look at and with some interesting ideas, primarily the immoderate use of elements of the scenario, but an absolute masterpiece among superhero video games. This was not the case, unfortunately: the title produced by EA does not offer great substance or entertain for a long time, therefore it joins the ~imperfect~ whose origin and deeds it narrates. Pros: Technically valid Stage extremely interactive Interesting story mode and with the presence of crossroads Cons: Lack of thickness Collision detection not always up to par Not very long-lived Anyone who reads Marvel or DC comics knows what a ~crossover~ is: these are stories that abandon the theme of the single character to narrate the encounter (or clash) between different superheroes but who share the same reality of belonging. Very often this kind of production is characterized by its weaknesses rather than the quality of the plot, especially when the crossover involves characters belonging to different publishing houses (such as the recent ~Avengers vs Justice League of America~). In that case the writers are more concerned with maintaining the status quo of a superhero (in this case not to make him look bad with the ~colleagues~) than to use it in the most intelligent way according to the story. With the arrival of the new generation of comics authors, such episodes seem increasingly rare", "date": "2005-10-17", "grade": null}
