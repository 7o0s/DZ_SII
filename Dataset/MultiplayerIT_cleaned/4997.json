This is not the case with the Dangonronpa series developed by Spike Chunsoft, which after having depopulated at home has conquered players from all over the world thanks to the English localization. The great success arrives at the debut on PSP, but the long wave of success has led NIS to publish several versions, including the latest one dedicated to PlayStation 4. Danganronpa 1.2 Reload brings together Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair in a package with decidedly interesting premises, but which on balance was found to be deficient from many points of view. Danganronpa 1.2 Reload brings one of the most successful series to appear on the Sony laptop to PlayStation 4 Serial killings Little refresher for those who are fasting on the Spike Chunsoft series. Danganronpa: Danganronpa rigger Happy Havoc puts us in the role of young Makoto Naegi, a high school student who is incredibly drawn by lot to join the prestigious Hope's Peak Academy, the best school in Japan whose graduates are guaranteed success. What appears to be dumb luck, however, soon turns into a nightmare when Makoto and his fourteen classmates wake up prisoners inside a school completely isolated from the outside world. The young students have unknowingly become the protagonists of a sadistic murderous game directed by a creepy stuffed teddy bear who puts them in front of a simple and cruel rule: kill to survive and leave Hope's Peak Academy or be killed by one of the other students. A series of murders and macabre events are then unleashed which we will have to investigate by exploring the school in search of clues, in the ultimate hope of discovering not only who committed the murders but also hiding behind the demonic teddy bear who directs the orchestra. The story is told very well thanks to very high quality dialogues, unpredictable scenes and very dramatic moments that perfectly manage to convey an overwhelming sense of unease to the player using only a handful of static scenarios and a few lines of dialogue. After all, this is the great strength of Danganronpa, also taken up in the second chapter Goodbye Despair which takes us to a paradisiacal tropical beach in which murders and mysterious events will not take long to occur. We don't go into much detail on this second chapter because for events and characters it is hand in glove with the prequel; however, we can tell you that in terms of gameplay it expands the formula with new mini-games and even more engaging processes, always supported by a very high quality of dialogues and a convoluted plot that has kept us more than once in suspense. The positive aspect of having the first and second chapter enclosed together on the same disc is precisely that of going to eliminate one of the major obstacles for those who picked up Goodbye Despair for the first time: the second chapter of Danganrompa, however complex and engaging is linked to the events told in the previous title, making it impossible for a player who approaches the series for the first time to grasp all its facets. However, with Danganronpa 1.2 Reload you will be able to enjoy the events of the unfortunate young people involved without missing a single detail and risk remaining with unresolved doubts. Playstation 4 trophies Danganronpa 1.2 Reload provides 45 trophies divided between the two chapters included in the collection. To get the 2 gold, 16 silver and 26 bronze trophies, in addition to the inevitable platinum, it will be necessary to spend several hours on the game finishing the whole story, finding every collectible and witnessing every possible ending. Objective not achieved Paradoxically, all the limits of Danganronpa 1.2 Reload emerge precisely from its liaison with PlayStation 4 which, needless to say, is the reason behind the release of this collection. The marriage with Sony's home console brings with it a series of defects, some related to the genre, others to the work lazily done by the developers. In the first case, we are talking about a limit inherent in the genre to which it belongs, made up of many dialogues, a succession of static screens and, more generally, little action on the screen. Of course, the mini-games in the case of Trigger Happy Havoc and the Goodbye Despair processes are excellent at breaking up the monotony of reading, but there is no doubt that such an experience does not find its climax enjoyed on a sofa in front of the TV screen. Despite the efforts of Frorting Danganronpa on PlayStation 4, it only takes a few minutes to understand that the series has already reached its peak, and more precisely on the PlayStation Vita touch screens capable of merging excellent graphics with the possibility of playing it anywhere with bite-sized game sessions and flee. Secondly, but not least, there is the - little - work done by the developers for this port. Basically, in addition to a simple upscaling of the resolution, there have been no changes to the graphics sector. The result is a gaming experience marred by heavily grainy screens that don't do justice to the delightful two-dimensional models of characters and elements that fill the three-dimensional environments. The textures are of very low resolution, an eyesore especially in those situations where a minimum of investigation of the scenarios is required with a consequent zoom in on details of characters or objects. A real pity, because thanks to its extremely particular artistic direction dominated by sharp figures and bright colors, Danganronpa manages today as now to highlight the sinister atmosphere and the homicidal madness that pervades every aspect of the story. Finally, we remind you that Danganronpa 1.2 Reload maintains the same localization of the two previous titles with texts available only in English and Japanese.", "date": "2017-03-14", "grade": "7.5"}
