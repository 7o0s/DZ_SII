You don't need epic intentions to go on an adventure: sometimes all you need is an empty pantry. So it is for Teacup, the protagonist of the homonymous game created by Smarto Club. Here is our review of Teacup, a perfect video game for those who want to relax. Marked on the calendar Teacup with two friends on a boat in a pond We are Teacup, a frog who lives in Little Pond (literally ~pond~). Our adventure doesn't start on just any day: today is the eve of our tea party, where our dear friends - who haven't visited us for a long time - will gather in our cabin in the woods. However, happiness is soon dampened: we have run out of all the ingredients to make tea! There is therefore nothing left to do but go out, face the world and ask for help from the inhabitants of Little Pond. Teacup - the game - is an adventure that cannot be defined in any other way than ~wholesome~, that is, a work that wants to put you in a good mood. There are no real dangers in Little Pond: it's a big little world where everyone is happy, busy, having fun, partying and happily remembering the past. It's a walk in a bucolic and utopian world, literally fairytale, told like a bedtime story you might find in a children's book. Teacup - the protagonist - is a shy, lonely frog who listens and helps others, but tends to stay silent and aloof. During this adventure she will have to expose herself to the world a little more, finding many people known to her that she hasn't seen for a long time, since she usually stays alone in her own home. From dialogue to dialogue we meet friends and neighbors, acquaintances and family friends, who will help and will help us, in our ~quest~ to find the ingredients to make tea. Interaction Teacup features classic mini-games, like a vegetable stand to rearrange However, Teacup is not only a narrative game. In addition to exploring the various areas, all small but full of characters to talk to and objects to observe, we will have to complete a series of very simple mini-games. These are very classic small puzzles: we will have to arrange a series of Tetris-style shapes in a limited space, recompose an image by moving various pieces, hit a series of targets in a sort of rose water shooter minigame, complete some Quick Time Event, find a list of objects in the midst of various junk as in a classic HOG, solve a classic puzzle in which you have to place the gears in the correct order to restart a machine, and so on. As you can see, these are very classic ideas and it is perhaps the biggest limitation of Teacup. The gameplay is minimal - which will turn away a lot of players - but it's a clear and stated design choice: you can't fault the game for that. However, it is a pity that in playful terms there is never a particular, intriguing idea: simplicity and originality can absolutely go hand in hand, as Wandersong and Chicory: A Colorful Tale teach us. The Teacup Ingredient Book Teacup is a title with very different production values (three developers, in their first work) compared to the two works just mentioned, mind you, and it is also easy to understand from the longevity. The whole adventure took us 90 minutes and, given the linearity and the total lack of secondary objectives to complete, we believe that everyone will more or less settle on this minutation. In our opinion, this is the correct duration: even just twenty minutes more would have risked making the journey in Little Pond too slow. The pace, on the other hand, is high enough to accompany the player to the end without tiring or pushing him away, even in a single session. An illustrated book Little Pond party, in Teacup Teacup's big selling point is its graphic style. The game is a large interactive picture book. The world of Little Pond, which is divided into woods, ponds and a festive town, is a feast for the eyes. Each scene is cheerful, full of color and characters. The latter are anthropomorphic animals of various types, always different and with their own style of clothing and their own personality. Most are just small extras that we will interact with once and set aside, but together they form a believable community, which is a pleasure to be new to. The sound also accompanies each section effectively, even if the work completely lacks an options menu, so it is not possible to adjust the settings. We close by pointing out that the Italian translation for the game texts is missing. Teacup is available in English and anyone who knows a minimum of the Albion languagehe should have no problem enjoying the opera. Unlike usual, however, we consider the lack of Italian to be a more serious ~problem~. Teacup is a perfect game to play with the little ones but the lack of a translation could make the experience inaccessible to most.", "date": "2021-10-03", "grade": "7.5"}
