{"name": "R-Type Final 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/r-type-final-2-recensione.html", "text": "The problem with games like R-Type Final 2 is that they always offer a double interpretation, very trivial between us, so anyone can afford to take a position without much effort. On the one hand there is the observation that these are classic titles, which have their roots in forgotten eras of videogames, and which therefore can make many modern players turn up their noses; on the other there is an unbridled love for everything that allows you to reject the present and celebrate a past that will never come back, but which for many is an unavoidable ghost. The judgment expressed by the R-Type Final 2 review therefore becomes a kind of search for the perfect balance between the parts, which constantly tries to justify itself. On our own we have tried to think of Granzella's title in relation to the public it is aimed at, not to a generalist who, in all probability, has no interest in the R-Type and everything that revolves around it. Playroom smell R-Type Final 2: artwork R-Type is a name that smells like the 80s. It's the gambling den where you went to spend your snack money before going to school; hours spent playing and watching others play to see if anyone could tame that cursed giant third-level spaceship, while all around the smoke suffocated the little air of the small room where the dumpster was located. R-Type on paper was a simple horizontal scrolling shooter like Gradius or Darius were, but it had a completely different way from its competitors to manage power-ups and, above all, such a marked visual style that it did not leave one indifferent. When Dobkeratops appeared at the end of the first level you couldn't help but gasp because you've simply never seen anything like it. At Irem, the original development studio, they worked wonders. The other bosses of the eight levels that made up the game won't have the same impact and will never become as iconic (also because they were very difficult to reach and few saw them), but it doesn't matter. R-Type greatly influenced the genre, inspiring a multitude of clones, often even shameless (Katakis and Pulstar, just to name a couple) and giving birth to a series that fortunately we can still talk about today, despite the years that elapsed between the publication of R-Type Final and R-Type Final 2. Game mechanics One of the end-of-level bosses At this point it is worth remembering that R-Type Final 2 was born thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign (actually more than one, but let's not quibble), in which the developers actually promised what they then achieved: a real party for fans of the previous chapters. In this sense, their game could not have been different from what it is, precisely because it was born with the intention of reviving a certain way of playing, rather than evolving it, revolutionizing it or making it attractive for an audience that would not consider it a regardless. R-Type Final 2 is, in this sense, exactly as it should be. The first level is a destroyed space factory where there are still signs of Bydo activity (the alien creatures that have made our lives hell since the first episode). Before setting off on a mission there is a short cut-scene, which you can easily skip, then you immediately start shooting enemy waves, collecting power-ups which, as tradition has it, become pods that attach to the front or back of the selected spaceship and which can be managed during the game by changing its position. Depending on the color of the upgrade you get different weapons, which in turn vary according to the spaceship. Between bouncing beams, circular energy beams, lateral flames, laser bullets and so on, fans of the series will find themselves at home. Naturally, the Beam is not missing, that is the attack loaded with two degrees of power, which usually allows you to quickly destroy even the toughest enemies. The ability to change spaceship between levels (or after dying), adds a touch of strategy to the whole, also encouraging the player to thoroughly study the different means at his disposal (initially only three, but others quickly unlock) to figure out which ones are best in certain situations. Difficulty Consider that R-Type Final 2 is anything but easy. Indeed, to be honest, it is really hard. At the beginning of each game it is possible to choose the level of difficulty to play one of the two courses available (the levels of R-Type Final 2 or a DLC which is nothing more than a celebratory course of R-Type with a couple of truly toast). There are five of them and one would think that things are starting to get donedifficult from the third onwards. In reality, already the second level of difficulty, defined as ~for children~, is capable of literally spitting blood. Imagine the others. We specify that ours does not want to be a complaint: R-Type was very difficult and the sequels were no less, so we are perfectly in the tradition. By playing you learn, one might say, but you also unlock new content, such as the ability to replay individual levels to improve your score or new spaceships. You also get money to spend on cosmetic items (there are no microtransactions, don't worry), to decorate the spaceships and the pilot. Nintendo Switch version Be careful, because the Nintendo Switch version has a few more problems than the others in terms of bugs and stability. It's not completely unplayable, but at the time of writing this review it hasn't received a final patch yet. Surely it will be updated soon, but you make your own assessments. Artistic direction Some levels are nice to look at, others just not The weakest side of Granzella's classic shooter is certainly the artistic one, starting from the music, which is without infamy and without praise, reaching the real levels, often less characterized than one could expect from a game that bears the name of R-Type and also full of ugly 3D objects, including some enemies, which make some passages really insignificant. It must be said that things improve in the advanced levels, those that paradoxically players will see less, but something more could be done, especially with the bosses. The first four bosses of the R-Type Final 2 levels are really bad: a frozen version of Dobkeratops (playing the normal version will also unlock), a kind of room full of small tentacles spawned by two strange flying devices, the heart of a giant spaceship (which, however, we will never have the pleasure of seeing in its entirety) and a kind of chandelier. In later levels things get better. Especially the final bosses (the game has three different endings) are really successful. Of course the problem is getting there unscathed. Be careful because we are not saying that R-Type Final 2 is bad to look at in general, but only that some elements let us glimpse its production limits. For the rest, the gameplay is what fans of the genre can't do without and will surely love, made with great skill by the development team, who know it better than anyone else. It will probably be the last R-Type... let's hope not, but if so at least the series would have ended with a bang.", "date": "2021-05-04", "grade": "8.5"}
