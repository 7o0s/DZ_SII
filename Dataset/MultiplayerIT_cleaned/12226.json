{"name": "Pirati dei sette mari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pirati-dei-sette-mari.html", "text": "In fact, thanks to the film with the excellent Jonny Depp, the transalpine house was able to enjoy an enormous indirect and above all free advertising boost for the launch of this ~Pirates of the Seven Seas~. But beyond the astuteness of the marketing department, Gameloft must be given due credit for having packaged an overall product of undoubtedly good quality. Let's start from an assumption, which also represents the major limitation and defect of the game in question: Pirates of the Seven Seas was built on the mold of other similar products published by Gameloft, such as Splinter Cell and above all Prince of Persia. It is in fact a two-dimensional action/platform, in which you are called to take control of a pirate within levels full of enemies and obstacles to overcome. All this through spectacular jumps, wall runs, hand-to-hand combat with white weapons and so on. A decidedly marked and evident lack of originality, even more so for those who have already had the opportunity to buy titles from the French software house based on the same engine. It's certainly true that a minimum of variation on the theme is provided by the surfing levels (!?), in which our hero will find himself riding the waves collecting coins and avoiding zombies, but the substance doesn't change in the end. As far as the control system is concerned, like the aforementioned previous titles, it is extremely well studied, managing to circumvent the limits of mobile phone keyboards in a convincing way. The special actions are in fact performed semi-automatically, relieving the player of the need to work in strange and improbable combinations. It must certainly be said that Pirates of the Seven Seas is not a difficult game, far from it, and to this is added the presence of only 8 levels overall; a bit 'little, to the point that it is possible to complete it without too many worries within a couple of hours. If up to now we have therefore described lights and shadows, undoubtedly the graphic layout fully belongs to the first category; the levels are colorful, detailed and well designed, the animations are simply excellent, and the use of color is always very inspiring. From a technical point of view in summary there is really nothing to object to, since the Gameloft title offers one of the best 2d ever seen on mobiles. PRO Graphically excellent Very funny Flawless game mechanics AGAINST Zero originality Too similar to others from Gameloft Very short", "date": "2007-06-05", "grade": "S.V."}
