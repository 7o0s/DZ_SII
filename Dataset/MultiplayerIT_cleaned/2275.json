Captain Picard is Master Clean. Every transplant is useless. We are the Borg... The crew on the bridge barely hold back their laughter, snorting and glancing at each other... Picard, red in the face - Data, interrupt immediately! That's enough, these Borg have really crossed the line, we must eliminate them once and for all. Riker - Sir, I don't know about you, but I don't remember how to defeat the Borg. Picard, pacing nervously: - Heck, neither do I... Data - Sir, in our archives there is a document, defined as a videogame, in which it is possible to face the Borg, and not only them, in a real-time strategy game. Gentleman. Picard, with a mocking grin - Data, tell us what you found... FILE A: GAME OVERVIEW AND SETTING Date - Proceed. The first Star Trek Armada was trying to definitively kick away the fame of loffi titles in the Star Trek setting, and if this cannot be fully stated yet, if nothing else Armada has helped to revive the good name of the series. In this case, history repeats itself, without any particular innovations, except as regards the cauldron of races present in the game, and for some graphic amenity, in an attempt to revive the glories of the trek scene. There are six races from the Trek universe, three of which can be used in singleplayer campaigns. (The Federation, the Klingons, and the Borg) The other three races are the Cardassians, the Romulans and the very bad species 8472. It goes without saying that a number of races so consistent suggests a small number of vessels and buildings, but no! Each race can count on a good number of ships, among which many can be recognized in the television series. Any names? Enterprise-E, Enterprise-D, Defiant, Voyager, then the Klingon Bird-of-Prey as well as the famous Borg Sphere and Cube... and many more. Too bad for the fact that each army differs only aesthetically in appearance, presenting units that are almost identical in functionality, but it certainly did not represent an uncommon feature, unfortunately, at the time of its release on the land market. The game plays like a traditional RTS, with resource gathering and enemy slaughter, but with some small variations given by the completely space setting! In fact, the entire game takes place between infinite space, made up of planets, nebulae, cosmic dust, black holes, asteroids and so on and so forth. FILE B: CHARACTERISTICS Data getting up and walking towards the replicator: - A mouse. Immediately a mouse materializes and Data taking it in hand shows it to the crew on the bridge. Data: - This is a mouse. And it is a tool that humans used to play with Armada2, it is said that through this simple control tool it was practically possible to command all the units, and keep the entire game map under control. Riker rolling his eyes: - WOW! Data, sitting back down and throwing the mouse at Riker: - Of course, it was also possible to vary the deployment of one's forces, making it possible to give the illusion of altitude. Here it refers to ~illusion~ because in fact it has no practical value, but only an aesthetic one. The ships attacked exactly as usual. It was possible to deploy different attack formations and it was possible to admire them through an alternative view, different from the classic RTS one. Entering the panoramic view by rotating the mouse it is possible to go around an object at 360 degrees... Riker in the meantime tries to rotate the mouse in mid-air with curiosity... Data, observing Riker and sighing: - ...remembering indeed a very successful title such as a certain Homeworld, which however made a very different strategic use of this view. Once again it was a graphic tinsel that gave the possibility of observing the most spectacular battles, or the ships entering one of the nebulae scattered around. An interesting aspect is the fact that the crews have to be teleported to the ships, in order to make them operational. A ship without adequate crew is unusable. It was quite an idea to think of having to attack a hostile ship, even weakening its shields to allow the crew to board it, and take control of it! In fact, it should not be forgotten that there were also neutral vessels in the game, mostly belonging to the Ferengi race, traders very greedy for money, but equipped with respectable naval technology. It was possible to prepare strategies using for example a correct combination of orders. For example, yellow alert ships that would only return fire if attacked first,while a concealed group and therefore made invisible to the enemy's sensors could easily take him from behind with a massive concentration of forces. FILE C: MULTIPLAYER, GRAPHICS AND TECHNIQUES Picard: Is it possible to match human opponents, Data? Data: - Sure sir, a panoply of different modes were available to test your skills against human opponents. All this could take place through the use of typical protocols of the time such as LAN, TCP/IP or IPX, as well as take the field on the Internet, a form of huge network on a planetary scale. The game modes ranged from pure and simple destruction of the opponent, to matches that gave the possibility to team up with opponents. Or modes such as capture the flag, or the colonization of neighboring planets, the collection of dilithium in the shortest possible time, the defense of interstellar systems or the assault maps, where the number one team had to survive as long as possible against the attacks of the team number two. PICARD: - But the visual rendering of all this? Data: - As regards the representation of the battles on the screen, everything was rather convincing and above all enthralling, given that the clashes were perpetrated furiously between successful laser shots and colored explosions which contributed, with the presence of the elements on the screen, to making the all lively. You didn't even need a too powerful computer to run it, since the number of polygons was certainly not excessive. The right compromise reads here...Captain, I don't understand the term ~compromise~ - said Data, turning questioningly. Picard: - snoring...zzz...uhu? Huh? Ah yes, compromise, Data. compromise. Well, we humans say the compromise of a definitively dissolved relationship, of a deal that has fallen apart... Riker: - Allow me sir, I don't think Data meant it in that sense... Picard, turning abruptly: - Number 1, don't allow me to contradict myself! Safety! take him to the cell! Riker, shocked: - But sir... he can't do this to me! Not with Worf! PICARD: - And shave him off! I can't stand that awful cut! At least there will be two eggheads. Please Data, continue... Data, swallowing: - Yes, sir. Erm, then... the sound department stands out for the absolute fidelity of the sounds of the famous television series, as well as the very well characterized voices in English. The drama of one's mothership exploding is hard to put into words, but in the context of the game it was definitely something that makes one emotionally share the fate of one's space colonists, whatever race was involved. PICARD: Well, I think the time has come to sum up such a relic of tactical archeology of our species. Is there anything reported about it, Data? FILE D: AUTHOR COMMENT Data: - The last chapter states that the game in question, Captain, is a rather obvious sequel, which can represent a real attraction only for fans of Star Trek in all its forms, people who know the setting inside out Trek, and that they will get the most enjoyment from the title in question. The rest of the population could get tired after a short time due to the too usual structure of the game, and to the landscape, sometimes bare and meager. In fact, however, it represented for mankind one of the many alternatives that did not deviate too much from the proven scheme to collect resources and kill, so dear to many people of the time, however, with a charisma that only a Star Trek setting could be. able to offer. EPILOGUE Picard, walking down the corridor with Data: - All right, Data, let me find a copy of the game on my seat on the bridge, I'm sure it will come in handy to prepare for the Borg threat. Date: - Yes sir. Forgive me Lord, what about Riker and Worf? PICARD: - Huh? Ah yes...Let them fraternize... Geordi, approaching limping and on crutches: - Captain. Captain look... I'm already almost healed, Dr. Crusher works wonders! As he says this he approaches and stares at Data from behind the visor. PICARD: Um, Mr. LaForge, I'm here. Does your headset still have problems? Geordi: -Uhu? Oh yes sir, I'm afraid so. Picard, resolute: - But it's obvious! Soon! All to the bridge, the Borg are now close! Walking towards the bridge, Picard stops Geordi with one arm. PICARD: Not you, Mr. LaForge. Security, take him to the cell with Riker and Worf. This man is still too powerful a catalyst for bad luck. We can't afford that against the Borg. Geordi, whimpering: - But Lordee... Picard: And throw away the key! Shortly after, on the bridge. Date: - Sir. Spotted Borg Cube at twelve o'clock. They are arming iassimilatory rays. What do we do? Picard, with a high forehead and a protruding nose, a slight drop of sweat on his forehead: - Mmm... where is the chapter on the Borg? - sitting down and frantically leafing through the Star Trek Armada 2 manual... Initials:PA PAPA' PA PA PAPAPAAA' PAPAA' PROLOGUE Acronym:PA PAPA' PA PA PAPAPAAA' PAPAA'Porta - Plo-lop Picard - Forward. Door - SWISSH! Worf: Captain, if I may, I'd like to point out that my hands are getting quite itchy lately, I need to go to war with someone, and I don't understand why we still have to be here studying some crap bacteria on some kind of crust rock in this remote corner of the galaxy. Picard - ... Worf - Sir? Picard, pressing the communicator to his chest - Security, come and take Lieutenant Worf immediately, and put him in solitary confinement on bread and water... indeed, give him a sedative... Worf while they're taking him away - But Signoreee... Picard - What a nuisance these Klingons. Bring - SWISSH! Riker entering out of breath, walking on purpose to show the gelled tuft - Lord, Lord! Our positronic cacophony has picked up a subspace signal, emitted with a transmit power that only an alien species you and I know of - oh, if we know them! - could get! Picard, raising his eyebrow - Number 1, apart from the fact that in the academy you evidently skipped the ~how to ring the doorbell~ class... are you perhaps thinking about the... Riker, puffing out his chest - Yes , Lord... I'm thinking of the Borg! A scream is heard, immediately we rush to see, and two floors below, beyond the partially torn protective bulkhead lies the body of Geordi LaForge, the head of the engine room. Riker, wobbling his forelock - Captain, we must act immediately... the dose of bad luck detected by our cosmic matrix sphygometer leaves no doubts, the Borg are about to approach! Living proof is the obvious malfunction of Geordi's visor, and bad luck has befallen him. Picard, foreground, with huge nose: Immediately transmit the decrypted material to the bridge. Let's all go there now. Shortly after... Data - Sir, the message is ready. Picard in a loud voice - Good Data, send it immediately to the whole ship, as commander I think it is better to spread instant panic, warning all the crew, rather than wasting my beautiful voice set in a subsequent communiqu. Go ahead, and turn up the volume...", "date": "2002-01-14", "grade": null}
