{"name": "Sonic The Hedgehog Golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-the-hedgehog-golf.html", "text": "With Sonic The Hedgehog Golf, Sega brings a partly old, partly new product to our terminals. The game developers were able to use a large part of the graphics ready for the classic episodes, therefore they limited themselves to distributing the various elements for each stage in order to create ~golf courses~ valid for a structure that sees the difficulty of handling increase as you proceed. But we must also take into consideration the fact that mobile golf games are still fresh and not very popular, with enormous potential to discover... as we will see. Once the game has started, we will be able to choose whether to try our hand at a classic game or with a single hole, choosing it from those already unlocked. The classic game has three difficulty levels (beginner, enthusiast, professional) but only the first is immediately accessible, while the others must be unlocked by completing all levels. The difference between the three difficulty levels lies in the presence of obstacles and enemies that make it more difficult for us to send the ball into the hole with just a few throws. Once in the game, we can control a trajectory indicator with the joystick, then press FIRE (or 5 on the numeric pad) to start a mobile bar that adjusts the power of the shot and press the same button again to decide the force and launch . Each stage is full of rings that you can collect by ~touching~ them with the ball, and the further you go the more you come across objects that can change the launch, such as pressure springs or ~fragile~ walls. There are also chasms, Sonic's hallmark, which can abruptly interrupt the ball's journey... On a technical level, as mentioned at the beginning, Sonic The Hedgehog Golf makes extensive use of graphic elements already used for the first Sonic always on mobile, to which the developers have added an unprecedented set of animations for the character (who normally didn't use the club actually). The result is nice, even if scrolling suffers from a constant lack of fluidity which does not make everything less playable but which certainly does not make one cry for a miracle. The same can be said for the sound, made up of Sonic's classic music but nothing new: it works, but we would have appreciated some more effort. In general, the impression is a bit that of an amateur production, which takes a back seat thanks to a simple but solid gameplay. The control system works well, responding to inputs quickly.
