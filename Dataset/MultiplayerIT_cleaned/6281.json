The touch screen often represents an obstacle in the rendering of certain genres, it is true, but at the same time it stands as an important resource where it is exploited properly. One Finger Death Punch, released last year on PC and in April on iOS and Android, interprets this approach in an illuminating way, giving us an immediate and fun experience, based solely on two touches, to the left or right of the screen, but not for this trivial or devoid of depth, on the contrary. In the role of an expert warrior, our task in each level is to face enemies arriving from both sides, hitting them as soon as they are within range and combining moves to generate spectacular combos. The presence of weapons and funny violence, together with extremely stylized graphics, do the rest and draw the picture of an excellent and highly enjoyable product. If you haven't tried it yet, you have to. Well, when there is a great success, imitation attempts arrive promptly, and Fatal Fight is precisely this: a clone of One Finger Death Punch, however equipped with more refined graphics and some interesting variations on the theme, all applied to a structure that allows you to progress completely free of charge in the single player campaign, provided you guarantee top performance. Do you feel like trying? Fatal Fight is a clone of One Finger Death Punch with ~normal~ graphics and some small glitches Right left; left right Going from a ~little white man~ similar to that of road signs to cartoonish and detailed graphics represents a big difference, in every sense, and Fatal Fight takes this risk trying to bring home the result. Right from the start, the game appears perfectly in line with the gameplay of its source of inspiration, including bullet times, and the action gradually becomes more multifaceted when the first alternative opponents enter the scene, those who do not fall after a single blow and which indeed require combinations, alternating touches to the right and left according to the icons that accompany their advance. Being able to ~read~ these indications correctly is not a problem, but unfortunately we have noticed that in more advanced missions the responsiveness of the commands tends to be less reliable than necessary. Getting the three stars in each stage is important to be able to unlock new scenarios, in view of a campaign currently made up of fifty levels (and which will be updated shortly, it is also said with the introduction of a multiplayer mode), but for to succeed you need to perform a perfect performance, ergo to score all the attacks and not suffer any damage during the wave. However, this becomes difficult if the game ~stops~ in the middle of a combination, perhaps to visually emphasize a blow or because on our ~path~ there is a weapon that the character automatically grabs, however using in this way a touch that perhaps we had calculated on the basis of the enemies to hit. It is not an insurmountable problem, mind you, but at the moment it marks a significant difference compared to what is offered by One Finger Death Punch, which is also confirmed to be more varied in the types of missions available. In any case, the download is mandatory, also considering that there is absolutely no need to pay to be able to progress and the five ~lives~ available are recharged quickly enough.", "date": "2015-06-06", "grade": "7.8"}
