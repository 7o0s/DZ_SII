{"name": "Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jurassic-park-operation-genesis.html", "text": "Welcome to Jurassic Park We cannot deny the good will and the great effort made by the game designers to propose a vast and varied title: every possible aspect of the management and maintenance of a Jurassic Park is reproduced in the game. We start by choosing the shape and conformation of the island on which our park will be built: from there on, the safe tracks of management are undertaken, with more than one debt to the historic Theme Park series. But what honors the Vivendi title is the ability not to throw away the possibilities that an idea like Chricton's puts in their hands: managing a park full of fat tourists and hungry dinosaurs will soon prove to be very difficult. We will have to think about the management of the dinosaurs, choose which reptile ~model~ to clone, considering its needs, its habitat, compatibility with existing dinosaurs and so on. Once the quintal of teeth and squals have been baked it must be fed, kept healthy and brought back to the kennel if it decides to flee. For the latter problem there is a security team that we will be able to lead in person: but this aspect also requires careful planning and precise control. Not to mention the tourists that we will always have to entertain with new attractions, well-placed bars and toilets, even worrying about benches and waste bins that are always available: otherwise we risk seeing them leave unhappy and never return. When I say see their discontent I mean it literally: it is possible to know the mood, ideas and propensity to buy of each individual visitor. Then it will also be necessary to keep an eye on the teams of anthropologists who, around the world, dig in search of fossils from which to obtain DNA. Obtaining amber and bones from which to clone new dinosaurs (perhaps more attractive to tourists than a placid and small herbiver) so as to increase the number of visitors and thus increase resources to maintain the Park and pay new teams looking for new DNA and etc. As mentioned, control over the park is total, in certain situations almost impressive in detail: from the ticket price of the single attractions, to the restaurant menu, from the position of the benches to the development of new attractions: the player can even determine the itinerary of the hot air balloon, give it a catchy name and then ride it and test it for yourself, making sure customers get their fill of dinosaurs and adrenaline. The player can also intervene personally in emergencies, taking the lead of the security helicopter and hunting for missing tourists or brontosauruses to be anesthetized. There are still too many characteristics that could be listed - from climatic conditions to genetic research - and it would ruin the player's pleasure of discovery: the learning curve is progressive, it never discourages, on the contrary it always keeps alive the player's desire to discover something new dinosaur or to implement a new attraction. Extinction and cloning A hint at the other game modes in addition to the main ~campaign~: to increase the longevity of Operation Genesis, in addition to the tutorials, they will provide single missions, to be unlocked during the game, with precise objectives to be achieved (capture an escaped dinosaur, recover of tourists, obtain certain facilities), and a ~Dinopedia~, a sort of encyclopedia on dinosaurs, concise but valuable for understanding the characteristics and needs of our creatures. Only positives then? Not really: however numerous and varied the different aspects of park management seem to not all affect the continuation of the game with the same weight. Thus the enthusiast of management titles must bear in mind that he is faced with a title designed for the mass market, for the enthusiast of the saga or the casual gamer, certainly not for those who seek depth and complexity from a similar title similar to Sim City. Not all aspects have been investigated sufficiently: there is a lot of quantity but not as much quality in a gameplay that in the end risks boring the player looking for the challenge. The technical aspect is more than decent: the graphics will not make you cry out for a miracle but it does its job very well and more than once it will offer suggestive landscapes full of details. The zoom effect is noteworthy: from vast panoramic views over the whole island it will be possible to go down to admire the individual dinosaurs, recreated very faithfully and covered with good quality textures, within the limits of the Ps2. The sound effects, on the other hand, betray excessive neglect, resulting particularly anonymous to the point of annoying: of a completely different caliber the sound accompaniment which, in line with the cinematic Jurassic Park, retraces the extensive and epic scores to which John Williams has become accustomed. Comment Like scientists who combine mutant chromosomes with the spirit of the bricoleur, the designers of Operation Genesis have attempted a graft of different styles of play - from pure management to strategic, from educational to life simulator - obtaining a fragile hybrid with very rich potential that unfortunately they remain so. An immature puppy, thrown out of the incubator too soon: let's hope for the sequel. Jurassic Park is a more than decent product that performs its function of entertaining and inspiring the dinosaur enthusiast in an excellent way: those who know all the phylogeny of the pterodactyl will find Operation Genesis a fun and varied title, on the contrary the hardcore gamer he must bear in mind that he will not find very profound challenges but only an unsolved title, only potentially great. Dignified graphics and immediate playability make it a product recommended for an audience not specialized in management, perhaps young and passionate about reptiles bigger than a lizard. Pros: Playable Great music Complex... Cons: ...but shallow Challenge poor Interface to polish Jurassic Park  first through the book by Michael Chricton, then the film series by Spilberg  gave dinosaurs unprecedented popularity, transforming brontosaurus, triceratops and tyrannosaurs into authentic global pop stars in the early 1990s. The origin, in some mysterious ways, of so much fascination for these rectiloni is probably to be found in their simultaneous incarnation of both the past and the future  being clones  of humanity. Furthermore, Spielberg's films were also milestones in the history of cinematic special effects: his dinosaurs were among the first creatures  moreover of a certain indisputable weight  largely recreated with computer graphics. It is therefore a pity that, up to now, these doubly virtual dinosaurs  because they are clones and because they were created on the computer  have not found any worthy videogame representation (with the exception of the Dino Crisis franchise, in which, however, they limited themselves to the minimum wage by replacing the of resideneviliana memory). Vivendi Universal is now trying to fill this gap with Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, and it does so by going to the roots of the ~dynomania~ phenomenon, precisely to its genesis, providing the player with an entire island on which to build and make the own amusement park based on giant reptiles where, like a real mad scientist, you can play God.", "date": "2003-06-30", "grade": null}
