Respect. in fact it's not Scarface's UMD. Even if I have to admit that after the first sequences the doubt came to me. It's a game, I remember with difficulty to myself, the central nucleus must be the gameplay, not the watching of the film. I'll have to do something. But of course, it is logical, the movies are nothing more than a chain that links different scenarios of the game, unrolling them like a sort of blood rosary, the grains of which are however sadly disconnected from each other. In fact, the scenes seem to have no logical thread, and to be completely disconnected from the mission that we will have to carry out in each scenario. Which, honestly, taking away the visual pleasure given us by a hardware perfectly capable of reproducing the scenes of a cinematic masterpiece at high quality, limits the enjoyment only to those who have been able to appreciate the film and cuts, in some way, the legs of those who never seen it. Even in fans of the film, however, a nostalgic taste is left in the mouth, but also the bewilderment of not being able to put a head and tail to the scenes we are witnessing, thus limiting ourselves to pure contemplative pleasure. Which, I have to admit, is baffling to say the least, if not downright disappointing. But after this criticism of the absence of a logical thread in the presentation of the filmed scenes, albeit impactful, let's move on to the actual game, and analyze it carefully. Money. Power. Respect. (from now MPR) is not, as perhaps some expected, in any way similar to its ~big brother~ that has recently been released for PC, PS2 and Xbox: Scarface: The World is Yours. It's not a third-person action, it's not GTA styled, we're not hanging out with Tony Montana. It is actually a turn-based strategy, with a series of combat actions, also turn-based. It is basically about dealing with the competition between the various clans for control of the neighborhoods of Miami. The building of an empire The scenarios contain a series of missions to complete in order to pass the step and access the next scenario. An example would be selling a certain amount of cocaine at the highest street price, conquering a certain number of territories or buying a certain number of warehouses to receive the shipments of drugs that are sent there. Frank Lopez (Sosa, in the Italian game), takes us under his wing and somehow guides us in building our empire. It is from him that the instructions that we will have to follow to fulfill the conditions of the scenarios come and it is always from him that the suggestions that will help us to extricate ourselves in the game come. The initial tutorial is fundamental, showing step by step how to proceed in the various phases of the game, which will take place in three main phases per shift: a first part relating to purchases, a second to traffic and a third of combat, which will close the shift for reopen with the next sequence. The purchase phase basically allows you to place a series of buildings on the neighborhoods we control, including warehouses and laboratories for the production of weed, cocaine and heroin, henchmen to defend them and drug dealers to... well, drug dealing, of course , the stocks of drugs that we will produce and, finally, of moves. The moves in question are a sort of strategic cards to be used in combat, traffic or, in the case of ~legal~ cards, depending on the circumstances to turn the regulation on the roads in our favor. For example, a specific anti-drug card could reduce the street price of heroin. the intermediary card will allow us to collect a certain amount of money from each of our opponents, and so on. The last option of the purchase phase is that relating to alliances, which we can make for a certain number of rounds with each of our opponents, the Diaz, Gomez and Contreras clans. having collected the amount of drugs yielded by our laboratories during the shift, we can move on to the trafficking phase. Candy from strangers Here everything depends on the number of drug dealers we have and the cost, which varies according to the cards played by us or by our opponents, of selling the goods on the street. Furthermore, each territory has its own market value, so we will have to choose carefully where to sell our goods. If heroin sells better in Miami Lakes, for example, weed might sell better in Carol City, and so on. It seems clear that a prudent distribution of goods affects not only profits, but also the attention we will arouse in the long eye of the police, who could decide to carry out raids, which will not only see us confiscate goods, with relative peloss of income, but they will force us to post bail, in the next round, for our arrested drug dealers, essential for retail distribution. That's why a good distribution on the territory will facilitate our escaping the police networks, as well as a good dose of corruption, always effective. It should be noted that when our opponents undergo such round-ups, a nice voice off-screen from the boss of the clan in question comments on the fact with a harsh consideration: that it is necessary to give in to oral sex with the police chief to save oneself from such huge economic losses ? The fact that these colorful expressions are, as is logical, expressed in much less elegant terms than mine, and in a loud voice, beyond the vulgarity and verbal violence that exude from this title, which by its nature cannot fail to deal with situations scabrous, I find it honestly really excessive. If only because if the first time he elicits an uncertain surprised smile, the repetitiveness of the matter ends up making these utterances (and there is a certain variety, it must be said, even if limited) rather annoying. Also in consideration of the fact that PSP is, in fact, a portable console and, as such, potentially used also in public environments. Unless earphones are used, it could be embarrassing to let sentences like this come out of the console that we hold by the hands, if we are in the presence of strangers or people who are not particularly flexible or tolerant. We certainly get at least a couple of puzzled or disapproving looks. Muting the volume is not an option, playing on mute is really sad. In short, the saying that ~don't worry about them but look and pass~ is true, but honestly it seems excessive to me, especially considering the perfect localization in Italian which, for once, we find penalizing at least in these circumstances. Returning to the traffic phase : once the sale of drugs has been exhausted and any cards have been used, we can move on to the third and final phase: that of combat. Eat the dust, you bastard! In combat, the concept is very simple: it's about attacking or defending yourself. The second option simply involves moving the picciotti to areas where greater defense is expected to be needed, for a maximum of ten henchmen per neighborhood. In the case of an attack, after having decided which number of henchmen to take to the street, we will have the possibility to choose a move with which to open the combat round. For example, a ~lethal aim~ move card will give our minions an attack bonus for the duration of a battle, a sniper move will see you hire a minion who, for one turn, will fire a certain number of aimed shots at enemy minions . Moves that could turn a clash to our advantage and will therefore be used with acumen and on the purchase of which it is never advisable to save. Battles, which switch the screen to a 3D view of the street, allow us a variety of moves, including the ability to run away, focus fire on a single opponent, use moves and hire (at a higher price) new henchmen. Once this phase is successfully or defeated, everything repeats itself, returning to the initial cycle. There are about ten scenarios in Scenarios from the Movie mode, which will unlock, every time one completes it, as many clips from Scarface. The Challenge between Cartels mode, on the other hand, offers three different game modes in which you have to complete objectives before your opponents. For example, we will have to earn 15 million first, or have the most personal assets at the end of six rounds, or still take control of the whole of Miami by eliminating all our opponents. Everything is playable, as well as in the Single Player version, also in Multiplayer via WiFi for up to 4 players. Comment Scarface: Power. Money. Respect. disappoints. It does so above all because of the potential that has not been exploited properly, making the game repetitive and resting mainly on the pillar of the clips taken from the original film, which, while delighting the fans, are not sufficient to revive a low-profile gameplay with excessive verbal violence, also repetitive and not suitable for the atmosphere, somehow an end in itself in a ~out of tune~ way. The game, which falls into the category of ~board~ strategy games, a sort of criminal Risk, enjoys certainly pleasant graphics and a clean and equally pleasant sound, as well as a series of missions with two quite challenging but not too much to be difficult. Despite this, after a short time one slips into the mechanical nature of the action, ending up in monotony. A titOnly to be combined with the version for home consoles, of a completely different thickness, or to be purchased for completeness if you are a lover of the film. Pros Excellent rendition of the film clips, a pleasure for film lovers Fair video and sound sector Passes the time Multiplayer mode for up to 4 players Cons Poor and repetitive gameplay Verbal violence in some embarrassing cases, if you are in public Confusing plot, absence of storylines We are in a world where only those with thick skin survive. The eyes of Tony Montana, aka Al Pacino run across the screen, burn away, just as his life will be burned by a mad rush for power. Frantic minutes of filmed sequences introduce us to the game, bringing back memories of that film that marked the history of Hollywood, marking a chapter in the history of mafia and crime that has never been forgotten. Its success was decreed by the extreme, raw, real violence of some scenes, flanked by a flavor of horrible desperation and a sense of total absence of second chances. Mirror of a world that winds through the streets of Miami, in the corruption and ruthlessness of drug trafficking, where there are several sovereigns in constant struggle with each other for control of a neighborhood, a sidewalk, a street corner that as an outpost for its trades. A fight that is consumed to the sound of firearms, of alliances and betrayals, of the blood of sacrificial labor shed, at times, even by hands armed with chainsaws. The game, in fact, takes place between a filmed sequence taken from the film and another, and opens the ball with the famous part in which Tony Montana and his brother find themselves negotiating the purchase of drugs to end up chained in the shower. How it ends, since there is a chainsaw involved, I leave you to imagine, in case you have never seen the film (and in this case it would be advisable to remedy the gap). Allow me to anticipate that it's not really something that a delicate stomach can digest easily. Impressive introduction, which exploits all the cinematic quality of the small PSP screen, leaving us almost stunned by the violence of the visual impact. But then, what happens when we get to the actual game?", "date": "2006-12-19", "grade": null}
