{"name": "State Of Emergency", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/state-of-emergency-8.html", "text": "Sir, would you kindly return my head? State Of Emergency (SOE for brevity) can recall the footed sections of GTAIII in the game structure. Having said that, the Xbox user, who envies users of the monolithic Sony console, might be tempted to consider the title we are examining as a valid palliative for the lack of GTA on the Microsoft platform. The Xbox version can also count on a substantial difference with its twin on PS2: the introduction of four multiplayer modes. There is no doubt that virtually fistfighting with three friends is fulfilling, fun, and adds an extra dimension to most video games. It remains to be seen whether this addition is sufficient to revive the fortunes of a game that a year ago had certainly not impressed on PS2, but let's go in order. There are two single player modes in SOE, Revolution and Chaos. In the first mode, objectives are proposed from time to time to be achieved by trying to enrich the massacre that one is called to carry out in order to free the planet from the evil plots of the megacorporation with a sketch of a plot. Defending allies, attacking enemies, recovering some items, are examples of the tasks entrusted to us. Failure to achieve an objective forces you to start over from the beginning of the current mission, the repetition of which is not excessively frustrating given the brevity of the same. In the long run, however, the lack of a real narrative fabric and the repetitiveness of the objectives tends to reduce interest in the Revolution mode. At that point it is better to jump into the Chaos mode, which throws the player into the fray, leaving him with greater freedom of action. Objectives are also assigned in this mode, but they can be conveniently ignored to focus on mass destruction. What do you have to break bones, smash windows, cut off heads? The first weapons supplied are obviously those common to all human beings: a type of kick, a type of punch, a grip and a special stunning move to be used when surrounded. Naturally the satisfaction increases when one comes into possession of white or firearms. With hatchets, swords and the like, enemies can be sliced or decapitated, while with grenade launchers, machine guns and missile launchers, Molotov cocktails and flamethrowers, they can be punctured, set on fire or detonated. The environment around us is somewhat interactive and it is allowed to grab objects such as stools, ashtrays, billboards and throw them at other objects or at people. Another type of weapon consists of the human remains of defeated enemies: just approach a dismembered corpse and grab a limb or skull to use it as a blunt weapon. All this always happens at a frantic and incessant pace, but SOE's too simple and repetitive structure leads to premature boredom after a few hours of play. The multiplayer mode, introduced for the occasion of the Xbox port, as already mentioned, helps the longevity of State Of Emergency. The possibility of filling friends with blows in four different modes (Chaos, Last Clone, Deathmatch, Survivor), playing all against all, in teams or in cooperation, increases the attractiveness of the Rockstar title, which is offered at the price of  29.99. a completely different attraction, so as to become a decidedly attractive purchase for all fans of the genre. A praise to Cidiverte, not new to this kind of initiative (remember Max Payne for PC, also offered at the launch at a reduced price). The face of violence Rockstar declares that the game's engine plays up to 250 characters simultaneously on the screen without slowdowns, and indeed the playing area is always very crowded and the fluidity is always constant at 60 frames per second. A feast for the eyes, then? The answer is not positive because those two hundred and fifty people on screen enjoy a very low level of detail, as can be seen from the photos below. There are also no special effects or plays of light. In any case, however, the Xbox version of the game is a step forward compared to the PlayStation 2 counterpart, which has already been available for a year: the graphics are more defined, the textures have been improved and the frame rate has doubled (the edition for the black monolith Sony did not exceed 30fps). The violence of the game is somewhat dampened by the very ~cartoony~ style of the graphics, made up of polygonal models with large hands and feet and decidedly caricatured. It's Revolution baby The sound is of honest quality, in sound effects and music. Offere soon the latter will resort to one of the most interesting features of the Microsoft console, and that is the custom soundtracks that are fully supported by SOE. Try ripping a cd of healthy heavy metal, perhaps by Fear Factory or Machine Head, and insert it as background to the game, or try playing with a soundtrack by Beethoven to recreate a surreal ~A Clockwork Orange~ atmosphere and experience he will certainly gain from it. Comment Do too many slaps hurt your hands? It seems so, because this State Of Emergency fails to resolve even with the introduction of multiplayer the general quality of a title that already a year ago on PlayStation 2 had not impressed in a particular way. After a fairly entertaining impact, the lack of variety and the lack of a real story are felt after a few hours of play. It is also certain that the alternatives on Xbox are absent and SOE can be a good diversion at the end of a stressful working day, or a new entry in the afternoons with friends in the name of ultra-violence. State Of Emergency also appears on the Microsoft console without much praise and with a few too many problems, especially with regards to the single-player mode, but at 29.99 it's worth a try. Take three friends, let them participate in the purchase and throw yourself into the massacre. Ah, I forgot: the game screens are entirely translated into Italian. Pros: Frantic, violent Ability to customize the soundtrack Multiplayer support  29.99, the price is really competitive. A praise to Cidiverte Cons: Repetitive Not long-lived Technically not exceptional, although superior to the PlayStation 2 version Rockstar Violence We're not talking about another case of domestic violence reported by the partner of some famous singer, but about the software house that created one of the most controversial and successful brands in recent years, that Grand Theft Auto whose latest incarnation, GTA III and related sequel/expansion, has risen to the role of Killer Application on Playstation 2. The violence of the aforementioned title was undisputed and, given the public's receptivity towards the theme, our developers decided to continue along the same bloody path. The pretext to vent our basest instincts, also known as a plot, is not overly complicated: a megacorporation dictates the law in much of the planet, oppressing the various populations with an iron regime. A group of rebels forms a special team, the Freedom Force, to thwart the enemy's globalization plans.", "date": "2003-04-09", "grade": null}
