{"name": "Battle Realms", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-realms.html", "text": "History ~My name is Kensij and I am the last descendant of the honorable Dragon Clan~: this is how the story narrated by Battle Realms begins. Once the Dragon Clan was the only one in existence and the word war was only a distant memory. Then, suddenly, plagues, failed crops and especially the Horde. Grim army of darkness made up of evil monsters and evil creatures. In the face of a force as devastating as it was unstoppable, the powerful Clan of the Dragon had no choice but to flee and abandon their lands, their possessions and their homes. However, this did not satisfy the Horde's thirst for blood, so much so that it continued to hunt down the fugitives at less and less distance; the head of the Clan (Talan the old) therefore decided to sacrifice their most precious treasure: the eye of the Dragon, a powerful and arcane artifice imbued with magic. The people were saved, the Horde was stopped but the price paid was very high: in fact, a deep gorge, created by the telluric upheavals caused by the spell born of the stone, divided the refugees from their motherland, in a few years the Clan fell into disarray and was replaced by three other Clans. The Clan of the Serpent home of the direct descendants of Talan the old, the cruel one and dedicated to the arcane arts of the Lotus and the Clan of the Wolf, barbarian and relegated to life in the woods. History Kensij's task (who, if you haven't figured it out yet, will be your digital alter ego) is to reform the Dragon Clan, find the Dragon Ball and save the world from the new imminent wave of terror. Does it seem little to you? The game plot therefore evolves in a ~dynamic~ way, it will be up to the player to decide which side to take (follow the path of the righteous or get lost on the dark road?) and decide each time which provinces to fight or which to save. In this way it will be possible to replay the same plot several times but seen from different points of view. Zen graphics and introspective sound Battle Realms looks like the most classic RTS. The graphics in the game are fully 3D, the playing field looks pre-rendered while all units are beautifully animated in real time. While implementing three-dimensional features, all those who hoped to be able to move their ~digital camera~ at will throughout the game scenario will be disappointed: far from being a defect, the view is in fact fixed and as a setting it is very reminiscent of the classics of the genre such as Command & Conquer and the archaic Warcraft. However, the point in common with the past is only this: the graphics of Battle Realms are in fact a true example of Zen art. The colors are clean, the outlines sharp, every single detail is taken care of in an almost obsessive way. Screenshots are not enough to describe the graphic magnificence of this game. At first sight it seems to be faced with nothing astounding but the more you go on in the game and the more you appreciate the reflections of the water torrents, the splashes of the waterfalls, the plays of light that occur when the weather changes, the splashes of blood during the bloodiest fights. The animations of the characters (and of the animals) are excellent and we regret not a little the fact of not being able to zoom in on the characters from time to time to be able to appreciate all the touches of class: from the farmer who bends down to collect water creating ripples on the surface of the lake up to the agile prettiness shown by Kensij in the use of the sword during the numerous fights. Zen graphics and introspective sound The animated interludes (which seem to take advantage of the same graphics engine used in the part played) are a bit out of place in all this graphic magnificence which, although well-made, cannot hold a candle to those of older titles such as Red Alert. The music is honest, more thought of as a background accompaniment than as a symphony in its own right, they are however pleasant and, as is now fashionable, they follow the rhythm and the game action: in this way we will hear relaxing melodies during the less agitated phases while, during the fights, we will be able to perceive arrangements and motifs that underline the epic nature of those moments (in full Braveheart style), each faction has its own personal repertoire and in any case it is possible to define its own personalized playlist to listen to during game sessions. Even the sound effects play their role very well: also diversified according to the Clan used (especially the voices) they are all very well characterized.The gameplay. Yin, Yang and the secret of paper versus stone. As previously written, Battle Realms comes with a top quality pedigree and during all the sector fairs and the numerous previews dedicated to it, many have launched into numerous praises for this title. Let's say immediately that, as well as the graphic setting, also the gameplay and game interface of Battle Realms have left little room for more extreme experimentation (as David Perry did last year with his Sacrifice) and for the search for risky innovations that could have undermined the feeling with fans of this genre of games since the times of the now ancient Dune II. However, this does not mean that the game does not present some interesting innovations. Indeed, after years I found myself having to abandon the well-established game tactics refined over many years of videogame experience to, for example, find myself in the woods of medieval Japan implementing guerrilla tactics in full ~Robin Hood with almond eyes~ style  . With a wink to Sacrifice in Battle Realms the use of Yin and Yang points has been implemented, in a nutshell every time you win an armed clash you earn points (Yin for the ~good~ clans and Yang for the ~chaotic~ one ) directly proportional to the distance from our base, these points are necessary to be able to increase the physical/psychic characteristics of their fighters or to be able to hire ~heroes~ who can help, thanks to their charisma and their special skills, the troops in the success of our missions. In this way we tried to fight the way of playing which consists, in full Trapattoni style, in closing in defense and launching the final attack once enough war resources have been accumulated. In truth, the intention is good but the results are only half so, in fact these points are also earned by defending and defeating the attacking troops, moreover the points are earned quite quickly and at a certain point in the missions it is almost unknown what more to do with it, at least until the games start to get really hard The gameplay. Yin, Yang and the secret of paper versus stone. Much attention has been paid to the interaction with the game environment, we are talking about the infamous Living System: we will be able to send our peons to capture the horses and then tame them and use them as pack animals or battle steeds, we will be able to hide (literally) in the woods waiting for reinforcements, however we will have to try not to move too suddenly or too en masse because the animals would run away scared and thus warn the enemy of our presence. Considerable importance is covered by the characteristics of the territory itself, in addition to the already mentioned use of the woods, it is interesting to note that it will also be possible to exploit the slope of the terrain on which we are fighting to our advantage: if we attack from above we will have greater visibility and our attacks (especially those at a distance) will be lethal, but if we have the misfortune of having to face a climb we will see our troops advance more slowly than usual and be at the mercy of the enemy. It will also be convenient to build our villages near streams and lakes, in fact water is of great importance in the economy of the game: we need it to irrigate the rice fields, to put out the fires set on our buildings by the enemies during their attacks . Furthermore, water, together with rice, is the fundamental resource used for the construction of infrastructures and for the maintenance of our men during their training in the appropriate structures. Ah, I was forgetting, unlike other similar titles in Battle Realms it is necessary to decide from time to time whether to benefit the military or the productive part of our microeconomic system: in fact, the units are not bought in special structures but are formed by ~training~ our farmers in one or more training centres. This means that we will often find ourselves having to sacrifice the size of our army to ensure that our village has a sufficient supply of resources: the famous saying ~arms stolen from agriculture~ has never been so true. This, also considering that the total number of Units that we could command will never be very high, immediately makes us understand how much the game designers have decided to shift the player's attention to the real tactical component of the fights (who remembers the series of Myth is well aware of what I mean) than on the classic scheme of exaggerated production on which the ~more coI build, the more armies I have, the more chances of winning there will be. The gameplay. Yin, Yang and the secret of paper versus stone. The training structures are not very numerous (they are generally one per combat area: magical, melee and ranged) but they can be used in combination to transform an inept laborer into an expert connoisseur of one or more martial arts. The units are customized for each clan and well balanced (even if the Lotus Clan seems to have a little more advantage than the others), certainly they are not very many but the effort to ensure that each of them can be useful, if not fundamental, is commendable , for the success of our conquest plans. It may seem strange but it is no longer sufficient to build an army made up of only elite troops to make it invincible: in fact, every type of soldier, from the most ~scaciosa~ to the most advanced one, has unique and absolutely necessary characteristics during battles. It's just a pity that often, especially in the first hours of the game, you find yourself a little lost and find it difficult to place a given type of fighter in a certain range of use, this because certain all-rounder classes still exist (such as that of the Samurai) who can carry out both ranged attacks and engage in hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, there is a lack of some highly specialized units such as naval units or those areas, so perhaps we will have to wait for Battle Realms II. The artificial intelligence of the enemies seems well thought out, depending on the clan and the unit it could happen that you are provoked to be attracted into some trap, that you are attacked simultaneously on several fronts or that you are hunted down when we run away crushed by a clear inferiority compared to the enemy. Your own troops, on the other hand, turn out to be ~too~ intelligent, it may seem like a paradox but unfortunately it is. The basic idea is very good, i.e. all our soldiers have very sharp eyesight and often think by themselves of heading towards sparsely covered areas to defend them from attacks (which can often escape us) from the adversaries, however if this in some cases is a value in many others turns out to be a double-edged sword, in the most agitated and chaotic assaults in fact it is very difficult to make our cannon fodder do what we want, I can assure you that more than once I have had to reload a scenario just because one of my team did not attack the target chosen by me but got lost along the way ~distracted~ by the other targets. It is true that there is, in the specific case, a FORCE ATTACK command but it is also true that often one is too caught up in the course of events to press this or that key. Another defect is represented by the fact that, by now accustomed to the glories of Age Of Empires, we often feel the need to be able to organize our troops in certain attack formations (tortoise, anvil, ...) by making sure, for example , that the shooters are in the back and the hitters in front. Unfortunately, all this must be done in an artisanal way (and with mixed results) by creating more specialized groups (with the now classic CTRL+NUMBER) and moving them continuously by configuring the position of the various groups according to our preferences. A real shame, especially considering the marked tactical setting of this game. Multiplayer It is possible to challenge other human players both on LAN and on the Internet, in this case a proprietary BattleNet-style game network has not been created but we have relied on the free service offered by GameSpy. The community is not yet very large but even now with a little patience it is possible to find human opponents with relative ease. The game options are identical to those designed for skirmishes in Single Player mode. It will therefore be possible to decide the number of players (how many human and how many guided by the computer AI) with relative Handicaps. Possible alliances can already be defined before starting the game plus other environmental variables such as the rice growth factor, the initial size of the starting armies and populations or other. The different game modes are inevitable: from the classic Capture The Flag to some innovative ones such as the one called ~Famine~ characterized by the absolute scarcity of resources. In short, there is something for all tastes. At the moment no map editor is included, but those already present are quite numerous and well thought out. No detail has been left to chance and this section also seems well thought out. That the time has finally come to unseat the supreme", "date": "2001-12-10", "grade": null}
