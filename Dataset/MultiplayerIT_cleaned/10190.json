{"name": "Medieval Dynasty: la recensione del survival con elementi RPG e un'articolata componente gestionale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medieval-dynasty-recensione.html", "text": "A short introductory sequence all drawings, but supported by a fairly powerful soundtrack, introduces us to the pleasures of medieval life, one in which you can suddenly lose everything you have to find yourself in the middle of a wood, desperate. An abrupt incipit which among other things recalls the initial bewilderment of a thousand other survivals. In the surroundings there are not only branches, stones and trunks with which to build the first tools. Right nearby is Uncle Iordan's house, the village of Gostovia, a thriving community that overlooks a long river and welcomes us at the beginning of an experience that mixes survival mechanics complex enough to include dehydration, a pinch of role-playing and a complex managerial dimension. Unfortunately not everything enjoys the same care, but there is still a lot of irons in the fire, as we were able to verify with the review of Medieval Dynasty. A multifaceted experience The vegetation of Medieval Dynasty is lush and realistic The combination of survival and the Middle Ages is not new, but takes on a different dimension in the title Render Cube which is proposed as a real medieval life simulator with articulated survival mechanics, interactions with non-player characters, a story, an open region world with several settlements, a ruler, construction, trade and a management dimension that flows into the city builder. From the collection of the first branches to build a first shelter of wood and reeds, we arrive in fact at the building of an entire city, with workers to entrust production, fields, livestock and so on. Here, among other things, we find an avalanche of skills in which to spend the experience points earned. In large part we talk about the effectiveness in resource collection, combat and the robustness of the tools we build, but there are also diplomatic and special skills such as the ability to recall the horse with a whistle and theft, a potentially useful shortcut in the first game stages. There is also a long list of notes that explain how to deal with a game that in the initial stages seems rather elementary, including the introductory missions that guide us to collect resources and build a first shelter, but it gets more and more challenging demanding a lot of time and a good deal of patience. That said, the difficulty is not punitive, starting from the survival dynamics to get to the management ones. Getting around the title's economy isn't particularly complicated, and resources are plentiful. Also for this reason we recommend paying close attention to the customizable variables of the game that allow you to add a little spice to the experience. On the other hand, it is an exclusively single player title that risks losing its bite, thanks to a slender narrative sector, sacrificing survival dimension and general difficulty. The game creation options allow you to disable raids, incidents, thirst, hunger, weight limit and several other options. There are also scrolling selectors that allow you to increase or decrease parameters such as the length of the seasons, resources required by our commoners, enemy health, taxes to be paid for each building, experience gained, dynasty points and technology points, necessary to build new buildings and unlock projects. Gameplay The first Medieval Dynasty home hearth is never forgotten The long journey to create a real dynasty starts from the benevolence of the citizens of thriving Gostovia where we are granted permission to build a first house, on which we will have to pay taxes, and where our research into Uncle Iordan's past begins as we juggle in gathering resources, hunting and surviving packs of wolves, brigands and bad weather. In the meantime, however, we accumulate levels that allow us to specialize our character. Each activity guarantees experience points that allow not only to strengthen our alter ego but to expand the technological knowledge that includes 68 tools including weapons and tools as well as sawmills, markets, blacksmiths, fields and houses that are necessary to keep the population healthy and increase the workforce. On the other hand, although the first-person action always remains important, it becomes more and more embedded in the management dynamics which allow us to individually manage several dozen individuals, all listed in a special section of the menu which also informs us of characteristics such as age, mood, profession and most important of all, specific skills. Then there are sections dedicated to buildings, fields, livestock and the needs of the inhabitants, also briefly summarized among the statisticsgeneral fiches summarizing dynastic reputation, total taxes accompanied by any debts, number of workers and stage of development of our settlement. The management component of Medieval Dynasty allows you to create and govern a small medieval city But although the passage of time and the growth of character and settlement are the heart of the experience, there is no need to neglect secondary elements such as unexpected events, attacks and difficulties, relevant to keeping the challenge high and giving credibility to the medieval context. However, they force us to swallow a few bitter pills. The raids of the brigands, to begin with, are essential to give that pinch of pathos to the experience, but they are really difficult to appreciate, due to a decidedly crude combat system. Furthermore, the RPG dimension, as anticipated, is largely appearance, excluding the evolution of the characteristics of the character. The cues are there, including loads of text options, stealing abilities, and a storyline that has some interesting spin at first, and goes so far as to include reputation-building missions for the king. But between repetitiveness and lack of depth it soon becomes clear that these are not fundamental aspects of the experience. The goal is to create a dynasty, but everything is diluted in the managerial dimension which becomes dominant and can be rather tiring to manage. Although the inhabitants roam the streets, work in the fields and in some cases even remember to light a lantern to go around at night, the player finds himself having to manage almost every aspect of the life and work of a laborer with decidedly autonomy more limited than what we are used to in modern good-level management software. Among other things, the citizens are not only poorly autonomous and reactive, but they are also not very credible and undermine the simulation aspirations of the title. In fact, that fundamental spark is missing to give depth and realism to the world, once the initial suggestion guaranteed by an effective atmosphere has diminished. A dimension that shatters on the expressionless snout of commoners who, in addition to having to be guided by the hand, making the micro-management component a little too cumbersome, are very little credible in the reactions and animations. Technical compartment The glance of Medieval Dynasty is undoubtedly among the strengths of the technical sector Medieval Dynasty can give a lot of hours of leisure to those who appreciate meticulous management, the slow cycle of the seasons and exploration in search of materials, in this case enhanced by a purpose that corresponds to filling the warehouses to keep healthy population and finances of a community. But even appreciating these aspects madly, it is necessary to arm yourself with patience in the face of ingenuity and problems of various kinds which include glitches, improbable Italian translations and all the typical uncertainties of games that come out still in progress. Note, among other things, the rigidity of the construction system that imposes fixed designs on us, but still forces us to hammer for several minutes to put up four walls and a roof. Given the setting, it would have been better to speed up the procedure, leaving room for the rest. Furthermore, as negative notes, the rigidity of the animations of the human characters, an approximate physics, some slowdown too much even on decidedly high-end systems and the lack of dynamic destructibility stand out. Structures, for example, disappear when dismantled, or are downgraded by choosing the relevant option from the hammer menu, and do not suffer damage from blows inflicted. Fleeing, a fox guides us towards Gostovia, the starting point of Medieval Dynasty But good audio samples must also be included in the calculation, a suggestive soundtrack, good reflections, credible water, defined textures, effective lights, spot-on colours, luxuriant vegetation, convincing animal animations and particularly well-finished aspects such as the fur of the rabbits, almost disturbing for realism when we find ourselves having to skin them to survive. Enough for a not bad glance which together with the convincing atmosphere can be decisive in helping us to overshadow the less successful elements of the Render Cube title.", "date": "2021-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
