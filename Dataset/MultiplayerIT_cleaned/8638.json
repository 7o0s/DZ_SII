{"name": "Profumo d'impresa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100883-malicious-profumo-dimpresa.html", "text": "The Japanese developers of Alvion have tried to contribute to the genre of action games on PlayStation 3 with a different product than usual, based on single arenas instead of the usual progression that characterizes this type of game, and which usually sees us eliminate crowds of opponents ~standard~ and then get to the boss fight. In Malicious, with little outline and even less introduction, we are immediately projected into a suggestive reality, in the role of a spiritual warrior (or a warrior, the choice is ours) summoned by a mysterious race of prophets to destroy the forces of evil. Armed with a sort of ~polymer cloak~ that allows us to dance in the air and attack enemies in different ways, our task will be to enter five scenarios full of pitfalls and eliminate a boss there. It will not be a simple undertaking: to defend the bosses we will find an almost infinite number of more or less dangerous henchmen, who, once defeated, will release energy useful for filling the aura bar, a fundamental indicator for recharging our vital energy as well as to perform certain offensive maneuvers. Let's immediately open a parenthesis on the visual representation of the character's health: the interface does not have a classic bar that empties as we suffer blows, but the protagonist sees parts of his body ~disappear~ (arms and legs) which, once restored using the aura, they will be naked and no longer covered by clothing. A small touch of class for an idea very well represented visually. Challenge yourself It is certainly not the style that Malicious lacks, on the contrary the artistic code of the game is indisputable and the compactness of its structure only highlights it further. The five immediately available scenarios, which can be tackled in the order we prefer (but with a degree of difficulty that increases as we pass from one to the other), are in fact very well characterized: Triumphal Square is a sort of medieval village , a city center in whose exact center stands a statue that comes to life and that we have to tear apart, while an army of soldiers surrounds us on all sides, trying to weaken our defenses, in the midst of walls that end up falling apart in the fury of the battle; Royal Battle Escort, on the other hand, is a platform suspended in the clouds, a sort of huge flying ship that continues to target us with its cannons (if we don't destroy them, of course) while a fearsome knight with a spear (a large minigun) and shield targets us with its gusts; Battlefield of Yore is the location that perhaps gives the greatest sensation of ~wideness~ among those available, because the map is entirely passable and the spaces are really large, with towers to be blown up, self-propelled attack positions and opponents of all sorts that they stand in defense of a giant armored quadruped; Forbidden Floor, on the other hand, is a dark place, the hall of a large castle where a anything but hospitable landlady awaits us, or rather an extremely skilled and elusive warrior, in all probability the strongest boss in the game; Forsaken Library, on the other hand, stands as the simplest scenario to carry out because the ferocious ~wolf~ that inhabits it is on balance the only opponent we will have to worry about, considering that his ~helpers~ will search all time to avoid our blows. After completing all five stages, a sixth scenario is unlocked that will put you even more to the test... Playstation 3 trophies There are eleven trophies made available to Malicious, and getting them all is not a simple undertaking. Beyond the trophies that are unlocked by completing the game, in fact, most require the completion of particular objectives: eliminate 10,000 enemies, chain a hundred shots, defeat a boss without ever resorting to parrying, carry out all the counters and so on . Dark cloak The order in which we decide to tackle the stages is very important, because each defeated boss implies the acquisition of a new skill for our character, a skill that perhaps can make it easier for us to defeat another boss. The cloak, as mentioned at the beginning, allows us to hit enemies in various ways, basically changing shape: it can emit a shower of bullets, transform into two big fists, a powerful spear or a sword, with different combos from time to time time and peculiar capabilities that make one solution more suitable than the other depending on the scenario. The gameplay encourages us to experiment, it does not feed us an infinite list of combinations and indeed, in the end, it gives us a relatively poor repertoire. Certainly, however, the impossibleThe ability to change attack on the fly (you have to press one of the four directions of the d-pad to do it) while parrying or performing a combo makes the experience a bit cumbersome. And then there's the question of the camera and the lock-on, which represent two major limitations for Malicious: the first happily tends to go crazy, you always have to adjust it by hand and it's not a simple practice, if we find ourselves in the middle of a hellish bedlam; the second allows us to hook (with a quick double pressure of the R1 backbone) the boss on duty and therefore direct the attacks in his direction, but every now and then it happens that we want to ~unhook~ and there are pains, because the system necessarily asks us for a other target instead of simply turning off the ~sight~. The final sensation is of being faced with a title that rivals Ninja Gaiden in (negative) terms of visual management. The last words for the technical sector, which stands out as already mentioned for the graphic style and attention to detail (too bad only for the drops in the frame rate during the most complicated situations), and is accompanied by really beautiful orchestral music.", "date": "2012-03-28", "grade": "7.0"}
