{"name": "Naruto: The Broken Bond - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-the-broken-bond-recensione.html", "text": "Blood Brothers Broken Bond picks up exactly where the first chapter left off. The Leaf Village has been destroyed and the friendship-rivalry between Sasuke and Naruto continues through ups and downs along a path full of dangers and dozens of fights up to the end of the first television series. The narration of the plot is entrusted this time to scenes created with the game engine, which integrate in a much more natural way than the videos used previously, and, thanks also to the many more hours available, anyone can follow the story, even not knowing the manga by heart. Our Ninja begins his adventure with the previously acquired skills already available, now ready to learn new techniques that will lead him to be, sooner or later, the new Hokage of the village. This approach, completely coherent from a logical/narrative point of view, is a bit unsettling at first, given that there isn't any kind of tutorial, as if to assume that whoever tries this Broken Bond must have played the first chapter, already knowing how to use combos and special techniques. So after the beginning (one soon discovers a gym in which to unlock further combos and become familiar with the fighting game mechanics), the structure is the same, with Naruto facing the quests that are entrusted to him from time to time by his masters and the Hokage and taking him around the forest, collecting items and beating up thieves, assassin ninjas and the main antagonists of the series. The reward for each mission is given in money and reputation points. With money and gold coins, hidden everywhere, you can buy items, healing pills to be used even during fights, and scrolls to enhance attack and defense characteristics. With the reputation points, Naruto's statistics are improved, increasing his vital points, the chakra available to perform the techniques, the strength and effectiveness of the combos. The most important novelty of this sequel, in addition to a greater number of types of sub-quests and a series of sub-games with which to acquire further reputation points, is given by the possibility of commanding, in addition to Naruto, even his friends with their skills and special techniques. This, both to solve the puzzles scattered throughout all the maps that must be crossed for the various missions, and for the fights, in which the moves to be performed in combination with appropriate keystrokes make their debut. The first aspect is decidedly interesting, with Naruto who, for example, uses the multiplication technique to create human bridges, which other characters will be able to exploit with their powers to get over cliffs and then activate switches and continue the adventure. Broken Bond is however a game also designed for a younger audience, and, therefore, cannot push too much on the difficulty accelerator, so much so that this side of the gameplay is barely mentioned, with a couple of combinations of powers that are repeated for the much of the time, leaving the feeling that the designers could have had many other arrows at their disposal. The experience is fun anyway, provided you like the atmosphere of the series and the missions whose structure is almost always the one that leads Naruto to collect objects to deliver them to someone who requests them. This time, however, the game is much longer, given that to finish it, without dwelling too much on the side quests, you need between 12 and 15 hours, not counting the missions related to the supporting characters and the real beat'em up modes . The road of the Ninja Ubisoft literally blew up Naruto's punch-hard section, with 30 playable and unlockable characters, even more beautiful animations and 60 frames per second that give the whole game a real anime look. The enemies to be faced in the random fights during the exploration phases are also much more varied, which, however, cannot be said of the moves, some of which are evidently repeated for a good part of the characters (especially the grips and certain combos recur very often). The large number of wrestlers, among other things, is not the result of an adequate balancing act, given that certain characters are clearly stronger than others, and the thing comes out in an overbearing way both when playing locally against friends , both when playing online, where there are also some lag problems. The fact remains that the various modes and Naruto, like beat'em up itself, are perfectly enjoyable, so as to bring the game to really good levels of longevity that fully repay the purchase price. As mentioned, you have to get in tune with the characters and atmosphere, because you spend your time shooting anywaythrough forests, chasing ninjas and collecting plants and wooden objects in a slightly too simplistic way, but it is undoubtedly fun. Then considering the addition of the mini-games, in which to excel to obtain reputation points, the various quests related to the supporting actors and the races among the trees (full-speed sequences from one branch of the forests to another, in which dizzying speeds are reached) , there's plenty to play for hours. Turning a blind eye to a slightly slender structure. The road of the Ninja To all souls! Naruto's graphics engine has been further refined. The lights and textures have been improved, the Vsync problems from the first chapter have been fixed and many more areas have been created to explore. Apart from the Villaggio della Foglia, however, truly suggestive locations continue to be missing, in which the team's graphic designers, truly gifted, could have shown off their obvious skills. Most of the time is spent wandering through well-kept but somewhat anonymous trees and forests, which will not be a problem for manga lovers, but which could bore everyone else. The care placed in the village area stands out clearly from the rest of the world, which is in any case characterized excellently, managing to recreate in all respects the sensations that the original series transmits. A separate mention should be made for the animations of some of the special techniques during the fights, which are often able to leave you speechless due to the spectacularity with which they are made. Broken Bond is all subtitled in Italian, with the possibility of playing listening to the original voices of the Japanese anime. Feature requested loudly by fans since the first episode and which this time is available from the beginning, without having to download additional content from Xbox Live later. Comment Ubisoft has capitalized on much of the criticism leveled at the first Naruto, released last fall. The story is told in a more understandable way for everyone, longevity has increased, as well as the type of quests and missions to be accomplished. Some of the innovations introduced, such as the combined use of the powers of the various characters, are very interesting, but they are hardly exploited, when instead they could have made the young ninja take a leap towards definitive consecration in the world of action rpg and, in the long run, the action can get a bit repetitive. Broken Bond is still a good game, perfect for Naruto fans and for spending Christmas in front of the TV, especially if you love manga and hard hitting. Provided you don't look for the depth and variety of structure that other titles are able to offer in this period. Pros The world of Naruto Graphics and animations Longevity The number of characters Cons A bit repetitive The underused combinations of powers Unbalanced characters Xbox 360 - Goals Completing the game, collecting half of the coins, you get around 400 goal points. To exceed 600, just play a little fighting game mode and devote yourself to the simplest quests such as perfecting racing among the trees. To get to 1000, however, you have to play a lot online and complete all the missions related to the secondary characters and this takes quite a bit of time.", "date": "2008-12-01", "grade": null}
