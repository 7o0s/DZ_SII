In the universe of the title, the very genesis of the world, including the human race, can be traced back to the pure-blood dragons, long gone but whose existence is revealed in the descendants who populate the world. Creatures of different shapes and sizes, halfway between extremely intelligent animals and monsters of immense power whose bond with humans, almost symbiotic, makes them invaluable companions, ready to take on the weight of a brave fighter to face threats and challenges in quantity. For the rest, the basic structure of Dragon's Prophet is common to that of many MMOs with automatic aiming, classic skills and a large bar where to place them. But the action still plays a part thanks to the implementation of dodging, sprinting and double jumping, all elements that increase the intensity of the fight and make the use of keyboard shortcuts more useful than in other such titles. Furthermore, Dragon's Prophet includes a rich crafting, not complex but very varied, and we don't even miss housing or the possibility for players to buy a plot of land, place a house there and furnish it. In Dragon's Prophet man's best friend has scales, a mouth full of teeth and magical powers The special ingredient Dragon's Prophet welcomes us with a tutorial that introduces us to three different types of opponents and contextualizes our role in the world. During the introductory battle, the first opponents are anthropomorphic and weak, the second formless greenish torpedoes and in the end the inevitable dragon with evil traits appears that allows us to become familiar with the dodging system. The latter is increasingly present in MMOs, and we are not surprised, given that it increases the thickness of the gameplay without forcing the developers to implement a physics-based aiming and combat system. On the other hand, such a system requires enormous resources, not within everyone's reach, and is subject to a long series of problems which include problems related to the difference in connectivity between the players. While with a high ping a realistic aiming system is difficult, if not impossible, to master, the auto-aim in Dragon's Prophet, truly automatic and not very easy to tame, allows even those with a less than excellent connection to enjoy almost fully the gaming experience. Dragon's Prophet, in essence, is a classic MMORPG enhanced by the addition of dragons which, while incorporating functions already seen elsewhere, represent the distinctive element of the Runewake title. Dragons can complete missions, they can fight each other and obviously evolve, training even while the player is busy elsewhere. Furthermore, they add to the title the collecting component with over three hundred potential typologies different in appearance and potential. Some creature traits are constant, with five archetypes making the main differences, while others, such as characteristics and appearance, vary wildly. Among these we find speed, a fundamental element to move more and more quickly and to enjoy the possibility of riding one's own creature more and more, and skills of various kinds that can help the player both in PvP and in PvE, allowing a player to rare self-sufficiency. Some dragons, in fact, possess healing abilities and this factor makes life easier for those who play alone, which is absolutely feasible thanks to the possibility of choosing the difficulty of the challenge when facing a dungeon. Unfortunately these, despite being quite numerous, offer rather trivial experiences, like quests and public events, with little news compared to what has already been seen in the now immense sea of MMOs. But it is clear that the developers have decided to focus on dragons, complete with a mini-game to face to tame them, neglecting, however, a large part of the monsters. In fact, excluding the bosses, the standard mobs are not particularly inspired or intelligent and end up debasing the action in defiance of the greater possibilities of movement granted to the characters of Dragon's Prophet. Thankfully, enhancing the action is infrastructure-backed PvP that allows alliances to battle it out in areas where players can build their own homes. The developers are still working on this aspect and have promised to expand its weight with respect to the game mechanics but the action is quite fun. The real difference compared to the average MMO offering is that all players have a dragon and can also use it as a mount onceonce the skill is unlocked. Dodge and double jump obviously also influence the fight between players which, thanks to the dragons that double the effective number of fighters, is decidedly intense. Potential alone is not enough Even if the dragons can recover resources for the player and train in passive mode if housed in a stable, the evolution of the character is linked to the classic grinding which is rather slow and made even more boring by enemies and not exciting challenges. As in many free-to-play games, the growth of our avatar can be speeded up by putting a hand in the wallet, but bonuses and items are not the only items that can be purchased. In fact, the possibility of acquiring customizable specializations, unlocking slots for dragons, teleporting and expanding the inventory also depend on the bank account. These are not necessary elements to fully enjoy the title, which places no limits on the growth of dragons and characters, but the benefits are significant enough to make this constraint rather unpleasant. If nothing else, the purchased items cannot be worn immediately and it is necessary to wait a certain level to access the equipment included in the purchasable packs. A limit, the latter, which guarantees a minimum balance in the growth phase but which obviously no longer exists once the highest levels have been reached. There are four classes available and they range from the classic ranger to the even more classic warrior passing through the magician and the inevitable curator who in the Dragon's Prophet universe is capable of defending himself in a more than dignified way. But Dragon's Prophet does not pigeonhole the characters the roles carved in stone and does not base the evolution of the characters on the classic skill tree but allows you to draw from a rich pile. There are, inevitably, some limits but the freedom is considerable and the MMO, in contrast with most modern games based on leveling up, also leaves the player the freedom to choose which characteristics to increase in order to allow the creation of a custom character. And this degree of freedom also extends to the aesthetic sector with various outfits to choose from and different physical traits with which to customize the appearance of our avatar. An aspect that, in game, is quite pleasant. The graphics, in fact, show off various well-made elements such as, in fact, the models of the characters to which are added cities that are well differentiated from each other and characterized by not too trivial architectures. To this we must add fascinating glimpses typical of oriental MMOs with spinning mills, acceptable quality textures, dragons crossing the sky and some of the houses that players can build are decidedly spectacular. However, there is no novelty whatsoever and the design of the wild areas is devoid of interesting ideas. Whole areas are mere containers of monsters without an if and without a but that are exclusively functional to the accumulation of experience. On the other hand, there are plenty of glitches, disappearances, image distortions between cutscenes. Furthermore, the interlude scenes leave much to be desired and the interpenetrations are a constant. A lack of refinement that invalidates the whole experience even if, given the evolving nature of the title, it should improve from patch to patch. But, in the current state of things it is even possible to swim up the waterfalls, like a salmon. Too bad Dragon's Prophet is not a fish-focused MMO but dragons.", "date": "2013-10-11", "grade": "6.0"}
