{"name": "Spider-Man 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-3_a.html", "text": "Having been distributed before the release of the film in theaters, Spider-Man 3 presents a narrative structure so fearful of leading to any spoilers that it is almost non-existent: the 14 levels that make up the adventure are therefore almost totally unrelated to each other, and individual mission objectives appear hazy at best. In any case, we will certainly not excessively criticize a mobile title like Spider-Man 3 for its own deficiencies regarding the storyline, given the chronic dislike of mobile phones for minimally elaborated or original plots: we will instead focus on the gameplay and technical realization of the Sony Online Entertainment product , supplied at the right point with questionable elements. Let's start right from the cosmetics of Spider-Man 3, to all intents and purposes rather bare and dated: the scenarios are very anonymous, squared and debased by a palette of dull colors, while the sprites of Spidey and the various enemies on the screen do not shine by definition and animation quality, although generally acceptable. Despite the picture just described, Spider-Man 3 even allowed himself to shoot on the Nokia N70 that we used for the review, a clear sign of not really flawless programming. Not even the sound escapes the pillory, being made up only of very spartan music which fortunately ends in a short time leaving a perfect silence. But let's move on to the playful structure of Spider-Man 3, which would seem to be the hackneyed one of a two-dimensional action game: this is indeed the case, and the user finds himself having to repeat what he has already done millions of times in as many identical products. You run, jump, climb walls and press the OK key to throw balls of cobwebs or beat up enemies with your bare hands using basic combos. The far from original level design and the boring fights would inexorably drag Spider-Man 3 into the abyss, were it not for two elements that improve the situation a bit. These are respectively spidey's ability to use his cobwebs as a liana (an aspect that makes the crossing of the various levels at least a little more dynamic) and the presence in some advanced stages of the phantom black suit seen in the film. In this capacity, Spider-Man's power increases considerably, but at the same time it is necessary to periodically ~recharge~ by collecting black orbs scattered here and there. Spider-Man 3 is basically all here: if we exclude a handful of indigestible boss-fights, some moves that can be achieved with simple key combinations and certain game segments in which you have to abandon the fisticuffs to save civilians, the title trudges along this tenor until the conclusion.
