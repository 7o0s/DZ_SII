{"name": "Conflict Global Storm - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-global-storm-recensione.html", "text": "The Xbox version immediately appears to be the primary one, also resulting very pleasant to look at Compare versions On the playability side, in addition to the aforementioned novelty of cooperation, the Pivotal have thrown themselves body and soul into improving the artificial intelligence routines of the CPU. Our teammates react to our movements and actions. For example, if we find ourselves stationed behind a bush and start shooting enemies, our companions will come out all together, supporting our rain of fire. Or again, if we notice an enemy post in front of us and decide to surround it, the CPU automatically directs the other members of the group to leave the main road and blend into the surrounding undergrowth. After a short initial tutorial, the game will teach us how to issue some simple orders to our subordinates. The improvement of the intelligence of the CPU often has appreciable effects, other times not remarkable, just as many times it has no effect. The free will of our comrades would seem to have random components. In the sense that sometimes they are really stupid, they go black out, they crash or they don't know what to do. Certainly much better than the previous chapters, in any case. Country you go, terrorist you find What is now to be considered a series, that of ~Global~ by Pivotal studios, returns to our screens, abandoning the historical war scenarios to finally arrive at the present day. The original title of the project was actually ~Global Terror~, changed in the running because it was considered too misleading (it looked almost like a new survival horror?). The political situation that awaits us is today's one, with great nuclear powers scattered all over the world, a world threatened by dozens of terrorist groups now too ambitious and dangerous. Those who have already played the prequels, Conflict Vietnam and Desert Storm, will know how much the developers care about the general realism of their works. Pivotal spares us nothing: suffering, injuries, pain and blood are guaranteed. Pivotal spares us nothing: suffering, injuries, pain and blood are guaranteed Country you go, terrorist you find We also remember very well how much the game settings had been taken care of, but in the same way they were fairly monotonous in their succession of always the same colors. In Global Storm, fortunately (for playful purposes) our military action has the whole world as a backdrop, since terrorism is not an ~army~ to fight, each country can be suitable as a backdrop to our war confrontation and therefore we will find ourselves to ~flush out~ paramilitary organizations around the planet, from Korean cities to the Colombian woods of drug trafficking, up to the frozen mountains of Pakistan. Conflict Global Storm is a latecomer to the war simulator scene which took off with the sequential release of Vietcong, Shellshock Nam and Conflict Desert Storm, which the developers of Global Storm were the authors of. This saturation of the market given by the flood of tactical militarism has perhaps risked boring gamers with often mediocre, other times pleasant products and we have rarely seen the achievement of playability peaks. Global Storm stands as an ideal sequel to Desert Storm, in a world of the near future where terrorism has now taken hold all over the world, from Korea to Colombia, passing through the snowy mountains of Kashmir. And the protagonists are always them: Bradley, Foley, Connors and Jones. Comment Global Storm brings with it several improvements and succulent new features such as the cooperative mode and the online mode. However, all this is to be limited to its context, as these ~upgrades~ are nowadays almost a duty, representing features now used by many video games and for a long time. It would therefore be fair to call them updates, rather than news. The developer Pivotal now seems to want to specialize in war simulators, and slowly every sector of their games, from the graphic to the playable one, undergoes ~slight~ improvements. The result is appreciable but this is certainly not enough to create a real masterpiece, marginalizing the products of ~Conflict~ to mediocre games to play and good games to watch. Those who are satisfied enjoy, they say. But Pivotal doesn't have to be satisfied or feel satisfied, because there is a long way to go. Pros: Very diverse game environments Enhanced artificial intelligence Online co-op Cons: Technically unfair Multiplayer snaps are a beauty Cutthroat competition in the war simulator market Compare versions YouAll these new settings are made with a much greater number of polygons than the prequels, thanks also to a completely new graphics engine. The Xbox version immediately appears to be the primary one, also resulting very pleasant to look at. It soon becomes clear that Global Storm's engine has an Xbox origin, which also seems better optimized than its PC counterpart. The PlayStation2 version, as expected, suffers from numerous slowdowns in the busiest situations, with regard to the number of polygons used there is no complaint, rather the quality of the same is not comparable to the other versions, resulting rather dull and with washed out textures . The PlayStation2 engine also seems to suffer particularly in multiplayer situations with split screen, when the game becomes even unmanageable due to a jerky camera that prohibits straight and precise aiming. The multiplayer is precisely one of the other novelties of the game. With a friend we can try our hand at a cooperative split screen, or online with a distant friend. The game is enjoyable connected to the Internet, and the slowdowns are not too annoying because they are sporadic and of short intensity. Both the Xbox and Sony versions benefit from online co-op, even if the two versions are not ~compatible~ with each other.", "date": "2005-10-17", "grade": null}
