{"name": "Little Nightmares: Complete Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199472-little-nightmares-complete-edition-little-nightmares-complete-edition-la-recensione-per-switch.html", "text": "Recently it seems that the horror industry has rediscovered infancy and childhood as elements on which to make particular leverage to push the limits of fear, breaking into areas that have always represented safe havens and thus amplifying the restlessness which arises from the loss of reference points. It is an argument that is exploited treading hand, with the awareness of presenting something ~scandalous~, but the principle is ancient and can also be found in the most classic fairy tales, where fear above all had an educational and cathartic value. The beauty is that it still works and the characteristic restlessness of Little Nightmares is based on this, a game that demonstrates how childhood fears are always valid as they are ancestral and linked to human nature. We are not dealing with pure horror because the touch is always light in outlining the strange world in which Sei finds himself, in spite of himself, having to escape strange aberrations, but there is a particular tension that derives from the decadent aspect of the settings , by the deformity of the ~grown-ups~ and by the ruthlessness with which the tenants of the underwater structure seem to rage against the little prisoners. The balance in dosing grotesque, horror and even tender elements, in some respects, demonstrates a remarkable stylistic mastery on the part of the Tarsier Studios team despite being faced with a first work, and the atmospheres of Little Nightmares remain easily impressed, giving it a strong identity also in relation to many genre productions and despite game solutions that often seem to derive from similar titles, such as Playdead games. It is a set that works and further squares the circle in this Complete Edition, which solves one of the main defects of the original - its brevity - also proposing the expansions of the ~The Secrets of the Fauci~ series in a single solution. Big little nightmares We have already expressed ourselves on the original version in last year's review, to which we refer for a more accurate examination, limiting ourselves here to evaluating the entire experience proposed with the Complete Edition and in particular the Switch version that we tested. The entire journey of Sei and the parallel one of the Fugitive are united by absolute silence, taking place without a single word spent to explain something about the characters, the setting and the reasons that led the protagonists to this situation, but there is none a great need because the fundamental elements of the narrative emerge clearly from what happens on the screen. There is only the urgency of the immediate and the need to escape the dangers and somehow seek a way out of the nightmare. The story therefore remains extremely enigmatic even once both paths have been completed, remaining faithful to the particular artistic vision of the Swedish team, which has decided to leave the deductions to the player. The path has allegorical aspects but for the purposes of the game it has the merit of placing us in front of a series of locations scattered with puzzles to be solved simply to advance: passing a door, activating a switch and escaping some disturbing presence are actions to be undertaken without too many explanations, as perhaps a witty little girl would do who sees a way out in the face of unspeakable horrors. We proceed a little by trial and error but it is always quite clear which path to follow and the elements with which to interact to reach the objective, moreover the looming presence of the various mysterious guests of the Fauci forces us to never let our guard down, also imposing sudden changes of pace to the action with the need to hide and flee often becoming immediate. The integration of the three chapters dedicated to the Fugitive, previously distributed as DLC, enriches the world of Little Nightmares by providing a deeper insight into some rather colorful characters that we find ourselves facing: the Granny, the Keeper and above all the Lady. As usual, the story has nothing explicit, but the addition of these parts is important to broaden the game solutions and above all to expand the knowledge of the settings and the strange ~lore~ of the Maw, in particular by throwing some light on the enigmatic figure of the Lady. A memorable journey There is no doubt that the characterizing element of Little Nightmares is its artistic direction, which manages to make a path that in purely playful terms does not present particular elements of originality truly memorable. The rendering capabilities of the Unreal Engine 4 are masterfully exploited in the use of contrasts between dynamic lights and shadows and in the rendering ofmaterials, which plays an important role in the construction of the world of the Maw, with its almost twilight attention to common and dilapidated objects. The disorienting effect that emerges from the difference in scale between Six and the elements of the scenario which amplifies the feeling of disorientation and impotence, the impressive care in the construction of the sets but above all the style with which the setting and characters are created, staging a world decadent, grotesque and obscure, they give a very strong identity to this adventure, imprinting the whole journey on an atmosphere that remains with us for a long time even after the conclusion of the game, which to tell the truth comes perhaps too quickly. The constant relationship with the scenarios is amplified by good physics management, which allows you to interact with many of the objects represented in a realistic and sensible way, enriching the gameplay with interesting and credible solutions for solving the various puzzles, all within a context that increasingly assumes the characteristics of a lucid nightmare. The presence of the inevitable collectibles plays its role in stimulating the exploration of the settings, but it is above all the integration of the additional contents on the Secrets of the Maw that significantly enriches the contents of this edition of Little Nightmares, allowing you to immediately choose between the history of Sei and that of the Fugitive. The conversion on Switch keeps the technical characteristics of the original largely unchanged: in the portable version something is inexorably lost, with the significant lowering of the resolution and contrast which slightly dilutes the effect of wonder arising from the settings, but the possibility to face the adventure under the covers, for example, is an experience that we really recommend to everyone.", "date": "2018-05-20", "grade": "8.2"}
