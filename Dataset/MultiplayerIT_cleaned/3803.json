Tetris 99 is simply brilliant, in the sense of a brilliant idea realized with great simplicity and keeping intact the immediacy typical of the original puzzle, as we see in this review. In an excellent coincidence of events, within a few months we are witnessing a return to strength of the game in question, demonstrating how its concept is still perfectly suited to the times and practically eternal, in particular through two projects that arise a bit at the antipodes, going to deepen different aspects, however, already present in a nutshell within the original Tetris. On the one hand Tetris Effect leverages the game's ability to immerse us in its mechanics at a deep level, marking with its captivating and complex graphic sector the famous abstraction effect that can strike those who insert themselves deeply into the fabulous tetrominoes joints . On the other hand there is Tetris 99, which pushes on other aspects of the classic game that have remained valid and re-proposed almost unchanged nowadays. The creature of Arika and Nintendo is much more rigorous in the graphic representation and in the re-proposition of the classic mechanics, but relies on the competition, which is an often underestimated element in puzzle games, thus shifting the fulcrum of the action from the resistance and therefore from the challenge against themselves, essentially, in direct confrontation with other players. However, it goes beyond the simple standard multiplayer by connecting, with a brilliant move also from a communicative point of view, to the fashion of the battle royale currently in vogue and proposing a mass clash between 99 online players. The union between Tetris and online multiplayer The idea of a battle royale applied to Tetris may seem absurd, but that's only until you've played the game in question for the first time, after which it becomes the most natural thing in the world. The execution is very simple: it is a question of playing Tetris in parallel with 98 other people, whose screens can be seen - with a solution that is actually very nice, as well as strategic - in the background on the sides of our grid. At the moment there is only one game mode, or the battle royale in question: an ~all against all~ in which whoever remains the last in the game wins while all the others have reached the KO for total filling of the blocks on the screen. The rumor has popped up these days, starting from some files discovered in the code by some data miners, of new modes that could be arriving between team battles, one against bots and a classic marathon, interesting solutions that would add lifeblood to Tetris 99, but for now the game also copes very well with its only game mode. One would think that a possible expansion of game solutions could take place through paid DLC, given the free base of Tetris 99 which seems to clash a bit with Nintendo's traditions, but this is another matter: the fact is that, already as much as it offers now, Tetris 99 fulfills a particular function, which is to attract people to subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online. In fact, the free launch of the game could play an important promotional function within the new Nintendo service, given the high-sounding name it carries, capable of attracting a truly large audience. Given the obligatory subscription to access it, Tetris 99 could represent the bridgehead for attracting new users within Nintendo Switch Online, becoming a sort of real killer application for the service, considering that the introduction of the cost per retrospectively online multiplayer is always a difficult solution to get users to accept if you don't offer them some truly substantial pluses. Last man standing The mechanics of the puzzle are always the same and an explanation seems almost superfluous at this point, also because Tetris 99 is perhaps one of the most faithful variants to the original seen in recent years. The new elements are largely linked to the online multiplayer context, which introduces some additional dynamics to be taken into consideration in the strategic approach to interlocking tetrominoes. Among these, the one that most closely concerns the basic mechanics is the ppossibility of ~setting aside~ a piece, and then re-proposing it with the simple pressure of a text at the moment that seems most appropriate to us, while the other added features have mostly ~aggressive~ effects towards the other players. The drag race is in fact actively modified by the presence of the other 98 competitors in the game, as the elimination of the lines is reflected in the transfer of ~junk blocks~ to the other players' screens. This can happen in various ways, depending on the pre-set approach that we choose to implement from time to time: you can choose to attack those in greater difficulty (~KO~ option), a rather evil solution but which can earn us medals, since these are assigned with the direct elimination of the opponents, or on the contrary we can concentrate the attacks against who is winning (~Medals~ option), or maintain a balanced approach by simply returning fire with ~Counterattack~. In addition to these options, it is possible to individually select any opponent in the game on which to converge our junk blocks, simply by touching it on the touch screen or selecting it with the stick. All this generates a real battle between the players, who don't limit themselves to testing their resistance in parallel and detached tests, but find themselves effectively ~fighting~ with blocks, with important reflections in the pace of the game and in the classic dynamic of the puzzle. Classic Tetris variegated to multiplayer The developers of the Arika team have opted for a representation that is as simple and clean as possible, thus going, also in this case, in the opposite direction to what has been seen in other reinterpretations of the classic such as Tetris Effect. In Tetris 99 what stands out above all is the clarity, because in a competitive context the reading of the action must always be immediate and without disturbing elements. For this we are faced with one of the most faithful reproductions of the typical Tetris style, with the only addition given by the particular background wall full of tiny reproductions of the screens of the other players in the game. In addition to online grafts, there are no particular mechanical additions to the basic structure to report, except for a certain attention to T-spins, which are reflected here in particularly powerful attacks against opponents. For those unfamiliar with them, T-Spins are moves that require a certain degree of skill in Tetris: it involves exploiting the rotation of the pieces in order to place them in seemingly impossible positions, which can be reached instead by rotating the tetrominoes to the desired point . Lines cleared with these moves result in more Junk Blocks to be distributed to opponents, with progressive effects from single to double to triple T-Spins. To manage techniques of this kind, there is above all a need for expository clarity and a reactive control system, with both objectives largely achieved by Tetris 99. Also noteworthy is the stability of the connection and also the speed in organizing the match despite the research of 98 opponents, also because the servers seem very crowded at the moment. Finally, a special mention must be made for the soundtrack, which re-proposes the classic tune but within a sort of 90s dance remix capable of eliciting even a few smiles.", "date": "2019-02-20", "grade": "8.5"}
