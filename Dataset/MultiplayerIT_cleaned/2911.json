That was a still fresh world of exponent RPGs like Skyrim and 38 Studios' particular hybrid project seemed more of a gamble than anything else. Bringing together minds of the caliber of R. A. Salvatore (world-famous fantasy author), Todd Mcfarlane (designer of Spawn) and Ken Rolston (designer of The Elder Scrolls) the newborn studio attempted the particular road of the action role-playing game, combining the classic features of the genre to a structure that very well mixed hack 'n' slash combat and MMORPG. The result, albeit far from the great commercial success, surprised more or less all those who crossed their path with the game, leaving behind a trail of important and high-sounding acclaim. After eight years and following the tradition of recovering the IP of THQ Nordic , a (slightly) revised and corrected reissue is back on the market, which also promises the arrival of a totally new expansion for 2021. In this review of Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning we tell you if, in our opinion, it is still worth the worth returning to the immense world of the title. A hero without a precise destiny When it comes to fantasy RPGs it is evident how the nature of the hero's journey can easily find itself at the center of the plot. Whether it's a title with a well-defined protagonist, or on the contrary an alter ego built entirely by the player, the fate of our playful counterpart is often the center of the story. As it is easy to imagine this is also valid for Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, but all with the particularity of putting us in the shoes of a character with no memory, lost in a desolate land and just returned from the dead. First real successful resurrection experiment, one's destiny is so uncertain and smoky that not even the seers are able to read it, thus transforming us into the most important creature of the kingdom. soon behind the stereotypes of the genre, so as to build a background of the articulated and suggestive universe. The particular nature of the production required this work to turn into a great single player introduction to the next MMORPG Copernicus, written by Salvatore on the basis of his idea on a universe with ten thousand years of history behind it. What is still today a great a pity is the failure to deepen this background, which never went through due to the failure of the development team and the lack of commercial success. Despite this sore point, to anyone who has the desire and perseverance to explore everywhere and pay attention to documents and insights into the dialogues, Kingdoms of Amalur will be able to give various satisfactions. A multifaceted gameplay Even today, together with Dragon's Dogma, we don't struggle to consider Amalur's gameplay as one of the best ARPGs of our time. The team's ability to combine the basics of the purest action RPG with colorful loot fever together create an addictive formula. We first, in the abundant fifteen hours spent again in the company of the title, cannot hide that we have fallen into the trap of searching for the best loot on more than one occasion. Obviously, for a truly exhaustive review of all the game's mechanics, we refer you to that of the original, deep and detailed to the right point, while today we will focus on the experience given by the remastered. It is precisely from the point of view of the gameplay, rather than from the technical one, that we see the tweaks developed for this re-edition . Let's not hide that overall we would have expected some better revisions, at least of those details that are really difficult to digest in the light of 2020, but it would be unfair not to reward some small tricks that have changed the user experience. Let's start with one of the most talked about elements at the time of the original release: balance. Kingdoms of Amalur has always had its ups and downs in terms of difficulty. In the original version, once you entered a dungeon, it was fixed on the level suitable for the player at that moment, then preventing you from rebalancing the experience during the progress. The same was true for loot and the various chests salvageable in the field. In this new version we have tried to satisfy the players' desire for a challenge, making sure that the level is updated with each entry and exit and also adding a new Very Difficult difficulty, capable of drastically raising the challenge of the game. great the 38 Studios title was its depth. Anything but simple gesturesking, with a very limited number of skill points to spend and supported by a system of trainers and books that could be lost forever, if not used in the right time window. Growth management, skills (which are now easier to control via pad thanks to the double page that can be consulted quickly via the front keys), the choice of one's destiny among the myriads available thanks to the tarot cards; as well as the progression of the role-playing aspect, the options relating to one's karma, the will to steal or remain peaceful and all the characteristics that make the genre great are present in this work. Indeed, it is strange to see such a sketchy and limited character editor, precisely in light of the depth of all the other features. Speaking of growth, what we would have preferred to see retouched are the menus in general. Clear and direct but aesthetically old-fashioned and poorly adapted to high definition, with huge screen HUDs that can be reduced to a size that is almost difficult to focus on. The remastered technique It is precisely from a technical point of view that the best qualities and worst defects of this re-edition can be seen. The purely graphic aspect, already dated at the time of its original release, comes out with all broken bones, putting on the plate an intriguing style and somehow close to that of a World of Warcraft, but at the same time plagued by a count polygonal and lighting really difficult to digest today. From this point of view, even if the investment had proved to be much more important, the idea of a remake as done recently for Destroy All Humans by THQ Nordic itself certainly would not have hurt. On the other hand, it is the performances that are drastically changed. Finally seeing Kingdoms of Amalur at 60 fps granite where too many times the drops gripped the original, is a satisfaction that alone could be worth the ticket price. It didn't go well in the same way for the uploads, still too long even on PCs and even on SSDs for a title made up of a huge world but divided into macro-areas and which requires uploads at every move or even just to enter a any shop or inn. The sound sector is excellent, which today as then worthily accompanies the hero's journey up to the discovery of his destiny and the world of Amalur.", "date": "2020-09-07", "grade": "8.5"}
