{"name": "Silverfall - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silverfall-recensione.html", "text": "Hack&Slash with style The sentence that gives the title to this paragraph is the same used by MonteCristo to advertise Silverfall, which, we must admit, shows all its style from the very first glance: the cel shading graphics, certainly atypical for an H&S, contributed in the months preceding the release of the game to create enough curiosity within the online communities, and the time has finally come to know if this attention has been well placed or not. After all, MonteCristo has by now accustomed everyone to his attempts to propose something original, courageously probing the terrain with titles such as War on Terror, Medieval Lords and even the recent City Life, to rewrite the laws of the various genres called in question, obtaining fluctuating results which in any case did not prejudice the appreciation for the efforts produced by the French developer. When magic and technology merge The world in which the adventure narrated in Silverfall unfolds is certainly atypical: in fact, in it we find the ancient magical arts, used since ancient times, which are contrasted with a technology very similar to that of our days, with so much of firearms and various types of machinery. Within this scenario, the population splits with conflicting opinions within the two philosophies (traditionalist and modernist), degenerating into a conflict that razes the city of Silverfall, whose population ends up taking refuge in a swamp nearby, from which he will try to launch a counterattack against the forces of evil rampant within the realm. In this context we find ourselves creating our hero, to whom we give a name and a decidedly reduced number of features (race, appearance, hairstyle, skin and hair color, and finally gender), even for a game that does not pretend to be maximum RPG depth: the ability to customize your character more would certainly have helped to make the player's involvement with him greater and, given the existence of the online mode, to see a certain number of variations within the same race, rather than a series of virtually identical characters. Speaking of available races, the player has the possibility to choose between 4 of them: Humans, Elves, Trolls and Goblins, which faithfully reflect the classic stereotypes of fantasy, however uniting in the same armies to fight against the forces of evil, where we find monsters of various types, also influenced by the coexistence of magic and technology; we will find classic creatures such as zombies and trolls, but also humanoids ~equipped~ with cannons and other enemies resulting from mechanical creations. When magic and technology merge we have a tree system available that is quite close to that of World of WarCraft Experience and levels Having already talked about the creation of the character, let's now see how this is destined to grow: in full RPG style we find the experience bar and levels to reach, for a maximum of 80, through which to acquire new knowledge and increase the values of the attributes . The latter are practically reduced to the bare minimum, namely Strength, Fitness, Intelligence and Agility, which will roughly influence the power in melee attacks, the life points, the mana ones (in Silverfall called power) and the ability in score critical hits. As far as knowledge is concerned, however, we have a tree system available that is quite close to that of World of WarCraft: through three main branches (Combat, Magic and Other) we will have to distribute the 4 points that will be assigned to us at each level advancement, thus going to identify the class of our character, since this is not necessarily chosen at the beginning of the game. If the first two branches do not present particular innovations, essentially dividing themselves into more or less classic sub-trees, it is interesting to dwell on the other knowledge, divided into Race, Nature and Technology, where the first allows you to obtain skills related to each of the 4 playable races, while the other two clearly give the possibility of bringing one's character closer to one of the two alignments of the game, which can also be reached by undertaking particular missions: for example, if we help someone aligned with Nature, we too will get points in that direction, thus having a higher level of favor towards all those belonging to that faction, while vice versa those of the other alignment will not see us very favorably. Violent punches Beyond the few RPG elements present in the H&S, much of the fun is provided by the real fightsand exhausting sessions for the index fingers of the players, subjected to repeated pressures on the mouse button. To make things easier, it is first of all possible to create a group of up to 3 characters including your own, which should be done immediately since soloing practically does not go anywhere. Despite the presence of an altogether acceptable number of creatures, many of these have a fairly similar way of fighting, thus making many of the fights similar to each other, and very often forcing the player to a fairly large number of clashes when he moves around inside the wild lands of the realm: to worsen the situation also contributes an AI not exactly screaming, which lets the enemies controlled by the CPU go quietly to attack the cashier of the group, without targeting the curator who therefore from the rear can do its job better. As far as multiplayer is concerned, everything remains strongly linked to the single-player story, given that both the campaign and free modes basically allow you to take part in it with other player-led characters, offering very little more. questionable choices and annoying bugs make the life of the player complicated Cel shading for everyone As already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Silverfall's graphics rest entirely on the cel shading technique, seen before in quite different genres from the one to which this game belongs: the rendering is of an excellent level thanks also to a more than respectable, excellent light effects, including those related to spells and the alternation between day and night. The worst side of the engine is the presence of collisions between the characters who do not move to let at least our main hero pass, which often leads to annoying blocks, following one of which it was even necessary to save and load the game again, solving the right problem because every time you re-enter Silverfall you start from the camp closest to the area where you saved the game. Together with what has just been described we find some questionable choices, including the movement of the camera by approaching the edges of the screen, where the arrow keys would have been enough, combined with a fairly small viewing angle, both by positioning the shot behind your character, both by placing it higher: some steps towards a better solution have been taken with the 1.11 patch but everything can still be improved, hopefully in the future with a new ~patch~. The sound is not at the levels of the video, only a few are the dubbed sentences (in English) among those that appear on the screen through writings, which among other things sometimes get lost along the way presenting instead of the sentences of the characters of the very unpleasant messages of error, which fortunately only in one case ended up compromising the performance of a secondary mission. Silverfall is an original game with a fascinating world to discover System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 2Ghz or equivalent Athlon RAM: 512 Mb Video Card: 3D 128Mb DirectX 9.0c compatible Disk Space: 6 Gb Drive: DVD-ROM Network interface (for games via LAN or Internet) DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium4 3.0 Ghz or equivalent Athlon RAM: 1 Gb Video Card: 3D 256Mb DirectX 9.0c compatible Test configuration Processor: AMD Athlon64 X2 3800+ RAM: 2 Gb Video Card: Forsa Geforce 7900GT 256Mb Conclusions Evaluating Silverfall was extremely difficult: if on the one hand the MonteCristo game offers considerable ideas worthy of merit and more than appreciable innovations within its genre, on the other we have a lack of game depth, palpable from the first moments of character creation. We certainly don't expect the depth of a pure RPG from an H&S, but some more tricks in the direction of personalizing your hero would have been particularly welcome, especially in terms of appearance and attributes. To further invalidate the evaluation we also find the problems described in connection with the technical sector, which between questionable choices and annoying bugs make the player's life complicated. However, the fact remains that Silverfall is an original game, with a fascinating world to be discovered also thanks to MonteCristo's choice to use cel shading to represent the entire adventure. Those who want to play Silverfall will not be disappointed, provided they arm themselves with a little more patience than usual, to overcome the difficulties set out here and obtain a lioverall good level of fun, without expecting to play it and replay it as if it were Diablo. Pros Original setting Immediacy of hack & slash Cel shaded graphics Cons Problems related to bugs and construction choices Little possibility of differentiating your hero Graphic engine a bit heavy Patch 1.11 As it now seems to have become customary for the majority of developers, MonteCristo also released (strangely a little quietly, on the game's French site only) a ~patch~ immediately after the release of Silverfall. The patch is going to change the entire game system quite radically, fortunately for the better: the review therefore refers to version 1.11, the installation of which we recommend to all owners of the latest MonteCristo effort.
