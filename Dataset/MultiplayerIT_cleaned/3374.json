An edition in great demand by fans of the imposing software house which, despite the absence of a conversion of the first chapter of the western saga, took it for granted that the American company did not miss out on such an interesting market after the frightening success achieved with GTA IV, GTA V and obviously GTA Online right on computer. And, as always happens in these cases, patience has been rewarded and here we are, finally, ready with the review of Red Dead Redemption 2. Why did we take longer than expected to write this article? Primarily, unfortunately, to try to overcome or at least circumvent the enormous compatibility problems that we encountered on editorial computers in the first few days of testing. Secondly, to analyze with our usual detail the effective quality and configurability of this conversion that really amazed us for the amount of settings and settings made available to computer owners. An obsessive attention and care, practically a pampering for those who play on PC, who unfortunately collided with that lack of optimization and with too many problems present at launch. But let's go in order: in this review we will focus on the graphic settings implemented by Rockstar and on the actual performance of the game on three different configurations, and then let us go to the comment and judgment on the work done by the developer. However, if you are primarily interested in finding out what Red Dead Redemption 2 is about or if you want to have a detailed examination of its gameplay because perhaps you have never heard of it, we advise you to read our review of Red Dead Redemption 2 in the console edition. Additional content of the PC version Red Dead Redemption 2 PC offers a handful of additional content which, for convenience, we list below. 3 new Bounty Hunter missions 2 new gang hideouts 2 new treasure maps A new mission from a stranger 5 new charms to collect New Weapons for Story Mode New horses for Story Mode and three new horse types to find in the game world Photo Mode only accessible in Story Mode The settings As always happens in these cases, Red Dead Redemption 2 supports any type of controller and can therefore be played either by recovering an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 pad, or by turning to the PC compatible joypad market, as well as by relying on the old and trusty pair of mouse and keyboard. The game modifies the overlays of the commands that appear on the screen on the fly and we must acknowledge, especially playing with the mouse and keyboard, that we appreciated the responsiveness of the controls and the excellent work done on the input lag front which we felt was adequately kept to mind you, without prejudice to the physicality and responsiveness typical of Rockstar titles. Furthermore, the game allows you to keep the mouse and keyboard settings completely separate from those of the controller allowing, for example, to enable or disable the assisted aim according to the input used but also to manage its intensity in a different way. As for the actual graphic settings, first of all Red Dead Redemption 2 supports HDR even on PC. The option is present in the Screen menu and is activated automatically when the game realizes it is connected to a display capable of managing the feature. It is always possible to deactivate the option manually, but we have not understood why the item disappears completely in the event that the monitor is not compatible with the high dynamic range. All the other settings are contained within the huge menu Graphics. Here we find three different subgroups: the first, the Video one, related to the resolution and vertical synchronization settings; the second, called Graphics, which contains the quality settings of the various elements on the screen, the general preset of the graphics level and the four separate settings for managing anti-aliasing: anisotropic filtering, TAA, FXAA and MSAA; finally there is the Graphics-Advanced sub-menu, blocked by default to avoid accidental interventions and which allows you to work on some very specific elements such as reflections, refractions, details of grass, trees and furs, quality of the shadows but also, and above all , on the libraries used by the game for rendering and on the possible use of dynamic resolution. In fact, Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC uses both Vulkan and DirectX 12 for what chand concerns graphic rendering, with the former selected by default and able to offer ever greater optimization during our tests (with one exception). At the same time it is possible to work hard on supersampling and undersampling by managing the dynamic resolution through a spectrum of values that starts from 0.50x up to 2.50x of the set resolution. What does all this actually mean? For example, it is possible to run the Rockstar title in 4k but with the engine rendering the elements in 1080p (setting 0.50x) or, conversely, it is possible to play Red Dead Redemption 2 on a FullHD monitor but setting the rendering in 4k (2.00x) or even 6k (2.50x). There are many intermediate steps and, more generally, we can only praise the work done by Rockstar precisely with the settings on which the most savvy PC user can intervene. We are talking about 50 different items in the Graphics menu that allow you to micro-manage every single element present in the game world with a granularity that we have never seen in other triple A titles on the computer. Even the general graphic preset, the one that allows you not to intervene on individual settings but to have values predetermined by the developer, has 20 different levels ranging from settings that favor performance to balanced ones up to the last presets that favor graphics quality. These presets actually appeared very conservative to us, probably precisely to limit the ~damages~ of not cleaning and optimizing this conversion and, until you get to the 4-5 most extreme settings, the game tends to level the settings towards low, to the point that very small frame rate differences are often noticed in game and during the benchmark. Even aiming for the maximum graphics preset, a lot of settings will remain set to High instead of Ultra with both MSAA and FXAA disabled. In short, Red Dead Redemption 2 offers everything necessary to allow PC users to find their ideal settings by aiming for the perfect compromise between graphic quality and frame rate, but unfortunately it crashes miserably once you try to apply and see these settings in operation. The performance As we said at the beginning of the article, it is no coincidence that this review arrives so late: we tried for a long time to start Red Dead Redemption 2 on the three test configurations, with all the updated drivers including the NVIDIA ones (version 441.12), but until until Rockstar updated the official Launcher, there was no way to start the game on the 2 PCs equipped with GeForce RTX 2000 family, while the computer with GeForce GTX 1080 tended to crash after a few minutes of play or benchmark. All ran the same game build version 1207.60. The situation has ~stabilized~ only recently but quotation marks are in order. Unfortunately, even today the Rockstar masterpiece continues to be very unstable and working on the graphic settings is complex since very often the application of the changes made in the menus does not seem to work, or it seems that the system does not correctly register the settings that have been modified, forcing a constant reboot and multiple runs of the benchmark to verify that indeed the settings are active. And to all this is added a truly bizarre behavior of the benchmark itself included in the game. As it will be possible to see in the video review that we will publish shortly, the test tends to behave differently at each start. We had fun joking about it in the editorial staff, but it almost seems that there is someone playing the benchmark since the in-game clip that comes after 4 landscape scenes often shows different behaviors of Arthur: sometimes the camera does not rotate to frame the enemies, other times the protagonist doesn't take cover behind the tree or drives the cart in a different way, sometimes his hat gets hit and flies away, other times the cops never hit him. And all this without mentioning the continuous graphical glitches that occur with sessions in which the textures are not loaded and others where very long freezes occur or Arthur runs in place for several seconds before proceeding correctly within the scenario. In short, it seems that the benchmark has a life of its own and this obviously did not help us to have sensible values for an in-depth analysis of the frame rate. For all these reasons, the table that you find immediately below is the result of an average of multiple results, while some values could be of the tAll absent due to problems related to testing.

First of all, it is interesting to note that Red Dead Redemption 2 is a title heavily dependent on CPU power and, in particular, on its clock frequency. If on the one hand it is legitimate to expect, as usual, that the video card is responsible for a large part of the performance, the immediate comparison between the i5-8600K at 3.60 GHz and the i7-8750H at 2.20 GHz shows how the GPU is not sufficient to compensate for the difference in MHz that can exist between a home configuration and a notebook. In fact, although the first PC has ~only~ a GTX 1080, it manages in all tests to produce more frames per second than an RTX 2080 in the Max-Q version. It is also true that in one case it is a native rendering in 4k while in the other the supersampling trick is used by setting the native resolution, but the substance does not change. On the other hand, the absence of support for advanced features such as ray tracing or DLSS excludes that additional performance component of the latest NVIDIA video card family and the whole comparison necessarily moves on the pure brute power of the execution speed of the instructions. At the same time it was really very interesting to note how, by setting the medium settings (balanced preset) and therefore approaching the settings of the console versions, Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is always very optimized, easily managing to stay above 30 FPS in 4k resolution and breaking through the ceiling of 60 frames per second in 1080p even with the least performing configuration. The speech changes slightly by switching to the maximum preset for what concerns the graphic quality. In this case the title is perfectly playable at 1080p, reaching 70 FPS without problems on the best configuration while choosing the 2160p rendering, the situation becomes more complicated since only in the presence of 2080 Super are we able to enjoy acceptable fluidity and an average FPS that never drops below the crucial 30 frames per second. So do these results indicate a lack of optimization? In our opinion not really, given that, as we said above in the body of the review, Rockstar was particularly conservative with the lowest graphic presets but had no problems raising the bar especially when selecting the 3 highest values. It is assumed that there is ample room for improvement and that most likely in the space of a few patches and new drivers, we will be able to appreciate further filing work, but it is also true that the American software house has brought a conversion to the PC market that it can easily be used for at least a couple of generations of hardware as a benchmark capable of squeezing all the raw power available. Quite different is the discourse of the stability and cleanliness of the game. On this front, the lack of optimization, but probably also of large-scale testing, is clear and unjustifiable for such a prominent software house and for such an important product.", "date": "2019-11-14", "grade": "8.6"}
