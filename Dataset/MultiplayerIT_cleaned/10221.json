{"name": "Kart a tutto gas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73827-zero-gear-zero-gear-kart-a-tutto-gas.html", "text": "The genre of arcade driving games was very fashionable until a few years ago, just think of legendary games such as ATR - All Terrain Racing or the more recent Re-Volt, still today a myth for many even still played by a handful of loyalists . Zero Gear rightfully enters this category, presenting itself as a purely arcade kart game, within which you can embark on online challenges by leveraging not only the classic race mode but also other types of game studied by the developers for your own entertainment . The initial menu is immediately presented in an essential way, placing the player in front of the choice of starting a new game or joining an existing one, but also of entering the garage to customize your vehicle and the character who drives it. In the editor it is in fact possible to indulge yourself in a good level of variety, creating the craziest combinations that come to mind between pilot pandas and thorny cacti to dress up even with bandages, pirate hats and other bizarre objects. Ready go! As we said, Zero Gear comes with some quite original game modes, including the one called Goal during which to play in a sort of football field where the objective is precisely to try to score into the opponent's goal, while the jump maniacs can get busy in Target mode, where you can fly towards targets of various values placed in the air. The games in which you find yourself in a kind of closed arena are also very nice, with one of the players becoming the target of all the others to earn points, alternating this phase with the exact opposite where the user in question must unlock a kind of a hot potato to the others. A self-respecting arcade cannot fail to have a whole series of crazy bonuses, and even in this Zero Gear does its duty fully: between the possibility of unleashing small tornadoes, throwing punches with a special glove and making jumps with a spring applied under the kart to escape from ardent bots, there will be crazy and surreal situations where you can have fun in the company of other players. Karts for everyone From a technical point of view, Zero Gear is certainly not state-of-the-art, but Nimblebit also demonstrates in this case that it knows how to defend itself without paying attention to the graphic detail, revealing the work and care that the staff has put into every aspect of the game. The most important thing of the rest is that online games (up to a maximum of 8 players) are not affected by any lag, while the system requirements are practically affordable for any current configuration. The controls support the possibility of using a pad and are essentially based on the steering and accelerator/brake commands, plus the additional use of a key to perform a kind of jump with which to change direction more immediately, almost as if it were a handbrake. In case you rely on the mouse / keyboard combination, the first is instead used to use the bonuses collected and move the shot to your liking. Finally, as regards availability, the title can be purchased via Steam for 13.90 euros.", "date": "2010-01-29", "grade": "7.5"}
