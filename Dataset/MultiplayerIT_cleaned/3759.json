{"name": "Super Brawl Universe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-brawl-universe-la-recensione.html", "text": "Ever since the world began, the concept of brawl always goes well with the idea of cross-over: on the other hand, when it comes to leading your hands in a furious melee, it is important to have a good amount of different characters between which to choose and even better if each of these is endowed with a peculiar charisma. Nintendo is well aware of it, which has managed to transform this somewhat confusing and somewhat extreme fanservice design into a successful series with its Super Smash Bros., but that is the usual magic of the Kyoto house and it's not really stuff from everyone. This is quite evident, considering that in most cases these convenient solutions to put together a catwalk of all-stars in videogame form are resolved in soups that hardly dissociate themselves from the most absolute mediocrity, or worse and Super Brawl Universe, protagonist of this review, unfortunately belongs to the latter category. With the easy synergy between the mobile market and multimedia franchises, the phenomenon of licensed cross-overs has further expanded and group video games based on the characters of the various cartoon networks or film producers have almost become institutionalized, with fluctuating results. Super Brawl Universe starts from an important and globally known license such as Nickelodeon to propose a game-container capable of bringing together disparate characters taken from the various animated series that are part of the famous network such as SpongeBob, Invader Zim, Ninja Turtles, Kid Danger , Danny Phantom, The Legend of Korra, Avatar the Last Airbender and many more. The pretext is so simple that it takes up just a few cartoons when the game starts: the various characters all come together to participate in the Brawl tournament and prove that they are the strongest in the Nickelodeon universe. In short, although within Super Brawl Universe there is space for animated series also equipped with a certain narrative substratum, you do not expect absolutely anything on this front from the game, because in fact it has nothing to tell, between one battle and another . Mobile all-stars fighting game The push to continue is therefore provided exclusively by the desire to undertake new encounters and collect the greatest number of characters to use. The core of the entire gaming experience is therefore divided into the two sections of the actual fight and the management of the fighters, which, as always happens in the types of game based on collections, becomes an element of primary importance especially in the long term. This is also because the mechanics of the fight, to remain as intuitive and accessible as possible, turns out to be a little too simple and shallow: the action takes place in real time as in a real fighting game, with the characters facing each other one on one or three against three in various arenas all inspired by the aforementioned Nickelodeon series. The control system is all set on the touch screen and allows, with quick touches on the screen, to defend and attack with a very small number of moves and special attacks. There is very little of the typical fighting game technicality here, since it is above all about defending at the right moment and counterattacking as quickly as possible, trying to best dose the cooldown of special moves. At first this carefree dynamism is also appreciable, but in the long run its limits emerge clearly and then all the weight of the gaming experience tends to shift to the management of the characters, given that the will to collect them is the spring that triggers all the gameplay, as seen in similar titles based on famous licenses such as Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem or Disney Heroes: Battle Mode. Even in this area, however, we have to deal with an extreme simplicity adopted in the design of the game: the evolution of the fighters, all based on the collection of slimes, is extremely linear and does not allow for particular personal approaches in the development of the characters. The free-to-play setting obviously hides a hidden economic balance between the in-game currency of the slimes and the gems, which can be purchased with real money, which does not prove excessively prone to in-app purchases even if the expectations for the unlocking of the bonuses are practically continuous.", "date": "2019-03-22", "grade": "6.0"}
