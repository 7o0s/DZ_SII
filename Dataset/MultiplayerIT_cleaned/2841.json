{"name": "Nioh 2: Oscurit nella Capitale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nioh-2-oscurita-nella-capitale-recensione.html", "text": "Almost three months after the release of the first additional content, The Disciple of the Tengu, the second round of DLC for Nioh 2 arrives on PlayStation 4. With the usual desire to curse and feel great satisfaction, we launched headlong into the Japan of the X century, savoring the atmosphere of ancient Kyoto and facing new fearsome pitfalls with the forms of Yokai. The review of ~Darkness in the Capital~ highlights how much the Ninja Team is increasingly enslaved to a game system that knows how to make it work as it should, but unfortunately it tends to never renew itself, net of some discreet ideas. History Different eras and same situations. So the new Nioh campaign could be definitive in a nutshell. There are three main missions this time, one more than last time but overall significantly shorter. This package is completed with a further seven secondary tasks scattered around an already known but significantly modified region. Our protagonist's wandering through time takes him even further back, before the year one thousand, in the middle of the Heian era: a of the most interesting and prosperous in the history of Japan. It is not easy to perceive the passage of time backwards, this due to a style and an architecture that has never changed so much as to radically change the cards on the table, but it is evident that some stylistic choices have been aimed at differentiating the settings . Although the journey always focuses on the figure of our bad guy Sohayamaru, this time the new protagonists of the story reveal two other figures suspended between history and Japanese myth: Minamoto no Yorimitsu and Abe no Seimei. Demon hunter the first, also able to carry around their own ~personal collection~; the second is a magician with incredible power, who together try with all their strength and knowledge to drive away evil from their land. Everything would also work well enough, were it not for the speed with which the events of these DLCs develop clashes heavily both with the general intentions and with the narrative dilution to which the basic campaign has accustomed us instead, creating a strange sense of inadequacy. You don't have time to get close enough to these new figures, that you have to immediately abandon them going forward six hundred years in time. It is this particular inconsistency that works little and does not give the narrative the right weight, even though we have always known that it is not the spearhead of the production. The power of repetition We have already anticipated it and it is a detail that has always been evident to anyone who has worked on the sequel to the series that arrived almost four years ago. Nioh 2 has always been a very clever more of the same, capable of inserting some small changes into the system, so as to give the player tepid but important variations on the theme. On the other hand, the strength of Nioh lies in its replayability more than in the variety itself, and all the work done by Team Ninja continues to be based on this principle. Darkness in the Capital tries not to recycle where the first DLC sinned a bit too much, giving about five/six hours of new dense and interesting content is fed to the player, interspersed with excellent boss fights, albeit less tough than in the past. As any Nioh player knows, completing missions is only the first step towards glory, which in this specific case also passes through a further added NG+: the Dream of the Sage. This mode will once again change the cards on the table, dramatically increasing the quantity and wickedness of the enemies in its path, however giving away in exchange for the loot of much higher quality than the previous one. We don't yet have an adequate level to tackle it properly, but it is clear that the degree of challenge is perfect for pushing those who have worked hundreds of hours on the title to test themselves in what is, so far, the definitive challenge. At least until the next one. This aspect goes against the trend with a standard medium difficulty which instead, perhaps, tends to be too permissive compared to the past, albeit with some still not bad peaks. Even the new levers as regards the Yokai kingdom are interesting and well done, with a couple of great additions that quickly soared into the top ten of our favorite demons. Stone of Contrition Among the novelties added in this new expansion, both goes to fill the space in the sanctuary, which now features a new entry: Stone of Contrition. Through this option it will be possible to pledge an accessory by receiving in exchange a stone that will gradually be imbued with magical power, dramatically increasing the probability of receivingdivine or higher equip. Somehow inversely proportional, this aspect will strengthen the enemies you will encounter, making your life hell. Once you decide to recover the object left in the heat, it could come out reforged and improved. Also in this case, it is an interesting addition that rewards the hours of play spent on Nioh, but which on the other hand does not change the substance, it adds brand new content. Yet another element dedicated to the most extreme replayability that makes it clear, where there is still a need, that Nioh is first of all a game designed to be played over and over again, like a real Diablo-Like. Tekko Another round of another weapon, Darkness in the Capital introduces the fearsome Tekko. Part Bruce Lee, part Dante, these sort of glove-like brass knuckles are perfect for fighting at incredibly close range, thus exploiting their maneuverability to inflict devastating combos on your opponents. What strikes you immediately, as soon as you put them on, is the speed with which you build combos, regardless of the chosen stance. But be careful not to overdo it, because unlike other weapons you risk losing control over your Ki more easily, running out of stamina before even having time to process it. Very useful in the case of other very fast human beings and devastating where it is necessary to unload the opponent's Ki quickly, they suffer a little in the case of few opponents prone to loss of balance. We found them a discreet novelty, which changes the cards on the table compared to the past and adds that ~contact~ that was perhaps too often sacrificed in favor of the distance of a Kusarigama.", "date": "2020-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
