{"name": "Hungry Shark World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/168186-hungry-shark-world-magna-tranquillo.html", "text": "Four years after Hungry Shark Evolution, the sharks of Future Games of London return to the assault for a new, bloody chapter for iOS and Android devices. The formula of Hungry Shark World has remained almost unchanged: under the command of a shark, our goal is to eat anything that comes within range, continuing to chew to keep the energy up but paying attention to the many pitfalls that hide in the deep sea. A simple concept, translated on the screen in a way that closely resembles the classic Ecco the Dolphin, therefore with a two-dimensional setting and a control system that on the one hand allows you to move freely the shark (which automatically attacks in case of contact with prey), on the other it includes a trigger function regulated by a special indicator. If desired, it is possible to use 3D Touch to activate the boost, but it is actually an awkward feature, which you will tend to ignore after a few attempts in favor of the standard commands. The game is offered in the usual freemium format, so it can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, using it without any limitations: there are no ~tokens~ to recharge over time, we can play all the games we want and collect coins necessary for upgrades or for the purchase of new and more menacing shark specimens. The progression also concerns the scenarios, with a total of three different locations which, however, only become accessible when our roster has a certain number of fish. Hungry Shark World is a very simple and fun action game that can be played completely for free Shark storm A virtual analog stick on the left (or right, if you want), pressing the opposite area to sprint, the automatic attack: Hungry Shark World takes only a few seconds to understand. In the same way, it is easy to understand what it is possible to eat and what to pay attention to, perhaps because our shark does not yet have the dimensions suitable to bite that particular fish or to break through that particular wall. You move freely in the sea, probe the depths and venture inside caves and recesses, avoiding mines or dangerous predators that could inflict great damage on us and lead us to game over; in which case the game can only be continued by watching an advertising film or by using the hard currency of the game. In any case, short sessions still prove useful to the cause, allowing us to collect the coins necessary to make upgrades or to bet everything on a new and more powerful shark. Playing completely free is certainly possible and as mentioned there are no limitations, however to unlock the entire bestiary and all the locations it will take a lot of patience. Fortunately, the experience, albeit intrinsically limited, is supported by very well done graphics, which make the most of the atmospheres of the title and even the bloody needs of certain circumstances. Unjustified absence of sound, with few effects and just as little atmosphere.", "date": "2016-05-14", "grade": "8.0"}
