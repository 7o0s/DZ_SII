And given the pedigree, which has seen them make excellent titles such as Kotor 2 and Neverwinter Nights 2, the developers have strengthened everything with an effective multiple-choice dialogue system fraught with consequences for the development of events. The story behind the events of Michael Thornton draws heavily from the typical clichs of spy stories of recent years, in which the line between good and bad is not clear at all, where nation states are little more than pawns at the mercy of the large corporations of the military-industrial complex. Our agent will initially have to investigate a downed plane and going forward, between double, triple and quadruple games, he will discover that his own secret agency, the Alpha Protocol, is not blameless. The future is not written Where the game really manages to convince is when, depending on our attitude, we change the course of history. It's not just a question of being aggressive, professional or friendly with our interlocutors, we can in some situations decide the fate of our enemies, spare their lives and make them precious allies who will never be able to say no to us later, given the debt contracted. Being more or less liked by the people with whom we relate brings us a series of bonuses (or malus) when we are on a mission, such as extra skills, ammunition, weapons conveniently positioned on site or better real-time assistance during the mission phases. 'action. Our behavior therefore has tangible consequences for everyone we come into contact with: from this point of view, the game has a high rate of replayability, to know all the crossroads and all the bifurcations of the story told by Obsidian. Accomplices, however, even of the not very beautiful cutscenes, everything is rather cold and mechanical, it lacks that emotional involvement, that affection towards the characters that only the best role-playing games are able to unleash. The story is interesting and its unforeseen development full of surprises involves, only superficially however, reaching the end almost without a deep interest in what has been told to us. The other excellence of the game lies in the character customization system, which as previously written refers almost slavishly to that of the first episode of Mass Effect. Initially the game, after a small parenthesis of choosing the physical connotations of the protagonist, asks us to establish the origin, Thornton's background, between soldier, technology expert and infiltrator, but only later after passing a couple of missions could we choose what to really be, which is very important in case of a wrong initial choice. mass protocol There are many skills available and upon reaching a particular step of progress a special ability is unlocked. Among the many, for example, specializing in guns we will have access to a sort of ~dead eye~ a la Red Dead Redemption, if instead we prefer a silent approach it will be particularly useful to raise the infiltration values to lower the noise produced or even to activate a sort invisibility, if instead we like to lead our hands (which we should do given the outcome of the game) we should focus on health and strength, to have skills that make the damage splash, as if they were real status buffs produced by our punches and kicks. Punches and kicks that are still performed with the more classic button mashing, without particular combinations, much less a button for the block. Specialization becomes fundamental, dispersing the points among the various skills to create an ~average~ character is the most wrong thing to do, also because many of the skills are not particularly useful, and we tend to always use the few that guarantee the most effective without too many frills. From this point of view Alpha Protocol works, and therefore pushes us to make sensible decisions. The sector relating to weapons and, more generally, to all the offensive and defensive paraphernalia that we carry with us is not bad. Here too the Masseffectian origin of the whole is clear, given that it is possible to modify the firearms by varying the internal components, barrel,scope, magazine and also the type of bullets. Furthermore, by collecting the money scattered throughout the levels, we can also buy modifications, new armor, different types of grenades and tactical gadgets to be used as needed. The differences are not merely aesthetic, but are felt pad in hand, each piece changes the object's statistics, both positively and negatively, therefore knowing how to compromise between damage, recoil and stability is the key to achieving the perfect weapon. PC version Alpha Protocol on PC is the bug fair. There are small, almost insignificant ones, but in some cases we found ourselves gazing at the desktop for no apparent reason. Obviously we don't like to judge a game only by its technical problems, but when these go to affect the whole gaming experience, we just can't avoid pointing them out. Just as we cannot avoid underlining the bad artificial intelligence that renders much of the 007 film atmosphere useless. The enemies are so inept that it seems to be in an Austin Powers film rather than a James Bond and in some cases their behaviors appear irritating and out of any human and virtual logic. The only cases in which they manage to worry is when one of the many bugs prevents you from taking cover behind a wall or some other object, bugs accentuated by the controls of this version which are obviously affected by the joypad setting. From a technical point of view, what is barely passable on a console, performs even less on PC. Seeing certain animations makes you sad and in general there is a discouraging sense of anonymity and not worthy of a great production. Overall the graphics aren't terribly bad and get the job done, but lack any inspiration and are sadly functional. The presence of various visual glitches does not help to raise the judgment that stands on the ~mediocre~, without any possibility of appeal. Too bad, because other aspects of the game are very good and the level of dialogue and narration is quite high. More than a final version, it looks like a beta where many of the problems could have been solved with a few more months of development. It would take more time! But when you go on a mission, that is, when you leave the safe haven where you have long conversations with your contacts and where you have access to the black market for weapons, all this finds a coherent and effective realization with the vast promises of customization , both narrative and skill and class that the game offers? The answer is simply no, due to a series of critical issues that undermine the gameplay. The most evident is the artificial intelligence, inept and random which in fact transforms the shootings into fisticuffs and penalizes any type of silent approach to the action. We are faced with truly comical situations, such as soldiers who do not see us half a meter away, who remain impaled in the open to take our lead, or who fire a volley towards us and come upon us to punch us, what this which could not happen if in the middle of the journey there was a stairway that attracted them like bees to honey. Paradoxical moments are many, and all, except in rare cases, can be overcome by slapping opponents. In fact, by activating reduced damage and extra strength, it is possible to run towards enemies (when they don't) to knock them out. with quick one-two punches, reducing moments of siege or infiltration to quick vaudeville carousels. All this is a real shame given that the game between skills, gadgets, weapons and armor allows you to choose what to do and how to do it, but in reality everything boils down to a bland extremely linear third-person shooter, with equally bland stealth mechanics . As if that weren't enough, if you decide to set aside the silent approach for a more markedly aggressive one, further problems arise. The covers, like the artificial intelligence, also seem to be random and also not very recognizable, with objects that have the appearance of a saving point to hide in which then turn out to be unusable, whether they are crates or huge boulders, which puts us in a position to suffer heavily when fiddling with the A key to understand the reason why the coverage is not successful. Secondly, the system that implies aiming is far too tied to the degree of specialization of the weapon and it too suffers from the works/doesn't work effect. It may happen that bursts from a distance, without waiting for the slow critical hit hookup, have a positive result, while others closer to a stationary enemy, strangely go off target over and over again, without the victim leavingnotice more. Another aspect that does not seem to be spot on is that relating to check points: although they are placed intelligently, they save all the character's statistics when the activation trigger passes. If unfortunately this happens when you have little energy and little shield, you are forced to leave again with that minimum quantity available, consequently if there are no first aid stations nearby or you don't have medkits to use, the following minutes can become really frustrating. Xbox 360 goals Alpha Protocol rewards the player with 1000 points for a total of 50 achievements. The easiest objectives are achieved with simple progression, while the most interesting ones relate to how the story progressed, how many objects were found and so on. Due to the crossroads nature of the game, many achievements in a single match cannot be achieved, unlocking all of which requires playing the game multiple times. Cables and codes Instead, the judgment regarding the numerous mini-games scattered throughout the levels that serve to deactivate circuits or to enter computers can be rather subjective. Glance and timing, rather than logical dexterity, are the key to finding two alphanumeric codes in the midst of an entire screen of ever-changing numbers, the same acuity is needed to follow electrical terminations to bypass of the circuits. They represent a good challenge initially, but in the long run, given their continuous use, they become too repetitive and exhausting, especially when you are forced to stare at the monitor in search of that damned code that changes position every ten seconds. The final impression of the game is that despite numerous postponements of the release date, Obsidian has not managed to carefully polish their product. Some parts are done and finished, well implemented and working, others still seem decidedly immature and sketchy, full of bugs (like not wanting to shoot behind cover, which often doesn't cover) and with a lot of work still to be done, which actually damage the promises of a varied gameplay and with different approaches to choose. From a technical point of view we are facing an average title, not particularly brilliant, with various settings, equipped with a good level design, but certainly not a touchstone for the months to come. Here too there are some problems to note, mainly in the annoying pop in of the textures and in the camera, which is too close and which often remains perplexed in choosing the best shot, with the result of snoozing the protagonist. Venial peccadilloes, but still to be underlined.", "date": "2010-06-10", "grade": "6.0"}
