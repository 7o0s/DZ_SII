{"name": "World Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-racing.html", "text": "Exploring World Racing It is this feature, i.e. the ability to reach anything you see on the horizon, regardless of how close or far it may be from the track, which could push those who play to look at TDK's work with an extremely positive lens. Furthermore, the possibility of choosing how simulative we want the game (there is a slider that moves from maximum simulability to maximum arcade) allows us to increase longevity even further, if the ~exploration~ option should not be sufficient. But the game, unfortunately, fails to give those sensations of fun, freedom, variety that one would have expected considering the enormous potential of this title. It is as if the developers had worked too hastily, because if some aspects had been studied in detail, World Racing could have been a good game and, instead, in the ~exploratory~ mode we find ourselves wandering in a dead world, with very few animations (with the exception of some more accurate outline elements). The hope was to find a game capable of satisfying two different types of gamers at the same time, the racing enthusiast and the reckless driving simulators like Test Drive. Instead, we wander the streets, straying off the path and seeing not a soul, no cars coming towards us, nothing at all. Not to mention the slowness of the game. The tracks seem to go on forever and instead of being a cause for praise for the game it's quite the opposite. The gameplay is slow, inexorably slow and monotony grips the player after a few long, frustrating races. The graphics Let's breathe a different air when talking about the graphics of the game. The environments are recreated in detail and the cars have a higher polygon count than any other racing. Basically, the 3D reproductions of Mercedes cars are truly perfect. Since this is a new racing, however, it was to be expected. Mercedes has good graphics, but absolutely in the average quality of the latest generation racing games. In fact, it has a respectable 3D engine, however, even here, there are some flaws that had to be eliminated in the bud during the development phase: detail yes, but little atmosphere. Everything is clean, ~cut~ by the hands of a surgeon, but it is also aseptic, without personality, without anything truly evocative. Sure, the 3D engine allows you to recreate canyons, mountains, rivers, climatic effects, but the feeling is that the environments have been rebuilt without too much passion. Alongside truly beautiful textures, for example, there are mediocre textures and it is not clear why this choice of graphics. Since we are given the opportunity to explore any area of the map, they should have taken care of the graphic rendering in a manic way, also taking care of the textures of the most remote corners. The feeling is that it already looks old despite being new and the risk that it could end up on the shelf as soon as another racing car comes out on the market is really high. The simulation, the real strong point Where then does the game excel? Definitely in the simulation. By moving the simulation/arcade bar all the way to simulation, we end up with a truly realistic game. Each car behaves differently according to characteristics based on accurate datasheets supplied by Mercedes to TDK. The game also involves driving on mixed routes, where we'll find ourselves facing not only the classic track, but also snowy tracks, icy roads and so on. In these situations it seems to be really behind the wheel of a Mercedes (and on the other hand the reproductions of the car interiors are very faithful and help us to identify ourselves even more). This mode will engage fans of realism at the highest levels, but will obviously disappoint those who want realistic and fun simulations at the same time. Conclusions World Racing could have been an interesting racing game but instead, due to the many flaws, it presents itself as only an adequate game. It's quite playable and moderately fun, but it gets so much better on Xbox. We feel, therefore, to recommend it only to the avid enthusiasts of the famous car manufacturer of the three-pointed star. Pros: Good driving simulation Interesting ~exploration~ mode Long-lived Cons: The good basic ideas were developed with superficiality Clean graphics but without personality Limited gameplay Mercedes or no Mercedes? The game was originally supposed to be calledMercedes Benz World Racing, but TDK, the developer, has decided to simply leave the World Racing title, although the 107 cars available in the game are all Mercedes. It is a discreet portfolio of cars, from classic racing cars to futuristic prototypes. The game presents itself as a ~different racing~, because the strength does not lie so much in the races themselves (there are 117 tracks within 7 very large areas where the tracks intersect each other), but in the possibility of get away from the track and explore the surrounding area.", "date": "2003-05-06", "grade": null}
