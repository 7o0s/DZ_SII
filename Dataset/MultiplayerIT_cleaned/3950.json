This cute Pok Ball, sold as an accessory in Pokmon: Let's, Pikachu!, Pokmon: Let's Go, Eevee! and Pokmon GO, is in fact only the latest in a long series of additional objects, which have often accompanied Pokmon titles as well: just think, to name a couple, of the pedometer of Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the so-called Pokwalker, or to Circle Z, the bracelet dedicated to the Z moves of Pokmon Sun and Moon. However, this time we are facing what is probably the most complex additional peripheral in the history of these little monsters: the Pok Ball Plus is in fact a mix between a traditional controller, a movement controller, a pedometer and a Tamagotchi. All enclosed in a ball that fits comfortably in the palm of a hand and faithfully reproduces the iconic Pok Ball. So follow us in our review to discover all the features of this little technological marvel. One controller As already reported in the review of Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! , the Pok Ball Plus is a good controller to play the two new Nintendo Switch titles. Activating the ball is very simple: once the software has been started, a screen allows you to choose your preferred control system and just press one of the keys to start pairing with the Pok Ball. The surface of the sphere is in fact characterized by a series of control elements. At the apex of the upper hemisphere, the red one, there is a rather large button, while in the connection area there is an analog stick that can also be pressed. At the antipodes to the stick, a flap gives access to the USB-C port used for recharging a 220mAh lithium battery which guarantees about twenty hours of use. Finally, the small black line that divides the sphere into two parts hides a small reset button. These are very few elements, which however allow you to replicate almost all the keys of a Joy-Con inside Pokmon: Let's Go. The stick allows you to move and, when pressed, interact with objects and confirm your choices. The top button allows you to access menus and cancel actions. Finally, shaking the ball enables special commands, which in most cases are limited to reproducing the Y key or calling up some shortcuts. Unfortunately some keys have not been implemented and in this way it is impossible to access some secondary functions, such as listening to the verses of the Pokmon in the Pokdex or the use of brands to signal the little monsters with specific characteristics. Also, the ball isn't well optimized for navigating console menus and using it with other games, so it's effectively a controller exclusive to Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!. Once in the game, however, using the sphere as a controller returns a convincing, unique and hilarious experience. In fact, the main functions are all well implemented and allow you to complete the adventure without major problems, while the feedback from the exclusive ones is extraordinary. The ball is in fact very pleasant to the touch and hides inside a motion sensor, a vibration motor, colored LEDs and speakers for playing sounds. During the capture phases it thus transforms into a real Pok Ball, which must be thrown towards the Pokmon on duty (simulating only the movement, and to avoid damage it is always good to use the special strap). If you manage to hit it, the ball emits the typical beeps of capture, lights up in sync with the ball in play, vibrates with various levels of intensity as the Pokmon tries to free itself and, if successful, allows you to hear the cry of the Pokmon. little monster come directly from the Ball. It is something that can hardly have mass appeal, but which represents something priceless for the most passionate fans of the series. A Pok Ball The surprises don't end there, since the Pok Ball Plus comes with a preloaded Mew inside. By holding the stick down until it glows pink, you can feel it moving inside the sphere. The beauty is that it is possible to transfer this mysterious Pokmon within Let's Go already in the early stages of the game: just connect to the internet, access the communication menu, select the Secret Gift option and choose the ~Via Pok Ball Plus~ option to make a level 5 Mew appear in your Box. Unfortunately the IV and the nature of the Pokmon thus obtained are complIt is completely random and there is no way to cheat the game into receiving it with different values. Furthermore, at the moment there are no other distributions of the little monster number 151, but the presence of the options ~via internet~ and ~via serial code~ in the Secret Gift menu bode well in this sense. Once Mew has been redeemed, the Ball can also be used to take one of the Pokmon on your team for a walk. In this way he will gain experience and items by simply keeping it in his pocket or playing with him. However, the interactions are limited to the shaking and rolling of the sphere, and to some and occasional calls, with the stick's LED flashing in different colors based on the main color of the Pokmon inside. In some circumstances there are some problems in the reproduction of sounds, which are however attributable to a low battery level and the simultaneous absence of an indicator that warns you to charge it in time. A Pokmon GO Plus The last function of the Pok Ball Plus is finally linked to Pokmon GO. In fact, inside the mobile spin-off it works like a classic Pokmon Go Plus, allowing you to capture Pokmon and spin Pokmon with the simple press of a button. The only difference is that, when there is a Pokmon inside, the little monster will spin the Pokstops by itself. However, the price of the Pok Ball Plus is far from low: this interesting gadget is in fact sold for 50 euros, or bundled with Pokmon: Let's Go or the limited edition Nintendo Switch console dedicated to little monsters.", "date": "2018-11-14", "grade": null}
