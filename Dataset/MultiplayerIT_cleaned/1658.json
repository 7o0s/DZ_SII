{"name": "Before Your Eyes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/before-your-eyes-recensione.html", "text": "It's not easy to write the Before Your Eyes review: it's not because, like all narrative adventures, it's an experience that digs deep into the individual player, drawing from it a sensitivity and emotions that will never be the same as the others. Above all, however, it is not because it involves us personally much more than other titles of the same genre have done: the developers of GoodbyeWorld Games have in fact decided to base the entire adventure on blinking. You got it right, except for the use of the mouse to move the view, interact with the story and continue depends on a gesture as natural as, precisely for this reason, uncontrollable. Obviously it is also possible to play by deactivating the function but the whole soul of Before Your Eyes would be lost and since it is enough to have a webcam, even if it is integrated into the PC, there is no excuse for neglecting the founding core of such a visceral experience. Life in the blink of an eye Before Your Eyes is not a game that is striking for its aesthetics, nor for the writing which is yes pleasant but could have aimed higher, not even for the overall duration of around three hours. It pioneers nothing, and the blink mechanic is never fully exploited. Nonetheless, in disappointing us in some aspects, it also hit where we didn't expect it: if the individual narrative parts are all too simple and at times insipid, it is by joining together that they allow you to create an interactive experience capable of plucking the right strings - which , as mentioned, may not be the same for everyone. To avoid spoilers, we won't tell you anything, except that we are together with a bizarre ferryman who is leading our soul towards the final judgment: if deemed worthy, we will have access to a dream city. If not... it's up to you to find out. To make this happen, for better or for worse, we will have to retrace our entire lives from the beginning, opening our hearts to the guardian and showing ourselves completely honest in analyzing what we have been. Right here lies one of the cornerstones of Before Your Eyes, the one that breaks through the fourth wall and speaks directly to us: self-criticism. In asking us to retrace the life of the protagonist Benjamin, the ferryman in any case insinuates doubts in us, that is, if, being in his place, we would really be able not to lie, to recognize our mistakes even before those of others; if, in short, we would be able to free ourselves from that cage that we have built around ourselves and recognize that yes, we are often the first executioners of ourselves. In order not to bleed, we mystify reality as we would have liked it to be to the point of convincing us that it really happened, cleanse ourselves of all guilt to create an ideal image in which we can better recognize ourselves. After all, if we were allowed to relive our lives frame by frame, we would tend to eliminate the most painful or futile memories in a subtle cut and sew job that would serve to delude us in the first place. Before Your Eyes: the ferryman and the mechanics of blinking On the other hand we are shown how ephemeral time is and how every moment can slip away from our fingers, precisely, in the blink of an eye. A metaphor for the transience of life? Perhaps, the fact is that the developers have linked an uncontrollable passage of time to this mechanic that could leap forward by a few minutes as well as days, months, years. It is completely out of our control and as soon as the metronome starts ticking on the screen we will know we have to give in, surrender to the evidence that we are reliving a past that is no longer there and blink, move on to the next memory and try to reconstruct it in time. Better. It is no coincidence that by moving the view, we will never see everything around clearly and there will be black areas to testify to the impossibility of remembering every single detail with precision, giving space to the object of our memories. In some cases we will be able to unlock parts of the scenario, or choose not to, while we reconstruct the events by reacting on the basis of them: in fact, there will be occasions where we will be pushed to decide, take one path rather than another, shape our life as we remember , we think we remember it or we want to remember it. In retracing the life of another person, Before Your Eyes inevitably leads us to reflect on ourselves and it succeeds even if it doesn't shine in some respects. It presents us with life for what it is, with its joys and pains, raw and authentic, capable of transforming a very clichd story into something much more heartfelt and profound. The simple aesthetics, embellished by a rather evocative color palettea, manages to evoke that sense of childlike wonder transmitted by every memory, provided you don't look at the expressions of the characters which are extremely basic; to accompany this dive into the past there is a perfect soundtrack in its alternation of hope and melancholy. Although the blinking mechanic, replacing the classic point and click, is in itself a suitable choice for a more intimate and personal storytelling, the moment in which it shines the most is when we are asked - ironically - not to exploit it. Sometimes we will have to keep our gaze fixed to prolong certain memories, others for more significant reasons that we will not reveal to you; still others we will just have to close our eyes to concentrate and listen to the discussions between the various characters. Before Your Eyes: Sometimes we will be called upon to make plot choices Despite the interesting implementations, we still had the feeling that the blink mechanic could have offered even more: by allowing the game to track the movement of the eyes and not just the aforementioned blink, the immersion would have been even more profound and convincing , albeit limited in its application - it is still a question of choosing whether and when to perform a certain action, it rarely has different applications. The narration and the construction of the story are not relevant, however they are enough to push the player to that reflection which is probably the main objective of the game. Furthermore, despite its ups and downs, it is always supported by an excellent dubbing capable of enhancing the different scenes - on the sidelines, the Italian localization is missing in the subtitles. In its imperfection, Before Your Eyes remains a recommended experience even if only for its main mechanics.", "date": "2021-04-11", "grade": "7.0"}
