Despite the success and fame of the brand, the Japanese developer has wisely chosen not to saturate the market with sequel after sequel and limited variants of the Disgaea concept, exploring new genres and proposing his bizarre vision with absurd characters, hilarious jokes and abstruse but very profound mechanics. The last example was the more than discreet The Guided Fate Paradox, which maintained several points of contact with the style of Disgaea, starting with the two-dimensional graphics and the strategic elements. With The Witch and the Hundred Knight, however, Nippon Ichi may have taken the proverbial bit longer than he can... Nippon Ichi offers a very interesting action RPG which, however, dares a little too much Innocence lost It is not the first time that Nippon Ichi puts us in the shoes of the ~bad guys~: the veterans of Disgaea will undoubtedly remember the prince of demons Laharl or the mythical little devil Etna and Renya's choices in The Guided Fate Paradox were at least questionable, so the fact that the protagonist knight of The Witch and the Hundred Knight is in the service of an evil witch should surprise no one. However, the plot of the game is a bit more complex than that, because our knight is practically a newborn without a conscience or a moral compass and the witch who summoned him, despite the girlish appearance presented in the artwork, is really cruel and ruthless. Confined to her beloved swamp, Metallia has no intention of abandoning it and so, in order to conquer the world, she orders her knight to expand it by destroying the obelisks scattered throughout the fairy-tale region in which the story is set and eliminating all the obstacles in its path . So yes, essentially our ~enemies~ are the good creatures trying to defend their enchanted lands. This idea, captivating as it is, suffers from two huge problems. The first is that the story is far too intrusive: the dialogues interrupt the action every three by two with exaggeratedly long interlude sequences, breaking the frenetic pace that a full-fledged action game deserves. The second problem concerns the plot, and the character of Metallia in particular, exaggeratedly evil and scurrilous: the frequent dialogues mentioned above are full of insults, insults and gratuitous vulgarities which should serve to negatively characterize Metallia but in reality end up being frankly annoying. Metallia's actions, then, speak for themselves, describing scenes that have nothing short of disturbed us: torturing a defeated opponent by transforming her into a mouse to be chased by a brood of horny rats seemed extreme to say the least, especially considering the relationship between the two characters and the fact that the victim ends up becoming the main course of a dinner. The first hours of The Witch and the Hundred Knight are punctuated by more or less similar perversions which, set in its fairy-tale and colorful scenarios surrounded by characters that seem to come out of a Japanese comic, rely more on the player's morbid curiosity than on a narrative worthy of the name. At one point the story takes a different turn and we understand better where the writers wanted to end up with Metallia's perfidies, but you have to know how to juggle this type of black humor, and the kingdom of the Hundred Knight is certainly not South Park. Playstation 3 trophies The new title Nippon Ichi offers 48 Trophies: in addition to platinum, three gold, eight silver and thirty-six bronze ones can be unlocked. The latter are obtained easily, following the story and beating enemies, while the others will require a little more attention in the management of the knight. Clean break with the past? In addition to the abstruse characters and dark humor, The Witch and the Hundred Knight also shares with previous Nippon Ichi games a peculiar mix of different mechanics that can seem decidedly confusing at first, even if after a while you get the hand and seem to flow much more organically than it appeared in the first few hours of the game. The problem, if anything, is that the game doesn't explain them well at all: the initial tutorial is short and superficial and, once concluded, the player is left to himself, with any limited explanation of how to approach each new mechanic. Most advice is relegated to loading screens,moreover in a completely random order, with the result that you could end the game without ever having understood how a certain parameter works. In some ways it's not a bad thing, because it means that The Witch and the Hundred Knight can be played even without thoroughly dissecting its peculiarities, but on the other hand it means that they have been implemented in a superficial way and without too much care. The weapon system is a case in point: the knight can equip up to five different ones, in any order he likes which basically ~designs~ his combo of main attacks. The idea is that almost all enemies are more or less vulnerable to a certain weapon and the player should wield it every time he faces them. An interesting concept that, however, doesn't work, because in an action game having to open the inventory every time to change weapons is pure madness: you end up fighting enemies with the setup set at the beginning, even if it's one only attacks that are really effective. The Witch and the Hundred Knight, fortunately, is a rather frenetic game: it reminds a bit of Diablo, with its isometric view and the random layout of the maps, not counting the loot and the weapons of different quality that can be obtained by defeating the enemies. As per the Nippon Ichi tradition, each weapon can be upgraded up to a certain point (which depends on its quality) and therefore the player is offered an effective customization possibility which, together with the specializations (or ~facet~) of the Hundred Knight and the Tochka system, special abilities that can be combined in turn, guarantees excellent depth to all those who love to bask in numbers and statistics. It would be wrong to consider The Witch and the Hundred Knight an ignorant hack'n'slash, because it also requires a lot of reasoning, especially in the advanced stages when the GigaCalories and the spaces in the knight's stomach have to be calculated well: the former are in fact, a kind of resource that is consumed as the maps are explored and that can be recharged by returning to the base or by devouring enemies. The latter, however, occupy space in the knight's stomach which is also his inventory; as a result, a careless progression could force us to give up a newly found excellent weapon which, however, does not fit into our bellies. The result is a game system full of different mechanics that are expressed in an interface so rich that it is sometimes disorienting. From a visual point of view, in fact, we understand that this was a real experiment for Nippon Ichi. The fully polygonal graphics work, even if the detail and animations of the enemy and character models could have been treated more, while the scenarios are full of details and colors... and perhaps too much, given that in certain moments it becomes rather difficult to follow the action and you end up hitting keys a bit randomly giving up strategic dodging. The audio accompaniment, bizarre and not a little repetitive, reminded us a bit of Tim Burton's films, while the rather weak English dubbing can be replaced by the more engaging Japanese audio.", "date": "2014-03-24", "grade": "6.3"}
