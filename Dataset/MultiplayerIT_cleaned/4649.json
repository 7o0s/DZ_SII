Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies were archived in the previous decade, the upright Mickey Mouse has emancipated himself and is already a hugely popular character among children, with new dedicated series. Donald Duck follows him with his first characterization made of an oblong beak and flabby buttocks, as well as his ever-present sailor suit. He still doesn't know that in the following years it will be profoundly modified, assuming a more pleasant and harmonious aspect. These are the years in which the Looney Tunes appear in the still wild world of animation, together with the sexy Betty Boop and the first animated Popeye, both the work of the Fleischer brothers. The bosses have multiple stages and they are all beautiful In the same years StudioMDHR tries to create its first video game, taking up the visual style of those who were not yet considered masters, but who will become such with the passage of time. Unfortunately, development is slow due to the fact that no one has invented computers yet. There is actually something, but it is secret machinery, very cumbersome and capable of generating only a few numbers, certainly not able to manage a complex graphics engine like Unity (you could read it in the documentation that there is no support for Memex, come on). For this reason, it was decided to freeze the project, with the promise of resuming it when the time was right. The announcement of the resumption of work took place in 2014, on the occasion of E3. That's when the guys at MDHR realize that quite a few years have passed and that in the meantime a lot has changed in the world of animation, both technically and stylistically. But now the die has been cast: the characters remain those drawn in the 30s, and there is no mention of throwing away all the work done then. And then ~Cuphead~ remains a very original character despite the years, given that there are enough ducks, mice and other anthropomorphic creatures around. Shooter stages are well done Seriously, more than three years have passed since E3 2014, the actual year of Cuphead's announcement. Many had even lost faith in its chances of going on the market, as it was the subject of some major rethinking in the making. Instead here it is. When we saw it for the first time we were immediately fascinated by it, but experience has taught us that there is often an abysmal distance between a captivating graphic style and a beautiful game. Fortunately this is not the case. Let's explore the islands Cuphead begins with some static images that tell the prologue of the adventure of the two protagonists. Cuphead, practically an anthropomorphic latte cup, and his brother Mugman literally play their souls in the casino. The only way they have to save themselves is to obtain the contracts of the souls of other inhabitants of their world, scattered over three islands, and take them to the devil, who in exchange will spare theirs. The thin plot that introduces the game should have already made you understand that the focus of the gameplay is certainly not the narrative side. Indeed, let's say better: the story is practically all here and you can already imagine for yourself how it will end. Having taken control of Cupehead or Mugman, if you play in cooperative mode, you can decide whether to face the very short tutorial in their grandfather's house, useful for learning about the fundamental mechanics, or whether to go directly to explore the first island, which we can consider like a large junction center from which to access the various game sequences, indicated by animated objects or small placeholders. This cute beast made us spit blood, especially in his last phase Already in this phase the stylistic subtleties abound. For example, you can see the qualitative detachment between the background and animated objects, with the latter having less detail. For what reason? Simple: the developers wanted to imitate one of the tricks of period animation, in which the backdrop was a very detailed fixed sheet, while the more stylized animations were made on transparent cellulose acetate sheets called cels. The entire game is dotted with such goodies, evidently the result of great study. But let's get back to us. Initially not the whole island can be explored and only some levels or bosses can be reached: to access the closed areas you obviously need to overcome the available missions, which we will discuss in the next paragraph. In addition to them, there are also characters to talk to, who however in most cases will only give us some general information or some suggestions, while in others they will give us coins or give them to us after we have done them a favor. Just in case, talk about quests it seems to usexcessive, because they are basically a couple of very simple favors, which are resolved in a few seconds, but still serve to add some spice to the exploration. For the rest, there are two other types of buildings around: the shop, run by a pig, where you can spend your hard-earned coins to buy extra weapons and bonus items (six and six in total), and the mausoleums, where preventing ghosts from reaching a vase in the center of the screen results in a new super move (there are three in total, one for each island). Exploring there are also special areas, such as a small lake on the second island that tells us how many times we have died or the aforementioned grandfather's house, always ready to give us good advice. Also on the map you can access Cuphead's inventory, from which you can assign a weapon to the primary slot and one to the secondary slot (they can be exchanged during the action by pressing a button); a bonus item among those available, useful for example to have more life points or to become invisible during shots; and a super move, essentially a special attack that can be used when you have five cards in the bottom left bar (the cards are charged by hitting enemies or jumping on pink objects, which we will discuss in the next paragraph). Mechanics and adventures Cuphead's mechanics are few and really simple to explain. Our unlikely hero can jump, shoot in eight directions, dash left or right, and jump onto pink objects... yes, pressing the jump button a second time when you're about to land on a pink object, whether it's a enemy, a projectile or a piece of scenery, a so-called ~parry~ is performed, which makes Cuphead jump again and adds a card to the super counter. As mentioned the mug brothers have a total of six powers, which shoot from their fingers. At the beginning you only have a basic machine gun attack, but by spending coins you can buy: a slow and powerful charged attack; a homing attack that makes aiming unnecessary but does little damage; some undulating spheres, with a short range of action, but with good power; boomerangs that give excellent cover from weaker enemies, both in front and behind and a classic three-way attack. It sounds difficult, but it really is Each of these then has its own special shot. Mind you that we are not talking about super, but more powerful attacks than normal ones that require the expenditure of a card to be performed. The super instead require the expenditure of five cards and, as already mentioned, there are three: a kind of energy beam of incredible power and amplitude; a shield that makes you immortal for a few moments and a directly controllable spinning ghost that does big damage with its punches. In the shoot'em up phases, in which we find Cuphead and his brother on board an airplane, things obviously change. In fact, the aircraft has a machine gun and, from the second island, bombs and when you perform a super it transforms into a large missile that does enormous damage. Even the shutter button takes on a completely different function, making the vehicle shrink so as to increase its movement speed. In general, depending on the selected weapons, the approach to the levels changes a lot. Against some enemies it may be convenient to focus on more defensive weapons, while with others it is better to try to do the maximum damage with a single shot, provided you have a certain precision. In general, however, it is always necessary to try to understand when it is convenient to use what: selecting the right weapons can make the difference, making an impossible battle only very difficult. In total, traveling around the islands Cuphead will be able to access three types of mission, of which the most common is the clash with big bosses. The second kind of challenge is represented by platform levels, whose objective, in addition to reaching the end, is to collect the precious coins (there are five for each platform phase), the use of which we have already explained. Finally there are the classic shooter stages, which are still big boss fights, but have completely different mechanics. The Bosses What is inexorably striking and passionate about playing Cuphead is the variety: there is not a single enemy that returns in more than one phase, or a gimmick that is exploited more than once. Yes, each level has its own unique creatures, all with their own animations, attack patterns, and theme. The variety also manifests itself in the dynamics of the clashes themselves, all very different from boss to boss, and capable of changing during the clashes themselves. Just to give a few examples, in onephase we will have to face a queen bee who will first send a police bee against us, then start attacking us by appearing at the top of the screen and finally transforming into a large plane, all while we will have to be careful not to get dragged to the bottom of the screen from self-propelled platforms. The islands are not very large but are definitely varied In another battle we will instead have to deal with an actress who will try to eliminate us first with her umbrella and throwing fans at us, then making us throw props from a house-shaped set and finally using theatrical machines. There would be many more feasible examples (practically one for each level of which the game is made up), but the speech should be clear by now: Cuphead is a concentrate of ideas, which manifest themselves in every possible way. Think that even the last levels, which are located in a special area, have something original to offer in terms of visuals and mechanics. We don't tell them so as not to anticipate too many things, but we can tell you that finding yourself with the cards on the table changed even in the ending is wonderful, as well as the sign of love and care placed in the development. Everything is so refined as to be touching. In recent times, the only other title where we've seen such attention paid is Owlboy, with which Cuphead shares a certain love for the (relative) craftsmanship of video game development. Details, details and some flaws Coming back to more mundane matters, many of you will be curious as to how long it takes to get to the end. In general the individual fights aren't very long, but they are really difficult, to the point where some of them we had to replay over and over again before getting through them. At the beginning of each one it is possible to choose whether to play on easy or normal difficulty, to which is added a harder mode, called ~Expert~, which is unlocked after finishing the game and which literally spits blood. Smoking is bad At the end of each level Cuphead receives a value judgment, which varies according to the time spent, the remaining life points, the parries performed, the super accumulated and, in the case of platform levels, the coins collected. In case of death, the progress made in the fight and the stage of the boss that has been reached are shown. If winning is already tiring, getting all excellent judgments is a long and complex job, which requires perfect knowledge of the attack patterns of each boss and Cuphead's weapons. And if you want to get them at an expert level, expect to spend many hours in the company of our hero. For those who, on the other hand, like to finish games and archive them, things change: let's say that, depending on your skills, you can get to the end in about six hours. Of course, we specify that we are really talking about the minimum experience, given that Cuphead shows all its value precisely when the focus is on improvement. On the other hand, we would have liked a few more extras, such as some secrets to discover (there are very few) or some additional modes, perhaps designed as an additional challenge. We would also have liked a better integration of the platforming levels, which betray the original project made up only of boss fights. The challenge is of a high level from the very first clashes Let me be clear: qualitatively they are in line with the others. Some, like that of the cyclops, are also exciting for the dynamics they offer. The problem is that they are slightly disconnected from the rest, in the sense that they smell strongly of a late addition, which has been completely delegated the function of collecting coins. Nothing compromising, but it is fair to note. Finally, from a technical/stylistic point of view, really expect wonders: between drawings and animations that perfectly imitate the cartoon style of the 30s, between ultra-detailed characters and backdrops and between a soundtrack that helps create an incredible atmosphere . As already widely pointed out, there is not a single element that repeats itself and this makes us understand why the development took so long. The care taken in making Cuphead is really painstaking, but fortunately the result is unique. Letting it slip would really be a crime.", "date": "2017-09-29", "grade": "9.2"}
