Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The genre of drag racers, or arcade driving games in which you face races exclusively on straights, where the timing in changing gears or in operating the nitro counts more than the grip of the tires, is strong on the App Store. In fact, the case of CRS Racing has remained in the annals, which made its authors earn a ton of money and undoubtedly spurred many developers to try the same path; with mixed fortunes, it is clear, but sometimes churning out quality titles such as Fast & Furious 6: The Game or the recent CSR Classics, which is nothing if not a technically much improved ~vintage~ reinterpretation of the aforementioned CRS Racing. Well, Hutch Games has also decided to join the club: having archived the experience of Smash Cops and its various sequels, the English team has seen fit to create a peculiar drag racer, in which huge monster trucks rather than custom-built ones compete against each other or muscle cars. Downloadable for free from the App Store, MMX Racing uses the traditional element of timing to make us give and take off the gas when we face a jump or land, so as to gain cue, rather than to operate the gears. Beyond these ~facade~ changes, the structure of the game does not differ from that seen in other productions of the genre, also and above all as regards the freemium mechanisms: ten tickets allow us to participate in as many competitions and are recharged with spending time (or by spending real money to purchase special points), while a progressive upgrade system acts on the grinding and regulates the speed of our career advancement, imposing a certain pace on us with respect to the three categories of vehicles available (at which more will be added in the future, multiplayer included). MMX Racing is an interesting drag racer, capable of standing out on the App Store and carving out its own space Fly higher In addition to the choice of monster trucks and the variation with respect to the traditional gear shifting mechanics, what is striking about MMX Racing is undoubtedly the graphics, which are truly excellent. The fact of having to render a ~fixed~ path, without particular movements of the visual, has already made spectacular presentations possible in the past, but in this case we have probably reached the top between detail, style (especially of the interface, beautifully decorated) and plenty of post-processing effects, with a blur that gives depth to the scenarios and enhances the polygonal models of the vehicles, which move very convincingly on their shock absorbers and sometimes have unpredictable reactions after landing, hovering on two wheels or almost capsizing . Precisely this characteristic of monster trucks becomes essential when playing, in the sense that it is necessary not only to calculate the accelerator release and recovery times well, beyond the traditional starting system with the rev counter, but also to verify that the vehicle lands without loading too much on the front, thus losing speed rather than gaining it compared to the opponent who runs alongside. The tracks, moreover, offer a mix of very high ramps and dips, and therefore gradually require greater attention to avoid making mistakes, especially if the degree of difficulty calculated on the basis of our upgrade level is high. The need to ~grind~ is evident when you don't want to put your wallet, also because the price of the packages is relatively high, however by playing with a certain constancy it is possible to overcome the first category and buy a vehicle of a different class within a few day. At that point, more than anything else, a certain sense of repetitiveness inevitably takes over, given that the developers have done an excellent job in every sector but have not been able to introduce a sufficient variety of situations, so much so that it is difficult to distinguish one event from 'other.", "date": "2014-07-12", "grade": "7.6"}
