{"name": "SNK 40th Anniversary Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snk-40th-anniversary-collection-recensione.html", "text": "We are used to associating SNK with Neo Geo, but the Japanese company was something more and also something else compared to the wonderful arcade-console of the 90s, which also certainly characterized the best part of its presence on the market: let's therefore discover the SNK secrets in this review. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the company, it can be said that the nostalgia operation closely linked to the Neo Geo era was entrusted to the market launch of the Neo Geo Mini, which beyond some defects represents that period more precisely, while to celebrate the first years the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection operation was developed, which surprisingly proved to be an even better studied product than the bizarre mini-console, at least from the point of view of historical celebration. Here we are talking about the Shin Nihon Kikaku Corporation, founded in 1978 by Eikichi Kawasaki and commonly became SNK in 1981 before the actual name change, which took place a few years later. In the end it wasn't many years before the advent of the 100 Mega Shocks that changed the way of thinking about the arcade, but considering the technological evolution of the time there is a discrete abyss between the first SNK and that of the Neo era Geo, although the links are also evident in some titles included in this collection. Just the selection of games can give us food for thought, because these are 80s titles that are probably unknown to a large part of the Western public, therefore the nostalgia effect on many users is substantially cancelled, but the construction of the Collection as it was elaborated by Digital Eclipse and SNK instead makes it very interesting for everyone. It could be said that, not being able to count on absolutely iconic titles such as those of Nintendo or Sega, SNK has worked very well on the presentation, packaging and composition of a collection that has all the trappings of a historical documentary. Collection At the moment there are 14 titles in the collection, to which another 11 will be added in December, therefore the evaluation that can be done now is clearly partial compared to what the complete collection should be. These are undoubtedly dated products, being all included in the decade of the 80s, however little known by most of the western public, at least by those who do not have a deep knowledge of Japanese videogame history. It should be noted that some of these titles are present in the arcade and console versions, which turn out to be almost two distinct games considering the big differences in terms of hardware that existed at the time and which also allow us to curiously evaluate the solutions adopted by the developers to adapt coin-op titles on still somewhat outdated home machines. There are some notable pearls inside: Athena, one of the best known titles, represents SNK's interpretation of the classic platformer with action adventure elements, following in the footsteps of Wonder Boy and Adventure Island, Crystalis is instead a true action RPG in full console style of the 90s while Psycho Soldier represents a true gem of the action platformer in full Japanese style. As for the more classic arcade tradition, we find several shooters, among which the Ikari Warriors series stands out, probably the best known and most iconic of the first phase of SNK, in whose trilogy the technological evolution taking place within the of the company in the second half of the 80s. A first glimmer of the famous fighting game tradition is also provided to us by the presence of Street Smart, still decidedly immature and somewhat bizarre in form but which already demonstrated a significant propensity for the genre on the part of SNK. It is clearly complex to evaluate a set of games of this type, made up of titles that are now decidedly dated and perhaps not yet able to offer much to the modern audience beyond historical curiosity, nostalgia or the momentary fun of a multiplayer game . Extras and presentation If you look at the way in which the collection is composed, one can only congratulate SNK: beyond the amount of extras present, the completeness of options offered is truly remarkable. In addition to the double console / arcade version that we have mentioned, of almost all games it is possible to select the localization between Japan and the West, which changes the illustrations and other elements inside the game. The display has several options (and on this point we regret even more the opportunity wasted by the Neo Geo Mini) as regards screen size (original, 4:3 with choice of frames or 16:9) and filters (absent , ~CRT~ and ~monitor~), as well as the orientation, which can be impostate vertically or horizontally. There is also a very clever option, which could be adopted by other productions of this type: selecting ~Watch~ starts a demo of the game, a sort of complete long play that can also be paused, rewound or forwarded fast, but the most amazing thing is that at any moment it is possible to interrupt it and take control of the game from wherever it is. All this in addition to the possibility of saving the game and of course multiplayer, where present. In short, the treatment reserved for the games in the collection is truly remarkable, as is the interface used which recovers and enhances the original illustrations, even with the artwork differentiated according to nationality. This aspect is particularly important in the Museum section, where a large amount of documents on the history of SNK video games are collected, with photographs, scans of magazines and manuals, screenshots and patents that flow in slideshows well illustrated by text in Italian that describes in detail the background of each title or particular event related to the company, like real documentaries.", "date": "2018-11-15", "grade": "7.5"}
