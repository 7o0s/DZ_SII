{"name": "Paper Planes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paper-planes.html", "text": "We have often talked about the nature of mobile video games, their characteristics and the mechanics on which they are based. There are rather complex and multifaceted titles, others that are decidedly simpler and more immediate. The common goal is to obtain quality entertainment, regardless of the device on which the software runs, and in some cases we are faced with products with an essential yet intriguing gameplay, which rely on a brilliant starting idea instead of on the implementation of technical solutions aimed at reinforcing hackneyed concepts. Paper Planes falls precisely in this particular vein, after all it could not be otherwise given the theme of the game: a series of competitions between expert launchers of... paper airplanes. Once the game is launched, we can choose to try our hand at a quick game or take a tour of the useful tutorial (divided by items), and then dedicate ourselves to the career mode. This is made up of a few events, divided into a large number of single competitions. Each will see us launch our plane in a different way, to achieve different goals. Is the purpose of the challenge to make the plane travel a certain distance horizontally? Or launch it until it reaches a certain altitude? Or, again, make him perform a certain number of rotations? There will be many objectives to achieve, and to succeed from time to time we will not have to rely only on the type of launches, but also on a series of preliminary settings for our very light aircraft. Before each challenge, in fact, we will be able to adjust the weight of the plane between three different stages, bend its tip gradually to trigger the gyrations or use larger sheets of paper to change its dimensions. A bigger, heavier plane can cover a greater distance, if we launch it right; at the same time, a light, bent-toe aircraft can go very high. The starting system sees our character use a bow for launch, a bow that we can tilt vertically and load more or less depending on the force we want to impart on take-off. When we're ready, just press the 5 key to take off, and observe what happens: if we reach the goal, we'll be able to move on to the next stage; otherwise, we will be able to repeat the launch and change the aircraft settings. The minimum terms for overcoming the challenges gradually become more complex and articulated, even if the structure of the game allows us to make an infinite number of launches: in this sense, hitting the target, however complex, becomes just a question of time and patience. The graphics of the game show a very particular and original style, characterized by pastel colors and stylized shapes. The locations are all very different and boast the presence of different moving elements. The little man who launches the plane has a basic look, not very animated, but the final result is excellent and fits perfectly with the action. The sound follows close behind: although it cannot boast a certain quality, above all due to short and repetitive songs, it offers a successful mix of MIDI music and sound effects. PRO Nice basic idea Unexpectedly rich in thickness Original and successful graphic characterization AGAINST The ~evidence~ structure makes it all too easy Limited gameplay Not very long lived", "date": "2008-08-01", "grade": "S.V."}
