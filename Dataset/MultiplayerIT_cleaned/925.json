{"name": "Realpolitiks II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/realpolitiks-2-recensione.html", "text": "Realpolitiks had big ambitions, but far too many flaws. On paper it wanted to be a grand strategy dedicated to soul and pixels to simulate the complexity of the world of contemporary politics, but in practice it was a game with a cumbersome interface and really superficial mechanics, which after a few hours turned into an arms race for crush rival nations. The Realpolitiks II review can therefore only start by wondering if all these problems have been addressed and resolved. Unfortunately the answer is no. Models Jujubee, the developer, evidently has an idiosyncratic relationship with the grand strategy genre: on the one hand it seems to want to look at the Paradox classics, but on the other it seems to fear complexity and tries in every way to simplify its games, even at risk to water them down. If we want with Realpolitiks II exactly this happened. The premise of the game is interesting: play the role of a leader of the modern world who must make his nation dominant over all others. Now, you don't need to have studied political economy and game design to know that the theme is not easy to translate into a video game due to a thousand problems, first of all the difficulty of making the artificial intelligences of the various states interact with each other in order to seem plausible, but we have several examples of successful games in this sense, first of all that absolute masterpiece of Crusader Kings III, which we can consider a real point of reference for the entire genre. Unfortunately Realpolitiks II doesn't even come close to him in the ability to propose a model of government that entails plausible consequences for decisions often dictated by reasons of state, but just as often by the individual traits of the rulers. Here, as in the first chapter, you practically always end up aiming to enlarge the army in order to be able to conquer all the opposing nations, with the remaining game systems that frame the military ones, in pursuit of the umpteenth delirium of videogame omnipotence. Game mechanics The combat system would be satisfying, if it weren't for the flaws in the interface Yet on paper there are many things to do and consider: you need to have advisers, you can put pressure on parliament to push your agenda, there is a large diplomatic section, you can forge alliances with other nations trying to achieve a goal common, projects can be financed to improve the well-being of one's nation, there is a commercial section to buy or sell the resources indispensable for development, spies have been improved which now truly represent a precious resource for blackmailing allies and enemies and there there are several other systems that give the illusion of being faced with a deeper game than it really is. The truth is that many of Reakpolitiks II's features work poorly. Take diplomacy for example: foreign rulers seem to act randomly and uniformly, so much so that they look like a single artificial intelligence rolling the dice for every decision. The internal economy also has several problems, probably due to bugs. For example, while playing we ended up with buildings that had literally disappeared, which gave a huge boost to our economy. Impossible to know what happened. Will we be able to become the dominant nation? Let's talk about bugs because reloading a previous save the phenomenon did not repeat itself. Another oddity: we ended up with building maintenance costs skyrocketing for no reason. Bug or did something happen that we didn't notice? Who can tell. The military side also suffers from many problems, especially of the interface, the first of which is the movement of troops, which is really cumbersome. Things have improved a bit since Realpolitiks, but not as much as they should have. Any examples? The troops must be selected individually and cannot be grouped, or by zooming the map the units disappear and are lost from sight. Given the importance of the military side, couldn't we have worked to make it more usable? There has been progress, both in the amount of troops and in the artificial intelligence that moves them, but the annoyances caused by the interface are far too many and make the entire combat system more complicated than it actually is. Bugs Don't be fooled, it's easier than you think After all, the Jujubee title has so many bugs that it is often really difficult to play. While we were testing it for the review it crashed twelve times, so to speak. However the bugs don't end there, because there are pfor all tastes: from graphic glitches to busted descriptions of the projects, passing through framerate collapses, even on very performing PCs (we tried it with a GeForce 3070), despite the fact that the graphics are really essential. You will therefore understand that the main problem of Reakpolitiks II is not so much that of not reaching the level of the Paradox titles or proposing an overly simplified formula for a grand strategy, but rather an objective difficulty in allowing the player to start a game and finish it without incurring in strange situations. It's a shame, because some things are done very well and the step forward compared to the first Realpolitiks is quite clear. Another moment on the battlefield In particular, the customization side of the game is decidedly more refined, between the unique characteristics of the advisers and project management, which on paper allow you to orient the type of government as you want. Unfortunately, it is precisely the unexpressed potential that makes the judgment on the game more bitter, which fails to live up to its name and fails to transform itself into a lighter and more fun alternative to the typical heaviness of the genre, despite the underlying depth that characterizes it .", "date": "2021-05-20", "grade": "5.5"}
