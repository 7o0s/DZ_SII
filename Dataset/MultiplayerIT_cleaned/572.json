{"name": "Call of Cthlhu: Dark Corners of the Earth - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-cthlhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth-recensione.html", "text": "is a first-person adventure, mixing shooter, stealth, and RPG elements Dark Corners of the Earth... The game puts you in the role of a private detective, Jack Walters, who is tasked with finding a missing boy in the mysterious town of Innsmouth. This will be the first step towards a nightmarish journey between madness and ancestral fears, which is based on the stories of Howard Philips Lovecraft, a writer of the early 1900s who is rightly considered the father of terror novels of our century. For the uninitiated, a writer of the caliber of Stephen King was inspired by him, and the mythology he created is a continuous subject of background and imitation. There are thousands of modern writings that refer to it (not counting movies, video games, and even role-playing games). In essence, the title is a first-person adventure, which mixes shooter, stealth, and RPG elements in an interesting game-design experiment. There are several innovations, first of all the total absence of a Hud that indicates health or bullets: what you see on the screen is what the protagonist sees. In addition, there is the sanity system, which, depending on dangerous situations or macabre and disturbing scenes, causes particular visual and auditory effects. Madness is an integral part of the title, which will put a strain on the nerves of your virtual alter ego (and yours too), involved in the discovery of a cosmic horror, that of the Great Old Ones. Funny to note an initial warning that warns about what we will see / hear while playing, and the consequences it could have! In addition to moments in which we will have blurred vision and hear gruesome sounds, it will be fundamental to heal quickly after being injured, on pain of weakening which will lead to death. it will be essential to heal yourself quickly after being injured Dark Corners of the Earth... The cure will not be instantaneous and even less unique, it will in fact be possible to cure wounds all over the body, evaluating (in the event of a shortage of medicines) which ones to heal first. This will require recovery seconds, in which it is recommended to take shelter from prying eyes. In fact, the enemies will not give a break, unless they disappear running from their view, which will lead them to be a little agitated and then calm down shortly after. All in all, the A.I. it works decently, considering that often the environments are not very large and that some of its ~oversights~ are mandatory to allow the player to continue. The plot is the basis of everything, and to avoid revealing the details, let's just say that it combines the events of several Lovecraftian stories, with quotes and twists that will delight fans. The adventure takes place in the 1920s, a period in which the writer produced his greatest successes and sees various elements typical of that period, above all weapons. It can be said that the plot is divided into 50% exploration and 50% action, where shootings, escapes, terrible accidents and murders will occur anything will happen! Sore point, the rescue system: there will be checkpoints to reach, which in the case of premature death, will force you to revisit sections (some quite difficult). This will lead to occasional frustrations, due to the need to act quickly and often blindly in some cases (fortunately not many). Innsmuth's mask If from the narrative side the game makes us savor a decadent atmosphere of about a century ago, a certain ~old age~ can also be seen on the graphic side. Five years of work are an era in the videogame field, however the result is not contemptible, but not even comparable to the latest generation games. On Xbox the title is graphically in line with most of the productions, on PC instead we find a port that highlights the limits of the graphics engine. The general aspect of the whole is rather edgy, in some ways embarrassing, but the excellent atmosphere, and a good use of filters and shaders, compensate for this problem. To tell the truth, the PC version is aggravated by a ~dust effect~ filter (similar to that of Fahrenheit) which worsens the visual not a little. Practically given the different settings in the dark and the consequent brightness adjustments, it happens to accentuate this annoying effect (completely useless). The characters and the various creatures are well made, which although they are not at the levels of Half-Life 2, let themselves be watched. The levels, on the other hand, alternate good textures with other much less defined ones, but the general picture still sees a set with attention to most of the details. The environments, both large and small, give an idea of minuteness, perhaps to accentuate the sense of inferiority compared to the Great Ancients. Overall we findor very claustrophobic indoor areas, and outdoor areas that inspire little confidence. As already mentioned, the setting is perfectly successful. A separate discussion for the effects of sanity: for example at great heights the protagonist suffers from vertigo, and the view will be blurred and shaky (after a while you risk seasickness), as in the case of injuries, mental stress or simple visions. All this despite the fact that it is nothing new, it makes some situations very tense (sometimes frustrating) but certainly effective. the best Lovecraft game out there Cthulhu f'tagn! Cthulhu f'tagn! YAHEE! YAHEE! A praise to the audio sector: a good English dubbing and perfectly suited to the context: the people of Innsmuth speak grunting, hiding something non-human (those who have read the story know what we are referring to!) and all the rooms are surrounded by noise more or less natural, like the rustle of the wind or mysterious sounds and voices echoing in the air. The advice is to play with an adequate volume, preparing yourself for continuous jolts in the chair and frightening sounds that will not seem to come only from the game! The music, on the other hand, is not really relevant, something more immersive was thought of, but after all, the sound is already enough to create an atmosphere. The only small ~flaw~ is the voice of the protagonist: although it adapts to most situations, in certain dramatic situations it could have been a little more ~breathless~. The Call of Cthulhu It took an amateur production to worthily transpose the most famous story to the cinema. The H.P. Historical society takes care of ~spreading~ the myth of Lovecraft, and thanks to the talent and perseverance of several people, a few months ago Call of Cthulhu was released, a short film (45 minutes) very faithful to the written narration. It is certainly the best film adaptation of all existing ones, which also has two particularities: it is in black and white and without sound. It practically refers to the films of the 1920s, those with captions and a continuous soundtrack (moreover here very spot on) and the settings and costumes are very well kept! It deserves to be seen at least once, both for the story and for the style! Alone in the Dark Looking elsewhere, one notices how different the videogame and cinematographic works are inspired by the universe created by Lovecraft. Surely the most famous game that refers to it is the legendary Alone in the Dark, which was the first to immerse itself in the Lovecraftian atmosphere. We also remember with pleasure Shadow of the Comet and Prisoner of Ice, (two beautiful graphic adventures) all titles branded Infogrames (the Atari of today). Finally, another immersive first-person adventure (set a la ~Myst~) is Necronomicon. At the cinema, on the other hand, there are various films that take up the stories but often in an obscene or superficial way: noteworthy are ~The Seed of Madness~ (by the great Carpenter) and the aforementioned Call of Cthulhu. Looking around you can find another amateur production, ~Cool air~ which is the excellent transposition of the story ~Aria Fredda~. If, on the other hand, you have a taste for trash that dares to refer to Lovecraft (s)we recommend ~Dagon~, ~Hemogoblin~ and ~Re-animator~, all available on DVD in Italian (to throw away!). Final comment Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is certainly an atypical adventure, a mixture of genres that is certainly well blended and in some ways innovative. If it is true that it is not the first time that an adventure has been presented in first person, it is the set of FPS, RPG, stealth and ~point and click~ elements that make it something unique and interesting. Despite some moments of pure frustration caused by the lack of quicksave, the game enjoys a plot that mixes the most beautiful stories of Lovecraft in a perfect virtual transposition. If the legendary author of Providence were still alive, he would certainly judge it as the best video game adaptation ever created for his works (and superior to most of the films that were badly inspired by them). Recommended for everyone, from fans of the myth of Cthulhu to occasional adventurers. Fans of FPS and graphic frills stay away from it. Pros Best Lovecraft game out there Great story and atmosphere Well blended blend of genres Cons Below current standard graphics Some frustrating sections Only fans will catch every nuance Eons ago First of all, it is good to make a premise: this game has been in the works for more than five years, being postponed several times, so much so that many have compared it to Duke Nukem Forever. After a mysterious announcement dating back more than a year ago, in which it seemed that the title would be released only on consoles, the PC version has finally popped up again, due out in a few days and almost six months away from the Xbox one. If you addanoint the passage of publisher in which the game was involved (which has passed through at least three brands) you will understand how troubled its publication was, which is now in the hands of Ubisoft (while the console one is by Take2).", "date": "2006-03-22", "grade": null}
