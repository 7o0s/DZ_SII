{"name": "One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/one.html", "text": "Pocket punches Before going to make sure of the actual solidity of One's gameplay, however, it is necessary to spend a few words of praise for the much-vaunted cosmetic quality of the Digital Legends title, truly excellent by N-Gage standards. Just to make a comparison, the One's graphics could very well compete with a second-third generation PSX product, with the added advantage of viewing on a small display like that of the Nokia console. In any case, the game offers the beauty of 14 entirely polygonal scenarios, extremely accurate and full of details, on which large characters stand out, very well animated and defined in an almost incredible way considering the hardware in question. A cosmetic abundance, that of One, which inevitably ends up weighing a little on the framerate, not really very high nor much less very stable, but which all in all does not affect if not minimally on an undoubtedly enthusiastic global judgment. The first step in the game relating to the character editor then paves the way for yet another applause for the Digital Legends graphics, capable of inserting a huge amount of clothing and accessories in order to maximize the customization possibilities of one's alter. digital ego. Once this is done, the time finally comes to play by engaging in the most substantial section of One, the Story Mode, which without a real narrative thread leads the user to fight from one end of the globe to the other. The victorious continuation of the adventure leads to the accumulation of ELO points, useful for increasing the ranking of the character and consequently unlocking new skills and items for the editor. The remaining modes (Exhibition, Survival, Training and Two-player Versus via Bluetooth) complete a more than satisfactory picture in terms of playful offer. Now let's see how One behaves on the battlefield... Matter of style The first peculiarity of One's gameplay reveals the presence of three different fighting styles, interchangeable on the fly after pressing the relative keys and characterized by inherent strengths and weaknesses: we therefore find an excellent defensive position for parries and grappling but sparing in terms of moves, an offensive capable of causing great damage thanks to its combos but completely devoid of blocks, and finally a neutral style, the classic middle ground. An interesting playful gimmick because it is capable of increasing the range of moves in favor of the user, but which lends itself to some criticism due to the palpable superiority of the offensive position compared to the other two. Again, the considerable amount of combos that can be performed by the player does not always find comfort in a control system that often lacks precision, frustrating the most elaborate attempts at chaining shots over and over again. Apart from this, One still lets itself be played in a fluid and enjoyable way, despite an AI of the opponents that is far too fickle and badly calibrated: just to give an example, we go from the puppet-fighters of the very first stage to the tough beaters of the second, without solutions intermediate essentials for a correct outline of the difficulty curve. Nothing a little training practice can't overcome, but a little more balance would have been very welcome. Ultimately, One is still a good beat'em up, whose obvious gaps are filled to an appreciable extent by a gameplay that is deep and fun enough. Comment One is certainly the best match beat'em up available on N-Gage, not only courtesy of practically non-existent competition, but above all for its own technical and playful merits. With a graphic sector of absolute excellence for the standards of the Nokia console, the Digital Legends title manages to offer the user a solid and sufficiently complete gameplay, even though it is globally undermined by some defects that are not always minor (AI of opponents and repetitiveness of the game scheme in primis). In short, it will certainly not go down in history, but One is still a good product that all N-Gage users who are passionate about the genre should take into serious consideration. Pros: Excellent graphics sector Captivating gameplay Excellent character editor Cons: Underperforming control system Opponent AI unbalanced Not very long-lived Developed by the Digital Legends team, One has been for a long time one of the most talked about titles for N-Gage: thanks to both its belonging to a genre almost unknown to the Nokia handheld, and to a well-made cosmetics which, first with the screenshots distributed on the net and then in the playable version prexempt at E3, has been able to attract the attention of users. Now that the product is finally complete, it's time to see if One, in addition to graphics, also has a well-defined soul and personality.", "date": "2005-12-01", "grade": null}
