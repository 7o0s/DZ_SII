From the introduction to the game - a short but captivating presentation movie of the characters - we understand that the atmosphere has changed: we are no longer faced with the routine of a single profession, this time the protagonist must juggle the different clues and look for the common thread that unites the mysterious cases of Summer Hill High School. If the risk of getting bored was high in previous titles, this time the panorama of mini-games is much more varied; not only that: the challenge is greater, the complexity rises to a higher level, the execution is no longer so obvious, obviously always within the limits of a title dedicated to children. The investigation must be carried out with accuracy, collecting evidence and spying on the suspects, but above all with attention, since each case ends with a small verification test (it is known that a good detective must not forget even the smallest of details !). The variety also accompanies the choice of characters, which increase in number, while always maintaining very stereotyped characteristics, a fixed point that allows the player to enter the dynamics of the game. Under the magnifying glass The main tool for carrying out investigations is the classic magnifying glass, which will allow you to find the smallest and most hidden details, thanks also to some help: the most attentive, in fact, will notice that the details worthy of note are indicated by a small glow of light and therefore easily traceable. The activities to be carried out do not end like this, but they are the most varied: ranging from the search for the differences between two apparently identical images, to the analysis of fingerprints, passing through planning an ~escape~ without being seen by guards and cameras ! The mechanisms for solving all the proposed mini-games are first clarified in an essential but effective way, even through very simple explanatory images. Also, aids like arrows or that aforementioned glow make completing the mission more accessible; but if the objective is still not clear or if the execution of the test has not gone as hoped, it is possible to repeat the mini-game until the moment in which one is not completely satisfied with the result (therefore it is evident how easy it is to reach the scores maximum; in short, whoever lasts wins...). Finally, it is important to note that all the unlocked mini-games are replayable whenever you feel like it, without necessarily having to depend on the plot, in a special section. Forbidden to...majors! Like every ~Giulia Passione~, this one is also highly recommended for the little ones. Although, in fact, this could be considered a separate chapter, both for the game modes and for the extreme versatility, ~Giulia Passione Avventure - Mysteries at school~ maintains all that series of characteristics that make it unsuitable for players already more ~ navigated~: as announced above, the complexity increases, but always with respect to the ~brother~ titles, which were characterized by an almost embarrassing simplicity. This time the presence of an initial choice between beginner and advanced mode stands out: this should not mislead, since the two difficulties do not differ much from each other (to be completely honest...), however it remains a novelty probably appreciated by the audience to which it refers, which can thus engage in self-improvement or rejoice in the skills acquired. Finally, the choice to create slightly more articulated mini-games than the standard makes the title more captivating, as does the choice to take on the role of an investigator. In conclusion, the title is absolutely recommended to all novice players who are bored with the repetitiveness of similar games and who are looking for some more ideas, while always maintaining a gradual approach to the most daring horizons.", "date": "2009-09-27", "grade": null}
