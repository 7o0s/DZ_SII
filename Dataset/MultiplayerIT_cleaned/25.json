Great things are not expected from a gambling simulation as regards the graphic and sound aspects, in fact all that must be achieved is a simple and intuitive menu, and above all a faithful reproduction of the cards, the gaming, roulette, slot machines, and everything related to the ~disciplines~ of gambling. Playwize recreates all of this flawlessly, adding an extra touch of simulation, i.e. it gives us the possibility to create our character like in a role-playing game, with which we can move freely in the casinos to decide which game to take part in, or listen to the speeches and thoughts of the players who are in the room. Aesthetically speaking, Playwize is very nice, the casinos are very chic and extremely beautiful to look at; technically speaking, however, the quality is not excellent: the models are not very detailed and rendered in a slightly crude way, the animations are woody and a bit awkward, the textures are not the best in terms of definition, and the color rendering is not very lively . Unfortunately Playwize's audio doesn't deserve to be praised either, not so much for the quality, but mostly because of the limited presence of casino sound effects: all you'll hear is the bawling of the croupiers and players (including even real comments on how their game is going), and the sound generated by the cards, dice and roulette. To break up the monotony of casino sounds, there is a discreetly crafted soundtrack that will keep us company throughout. Gamble! Gamble! Gamble! Before starting our adventure in the world of gambling we will have to create our character, and then select one of the available casinos (at first you can only choose one, but the others will be unlockable later). Inside the casino you can move with your character in order to go to the table with the game you have chosen, but if you want we can also approach the people in the room and listen to what they say, for example there are those who complain for having missed the bet and there are those who are trying to pick up a beautiful girl. Obviously our goal is to bet and win money, so first we will choose where to challenge our luck: there is a good number of games to play, and more precisely they are roulette, blackjack, baccarat, red dog , slot machines, wheel of fortune and video poker. In addition there is a special room where different types of poker are played (ie Texas Hold'em, Omaha high, Super hold'em, Pinapple and Crazy Pinapple), where you select the maximum bet, the number of contenders, the bet for the small and big blind and then the game begins. The fact of not being able to bet real money makes some of the games practically useless, think of the slot machine, what fun is there playing it knowing that you can't win anything? Nobody! The same goes especially for the wheel of fortune and roulette, but also for all the other games it becomes boring to follow them without having the possibility to interact with other people and make real bets. To give the player the opportunity to take advantage of his winnings, a boutique has been inserted in which to buy clothes for our character, including sunglasses, hats and jackets, in order to change the look according to our preferences. Certainly the boutique is not an element that can improve Playwize's fortunes, whose defects, due to obvious implementation limitations, will make it sink into oblivion. Final comment Playwize is a game that tries hard to recreate the world of casinos and gambling, and in some ways it succeeds very well. The problem, as explained above, lies entirely in the impossibility of making real bets, and therefore of giving up the ~thrill~ that one feels by betting real chips in a real casino. Most of the games in a casino do not need any particular skill to be played, it is almost exclusively a matter of luck, and it is easy to understand that trying your luck without putting anything up for grabs is decidedly unexciting and fun, above all if you play alone, and the lack of a multiplayer mode prevents any possibility of playing with other people. Playwize is therefore for those who are content to play without having to worry about going bankrupt, or for those who want to test the world of the gambler. In any case, boredom will inexorably take over, and if you feel like playing, it is certainly much more exciting to organize a poker game with friends, even usingI give candy instead of real money Pros: Lots of games to play Well done casinos Cons: Poor technical realization Impossible to bet real money Video game simulations have always given us the opportunity to experience experiences that otherwise we would never have been able to experience in reality. This is due to the fact that in most cases we are faced with situations that are too dangerous and difficult to simulate (just think of a Metal Gear-style action/stealth or a simulation of planes and Formula 1), which force us to take advantage of an electronic device to be able to live them. Unfortunately, no matter how well designed and implemented a simulation may be, there will always be limits due to the means with which it is represented, which do not allow you to reproduce every single detail ... and this can be well understood when we talk about video games that recreate the gambling experience. Playwize tries to reproduce the atmosphere that is created during a game of poker, blackjack, or a round of roulette, but unfortunately the electronic means do not allow the user to bet money and experience the real thrill of gambling. What's the point of staring nervously at the roulette ball when you can't even bet a single euro on it? What's the point of playing poker without being able to test our bluffering skills? What's the point of rolling the dice without a real crowd cheering us on?", "date": "2007-03-16", "grade": null}
