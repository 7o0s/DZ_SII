{"name": "Angeli e demoni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/176761-seraph-angeli-e-demoni.html", "text": "Made under the Dreadbit label by former Media Molecule developer Daniel Leaver, senior designer of successful titles like Little Big Planet and Teraway, Seraph is the classic independent product which, thanks to a particularly solid and refined gameplay, has earned the gamers acclaim since its Early Access debut on Steam, from which it successfully exited after about six months of updates and polishes. The game, a horizontally scrolling acrobatic action/platformer that winks at the dynamics of Bayonetta and Devil My Cry, also landed on PlayStation 4 at the beginning of November, where it is sold at a slightly higher price than the PC version. After the good impressions from our previous test, we returned as the fallen angel to complete his dramatic adventure, an escape through procedural levels infested with hordes of ruthless demons. All the elegance of ~Gun-fu~ in Seraph, action-platformer with Dreadbit procedural levels The art of dodging Seraph, as specified, is a fallen angel, trapped in the body of a girl named Talia held captive inside a fortress-ship (the Corangelus) sailing off the Arabian Sea. For obscure reasons, the vessel is attacked by a horde of demons who eliminate all the passengers on board, except for a couple of cryptic figures who will help Seraph in her return to ~Origin~, the celestial plane from which she hails. from ethical and religious themes, although rarefied and supported only by basic dialogues and simple diaries to collect, it is all in all pleasant to follow up to the final act, which comes after a handful of hours of play. As already underlined, the beating heart of Daniel Leaver's work lies in the excellent gameplay developed along the lines of the ~Gun-Fu~ style, the one in which the typical acrobatics of oriental martial arts are supported by the use of firearms. Chinese director John Woo's action films are a classic example of this. Unlike other side-scrolling shooters/platformers, in Seraph you don't need to aim at your enemies, they are automatically locked onto by your arsenal. After all, all the fun revolves around the acrobatic and elusive skills, made up of double jumps, sudden sprints and the possibility of grabbing and climbing walls (the use of the joypad is absolutely recommended). The basic weapon resides in a pair of pistols, sufficiently powerful and with infinite bullets, while the secondary ones, to be unlocked and collected in special lockers scattered throughout the levels, range between machine guns, assault rifles and ~railgun~ more or less effective. Among the most interesting aspects of Seraph there is precisely the management of weapons and the various angelic powers, linked to a deep crafting system that requires a certain period of practice to be understood in detail. Basic Seraph can perform two ~Miracles~, powerful special moves to upgrade and enhance through the Transmutation menu; among them are Repellent, which repels bullets and enemies, Globe which strikes like a boomerang and Comet, thanks to which the protagonist, after a leap, hurls himself towards the ground, producing huge area damage. In addition to Miracles, our angel can also count on Blessings, to be earned and updated every time you level up, and on Oaths, a series of passive skills and perks that significantly increase firepower, defense, health, critical hits and more. The Oaths, divided into three types called Ammunition, Defensive and Sacred, can be associated with the so-called Fragments, which are in turn organized by effectiveness and rarity. If that weren't enough, protective rings can also be crafted in the Transmutation menu with the elements dropped by defeated enemies, which are randomly dropped in the level lockers. The latter, as anticipated, are of a procedural nature, and although they do not present a design studied to the millimeter, they are generally enjoyable, net of some not always happy stylistic choices. Unfortunately, the only objectives to complete them lie in the defeat of the boss on duty or in the destruction of the so-called ~Fountains Terminus~, the classic nests where demons are generated. In some levels there are also secret areas to unlock, where in addition to the inevitable loot, the precious checkpoints can be found; once killed, in fact, Seraph can be reborn up to three times within the same level, on the fourth, however, it can only be resurrected in the last checkpoint identified. Will I pass or not? Among the most interesting aspects of the titlethere is the level of difficulty, which is shaped according to the player's skill; in simpler words, the better you play and the more numerous and difficult the enemies will be to defeat. Although at a certain point a sort of balance is reached, it should be emphasized that some passages are really difficult to overcome: suffice it to say that the final boss was so challenging in previous builds that Dreadbit necessarily had to weaken him. As far as the ~bestiary~ is concerned, unfortunately the demons as well as not being very varied (there are a dozen species in all) do not even shine for artistic inspiration. Some remember the necromorphs of Dead Space, but the curious chromatic choice - in grayscale - makes them all similar to each other and a little anonymous, although there are some more interesting variations, especially in terms of special attacks. Even the settings, with the exception of some specific levels, are all a bit similar, above all due to the palette and the excessive blurring of the backgrounds; in some cases the design can even be confusing, as one cannot quickly tell the difference between closed and open passageways. Despite the aforementioned defects, amplified by the procedural nature of the work, the delightful gameplay and the frenetic nature of the clashes still manages to turn a blind eye to the less successful aspects, net of an inevitable repetitiveness in the medium / long term. Beyond the main campaign it is possible to play the daily challenges and the weekly survival challenges, which, accompanied by online rankings, offer very interesting objects for the growth of Seraph / Talia. Curiously, the game lacks any graphics options, except for gamut, resolution, and the ability to implement full screen or window. This, as can be seen from the requirements, allows Seraph to run even on older systems, while maintaining a pleasant graphic, which stands out above all for the acrobatic animations of the protagonist (or it would be better to say of the protagonist, given that Seraph is imprisoned in the body of Thalia). The audio sector is very good, supported by a catchy soundtrack and crystalline samples for the effects. Finally, with the exit from Early Access, we underline the introduction of Italian subtitles.", "date": "2016-11-24", "grade": "7.8"}
