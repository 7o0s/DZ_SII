{"name": "Knights Chronicle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knights-chronicle-la-recensione.html", "text": "The oriental-style RPG created for mobile platforms has taken on a very specific structure in recent years, so as to constitute a real separate canon, derived from some traditions of the classic JRPG but with influences reminiscent of the MMO and the online game in general, all with a strong collector imprint also given by the gacha drifts that are now on the agenda. It is something that we have already had the opportunity to examine recently, among other things also talking about the good Might and Magic: Elemental Guardians which falls precisely into this category of games. In this vein we can also easily include Knights Chronicles, the new RPG from the Korean NetMarble which has made itself known in this area also for Lineage 2: Revolution and above all for Seven Knights, with which this new title really has a lot to share, from the characterization to the general organization. Also in this case, it is a matter of setting up a party of heroes and launching them into quests essentially composed of progressive fights, with exploration reduced to a minimum and waves of enemies to be killed until the conclusion of the level is reached, usually corresponding to the clash with a boss. It is therefore exactly the setting that has now become standard for mobile RPGs, also in this case accessible for free as free-to-play with micro-transactions and to tell the truth also quite honest as a sales model, considering that the latter are no longer so invasive in the evolution of the action. As often happens in these games, the main focus has shifted completely on combat and above all on party formation and character evolution, the true engine of the entire gameplay, rather than on the exploration of new settings and on the narration, which can count on a good number of well-crafted anime-style cutscenes. Fights and heroes The gacha dynamic is also prevalent in Knights Chronicle: we therefore find ourselves summoning fighters from a sort of parallel dimension to launch them into battle, trying to free the various areas of the game world from monsters and creatures of various kinds or using them in PvP fights or in special timed events. The excellent character design, in addition to highlighting an excellent production, also has the purpose of fueling the aspiration to collect as many characters as possible, all drawn with a beautiful style and belonging to different classes with varied abilities, among which obviously missing a large number of ~waifu~ in perfect Korean style. Closely connected to the attention devoted to the party is also the complex character customization and evolution system, which allows you to significantly modify and improve the basic characteristics of the various fighters, as well as their appearance, by investing materials and resources. It is on this front that the game of micro-transactions is essentially played out: more than energy bars and forced waits, present but not very nagging, the free-to-play model aims to monetize the desire to grow one's army, given the amount of characters to manage and parameters to keep under control and evolve, for which it is necessary to adopt some shortcuts in case you do not want to invest too much time in grinding. It's still a pretty honest system, considering that it's based on a positive will to advance rather than the need to eliminate forced waiting. However, the usual plethora of warnings, icons and updates that crowd the screens of titles of this type, especially those with a distinctly oriental taste like Knights Chronicle, are also regularly present in this case, so if you are not a fan of menus, under- menus and complex resource and character management mechanics, even a first glance at the game is likely to put you off. The other pillar of the gameplay is made up of the fights, which feature the typical turn-based mechanics in the classic JRPG style. As is by now the norm in this genre of games, also in this case it is possible to adopt an automatic combat system which eliminates tedium in longer grinding sessions, obviously to the detriment of involvement, but Knights Chronicle also adopts a good intermediate solution providing the possibility of semi-automatic combat which still grants the player some initiative, thus trying to take advantage of both systems.", "date": "2018-07-13", "grade": "7.5"}
