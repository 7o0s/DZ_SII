Probably none of us expected that title, so damn derivative at first sight, could hide the biggest pearl of last year, combining action, puzzle, platforming and fresh and ironic writing in the best possible way. A little less than two months after its release, the first of the three DLCs dedicated to the game arrives on the market. We have had the opportunity to play it for most of its contents and, after about ten hours, we are ready to tell you what we think in the review of Immortals Fenyx Rising: A New Divinity. History is made on Olympus A New God begins its narrative right where the main campaign ended its arc. From the main menu it will be necessary to choose to start this additional content, with its own menu and its totally separate and independent progression. Precisely for this reason, once started, it will be possible to decide to load the powers and the unlocked equipment, or start from a standard base chosen by the developers. It goes without saying that, given its temporal location after the campaign, it is advisable to start A New God only after completing the base game. Once started we will find ourselves on Olympus, a totally new location, with its own dedicated map and managed through a series of areas dedicated to the various gods, the ones we have already come to know. Fenyx's goal this time is to be accepted as a member of the Greek Pantheon, and having solved the troubles generated by Typhoon on the Golden Island was evidently not enough. Zeus already considers his newfound daughter as one of them, but being a god doesn't allow you to have the automatic right to a chair on Olympus and to be worthy of it you need to pass a very long series of tests. Basically this is the basis on which the entire plot of A New God develops, taking advantage of the new location and this narrative device as a pretext to put the player in front of a multitude of challenges along the lines of those of Tartarus already faced in December. Each series of challenges, assigned by one of the four gods - Ares, Aphrodite, Athena and Hephaestus - will unlock brand new abilities and four new blessings for Fenyx. Although it is a pretext, as already mentioned, we really appreciated the effort made by the team to create a sort of continuation of the story also for this DLC which, otherwise, would only be characterized by a sort of challenge mode to the nth degree. The ten hours needed to complete the plot does not hide who knows what growth of the characters and fails to address the important issues that were pitted in the base game with the same lightness. Net of this, one can still be on average satisfied with the effort made. On the other hand, the well-known situations and entr'actes of Immortals are always there, to elicit more than a smile with their genuineness and the right irony. Similar but different gameplay As we have already said, the gameplay of Immortals remains substantially unchanged, dividing itself between its purely action part and the much more structured one dedicated to environmental puzzles. Although the basics remain these, A New God brings into play a series of small but substantial differences, which modify the perception of the game and which push the user to have to reinvent himself in the approach to some situations. What immediately catches the eye is that on Olympus there are no objects and, for this reason, also all those quick uses that we used to keep close at hand on the d-pad are now gone, leaving room for a substantially longer life bar than in the past, but giving as immediately a clear direction to the gameplay. All the DLC is focused more on puzzles and challenges, relegating the Olympus map to a simple pastime, almost as if it were a gigantic central hub, embellished by an aesthetic as always delightful and by a level design which reaches its peak here. Even within the various dungeons (many, perhaps even too many) it will also be possible to encounter some brand new mechanics: such as the one linked to magnets, or others that are subject to the use of some of the new powers available. We don't want to spoil these details because it's basically all there is really to discover in this DLC, but know that Fenyx will finally be able to lift even those huge and very heavy objects that it was previously impossible for her to maintain. During these challenges, although still present in some sporadic moments, the fights will be close to the bone and almost always linked to part objectivesiculars that will make it a part of the challenge itself. This element will certainly turn up their noses to some, but the goal of the DLC is clear right away and remains honest from start to finish, a detail that made the original extraordinarily appreciated. In addition to these elements, two words must be said also for new Fenyx gear and upgrades. Compared to the past, the latter are very small, leaving the player with only a further degree of weapon and armor upgrades, which will be useful not only to increase their parameters, but above all to unlock the peculiar perks of the new sets, which will require level 7 of progress. All the new equipment is mainly designed to help in situations dedicated to the DLC, but they didn't make us cry out for miracles, neither in terms of utility, nor in terms of aesthetics (apart from a really splendid armor and which you will take in the first few minutes).As regards the difficulty, also in this case the developers have been clever in being able to balance the request for gray matter and intuitiveness, without ever making the game frustrating, even if in some cases losing the compass of longevity. If in fact the Golden Island contained dozens of short crypts and a handful of long and articulated challenges of the Gods, this time we got carried away, stretching the stock a little too much in some sections. Probably also for fear of perceiving a non-exciting duration, but in doing so we ended up risking the opposite effect. Nothing that could affect the general quality of a package that is interesting and always fun, despite a considerable unit price.", "date": "2021-02-01", "grade": "7.5"}
