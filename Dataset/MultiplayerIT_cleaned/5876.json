In the midst of the industrial revolution, a period of great economic growth but also of great injustice, the two will have to deal with rival gangs, children to save, shady plots and a new ~villain~, Crawford Starrick, who controls the capital and aims to gain even more power thanks to his ties to the Order. Revealed by a sensational leak a few weeks after the release of Unity, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the first episode of the series developed by Ubisoft Quebec, a team that had already collaborated with the other divisions of the French company in the processing of previous chapters for the franchise. Of course, the task of convincingly rendering a setting as fascinating as that of Victorian London would perhaps have required a greater use of resources, but after what happened with Assassin's Creed III, Ubisoft's new philosophy is to break up the production of its games, so as to preserve its coherence in both narrative and structural terms. Digressions aside, Syndicate arrived on PC late compared to the console versions in order to guarantee the degree of filing necessary for such an important release, and to avoid at all costs the embarrassing glitches that afflicted Unity at launch. Our hope was also that the developers would find a way to take advantage of the greater computational power afforded by the Windows platform to offer not only higher resolution and frame rates, but also to repopulate a London that appears practically deserted compared to the Paris of Unity. Unfortunately, we say it right away, we were not satisfied. Assassin's Creed Syndicate comes to PC with better graphics than the console versions Graphic settings As necessary, this review is based almost exclusively on the technical aspects of the game on PC, so for more details on the plot, mechanics and surrounding elements, go read the article on the console version. The first thing we can say is that in terms of performance Syndicate behaves very similarly to Unity, but without guaranteeing the same glance. The graphics options screen, this time equipped with an indicator of the impact on video memory, allows on the one hand to adjust resolution and v-sync (good news: even using it the impact on frame rate is minimal), on the other to access to the advanced settings and therefore determine the general quality, that of the environments, of the textures, of the shadows, of the ambient occlusion and of the anti-aliasing. Some novelties stand out: the shadows can be set to ~low~, ~medium~ and ~high~, determining the degree of ~scale~ that they project on the bodies, but there are also technologies for soft shadows and ~ultra ~, which further soften and blur the edges of the projections. The same ~ultra~ adjustment is now also present on the HBAO+, for an even more advanced ambient occlusion, while the anti-aliasing can count on many variations: from simple FXAA to a combination of MSAA and TXAA able to round off contours of the polygonal models to the point of giving them a minimum of thickness and contributing to the general visual rendering. Unfortunately, maxing all of these effects out at 1080p resolution has a serious impact on frame-rates, so much so that we dropped below 30 frames per second on our test setup. Luckily, you just need to tweak shadow quality (setting it to 'high') and anti-aliasing to get sixty frames per second in most situations, with some dips only during carriage rides. We left the frames per second counter visible to give you an idea of the performance, but bear in mind that without the AMD processor bottleneck we could certainly have achieved more: if you own a mid-to-high-end Intel processor and a GTX 970, in all likelihood you'll be playing a solid 60 frames with no dips. Big concerns As mentioned above, the London of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is indeed larger than the Paris of Unity, but it is not as beautiful in its landscapes, nor as alive. Firstly, even by changing the quality of the environments, which should affect the number of objects visible in the distance and the population of the scenarios, the differences are minimal. Unfortunately, the developers used the London haze to save themselves from rendering the buildings over distance, which is particularly evident during thetraditional ~synchronisations~ from the top of buildings and bell towers. The strange thing is that if in Unity there was a mist that hid certain portions of buildings, however rendered in a realistic way, in Syndicate the same effect is ~smeared~ over the whole background from a certain point onwards, artificial and ugly to see . Then there is an issue regarding the incidence of light on the models, which makes the houses ~flat~ in the daytime, giving the sensation of a lower polygon count and a general lack of detail. Also and above all walking around the street, there are many glimpses of London that seem to come from a previous generation title due to the desolation and flatness of the surfaces, and it's really a shame because walking instead of in the evening things change drastically, reflections on puddles do their job and artificial lights create a great atmosphere. All of this, however, net of a desertification of the streets which constitutes a real about-face with respect to the extraordinary work done for Unity, with revolutionary Paris that was teeming with people, especially in the crowded squares, and therefore presented itself as a city believable, active, splendid to see from every angle, whether it was from below or from above. Going around London, on the other hand, gives back a sense of insignificance: the streets are wide but nobody is there, the squares are practically empty. In the previous episode of the series there were also a lot of buildings that could be entered and boasted a beautiful interior, full of reflection effects on the wooden surfaces, excellent textures and a nice change of lighting when going from outdoors to indoors. In Syndicate's London there is none of this, the interiors are reduced to the bone and do not guarantee the same glance, on the contrary. The video you find here, made using the PlayStation 4 version of the two titles, clearly highlights these differences. Up there on the rooftops with Annette In addition to the technical aspect, the different connotation of London in Assassin's Creed Syndicate also significantly influences the gameplay. The city, as mentioned, is larger and the streets are very wide, an element that in the vision of the developers has lent itself to the use of a new tool for moving around, the rope launcher. In practice, it is a grappling hook very similar to the one present in the various Batman: Arkham, but less reactive as regards the indication of possible attachment points. During a run on the roofs, the main difference between Syndicate and Unity is that our character will not make leaps that he knows he cannot cover, but will stop and the only way to proceed in the same direction will be precisely to use the rope launcher, creating a line that Jacob or Evie will cross at different speeds depending on the slope: if the target is lower, we will proceed quickly; if it is placed higher or at the same level, we will go slower and we will often have to push with the arms. In the ideas of the authors, this solution should have allowed faster movement on the roofs of the city, but in reality the grappling hook is only useful when you need to climb a hill quickly, perhaps to escape the gaze of enemies alerted by our presence. while the function of rapid passage from one roof to another rarely works as it should, breaking up the pace of the race and preventing us from taking off even jumps that in theory should be within our reach. Casting off the traditional Assassin's Creed rooftop ride, which also had an aesthetic value (looking at a city from above always has its reason), for longer journeys there are two possibilities left: fast travel or a carriage ride. The latter is managed in the same way as Grand Theft Auto, so it is possible to steal any tank around the city and use it, ~navigator~ included, to reach your destination faster. Fights and side activities As highlighted in the review of the console version, the single player campaign of Assassin's Creed Syndicate features two playable characters instead of one, precisely the Frye brothers, and the missions in which they are protagonists often have different purposes: Jacob aims to free the city, even above all by reinforcing the ranks of her gang, while Evie wants to follow in her father's footsteps and therefore concentrate on the recovery of sensitive objectives, primarily the Pieces of Eden. The fact of using two Assassins could have given rise to a real differentiation of the gameplay, which however in fact did not exist: the enhancement of the characters is managed independently, therefore we can for exampleimprove Jacob to make him an unstoppable warrior, ideal for open battles, and instead specialize Evie in stealth missions and silent eliminations, but there are no constraints in this sense and the abundant availability of skill points, the lack of preventive indications on the missions with one or the other, and finally the fact that both can use the same equipment, lead to the construction of two very similar Assassins, which do not offer the much desired gameplay variety that the series desperately needs . To further highlight the lack of attention to these aspects of production stands out an artificial intelligence below that seen in Unity and a globally lower degree of challenge: if in the previous episode the effectiveness of the maneuvers strictly depended on the weapons used and the times to carry out the counterattacks were reduced, in Syndicate it almost seems that the opponents wait for the pressure of the B button to sink the blow, as well as forming ridiculous and very flashy trains, almost as if they do not want to disturb us while we break the arms and disembowel their companions. A side note about the increased visual violence: it didn't seem very elegant to insert female enemies and then see Jacob literally break their bones during fights. Going back to the technical issues, there is also an excessive recycling of polygonal models and therefore it shouldn't be surprised if you always fight against the same people. On one point, and only one, the hand has been pressed: the patrols appear more complex and tight, especially during some secondary missions, and concluding them without being spotted sometimes proves to be a difficult undertaking. The problem is that this rigidity instead collides with many cases in which killing a man on the street has no effect: two weights and two measures that do not satisfy. As for the collateral activities, the investigator-style missions have unfortunately been missing, but there is a certain variety between chariot races, clandestine fights, the kidnapping of Templars, the elimination of enemy headquarters or single targets, and finally head-on clashes between gangs .", "date": "2015-11-21", "grade": "7.7"}
