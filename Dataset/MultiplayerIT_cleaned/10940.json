{"name": "Ferrari GT: Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-gt-evolution.html", "text": "Despite the competition from various manufacturers (Italian and international), there is no doubt that the charm of Ferrari is unique. The history of glory and successes of the Maranello team was built above all in Formula 1, and road models have always benefited from the technical evolution obtained through racing. The world of video games could not fail to pay homage to these cars, which since the days of Out Run have also represented an extraordinary mix of speed and beauty for gamers. And the mention of the SEGA arcade was not made by chance, as Ferrari GT: Evolution is strongly inspired by that classic driving game (as well as its recent remakes) and it is possible to see it right from the start, when our Ferrari tackle a curve in a drift making us gain points and speed. Gameloft has created two different versions of the game to meet the technical capabilities of various mobile phones: one with ~hybrid~ graphics, the other completely in 3D. In both cases we will find ourselves facing the same modalities, that is we will be able to try our hand at fast races or start a career that will lead us to face a large number of challenges, but at the same time will make us sit at the wheel of dozens of carefully reproduced Ferraris. Ferrari GT: Evolution uses the tried and tested ~rewards~ system that allows us to race on a specific circuit or to use a specific car only once we have ~unlocked~ it through the career mode. The latter represents the fulcrum of the game: we will take on the role of a driver who has just bought a Ferrari and wants to make a name for himself through races and trials of all kinds. Our talent will be noticed in Maranello and we will soon find ourselves within a system that rewards our successes with the acquisition of new cars and the ~green light~ towards unprecedented and fascinating locations. Once you get on the track, you notice big differences between the 2D and 3D versions of the game: the first has precise and reliable control, with the possibility of making corrections to the trajectories without problems as well as producing controlled drifts at each corner; the second, unfortunately, is much less precise, with a certain delay in response to commands which translates into a much less satisfying and often frustrating experience. It is difficult to explain the reason for this serious lack, which in fact differentiates the two versions decisively beyond the purely technical aspect. For the rest, there are no ~boosts~ or particular bonuses to collect during the races, so we will have to rely on our abilities alone to win. The level of difficulty is well calibrated, and we will often find ourselves taking crossroads that will show us different scenarios but always very beautiful to see. The various Ferraris that we will be able to drive will behave differently on the road, as it should be, increasing the variety of situations in favor of the longevity of the product. The 3D version of the game boasts well-crafted polygonal graphics, even if not at the levels of the recent Need for Speed Underground. The track runs smoothly, the cars are faithful to their real-life counterparts and there is excellent use of colour. The scenarios are always beautiful to look at and full of moving elements, while there are no pop-up effects due to the particular design of the tracks. The 2D version is certainly less spectacular, but the differences in terms of visual impact aren't huge: the cars are well designed, with good animation describing their rotation in corners, and the scenarios are also characterized by excellent design. In both cases, unfortunately, the sound sector proves to be essential and adds nothing substantial to the action.", "date": "2009-01-05", "grade": "S.V."}
