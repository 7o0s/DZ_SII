{"name": "Ridge Racer 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ridge-racer-2.html", "text": "Godspeed The structure of Ridge Racer 2 does not change one iota compared to the first chapter: the backbone of the single player is represented by the tour mode, a mode in which the player starting from the lowest categories by participating in a series of championships will be able to acquire cars and the access to the more difficult levels. The level of AI still remains one of the most important things: the opponents will do everything to not let the players pass, blocking the road at every opportunity; in the higher levels, Ridge Racer voluntarily quotes an old predecessor (Ridge Racer Revolution), forcing the player to play in first person view using the mirrors to block the arrival of one of the most desired cars of the whole game. The graphics, sounds and menus are taken verbatim from the first Ridge Racer for PSP, even the presentation of the Tour mode is the same; the additions turn out to be some tracks recovered from the fourth chapter (Ridge Racer Type 4, released for ps1) and a series of musical pieces equally taken from the chapters that preceded this portable version. ~Revised and corrected~ seems to be the leitmotif that runs throughout the game and the sense of deja vu is sometimes such that curiosity is stronger than laziness, pushing the game test almost more towards a comparison of the two PSP versions in search of something really new. And there is something, in fact, and it's called survival mode, a mode in which four cars challenge each other in an elimination race, where for each lap completed, the last classified is directly redirected to the Game Over screen and therefore excluded from the race ; also in this case, deferring to the effective quality of this modality, one certainly cannot speak of innovation, unless one intends the universe of racer games closed and restricted to the Namco saga alone (Burnout for example already used this modality Years ago). The single player modes end with the classic Arcade in which you will compete against the clock by moving quickly between the various checkpoints on the track, and the duel mode represented by a simple 1vs1 race with both opponents driving the same car model. Also in this case the alleged lack of originality of the game is felt: these last two modes are not intended as an addition to the tour mode but rather as a rather bland integration, where the tracks and cars are selectable only after having unlocked them in the Tour In addition to all this, it rains in the wet also on the multiplayer side: in the first portable chapter Ridge Racer was playable in a multiplayer version with an ad hoc connection, or by exploiting two people equipped with UMDs and a great desire to play; almost as if to underline an already all too evident trend, there are no news from a multiplayer point of view, with the same ad hoc connections for all the willing ones mentioned above. What if... Graphically, the game remains excellent, certainly among the best things seen on PSP both in terms of the game engine and for a mere aesthetic aspect of the tracks and cars. In the same way, the sound sector does not disappoint, despite presenting few innovations, it remains of the highest level and with a set of songs that range between many genres (in part, it will also be possible to select the favorite song, in order to drive in complete comfort) to satisfy every kind of musical palate. it is not enough to add a number to a franchise to make it a new title What if... However, the shortcomings and the lightness used in developing the game weigh too much. It is evident that it is not enough to place a number alongside a franchise to make a new title out of it: ideas and the desire (and courage) to jump into something new are needed. It's a real shame that capable developers waste time smoothing the edges of games that have very few of them. Namco would have the ability to develop a new Ridge Racer and instead persists in offering gamers updated versions of their old products, collections and so on. The vote is to be considered an average between what Ridge Racer 2 is worth taken out of any context (8), and what is worth as a sequel (6). If this Ridge Racer 2 wants to act as a replacement version of the first then it probably makes sense to exist, however when it will be considered as a new game because of that misleading ~2~, then many people will be disappointed. If every year, in any fair, they also awarded the ~sequel most similar to the original~ award, this would rightfully go to this Ridge Racer 2. The game brings very little new, on the contrary it presents itself in the same graphic guise as its predecessor , with the only additions found in a few more tracks and songsu. We would like to recommend this title only to those who have not tried the first chapter, who would therefore find a good exponent of the arcade guide. Namco postponed to September, or rather to March, until the release of the chapter for Ps3. Pros: Taken individually, it remains a very valid racing game. Graphically excellent. Cons: It's basically the same game that came out a little over a year ago. No innovations worth mentioning. Even the menu graphics have been reused. Sequels are common practice in the world of video games, and while for some very famous and loved (and old) franchises the ceiling of ten has now been broken through, many others born in the 32-bit generation are preparing to reach the sixth or seventh incarnation. However, the sequels live very different stories: there are those that arise as a direct consequence of the previous chapter, others instead limit themselves to taking up the name of the saga by inserting new elements, new characters and perhaps new settings, and finally there are the sequels in disguise as sequels, those that add little, change nothing and are in fact like a revised and corrected version of the game released a few months earlier. A striking example? Ridge Racer 2, to be considered more of a remixed version of the first Ridge Racer, excellent launch game for PSP and undoubtedly the best representative of the ~racer~ category on Sony's portable console.", "date": "2006-10-18", "grade": null}
