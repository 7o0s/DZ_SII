{"name": "Zum-Zum", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zum-zum.html", "text": "Throwing yourself into the vein of puzzle games is something very demanding and risky, where inventing something new is almost impossible and more often than not you find yourself recycling already widely tested mechanics and structures. It is an old story, which we have already seen in the mobile sector as well, and which repeats itself with the release of Zum-Zum, which according to the title is clearly inspired by Zuma, a Java video game released for mobile phones in 2006. Using the same mechanics, this new HeroCraft title offers us the beauty of thirty-five different levels and two game modes (classic or survival), with the clear intention of offering all fans of Luxor and Zuma something that goes beyond mere data- disk. Once you start a game, you realize that the actions that the game makes available to us are more numerous than expected. Luxor and Zuma differed mainly in the presence of curvilinear or segmented paths, but the substance was the same: it was necessary to stop the advance of the row of colored balls, putting identical ones together which then, as in any self-respecting puzzle game, disappeared . Zum-Zum tries to go further: without prejudice to the motion of the balls, in this case along curved lines that are different each time, we will have the possibility not only to change the ball to shoot against the row, ~mixing~ the elements at our disposal, but we will also be able to place the ~cannon~ on the opposite side of the screen with respect to the starting point. The control system puts itself at the service of this mechanic, revealing itself to be simple and well organized right from the start: if our cannon is in the lower part of the screen, we can move it by going left or right with the joystick, shoot the ball by pressing on and move to the top of the screen by pressing down, while the 5 key is used to change the ball before shooting it. This extra possibility allows us to dedicate ourselves to eliminating the queue in a much more effective way, and with a little practice we manage to put together some spectacular combos. The novelties introduced by Zum-Zum do not end here, however: we will not only shoot normal balls, but also a series of bonus objects of various types: multicolored balls (which therefore take on the color of the adjacent elements on the row, once fired), missiles , etc. In short, the basic action remains the same, but is enriched by a series of innovations that actually add depth to this particular type of puzzle game. The technical realization stands at discrete levels, as is normal for a product that bases its charm on the structure and ideas behind it, rather than on aesthetics. The balls are always clearly visible and it is possible to ~read~ the row even in the most chaotic situations, without any particular problems. The background changes from time to time, both for the shape of the path and, above all, for the colors used. The musical accompaniment is dignified but not essential, while the control system is immediate and precise, with a prompt response to inputs. PRO Proven play structure Interesting innovative elements Technically well done... AGAINST ...but far from spectacular It's still a ~clone~ The graphics are sometimes too ~small~", "date": "2008-06-18", "grade": "S.V."}
