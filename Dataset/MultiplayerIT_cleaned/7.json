Fortunately Donald Duck Operation Traffic does not fall into this category, since the Disney title is revealed right from the start as a puzzle game that is perhaps not memorable, but sufficiently original and particularly fun to the point of being able to reside permanently on anyone's mobile phone. The concept of the game is the same as Traffic Mayem, a Gamevil title released in 2005 and which achieved good success; in summary, the aim of the game is to manage 3 or 4 traffic lights of a road junction, each one associated with keys 2, 4, 6 and 8 of the keyboard. In fact, the pressure of each of them determines the passage from red to green, and therefore the stopping or not of the traffic; the aim of the game is to manage the flow of cars in the best possible way, trying to avoid accidents among the poor inhabitants of Duckburg as much as possible. Yes, because the protagonist is Donald Duck, the new traffic policeman, together with a whole series of other Disney characters who will gradually make their appearance, for all lovers of the comics in question famous all over the world: Gastone, Uncle Scrooge, Qui, Quo, Qua, and so on. In reality, the Disney world is little more than a side element, which enriches a solid, simple and captivating gameplay. There's not much to learn in Operation Traffic, everything is clear from the start: managing the intersection perfectly brings with it points which then add up to reach the threshold necessary to pass the level. Passing the cars particularly close to each other also provides bonuses, and there is no shortage of extra skills that Donald Duck can earn to increase the final score, together with mini-games that give a little variety to the whole. From a graphic point of view, perhaps more could have been done, especially for the high-end mobile versions, but it is also true that the aesthetic aspect has never been a key component of the puzzle genre; therefore, if the short descriptive sequences of the story make their appearance thanks to the charm of the Disney tables, the actual game is slightly too minimalist. The sound is pleasant, never intrusive or over the top, with spot on songs and nice and suitable effects. PRO funny right away stimulating irresistible characters AGAINST improved graphics a bit repetitive in the long run", "date": "2007-03-26", "grade": "S.V."}
