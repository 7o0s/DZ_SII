To this, today, the Squid Game syndrome must also be added a little which, inevitably, has taken the media scepter of influences when dealing with themes such as deadly games, improvised couples in absurd and dangerous places, colorful cast and that persistent sense of anxiety under the skin. Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is that fusion experiment you don't expect, that disguised indie that in the meanwhile tries to emerge outside the box, bringing NIS America once again to the outer edge of the label and conceding to IzanagiGames to explode that inventive cauldron already proposed with World's End Club. Graphic novels and shoot-em-ups The first piece of information to share is that either you know Japanese, the only audio language present, or you know written English, since Italian is absent as per the script. Then there is the theme of game flow: IzanagiGames really wanted to insert a lot of text, alternating well-written dialogues with others that were a bit long-winded. If you are a fan of the games of the Rising Sun you will already have a hard rind and you will digest those seemingly endless conversations, perhaps even appreciate them: in general, Yurukill's writing works quite well on average, with peaks of boredom in some situations where you would like play but no, you still have to put up with the dialogues. All right, let's take it as a distinctive narrative trait that goes to taste and move on. The second novelty is the playful composition: Yurukill gives a big push to fans of graphic adventures and gives a small one to fans of... shoot-em-up. You read that right: the developers have incredibly opted to insert old-style vertical shooter mechanics in certain points that try to differentiate the offer, resulting however in order to enrich it only in the early stages of unexpected bewilderment, when it can still party. But then everything decreases going forward, given that the difficulty level is always very accessible and the body of the arcade experience does not really add anything to what has already been seen perhaps thousands of other times. Then we come to the third element, the fundamental one: the narrative part, the point-and-click part, in short, is the one that best meets the expectations of those approaching such a product. The question now is just: does it work as it should? The game of wishes Yes, Yurukill: The Calumniation Games has things to say on the story and narrative front: its premises, perhaps not sufficiently original in the colorful firmament of Japanese madness, are linked to a good cast of characters, to situations in which to solve puzzles - unfortunately almost always very easy - and at stages of progress in reading a canvas that can give some unexpected surprises. The island of Yurukill Land, where the amusement park will host the group of condemned men and executioners - on one side there are state prisoners, on the other side apparently normal people attracted by the fulfillment of a wish if they win the game - is a place that offers food for thought, for games, painstaking analysis of the rooms and narrative adrenaline. Instead, don't expect playful adrenaline, as we are not dealing with a particularly fast or snappy product: the narrative has its own tempos and the flow of the game is rather cadenced as per the best Japanese graphic novel tradition. In any case, the story knows how to take it by the hand and carry it forward: the beginning is decisive and captivating, enthralling, pleasant. There are 5 teams of ~competitors~ and you will enjoy advancing in the challenge, game after game and puzzle after puzzle. We were saying, the puzzles: as much as it will be the curiosity to see how everything evolves that will carry you forward, we would have liked a little more inventiveness on the puzzle side, which instead are resolved quite quickly without ever giving real bite, exactly like the shoot- em-ups.", "date": "2022-07-12", "grade": "6.9"}
