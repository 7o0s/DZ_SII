{"name": "Shadow of Rome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-of-rome.html", "text": "Rome is one step away from ruin: from every neighboring territory enemies rise up ready not only to defeat its soldiers, but also to break into the territories of the Empire. After ascending the throne, Julius Caesar manages to put things right by imposing the Pax Romana... which, however, does not last long: the emperor is killed in mysterious circumstances, leaving power in the hands of Antonio. The unbeatable centurion Agrippa, having returned from the battlefield, finds his father Vipsanius imprisoned and accused of the murder of Cesare. Not believing these accusations, the warrior will be helped by the shrewd Octavian to discover the truth about the emperor's assassination, in a series of events that will lead him to give up his role as a soldier to become a gladiator and have the chance to free his father. . This, briefly, is the plot on which Shadow of Rome is based, the latest Capcom product that introduces an unprecedented ~alternate~ game mode: in some sections, with a distinctly arcade character, we will take on the role of the powerful Agrippa and we will have to engage in fights to the death; in others, characterized by numerous ~stealth~ elements, we will impersonate Octavian in his espionage missions. Both characters will try to do their part to free Vipsanio and unmask the real culprits of the assassination of Julius Caesar. Agrippa and his way of seeing things First centurion by vocation, then gladiator by necessity, Agrippa is a powerful and lethal character, who faces dozens and dozens of opponents in the most disparate arenas with the sole objective of saving his father from being killed by the hand of a ~champion~ chosen through a tournament. The game sections in which he is the protagonist are characterized by pure action: you will find yourself fighting using only your hands or, better, an endless series of more or less powerful, more or less large, more or less manageable weapons. The moves at your disposal are extremely numerous: you can simply hit the enemies (~hooking~ one at a time), steal their weapons, perform combos of variable effectiveness, grab them from behind to throw them, ~finish~ them when they are on the ground or get them up to hit them again. The combat system sometimes suffers from the uncertainties of the view, which can still be managed using the back keys of the pad, but always proves to be up to the situation, requiring a pinch of strategy and cunning in more complex situations, when the opponents are numerous and concentrate only on one of them proves risky. Even the management of weapons is intelligent: each of them is equipped with its own energy bar, depleted which breaks. The more you progress in the adventure, the more impressive and lethal the weapons become, which translates into great fun... The main purpose of a gladiator is to entertain the public, and Agrippa cannot exempt himself from this burden: killing enemies using spectacular combos and moves (with the most extravagant names) will increase your score, and from time to time you can shout incitement to the people, who will respond by throwing weapons or food into the arenas. You don't always have to just strike blindly, however: some battles will require the completion of certain missions (escorting a prisoner, clearing areas, setting enemies on fire, destroying the statues of an opposing team), giving a pinch of variety to the whole. Octavian and his way of not being seen The game sections with Octavian are characterized by the ~stealth~ action, i.e. the need to not be noticed, move stealthily, say the right words, disguise yourself and so on. The character is decidedly less robust than Agrippa, therefore he is automatically prevented from fighting: if they find you wandering around in places where you are not allowed, you will necessarily have to escape and find refuge for a certain period of time, after which everything it will come back as before. Unless, in the meantime, they kill you. On some occasions you will have to knock out the guards using jugs or ropes, but this type of action is still aimed at reaching otherwise inaccessible areas, or at obtaining useful clothes to go unnoticed. The movements that Octavian can make are very reminiscent of what was seen in the Tenchu series and in Metal Gear Solid: leaning out of corners, walking close to walls, climbing in certain points, hiding, etc. etc. If the sections with Agrippa are decidedly uncomplicated, the discussion with Octavian is different: to understand what needs to be done, one always proceeds ~by trial and error~, restarting the stage each time to make a different experiment, until one finds a way to continue . Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's terribly frustratingnt... No shadow on the technical realization Shadow of Rome is powered by a very high quality graphics engine, capable of handling extremely complex and detailed polygonal models, which move in a fluid and convincing way. The uncertainties of the graphics can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and absurdly they occur when you are in command of Octavian rather than when, with Agrippa, you face five or six opponents at the same time. The work done for the Resident Evil series can be seen in the beauty of the faces, in the refinement of the expressions, in the realism of the bodies (massive or slender) and, last but not least, in the gory details: arms that jump off, heads that gore, puddles of blood and half-baked people are the order of the day in the gladiatorial arenas. Even the ~outline~ is convincing, both in the settings and in the special effects that adorn them. The sound, while not as brilliant as the graphics, has the undoubted merit of creating a certain atmosphere, thanks to spot-on music and a series of convincing effects. The dialogues, however, do not differ from the standards to which Capcom has accustomed us: the actors are not professionals and are unable to play their part as they should. ~Fixing things~ for the Italian version of the game would have been great, too bad they limited themselves to subtitles (the quality of the translation, however, is very good).", "date": "2005-02-17", "grade": "8.2"}
