{"name": "Advance Guardian Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/advance-guardian-heroes.html", "text": "Stronger, guys! Like its ancient predecessor, Advance Guardian Heroes is also a scrolling beat'em-up, seasoned with a sprinkle of Role Playing Game that never hurts. In fact, it is by punching our opponents that we will obtain particular gems thanks to which it will be possible to enhance the statistics of our alter-ego, to make him increasingly powerful and unstoppable. An alter ego that we will also select at the beginning of the game, choosing from three basic characters (Enn, Ray, Hyu), and who will be possessed by the soul of a legendary hero to battle the forces of evil. The difference between the three basic characters affects their starting stats (some are stronger in attack, some in defense, some are better versed in magic and so on) and the natural element of their magical powers (obviously fire, ice and electricity), which it will be possible to use in combat via a simple combination of keys: we choose the type of magic we want to use and then generate it to hinder the enemies. Between waves of energy in pure Dragon Ball style, fireballs, blades of ice and electric storms, there is certainly no shortage of variety. However, it is wise to resort to magic only in the most difficult moments, given that otherwise our hero can fight with his bare hands through a myriad of attacks and combinations, and defend himself using a special counterattack or an enchanted shield. And then there's Hyper Mode: getting hit repeatedly will increase our fighter's rage, until it's possible to activate this mode to become temporary killing machines. On paper, therefore, we have an exceptional, varied and fun action game in front of us... but that's not quite the case. How do you like it? The main problem of Advance Guardian Heroes is its technical realization, which at first glance may appear excellent, but which negatively affects the gaming experience. Leaving aside the bizarre character design that you may or may not like depending on whether you love or not the typically Japanese graphic style that distinguishes it, it is precisely on the front of the visual rendering that Advance Guardian Heroes succeeds in the difficult task, and it goes without saying, to be a feast for the eyes and simultaneously annoy the player. Between excessive use of mode-7, spectacular environment animations (just think of the river stage, with the raft racing wildly towards a waterfall and the waves surging around it) and huge explosions, there is little room for fluidity of the action in the midst of dozens of opponents who attack us from all sides. Thus it becomes practically impossible to manage the attacks and counterattacks of our character, especially the seconds, on which the clashes in the more advanced stages are leveraged, practically impossible to win if you do not resort, with timing, to the blocking technique. Nor do the jerky animations of the various sprites help, inexplicably incomplete in the number of animation frames, both the protagonists and the opponents. A real pity, because the musical accompaniment is well done, even if the sound effects are as rough as those of an NES, a feature to which the GBA has also accustomed us, but which many softco have managed to manage in an excellent way (Konami with Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, for example). There aren't many scrolling fighting games on the Game Boy Advance (the excellent Gekido, Final Fight Advance and what else?), so Advance Guardian Heroes is recommended for fans of the genre who are looking for a cartridge that can satisfy them: after all, the variety of action, stages and modes compensates for the technical problems discussed. It almost seems that the talented Treasure wanted to overdo it, filling the new Guardian Heroes with spectacular visual solutions without knowing how to manage them appropriately in the end. It's a pity, also because once the nice Story Mode is over (with a patchy plot due to a rather shaky English adaptation) we find ourselves with twenty different characters to use in the various multiplayer modes, which allow up to four players to face each other in arenas where the lack of visual complexity certainly won't affect the frenzy of the clashes. However, it is a pleasure to see an old legend revived on Game Boy Advance, we hope that Treasure decides to give us a new adventure better than this, however, a promising return. Pros: It's Guardian Heroes! Varied and entertaining game system Excellent multiplayer mode Over the top technical realization... Cons: ... but too many slowdowns... ... and too much confusion at inopportune moments. It is unlikely that in the toy library of the owners of the historic Saturn there is not one of the best scrolling fighting gamesever made, the legendary (yet little-known) Guardian Heroes. Between fantasy and technology, the original and frenetic beat'em-up, thanks also to an attractive design and a first-rate technical realization, had managed to conquer a niche of enthusiasts, who have always hoped for a sequel that would succeed to offer the same dose of adventure fun as Cerena, Nicole and company. After so many years, it is bizarre to see the heroes of the original Guardian Heroes revived (in every sense) on Game Boy Advance to face a new (new?) threat together with you, as the Hero of the Soul. Bizarre and also a little sad.", "date": "2005-02-26", "grade": null}
