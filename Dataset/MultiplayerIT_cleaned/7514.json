This is the second of the reviews dedicated to Battlefield 4 among those that will be published on Multiplayer.it in the coming days. What you are about to read relates to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game. For the PC and PlayStation 4 we refer you to this address, while for the evaluation of the Xbox One version you will have to wait until November 12, the expiry date of the processing embargo. The Battlefield series now has a long ten-year history: it was in fact 2002 when the first title, Battlefield 1942, saw the light on Windows platforms, and much could be written about the events surrounding it. In the following years, for example, the development team behind it, the Swedish DICE, has become increasingly appreciated by insiders. Hand in hand, the saga has grown accordingly, confirming itself in the eyes of genre enthusiasts as a synonym for online shooters with a quality military setting, gaining a special place in their hearts, especially in recent years. Battlefield 4 is probably DICE's most ambitious project, not only from a technological point of view but also from a content point of view, given the inclusion of new features and a multiplayer sector that has perhaps never been so complete. In recent days we have already reviewed it in the PlayStation 4 and PC version, where it has confirmed itself as a real benchmark for the future, now the time has come to evaluate it for the current generation of consoles. Battlefield 4 once again focuses more on online multiplayer than on the single-player campaign mode From China with fury The game is split into two DVDs on Xbox 360 and before starting to play it is mandatory to install 2 GB of data, otherwise it is impossible to start. Which can be a problem for some users, perhaps owners of a 4 GB model, since the installation can only be performed on a traditional Xbox 360 hard drive, and not on an external disk or internal flash memory. Regardless of all this, if desired, there is also the optional possibility of installing 5.8 GB of data for single player and over 6 for multiplayer over the network. In this case we recommend doing both for a better experience. Battlefield 4 offers two main game modes, one offline and one online. The first is the classic single-player campaign, where the user finds himself catapulted into the typical political fiction scenario, which this time sees China as the main area of the adventure. In fact, the story revolves around a coup d'tat in the People's Republic of China, ~thanks~ to which the exponent most open to dialogue and moderation of the ruling party is removed, and a hawk supported by the Russians is sent to power, the l 'admiral Chang, who as per the textbook is cynical and ruthless like few others. The United States of America are accused of this tragic event, which sees a large part of their Pacific fleet completely at the mercy of Chinese attacks. From here unfolds a story that sees gamers fight by sea and on land in the role mainly of the soldier of the American special forces Daniel ~Reck~ Recker, who alongside his teammates called Tombstone operates between Azerbaijan, coastal China and the hinterland, in a desperate attempt to find and save those who can restore the natural order of things. That of Battlefield 4, however, is not a very original plot and indeed, as the story progresses, it reveals itself as the biggest weak point of the campaign. In fact, the protagonists are tossed from one place to another for the sole purpose of varying the setting, with a few narrative moments of real involvement, even emotional, for the user. Not to mention the situations just mentioned that sometimes seem to occur just to allow the entry of some secondary character or for the controlled occurrence of some event useful for changing the scenario and the purpose of a mission. Another sore point is longevity, given that the entire campaign can be completed with an average time between five and six hours. Very little in our opinion, even for a title that focuses decisively on multiplayer, as we will see later. Yet in the face of these negative elements there are also positive ones, such as the pace of the game which is finally maintained at good levels, the missions with a variable approach even while running, and more generally the absence of particularly long and annoying. In short, the slow pace that in Battlefield 3 was the counterpart to the realism and spectacularity of the game seems to be just a memory. Xbox 360 goals There are 42 objectives availableavailable in Battlefield 4, for a total of 1,000 G. To obtain them you have to divide yourself between online and offline play, completing individual missions within the campaign mode, or by making a series of specific kills or collecting a certain amount of collectibles. Similarly in the network game getting 45 kills with the M1911 pistol can for example give away 25G. The battle The playability actually intends to move away from a purely linear progression, in favor of greater freedom of choice even in a context that does not give up a cinematic staging. In practical terms, what has been described up to now reflects on a gameplay in which great importance is attributed to the level design of the environments. These range from open areas where the player has a wide range of possibilities to get to the bottom of a firefight, to more confined areas where he is forced to advance cautiously, hiding in the right moment before launching an attack. In any case, he is stimulated to act and to change his strategy in relation to the environment in which he finds himself, often exploiting it to his advantage. This is where the main novelty of the game comes into play, the so-called Levolution, which manages the gradual changes that take place on the field and on the buildings built on it. In the game you can blow up everything, shelters, buildings and so on, and during the battle the players must constantly take into account the transformation of the terrain around them to avoid nasty surprises or, conversely, make it useful to their own purposes. Also from a gameplay point of view, the possibility of signaling some opponents to your teammates is new, tagging them with the RB backbone. At that point the signal can be given to attack them with suppressive fire, perhaps using the opportunity to try to get around the survivors from behind. Another of the innovations introduced in the product is the stealth approach. Nothing particularly complex, it's true, but the possibility of silently approaching enemies to eliminate them one by one before sounding the alarm offers a very fun tactical cue. Battlefield 4 can be played with three different degrees of difficulty, even if the writer's advice is to do it immediately at the maximum level available, if you have some experience with the genre. In fact, unlike other similar products, there are never really frustrating gameplay situations (the hardest obstacle are some distant checkpoints) and the action gains in thickness and intensity. The most difficult moments derive above all from the rather fluctuating artificial intelligence, and from a decidedly annoying bug, which is that of the respawn: these causes enemies eliminated a moment before to suddenly reappear in the same point as if nothing had happened, filling lead the unfortunate player. The antagonists, among other things, sometimes perform indecipherable actions, which lead them to perhaps not see an opponent even if they pass by. Or not to try to avoid a grenade, or to remain in plain sight even if hit for the first time by a shot, continuing undaunted to remain stationary in the same place as if they didn't realize the danger. Fortunately, this is not always the case, and when the behavioral routines work properly, the soldiers managed by the system put the gamer in serious difficulty with daring maneuvers, rapid movements from one cover to another and a crossfire that can prove to be really lethal when well orchestrated. Curiosity Battlefield 4 offers a Premium subscription useful for gaining early access to new weekly content, exclusive customization options and much more, including the five expansions China Rising, Second Assault, Naval Strike, Dragon's Teeth, and Final Stand. The interesting aspect of the subscription is that, if you decide to switch to the new generation of consoles, it can be transferred directly from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4. Speaking of travel, Battlefield 4 also includes the ability to transfer your own multiplayer stats. Rank, Score, D/K Ratio, Wins, Play Time, Service Stars, Dog Tags Collected, Revives, Squad Score, and many more stats will be able to carry over to next-gen platforms. Generational differences Going back to talking about scripted behaviors, these are also visible in the protagonist's companions, who certainly don't shine for inventiveness. In most situations they limit themselves to doing their homework, and sometimes they even become annoying and not very useful when they incredibly throw the main character out of his shelter if that istheir designated place. A real problem since while Recker (or the other two protagonists who will take turns with him in the game) is rightly sensitive to the shots that come at him, some enemies appear excessively resistant to bullets, and this regardless of the weapon used to shoot against them . Aside from a well-placed ~shot~ to the head, which can instantly chill an opponent, a shotgun or assault rifle sometimes does little damage even at point-blank range. Too bad because each weapon has been reproduced impeccably, with the gamer who can choose which one best suits his needs during the adventure. In fact, after each kill, the game calculates a score, thanks to which it is possible to unlock new weapons, to be changed on the fly in the game by accessing convenient supplies scattered throughout the levels. The steps forward made with this chapter in the multiplayer arena are absolutely indisputable. Although the multiplayer mode has been the beating heart of the gaming experience of the series since its origins, in this Battlefield 4 it probably reaches its peak in terms of content and quality. However, it is here that the real differences with the counterpart for PlayStation 4 and PC are noticed, above all due to the number of users who can participate in the challenges on the network, which is 24 units. This difference with the next gen counterpart is not a detail given that many of the maps, a dozen, have been designed to be fully enjoyed with 64 players. Therefore, the feeling of participating in a large battle is missing, and sometimes the adrenaline is diminishing in wandering around looking for someone to snipe inside what appear to be ghost towns. Regardless of all this, within the multiplayer sector there is still all the positive essence that the series has always carried with it, and the impact on the evolution of the guerrilla dynamics by the Levolution is felt. The teams facing each other must also take into account the important changes to the map, scripted but triggered by the player, which destabilize the level during the game. A concrete example of what we are saying can be found in the map called Flood Zone. During the game, gamers can destroy an embankment and flood a small neighborhood, reducing the labyrinthine complex of buildings into real islands, thus passing from wheeled vehicles to amphibious ones and enhancing the hot spots located on the roofs. These become real well-structured killing areas, full of shelters, defilaments and raised points. These are the most striking changes, but also in the maps where the destructive events are less pyrotechnic and more hidden, the level design, the breadth of the battlefield and the tactical union between land and air vehicles, make Battlefield 4 something great. Total destruction To make the online gaming experience even more complete there is a perfect management of the individualization of the classes, with the vast collection of unlocks that are obtained both by leveling up and by constantly using the weapon you are shouldering. What has been said allows you to obtain all those objects that are useful for their customization, and are able to considerably modify the performances. Likewise, leveling up grants the user new gadgets and battlepacks of different rarities to be opened when a particular score is reached. The specializations significantly influence the evolution of the player's class, making his growth path even more peculiar almost as if it were an RPG, which makes the tactical nature of Battlefield 4 even more evident. Ultimately , the dynamism of the maps given by Levolution, their ~minute~ destructibility, the perfect level design to enhance the four classes, without forgetting the excellent arrangement of the conquest points, allow the player - veteran or not - to enjoy the title exactly as he wants. To make the Battlefield experience more cohesive, the Battlelog was then practically rebuilt from the ground up: now it is no longer a separate application from the game and is always just a click away. Still in terms of content, we point out the return of the Commander mode, which allows you to play in the role of an officer, supporting a team by gathering information on the enemy, offering logistical support to the troops deployed on the field and managing the offensive phase, perhaps by calling in a bombardment at the right time aircraft in support of the infantry. If desired, you can also play via a tablet synchronized to a PC or console game server. The one described makes the pair", "date": "2013-11-06", "grade": "8.0"}
