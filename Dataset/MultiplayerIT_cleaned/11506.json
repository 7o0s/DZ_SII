{"name": "Terrorist Takedown 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terrorist-takedown-2-recensione.html", "text": "The Art of Recycling The philosophy followed by City Interactive is very simple: let's take a great game that was incredibly successful in 2005, we buy all the rights not only for the graphics engine, but also for the physics engine and the one that manages the routines of the Artificial Intelligence, let's change two textures and churn out a new masterpiece. The title that we have seen this havoc is unfortunately F.E.A.R., a splendid shooter by Monolith, which today you can find in all Italian newsstands with a different name: Terrorist Takedown 2 Forze Speciali. The plot conceived by the creatives will see you play no longer the classic marine, but rather a controversial captain of the Italian Army intent on freeing hostages in a location in the Middle East: needless to say that what will start as a simple rescue mission, will transform in an attempt to save the world from an impending nuclear holocaust. Is it possible that these villains never manage to offer a minimum variation on the theme? Kind of like the Fucito who always assigns us these games here? How to describe a game in one paragraph The actual game is exactly the same as F.E.A.R, in all possible aspects, including the font with which the subtitles are written and the slow motion effect of when your life will drop below zero: what this TT2 lacks, however, is not is a solid license, but rather a development team worthy of the name. What does the player do with a routinely structured artificial intelligence, if then the level design does not allow enemies to attempt any tactic (such as outflanking) other than that of head-on collision? What's the point of talking about realistic physics, if this only applies to some boxes? Is it possible that these villains never manage to offer a slight variation on the theme? Kind of like the Fucito who always assigns us these games here? How to describe a game in one paragraph This Special Forces is the tangible demonstration that graphics aren't everything, but that to make a good video game you also need to know the needs of gamers: place a spawn point of 5 enemies around a corner, thus seeing them appear in that corridor you have cleaned five seconds before, can quickly lead to cursing not only the software house, but also those 19.90 that you could have invested in an evening at a pizzeria. The entire game therefore develops in a continuous reaching a certain point on the map, enjoying the interlude film discreetly recited in Italian and moving towards the second waypoint indicated, being careful to massacre everything that moves: operation, between other, not exactly simple, given the somewhat uncertain framerate even on very performing machines, which will make aiming particularly difficult for you. Comment Let's jump to conclusions, because a more in-depth analysis would only be an end in itself: Terrorist Takedown 2 Special Forces is a game that we do not feel like recommending to anyone. It has no plot, the graphics date from 2005, the ragdoll physics definitely leaves something to be desired, the animations are woody, the AI is limited by a monotonous and repetitive level design, the frame rate is fluctuating and there are even references of bad taste about current events in the Middle East. Give it to someone if you want to spite them.

After years of reviewing titles, the typical editor develops a sort of nose for immediately identifying which titles are valid from which ones are, if we want to give a politically correct definition, much less valid. When the second chapter of a series as successful as that of Terrorist Takedown arrives at your home, where even the first chapter (dating back to 2005) could easily remain in the mind of whoever created it, a long shiver assails you as you remove the heavy cellophane from the packaging. The first impact is positive: a well-finished package, with captivating graphics, with a nice voluminous plastic box, which lets you anticipate a rich content. The reality is much sadder: a DVD and a 6-page instruction booklet, 2 of which are credits. Despite the criticisms of all the critics, this brand must have sold enough to cover the production costs, so as to encouragethe developer to publish a series of terrifying sequels until you get to this Special Forces.", "date": "2008-04-07", "grade": null}
