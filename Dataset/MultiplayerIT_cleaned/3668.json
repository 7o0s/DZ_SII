{"name": "Wanted: Dead", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wanted-dead-recensione.html", "text": "Hannah Stone is the lieutenant of a special police squad in a cyberpunk Hong Kong in the throes of dictatorship and corruption. She is a strong, determined woman, in some moments extremely sensitive, in others ruthless, who hides a turbulent past that will emerge in the course of the game. Beloved by her men, she will end up in the midst of a huge conspiracy that will lead her to follow a long trail of blood and power to get to the heart of evil. When we learned that a group of Team Ninja exiles were making a clone of Ninja Gaiden we believed it a bit. After all, the trailers spoke of technical combat, of high difficulty, of fifty final moves, of clashes that mix hand-to-hand weapons with firearms, going to tickle our desire to relive certain experiences. Unfortunately, as you will read in the Wanted: Dead review, dreams have shattered on the rock of reality. Storytelling Everyday life is part of the story of Wanted: Dead Let's start with the best part of Wanted: Dead, the narrative. The story, which we have already outlined, is not particularly original, but is told in an interesting way, alternating the progress of the actual plot with moments of the daily life of Stone and the Zombie Unit (this is the name of its team), with a lot of folklore but also a certain taste for description that we didn't mind and, indeed, supported the whole experience. Thus we see our people sitting in a room and talking about the missions and their lives, we hear a character tell foul-mouthed jokes annoying the others, we attend karaoke competitions, large meals based on traditional dishes, refreshing showers (which betray a a bit of voyeurism) and other activities that end up connoting the entire experience, leading it in a certain direction, and which enter into an almost speculative relationship with the more dramatic moments, such as flashbacks from Stone's life or some narrative turning points. There are also the foul-mouthed jokes in Wanted: Dead Of course, some choices end up being quite predictable, but it is the look at the story that is particularly interesting, because it tries to give a broader overview of the characters and the events they are experiencing, without ever becoming overwhelming. The brief dialogues with many non-player characters should also be read in this key, in particular Stone's generic colleagues who populate the police station (it acts as a connection area between the missions), whose words, for example, make us understand some interesting details, such as the contempt of the other cops for the Zombie Unit, the existence of relationships between the characters that otherwise would have remained in the background, or just kept silent and some power dynamics that will prove to be important in the advanced stages of the game. Don't expect Tolstoy, this isn't it, but at least a precise direction emerges of what the developers want to try to tell. Too bad it's not too worth following the story, given all the other huge problems of Wanted: Dead starting from the combat system. The combat system Stone will often end up covered in blood The combat system is terribly dirty, if not downright crude. Considering that it is the core of the experience (the levels are very linear and there is practically no to explore), you will understand that it is a big problem. Stone performs lightning-fast combos of sword slashing and pistol slashing when he's not using his weapon like in a third-person shooter. The alternation of hand-to-hand combat with shooter moments should be the strong point of the game and, in reality, when it works it produces some interesting situations, between dismembered bodies and blood that splashes everywhere, covering our policewoman and her companions in red. Unfortunately it doesn't work very often. Meanwhile, let's immediately clarify that the combat has very little technical: the combos are limited and we tend to always use one for the entire game, because it is more effective than the others. The artificial intelligence of the enemies leads them on the one hand to pile up around Stone, attacking with a certain shyness, on the other to use decidedly questionable distance tactics, so much so that in some clashes they appear erratic, rather than coordinated. Stone's biggest enemy is the game camera Yet Wanted: Dead is a challenging game, sometimes all too much given the assumptions. How does he do it? The quick answer is: targeting the player's frustration with sudden difficulty spikes, often due to his biggest problems, rather than design choices. For example, let's talk about the crazy implementaction of the camera, which in some cases just can't follow the action, in others it frames objects of the scenario covering the action itself (could that be why the levels are often very bare? We'll talk about it later) and whose management is required almost completely to the player; or let's talk about the lack of indicators of any kind on the origin of attacks from off-screen, partly compensated by the distance of the shot of Stone's back, but deadly when you have to avoid bullets by looking for some cover (only grenades are signaled and not always with the right accuracy). But still: the possibility of hooking up to enemies is missing, a truly incomprehensible choice which in some cases forces you to make real turns to keep an eye on the scene, especially in the presence of very fast opponents (see for example the first boss) . Stone itself has unlockable skills, divided into three trees (attack, defense, support), which give it, for example, longer combos, improve its resistance to damage and add grenades. In general they are decisive for moving forward, but in principle they are few and therefore there is a tendency to standardize the choices, which in any case do not involve substantial changes to the combat or gameplay. You will therefore understand that we are light years away from the planet Bayonetta, but also from the Ninja Gaiden themselves. Incidentally, here more than dancing fighting against enemies seems to fight against the game systems. Let's make a couple of very concrete examples: in the third level we find ourselves fleeing on the roofs of a building where we meet a couple of armored beasts placed one after the other. Now: The combat area is very narrow and favors the enemies in every possible way, as they are heavily armed from range and can charge Stone with deadly melee attacks if desired. Consider that in Wanted: Dead firearms do much less harm than attacks with bladed weapons, such as that a knife can kill the protagonist with a couple of shots, where a machine gun needs several shots to get the same result. That said, dodging the two giants is not only difficult, but it's a real agony, since you are often fooled by the camera about the direction of the dodge, obviously ending up being hit because the character moves in a different direction than we thought it was. have indicated with the controller. Parrying is not an easily viable option, as juggernauts are able to break defense immediately. Add to this the less than perfect collisions and some annoying design choices, such as allowing enemies to suddenly change trajectory while executing their attacks, it becomes difficult not so much to continue, as not to completely uninstall the game in the throes of feeling that only luck can help us get to the end, moreover after having almost completely gone through an overall very easy level (more than the previous ones, to make you understand how badly some things are calibrated). The death animations are tasty, but sometimes malfunction The second example, on the other hand, is of a completely opposite sign and concerns a boss (if you don't want advances, read the next paragraph immediately). The fight begins with Stone having to deal with some unruly synthetic workers equipped with melee weapons, while the boss bombards the battlefield with explosives. However, after killing some of the enemies, he enters the field directly and starts attacking us in melee, using his firearm when we move away. So far everything works quite well: the challenge is high and the boss seems to have decent attack patterns. Of course, there is the problem of the camera to be managed by hand, but that is spread throughout the game, so little attention is paid to it. Be that as it may, after a few unsuccessful attempts we manage to take away half of his health by starting the terrible phase three. The boss is furious, he throws his gun to the ground and he goes silly, staying at his distance to try to charge us from time to time with easily dodged attacks. Just shoot him with the gun while keeping his distance and that's it. What should have been the most difficult phase turned out to be a walk of health, which we even managed to overcome on the first attempt. In Wanted: Dead there are also cats, of course Be that as it may, the problems with Wanted: Dead's combat system don't end there. In fact, we can add the repetitiveness of the common enemies, practically all the same in the attack patterns for the entire game, the numerous bugs, tra lost animations, enemies who end up stuck behind walls (it also happened with the first boss, for example), interpenetrations and so on and some quite questionable progression choices. It should be noted that for the entire game we will have companions in all the missions, whose function is more of a nuisance because, even if fully armed, they do very little damage. It is true that they are immortal and therefore you see them all the time getting bullets, bombs and hammer blows without batting an eye. The electric saw deserves a separate mention. Theoretically it is a special weapon designed to create particularly splatter sequences, since using the Stone it can tear apart one or more enemies in one fell swoop. In principle it works, but even here the lack of refinement is felt. In fact, when the electric saw is hit, an animation starts that cannot be interrupted and which renders Stone defenseless against potential attacks from off-screen that it was not possible to prevent due to the aforementioned lack of indicators. Ultimately, using a weapon designed to make senseless massacres can reveal them to be very dangerous, because the game system does not allow you to keep an eye on the entire scene or does not make us completely immortal during the dismemberment animations. When it's the game system that's a problem, there's little you can do... Having said that, the merciless description also hides a potential that Wanted: Dead paradoxically manages to express when it fails to be a difficult game and becomes a meaningless massacre, as for example happens in the third level where the first enemies are numerous and very weak and it's a pleasure to reap them nonstop by making random combos. Precisely the feeling of omnipotence that these moments convey is the one that pushes us to move forward despite all the other problems, to the point that one wonders how the experience was conceived, given that it is substantially more successful where it fails its declared objectives. Everything tastes terribly unfinished, when not quite sketchy. The minigames and side activities Some impromptu elements are nice As mentioned, the levels of Wanted: Dead are divided by interactive phases set for the most part in the police station. Stone converses with the other characters, has revealing flashbacks about his past, takes a shower, goes around the police station looking for documents to read and performs secondary activities, such as mini-games, some successful, others much less . The best of the bunch is definitely Space Runaway, a full-fledged classic arcade shooter that is played by interacting with a coin op. Space Runaway is the best of the mini games and worth trying out of Wanted: Dead as well If you want, you can also download it outside of Wanted: Dead (do it because it's worth it). In addition to this there are two machines with hooks, which allow you to collect some trophies and a little experience, and there is a rhythm game a la Guitar Hero, frankly irritating, spread over restaurant meals or Karaoke competitions . What's wrong with it? Let's say that, needless to say, it lacks refinement and that immediately puts the player in front of a very high challenge, made up of really pressing and complicated keystrokes to press. It is true that winning is optional, but this is almost a slap in the face to the player and we don't understand how those who don't know the genre inside out can find an experience like this, which should be a nice interlude, somehow exciting or interesting. It is also eaten in Wanted: Dead Otherwise, the other interactions in the police station also have some problems. For example, the presence of the aforementioned documents to read to find out more about the scenario and the characters is fine, but having to go around the whole station every time to find them is quite annoying, also because it is divided into four floors and it is not exactly very small . It also lacks any progression management tools. For example, there are no upgrades for purchasable weapons (they are given by the game automatically to save points in an order set by the designers), there are no ancillary tasks, there is nothing at all, apart from a training room. Not bad actually, given that Soleil immediately said that it would be an action inspired by similar games of the sixth generation of consoles, but at this point one wonders why waste time building such a large environment if you can't do it almost nothing significant. Technical side Some 3D models are nice, but the environments are very bare The technical part is the icing on the cake of Wanted: Dead, the classic", "date": "2023-02-14", "grade": "4.5"}
