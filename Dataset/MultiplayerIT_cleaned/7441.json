Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Who were the ninjas? These were warriors specialized in assassination and espionage, skilled mercenaries who offered their services to the highest bidder in the days of feudal Japan. Their figure has become iconic over the years and there are also those who have made a humorous interpretation of it, such as the developers of NaturalMotion for their Clumsy Ninja. Available for free on the App Store, in a decidedly ~friendly~ freemium format towards those who do not intend to make in-app purchases, the new casual game by the authors of CSR Racing is basically like a virtual pet in which, however, our goal is not is to look after, cuddle and train a puppy, but a... ninja. A clumsy ninja, to be exact, who however by engaging in various movements and exercises will be able to become more cunning, earn the title of master and aspire to the attentions of the beautiful Kira ... even if first he will have to understand where she is. The experience offered by Clumsy Ninja immediately ends up being compared to that of Kinectimals, given the proximity between the motion detection control system offered by Kinect and that of the touch screen on iOS terminals. In fact, to interact with the character we are asked to touch him, poke him, tickle him, grab him by the hands or feet and lift him or throw him in the air, and so on. The traditional ~accompaniment~ system of casual productions shows from time to time the actions that we are called to complete to earn some experience points and some coins, the poor currency of the game; while diamonds (the hard currency) can only be obtained on certain occasions, such as when leveling up. Clumsy Ninja is an excellent virtual pet, well done from a technical point of view and with many minigames My ninja friend Clumsy Ninja takes us by the hand during the first interactions with the character, which boasts a sophisticated animation system, certainly among the best ever seen in the mobile sector, capable of reacting differently to any stimulus. Then when we grab the ninja and throw him in the air, a physics calculation takes over that is also fairly convincing, although on more than one occasion we have found difficulty in maneuvers that go deep, for example when the funny protagonist has to pass through a basket . The minigames put in place by the developers are more or less all of the same tenor: you take out a trampoline and make our apprentice jump to develop his ability to perform stunts, he holds up a bag of sand for you to hit him with new combos and special attacks, watermelons are thrown at him, balloons are tied to his arms and legs, and so on. Gradually the character becomes more cunning and able to perform new actions, which introduces further objects (almost always purchasable using simple coins, with a very limited grinding factor) and minigames. In the end, the question is clear: if you appreciate virtual pets, then Clumsy Ninja is a must-download, because even the most experienced gamers smile. However, if it is a genre that tends to bore you, the title of NaturalMotion, despite all its qualities, will do nothing to change your mind: the degree of interaction is low, the guide is practically constant and in the end there is very little room for complex mechanics.", "date": "2013-11-30", "grade": "7.0"}
