{"name": "Un mondo di creativit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108361-littlebigplanet-un-mondo-di-creativita.html", "text": "When the first LittleBigPlanet was released six years ago, Alex Evans, Mark Healey, Dave Smith and the other components of Media Molecule were overwhelmed by an unexpected success of critics and audiences. That those 527,033 lines of code hid more than a simple 2D platformer, the English team was more than aware of it, but hardly imagined that the newly lit fuse would quickly lead to a sequel, portable episodes, spin-offs and a small phenomenon community that would see the game's protagonist become one of the most recognizable mascots of the current PlayStation generation. After taking its first steps, the great little planet of Media Molecule has grown so much that it now lives its own life, regardless of the original authors: on the one hand thanks to the contribution of a very strong community that still today creates and shares crazy creations , on the other with the work of external teams to which SCE has entrusted spin-offs and portable versions. Yet, while Cambridge Studios had made a good but absolutely incomplete and incomplete PSP chapter, the first time of LittleBigPlanet on PlayStation Vita was born with much higher ambitions, partly due to the need to shake up the playground of the new Sony laptop in view of its first Christmas period. By managing to make the spirit of the series their own and having a much more powerful and functional console in their hands, Tarsier Studios and Double Eleven have managed not only to compress the entire LittleBigPlanet 2 experience into a laptop, but also to achieve what probably it is the best chapter released so far. The carnival of the Sackottino It is enough to have played at least one of the two chapters for PlayStation 3 and you feel at home from the start of the game: from the off-screen narrator to the tender introductory movie with real actors, passing through the title screen to go through as if it were a real level. The Swedish Tarsier Studios has clearly made an effort to welcome fans of the series in a familiar way, and in a snap of the fingers you are inside your Pod, the traditional cardboard rocket from which you can access the three planets that mark the three big game components: the first dedicated to single-player adventure, with a storyline full of humor and charm created especially for the occasion; the second focused on the entire social component, with the creations of the online community and the options for sharing and interacting with others; and finally the third, a stark and anonymous planet that like a blank canvas is just waiting to be filled by the player via the level editor. In terms of number of levels and amount of mini-games, the LittleBigPlanet Vita adventure doesn't differ much from what we saw in the PSP chapter, with the six game worlds acting as a springboard for everything that follows. Yet, although it represents more of a substantial introduction to 2.5D platform mechanics, the various power-ups and ways to interact with the scenario, the single-player experience has been embellished with a simple but fun storyline, which leads the user to go through very inspired settings and meet absolutely crazy characters. So, after traveling the world on PSP and defeating the evil Negativitron in LittleBigPlanet 2, this time Sackboy must discover the mystery behind Carnevalia, a world full of attractions that fell into ruins after his Puppeteer, tired and disappointed, he decides to leave to create an army of Dark Ones, faceless and happinessless puppets. Fans of the series will already know that waiting for them there is a cast of bewildered characters, in this case made even more bizarre by the original location: from old masked puppets to sad clowns, from elderly superheroes with no wheels to mischievous artificial intelligences. All the supporting actors who accompany Sackboy on his journey are characterized by their own personality, expressed by the funny dialogues dubbed and subtitled in Italian. As per tradition, each world offers a different theme and setting, with scenarios full of new obstacles, elements to interact with and more or less original power-ups: among these there are some already seen in the past, such as the grappling hook or the catcher gloves, but Tarsier has also added some completely new ones, above all the Triangular Troublemaker stands out, a tipping vehicle capable of remaining glued to any surface and tumbled over the level between jumps and somersaults. The Absurd Rocket is a helmet similar to the Creatinator but which can only fire small missiles to be guided via touchscreen, while in the adventure the Jet Pack is replaced by some extremely difficult flying insectsto fly. If the flight sessions are among the least successful of the entire adventure, the fault is undoubtedly the cumbersome controls via the rear touchpad, one of the rare occasions in which the implementation of the tactile features of PlayStation Vita proves to be not only forced and intrusive, but also counterproductive. On some occasions you may have some difficulty moving objects with a very small sensitive area, such as small springs and movable platforms, but most of the time the touchscreen is integrated in a very apt way. With a flick of the touchpad, for example, you can move a platform from the background to the foreground, blocking laser beams and allowing Sackboy to continue, while aiming and firing the Rocket Absurd is as simple as touching your target with a finger. Everything is made with extreme care, both technically and audiovisually, despite the presence of some bugs related to bad collisions which, although rare and not too important, a couple of times have seen us reach dead zones of the scenario and forced to restart the level . Pastimes and Minigames Invariably, even in LittleBigPlanet Vita the levels of the main campaign are accompanied by a whole series of more or less original mini-games, in this case often aimed at exploiting the tactile capabilities and movement sensors of the console. Playable both alone and with friends, these challenges range from balancing a stack of bricks to a sort of 'Mole Catch' where you tap on the screen and hit Sackboy's head as it pops out. There is also a world entitled Arcade Games, in which there are small arcades that are completely detached from the typical levels of LittleBigPlanet: an example is Retro Vector, in which you drive a spaceship trying to collect survivors and eliminate dangerous cannons; or Tapling, a platformer with a very particular atmosphere in which you avoid obstacles and bounce from one wall to another. Social rag dolls Although it is possible to complete the main adventure in a short time, LittleBigPlanet for Vita reaches levels of replay value far superior to the previous portable episode. As always, you can go in search of all the materials and hidden objects in the scenarios, or play carefully in an attempt not to lose a single life and collect the most points. As if that weren't enough, some secret areas are accessible only if you are accompanied by at least one friend, and the online cooperative mode is one of the strengths of this new miniature chapter. Whether you're playing with two, three or four it doesn't matter, each level is at the same time a passionate collaboration between strangers and a fierce competition to see who collects the most points, resulting in hilarious situations where there is no shortage of a pinch of strategy. For example, you can grab the other player with a grappling hook and drag him towards a laser beam, prevent him from reaching a platform by moving away the platform he is on, or make him fall by deactivating a trampoline on which he was about to jump at the right moment. But at the same time teamwork becomes essential to overcome small environmental puzzles, to reach well-hidden materials or simply to reach the checkpoint together and avoid losing the game. These are all situations that fans of LittleBigPlanet 2 know well, but it is remarkable how the developers have managed to reproduce the same experience on Sony's portable console, while the interaction with others is here enhanced by some pleasant gimmicks involving the touchscreen and the motion sensors. At any time it is possible to see if any player is tackling a particular level and possibly join, but it is in the Community planet that the social component of LittleBigPlanet Vita obviously takes shape. During our test there were only a limited number of levels, created and shared by the other journalists who had access to the game, but on day-one things should start to get much more interesting, not only welcoming the levels created as from the whole community, but also and above all thanks to the support of LBP.me and all the contents already available for LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2. Among these, the various costumes purchased in the console chapters and those unlocked thanks to the various Level Packs also stand out, while various new features can be purchased from the Shop menu, still empty at the time of writing. The options accessible from the Community planet are quite traditional and allow you to search for particular levels through a series of filters: you can for exampleexample, view the list of scenarios preferred by users, those recommended by the developer or those made by your friends, but this time it is also possible to download any level and then be able to play it freely even when you are not connected to the PlayStation Network. Clearly the success of this huge component will all depend on the creativity and participation of the community, but judging by the excitement on the official and unofficial forums it seems that the hard core of enthusiasts can't wait to churn out many creations. Playstation 3 trophies As if all the secrets and extra materials to collect weren't enough, LittleBigPlanet Vita makes you want to play the various levels even more through a long series of Trophies. Some more original than others, ranging from simply progressing through the story to hitting a certain multiplier, from climbing the online leaderboards to playing a piano in a level. Predictably some also encourage co-op play, level creation and level sharing. A galaxy of possibilities Ever since 2006 it has always been clear what LittleBigPlanet's trump card was. Not its intuitive platform mechanics or the light-hearted and original setting, nor the far from new idea of sharing your creations with other players. Media Molecule's Trojan horse was a deep and tool-rich editor, but one that was able to offer at the same time enormous creative freedom and a simple and user-friendly interface. It was therefore foreseeable that Tarsier would have kept an eye on the third and last planet, the one dedicated to the creation of personal levels. Taking advantage of the touchscreen to browse the pages of the Popit, or to apply and modify objects, stickers and pins, the new Create Mode has very little to envy to the one seen in LittleBigPlanet 2. Indeed, the player is now able to create and publish up at thirty levels (unlike the twenty of LBP2), being able to exploit a whole series of unpublished materials capable of opening the doors to new creative possibilities. In particular, the Rain and Snow materials represent a very welcome addition, while the Invisible one will certainly stimulate the creativity of the most imaginative users who will be able to use it both to place hidden barriers and to activate devices without the player noticing. Although many are not shown in Story Mode, the most popular power-ups and items are all present, ranging from the Creator to the Jet Pack, from the Sackbot to scuba gear. But the biggest news concerns the Memorizer, a new advanced logic tool designed for the most demanding and creative users. In fact, this new gadget makes it possible to record any signal, status, input and repeat it several times within the same level, with applications ranging from simple automatic mechanisms to the reproduction of elaborate computers. The possibilities at this point are truly endless, and we are sure that the next user-created scenarios will be more elaborate and interesting than ever before. Unfortunately LittleBigPlanet for Vita lacks Online Create, the option that allows multiple players to collaborate at the same time to create the same level, but Simon Rosenkotter, community manager at Tarsier Studios, said: ~that doesn't mean it won't come implemented in the future~. However, this is an element that in LittleBigPlanet 2 was exploited only by a microscopic part of the users, and overall the Create Mode on Life is the best the series has ever seen to date. The touchscreen is a great addition not so much for simply zooming or twirling objects with your fingers, but for the actual ability to ~paint~ game elements instead of creating them by joining block after block, while the portability of the console it's a real breakthrough: at any time you can take a photo of an object in real life and insert it within the scenario, record videos and upload them in the same way, while you carry on creating the level wherever you are.", "date": "2012-09-12", "grade": "9.2"}
