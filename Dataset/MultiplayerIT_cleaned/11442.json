{"name": "Jumper: Griffin's Story - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jumper-griffins-story-recensione.html", "text": "Anywhere is possible The cut given to the story, if nothing else, represents a pleasant surprise: as the subtitle suggests, in the game we will not find ourselves simply reviewing the plot of the film, but facing it from a different point of view. It is in fact a sort of spin-off compared to the film version of Jumper: in this Griffin's Story we will therefore find ourselves interpreting Griffin, who in the film covers the part of supporting actor alongside Christensen, and we will therefore have the opportunity to explore other aspects in the history of the ~Jumpers~ (those who have the ability to teleport), thus affecting even those who already know the plot of the film. The narrative parts are illustrated through mostly static scenes, made in 2D in the classic style of American super-heroic comics, moreover dubbed into Italian in a decidedly convincing way. The idea itself is very good, a pity that it is not reflected in the general graphic style of the whole game, as we will see. Our Griffin discovers as a kid that he has the ability to teleport, and it immediately becomes clear that trouble will always be associated with the intoxication of power, given that a sort of secret sect, made up of men devoted to eliminating jumpers, is already on his trail, and our hero will have to deal with them for the entire (short) duration of the game. A little here, a little there In the first five minutes of the game we will already have a rather complete vision of what we will find ourselves doing for all the remaining levels, or rather crossing various settings taken from the film (the Colosseum, an unspecified point in the desert, a port and an unspecified area industrial) facing crowds of enemies, until the conclusion of the various parts. In essence, it is a scrolling fighting game (or ~brawler~ as English speakers define it) of extremely rough and simple workmanship. There is practically nothing else to do besides punching, except for some small exploratory digressions in search of collectibles, which in any case are irrelevant to the flow of the game. Being a title based on people who have the ability to teleport, we would have expected the possibility of moving in this way within the levels, with a great variety of locations to explore. Instead, in the game the teleportation is used only to transfer from one enemy to another, or to attack them from side to side in a lightning-fast manner. Thus, one does not have the possibility of using power freely. The immediate movement from one point to another of the scenario, which could also have triggered interesting game dynamics as regards the exploration of the levels, is feasible only rarely, and exclusively in pre-established points. We therefore find ourselves simply running around the areas, facing waves of enemies until the final battle with the end-of-level bosses, who, moreover, simply appear as normal opponents, simply more resistant. The fight The combat structure is probably the most successful element. With the four keys of the controller it is possible to teleport to the corresponding sides of the opponent (X-right, Y-top, B-left, A-bottom) by delivering blows from various positions. The ~locked~ enemy is highlighted by a circle around the feet: occasionally some sides of the circle are marked in red, to mean that the enemy is ~protected~ on that side, or in green, to indicate a weak point. By attacking the red side we will suffer a counterattack, while by striking from the green side we will increase the power bar, necessary to increase the power of the blows. The dynamics may seem very simple, but the red and green areas change very quickly, and considering that you almost always find yourself having to manage the fight against several enemies at the same time (i.e. jumping from one to another, an operation made possible by pressing the left trigger), a certain glance and timing are required to be successful, especially in the more advanced levels. All this is combined with the possibility of chaining attacks in order to launch combos, based on the alternation of the attack keys (the instructions on how to set them can be found in hidden comic books for the levels) and some final moves quite spectacular. In these latter cases, we see computer graphics animations in which we observe the protagonist while he teleports, together with the enemy on duty, to some ~deadly zone~ (a glacier, a volcano, some unspecified point thousands of meters high soil and even a nuclear reactor, among others) leaving our adversaryat the mercy of the consequent catastrophic events. Not a good show Graphically this Jumper represents one of the lowest points reached by recent Xbox 360 productions. In a total lack of artistic direction, the game includes some rather well done scenarios (at least characterized by textures and effects worthy of the new generation), but populated by models rough polygonal and animated in an incomprehensible way. The characters are practically all the same, distinguished only by rare chromatic differences, and all characterized by unnatural and grotesque movements. Another striking element is the lack of cohesion between the style adopted for the narrative sections, illustrated with comic-style drawings, the graphics present during the game phases and the computer graphics animations showing the final moves (the ~extreme kills~ ): we are witnessing three extremely different graphic modalities, which bring with them disparate and completely disjointed styles and interpretations. Then there are several technical inconsistencies: the camera needs continuous adjustment, and in several cases (especially when passing through narrow doors or passages) it remains stuck in angles that make it impossible to view the game action. In several cases we will find ourselves suffering blows while the immovable texture of a wall is displayed on the screen in the foreground. The framerate undergoes continuous drops in intensity, even when only the main character is present in the scenario, and in some cases strange bugs are recorded in areas where it would be possible to activate the teleportation power, and trying to do so nothing happens . It is quite clear that, in addition to having large gaps from an upstream construction point of view, Jumper has not gone through a necessary testing period. The audio sector is probably the most convincing component of the game, with excellent orchestral music mediated by the film version and good dubbing in Italian during dialogues and narrative sections. Comment Jumper: Griffin's Story can be completed in a couple of hours, seeing just about everything there is to see. As if this were not enough, the already short gaming experience is marred by the poor quality of the graphics and the extreme monotony of the action, focused exclusively on fights that are always the same, moreover against enemies that are also identical. It would seem a title intended for a young audience, due to the simplicity and immediacy of the action, except that the topics covered and the violence present tend to exclude this solution. What remains of Jumper is a simple tie-in, which obeys the oldest rule concerning the genre in question: a product made with little care, which focuses entirely on the appeal generated by the corresponding film. Finds its meaning for the ~sick~ of Xbox 360 achievements, thanks to the ease with which it awards points with simple progression in the game. Pros: Not bad combat dynamics A cornucopia of easy Gamerpoints, for those interested Cons: Graphics absolutely insufficient. Short and monotonous. There are bugs and technical inconsistencies Xbox 360 - Goals Jumper's goals could be the real point of interest for the whole game. Achievement hunters will happily discover that the title in question gives out points in industrial quantities, without requiring great effort. There are 20 objectives for a total of 1000 points, therefore 50 points per achievement: simply by progressing in the game, without particular performances, it is possible to unlock around 650-700 points in a couple of hours.", "date": "2008-05-05", "grade": null}
