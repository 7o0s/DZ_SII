And so, in this sunny month of August, Ubisoft has decided to offer us Toy Soldiers: War Chest. The title will not sound new to Xbox and PC users, being the third episode of a strategic series with tower defense elements and strong shooter contaminations that debuted on the market in 2010. The first chapter was in fact developed by Signal Studios and was published on Xbox Live, and then also landed on PC two years later. Toy Soldiers: Cold War followed, launched on Microsoft's online platform during 2011. In the meantime, the brand passed into the hands of Ubisoft and last year the creation of a third experience was confirmed, which is also the first to land on three different platforms - PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One - simultaneously. Contrary to previous incarnations, the creation of War Chest was entrusted to Krome Studios, an Australian software house which among its best known past projects includes Viva Pinata and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. Toy Soldiers War Chest combines a strategic component with third person shooter mechanics Halfway between two worlds In War Chest, the proud Kaiser is back to lead the forces of the German Empire and to defend his kingdom from invading armies, with the invaluable support of ground troops, defense turrets and flying raids. From a certain point of view, the continuity with respect to the past is evident: we try to bring the player back to the playful period of his childhood, re-proposing bloody armed conflicts in a goliardic and picturesque guise. The maps are once again positioned within what could be a child's bedroom or playroom, while the stylistic approach remains the imaginative one already seen in the past, perhaps too much. Yes because, among the opposing factions of this new episode, rather singular armies such as the Star Power have also made their debut, which brings with it improbable hordes of unicorns wrapped in little hearts, flying fairies and armed teddy bears who don't have much with war to share. The settings are located within a limited area and the structure that will be defended is precisely defined as the Toy Box. The game, as in the past, is placed halfway between strategy and action, giving a nod to tower defense and third-person shooters respectively. The Toy Box must be protected by placing turrets in specific areas and money will have to be spent to put the necessary forces on the field. After a short loading time, each structure will start functioning independently and will be ready to withstand the enemy shockwave. Moreover, within the maps there is a pre-established quantity of fixed bases, on which it is possible to position one's own arsenal, and consequently the freedom of strategic construction appears very limited: the variety in the choice is in fact guaranteed only by the types of war vehicles in which it is permitted to invest. Infantry turrets, missile emplacements and mortars are just some of the options available to the player, who can also use the money collected directly during the mission to apply further improvements and defense tools. For example, we have the enhancement of the operator, which will make the fire machine more precise, the possibility of inserting protective sandbags, or the increase in the efficiency and range of action of the shots. If necessary, it is also allowed to adjust the structure for the damage suffered in the current wave or decide to sell it in order to recover the credit useful for choosing an alternative weapon, perhaps more suitable for the situation or the chosen area of expertise . But Toy Soldiers is also devoted to very tight action mechanics. At any moment you can acquire manual control of the gun emplacements, with the view moving much closer to the action, offering shots similar to those of third-person shooters. Furthermore, by killing enemies, an indicator called Action Meter can be increased, thanks to which the Kaiser himself is invoked. The latter will literally be launched onto the field, still wrapped in a flaming plastic package, as if it were to all intents and purposes a toy that has just been unwrapped. The player can take command of it and move freely around the map with the classic close-up view over the shoulder typical of TPS, also taking advantage of grenade throwing, rolling and melee attacks. Being monstrously stronger than any otheri other actor present on the scene, the Kaiser will only remain available for a short period of time, unless one of the various alkaline batteries that are scattered in several places on the maps is recovered. However, heavy artillery and the call of the champion are not the only tools that can be used, since one can take the reins of flying creatures such as winged horses or eagles, as well as the control of armored vehicles capable of knocking down the fixed positions built by the faction opposing. Not even a character progression system could be missing, which however is limited to increasing the experience level of your Kaiser, without the presence of skill trees or power enhancement grids. Ultimately, the impression we have left after playing the War Chest campaign thoroughly is that this title, like its predecessors, tries to wink at rather different categories of players, with the serious risk of displeasing a little bit of everyone. On the one hand, the strategic component did not seem particularly marked to us, there are not many plans and the variables put on the plate are more or less always the same. On the other hand, we are dealing with frenetic and fast mechanics, which however are not able to rival the quality of other game experiences specifically built and devoted to action. These reflections, which after all could have already been valid for the first - and although appreciated - chapters of the series, find further fertile ground when one considers that the innovative charge of this third chapter is almost zero. Furthermore, there have also been some design choices that have appeared to us at least questionable, above all the creation of the interlude scenes between one mission and another, which seem completely out of context with respect to the style presented in-game, but also the decision to introduce playful details with even more childish outlines, which however seem to clash with the characteristics of a title that should be limited to giving life to the old plastic soldiers that populated the childhood of many boys. Other flaws that we have perceived concern the repetitiveness of the game situations which, apart from some bosses, never present any change of situation or approach, as well as a slightly too linear structure of the enemy artificial intelligence. Weekly Wars Alongside the campaign mode that can be experienced in single-player, the cooperative functionality for two players has also been implemented, thanks to which it is possible to share the experience with a friend. On the online side, however, we have the Weekly War, a constantly updated appointment in which five objectives are planned, distributed from Monday to Friday and with exclusive rewards that will improve the power of your army. There are even online rankings to compare with the rest of the community about the achievement of medals and the best scores obtained in the various levels. In the settings screen there are some - albeit limited - graphic settings, including the anti-aliasing filter, the SSAO filter and the activation of vsync at 30 or 60Hz. For the rest you can only set the detail levels of the shadows, grass and the degree of accuracy of all textures.", "date": "2015-08-21", "grade": "6.0"}
