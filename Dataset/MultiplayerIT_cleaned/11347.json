Test Setup Intel Core 2 Duo 3 GHz Processor 2 GB RAM GeForce 8800 GTX Windows Vista Welcome to Hyboria The first impact with the new pretender to the online fantasy throne is satisfactory enough. We are not talking about the voluminous installation, more than justified considering the technical contents, but about the collector's edition bundle. An appreciable art book, which denotes an impeccable cure for the visual skeleton of the game, a DVD of the official soundtrack, evocative and touching in its climax. The composition of the massive collector's box closes, in addition to two installation DVDs, a map of Hyboria from the dark fathers (the skin of a programmer is rumored), a DVD of the making of containing films and curiosities and finally two exclusive in-game objects . In this regard, while the area of use of the cloak is still uncertain, the ring of Acheron is a decent boost on the experience gained for the first levels. After installation and various patches, you are immediately catapulted through a short introductory movie , in the vague background of a war-torn Hyboria, where the barbarian crowned king continues his endless crusade against Thoth Amon and his associates. The creation of the character is essential in the technique, but more than complete in the physical characterization. Although without stats or abilities to assign, a good modeling system, close to the old Star Wars Galaxies or the more recent example Oblivion, will be a sweet morsel for even the most delicate palates. There are three races to choose from: the proud Cimmerians, the mighty Aquilonians, and the mysterious Stygians. From a purely numerical point of view, there are no major differences between the three races, except for the exclusion of some character classes. Thus it will be that a Cimmerian will never become a capable user of magic, while the Stygians will not be able to field hordes of barbarians or warriors in heavy armor. The character classes, twelve in all, are divided into four categories: soldiers, wizards, thieves and healers. Each subclass will have a set of skills common to the others, within the same category. To this are added two branches of skills, always structured as a tree, which will allow the character to specialize in different disciplines. Chosen hair, frills and tattoos, we witness a brief introduction, which shows how the ship of slavers who accompanied us to sad fate, shipwrecked at the Barachan Islands, leaving us in skimpy clothes and armed with a stick ready to face our destiny. It begins! The first hours of the game The tragic landing on Tortage Island serves in some way as a tutorial to the actual game and through the first 20 levels of experience of your character, the player will on the one hand be immersed in the plot that forms the background to this persistent world and on the other will be guided with care and great attention in the knowledge of the game interface, the functioning of the quests, the combat system and then, more diluted over time, in the management of talents. Without danger of denial we can immediately state that this incipit to the actual game is absolutely excellent and full of obsessive care that is rampant in every aspect of the gameplay. The player is literally caressed during his first steps on the island, tackling very simple, particularly linear quests that almost act as a guided tour of the local beauties, while the online help system integrated into the game offers a very quick overview of the main actions it will be possible to carry out through the interface. Once it reaches Tortage City, Age of Conan literally explodes. In this first quest collection hub we will be inundated with missions that we can carry out in the areas surrounding the citadel, we will interact with the first NPCs (non-playing characters) to improve our equipment through the sale of objects and, above all, we will get to know with the dual nature of this MMORPG able to offer the most solitary players an extremely fun, fascinating and addictive pseudo-single player mode. Thanks to the painstaking work of Funcom, the developer, the player is offered the double possibility of tackling most of the first 20 levels of Age of Conan (those set right on Tortage) according to the classic styles of an MMORPG, or by collecting anddo this around the game world, in the company of all the other players, or we can enter a single player mode by talking to some key NPCs inside the Tortage City tavern. Following this narrative line, we will be able to carry out some Destiny Quests (particularly long and demanding missions that closely resemble the instanced experience of Lord of the Rings Online) literally sewn onto your character based on the pairing of race and class (in all there are 4 different narrative canvases) on the island itself but in a nocturnal setting and, above all, without the presence of any other player as the game world is entirely instantiated on our alter ego. The idea is extremely interesting even if it tends to slightly distort the social nature of the genre and leave the player a little too much at the mercy of a gameplay known only halfway once you reach the 20th level and complete this line of single player quests. Subsequently, in fact, although there are a handful of Destiny Quests at rather advanced levels of the game, it will be necessary to immerse yourself in the massive multiplayer component of Age of Conan and, especially at the beginning, you could be a little taken aback. Also, in case you want to create a new character, you will have to play this long tutorial on Tortage Island again, without any difference from the first time, except for the single player story line which can differ depending on the game. 'class archetype selected (as explained above). This could make players of World of Warcraft or Lord of the Rings Online turn up their noses, two titles that have accustomed us to experimenting with different settings and quests in the first 20-30 levels of the game based on the selected race. The vanguard of combat What heavily distances Age of Conan from the competition of a genre that is now rather static in terms of innovations is precisely that combat system with which we will interface as soon as we lift our heads from the white sand of Tortage Island. Completely forget the auto attack typical of any self-respecting MMORPG, now it will no longer be enough to press a single key to activate the fight and stand there watching our avatar perform automatic repeating blows, with the only possibility of intervention to activate the special skills. In AoC the combat is extremely interactive: initially we will have three different keys available, by default 1, 2, 3, to perform a left, frontal or right slash respectively and, later in the progress of the levels, two further types of attacks will be activated melee, the rear side shot to the left and right, which can be performed with the Q and E keys. It will be the player's job to press these keys repeatedly to choose how to hit their enemies by changing from time to time where to sink their shots. Age of Conan in fact also implements a system of dynamic shields that can be positioned in real time around the player (and the same obviously applies to computer-controlled enemies) so as to enhance the defense of a specific area of the body. The fight is therefore loaded with an interaction and a frenzy never seen before in an MMORPG with the player who will be forced to carefully follow the movement of the opponent's defenses to try to inflict his blows where he is most exposed and thus having bonuses on damage and on the possibility of performing critical hits. In addition, AoC also implements a particularly fun combo system that requires you to perform a precise sequence of shots in a certain order, in order to be performed. A bit along the lines of the Quick Time Events seen in many of the latest action titles. The strength of the melee classes in fact, the combos are added to the player's skill list, as the levels rise and gradually they will tend to be loaded with increasingly long key combinations and, obviously, with ever greater damage bonuses. Furthermore, finishing off one's opponent with the execution of a combo gives life to particularly violent and blood-soaked fatalities with decapitations, eviscerations and mutilations of all kinds. Very pleasant and satisfying to do especially in the company of your group mates. At the same time, it is quite obvious that all this focus on close combat with a white weapon leaves pure magical classes such as Demonologists and Necromancers at a certain disadvantage. And that's actually how it is. In fact, these classes remain more anchored to the classic stylistic features of the genre, subject to a couple of interesting introductions. On the one hand there is in fact a focus on versor area-of-effect spells, especially those granted to healers, many of which ~hit~ for example other characters based on frontal and lateral area cones and this forces the player to move continuously during combat to be positioned appropriately. The other interesting implementation is the spellweaver, a sort of berserk mode which is granted to magical classes at very advanced levels and which, once activated, exponentially enhances the damage and effects of the spells used over the seconds. This mode initially consumes the character's stamina (used for running and combos) and then begins to take a toll on hit points. Tactically very interesting and able to give many satisfactions in the most agitated phases. The last nodal point of the entire combat system rests on a very specific feature of Age of Conan: the physicality of the characters. Forget about passing through enemies or other players as the physical space occupied by the models is concrete. This translates into the possibility of being literally surrounded with no possibility of escape and opens up tactically vast scenarios in the wildest PVP. An example? A front line of melee fighters can physically prevent healers from being hit by opponents in close combat. At the same time, precisely this physicality influences the combat given that in Age of Conan there is no real system of targeting opponents or, better to say, it is not so necessary. In fact, it is enough to execute a slash to hit whoever is hit by the movement of the weapon, regardless of whether he has been ~target~ or not. In particular, when you are surrounded by multiple enemies, swinging lateral slashes armed with a spear will make us hit many opponents at the same time precisely according to the physical space occupied by the weapon. All with a very convincing result, especially from the point of view of physics. The adventure continues Taking one's destiny in hand from the relative capital of racial affiliation, the going starts to get tough. We will have different areas to refer to in the 20-40 range, looking for missions of various kinds, very well written and which, as a whole, fully evoke the rough Howardian atmospheres in the scenographic contents. The capitals, in themselves, represent a sort of checkpoint between one mission and another, which also gives the possibility to exploit the Trader, a non-playing character who allows you to manage the bank, auction, mail service in one fell swoop. -game and guild bank. In some ways, the choice of instantiating the entire game, dividing the areas into quest hubs and real gameplay regions, somewhat breaks the feeling of continuity with the environment, a bit like with Guild Wars, partially compromising the epic atmospheres that they try wandering far and wide. Although I do not fully agree with the choice, we consider it necessary for a fluid and crisis-free FPS gameplay. At level 20 it will also be possible, through a series of quests, to learn collection skills, specifically mining, prospecting and stonecutting, useful for collecting various types of resources from mineral deposits, from iron to basalt, up to valuable materials ever higher. The list ends with woodcutting for wood, weaving for cotton and substitutes and finally the inevitable skinning, for leather neophytes. Each character is able to learn all the gathering professions which, as mentioned, will evolve through a quest system, which will require you to collect a certain amount of resources before being able to move on to the upper step. To be honest, leaving out the advancement methods that certainly don't shine with imagination, we found one of the painful parts in the game in the management of resource nodes. The fact that the nodes are always the same and in the same points, as well as flattening the experience of searching for resources, generates an extreme camping of the points of interest, which, although vaguely mitigated with the change of instance, appears more than often as a poorly paid work rather than an incentive to develop crafting skills. Which in any case you will not see before level 40, together with the possibility of using mounts. The little barbarian builder prefers the horse It will be possible, having crossed the threshold of the fortieth level, to choose two craft professions, out of a basket of five available. In addition to the more classic Armorcraft, Weaponcraft and Alchemy, we find Gemcutting, which gives the possibility of creating gems capable of enchanting objects built by other professions, enhancing them", "date": "2008-06-20", "grade": null}
