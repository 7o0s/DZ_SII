Sane Trilogy arrives on PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch a year after its release on PS4. It is a historic event for each of these platforms, given that the saga created by Naughty Dog was initially hand-in-hand with the Sony consoles and never moved from there, leaving only the following episodes, in the hands of different publishers, the ability to aspire to cross-platform format. The project behind the return of Crash, naturally, starts from afar: there was talk of a possible remaster already in unsuspecting times, then came the sensational announcement, the enthusiastic debut on PlayStation 4 and now, precisely, the unprecedented landing on other systems; even if in this review we will only deal with the Steam version which, we say it right away, with its resolution up to real 4K and 60 frames per second, hardware permitting, is undoubtedly a candidate to be the best ever. Structure and peculiarities: a journey into the past As you surely know, if you have read our enthusiastic review of the PlayStation 4 version, Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy collects the three chapters of the original Crash Bandicoot trilogy, those developed by a still fledgling Naughty Dog, in a completely redesigned version . From the main menu it is possible to access each of the three games without any limitation, also carrying on all the titles at the same time thanks to a watertight compartmentalized save system. Crash Bandicoot, the first chapter, is undoubtedly the one that will unleash your nostalgic side, net of a gameplay and a structure devoid of the facets introduced later. For the time it was a revolutionary product, in its own way, which not only catapulted us into a three-dimensional sphere for a good part of the experience, but which managed to exploit the computing capacity of the first PlayStation in an extraordinary way and therefore to represent screen detailed and colorful characters, who moved within cartoonish and evocative scenarios. Accompanied by a three-quarter third-person view, we were asked to complete increasingly difficult courses, collecting apples and destroying crates in search of precious objects, avoiding dangerous chasms and spikes, as well as eliminating the enemies scattered along the way using the spin attack of the character. However, a vision based on the variety of situations was the master, and so in some stages we found ourselves completing the reverse path, perhaps fleeing from a huge boulder, while in still other levels we proceeded according to the canons of the classic two-dimensional platform . To enrich the whole there was the important factor of replayability, since each scenario hid something and therefore you had to go back to it again and again to complete it 100%, collecting all the apples, destroying all the crates and obtaining all the collectibles. The remake created by Vicarious Visions remains absolutely faithful to this formula, reproducing the dynamics that made Crash Bandicoot famous, the timing of the jumps and attacks, the secrets to be discovered and the bonus sections, however carrying out a painstaking reconstruction work from scratch. In fact, what the N. Sane Trilogy proposes is not the 1996 code to which new assets have been applied, but a new product, which imitates the original in a surprisingly effective way, smoothing out just a few edges as regards gameplay and controls. The modern Crash has an irresistible appearance, a goggled look and silly poses that are also reflected in the attack and movement animations. A similar discourse must be made for the scenarios, which have also been completely redone while respecting the design of Naughty Dog, with surfaces covered with clear and non-trivial textures, little concession to the repetitiveness of the elements, dynamic shadows that change in intensity depending on the light and, in general, the sensation of a cohesive and coherent world, which decisively cuts ties with the division between active parts and background that was clearly visible twenty years ago. Evolution and graphics As mentioned, it will certainly be the first episode of Crash Bandicoot to cause you the lump in memory of the youth spent in front of the PlayStation, but the second and above all the third chapter will make you understand the evolution of the franchise, with the introduction of new ideas and an ever greater freedom of action: elements that laid the foundations for what Naughty Dog would later achieve. In Crash Bandicoot: Cortex Strikes Back the simple alternation of levels is replaced by a more reasoned structure, with a central hub and a series of portals that will project us into environmentsentations very different from each other, capable of influencing the gameplay precisely on the basis of their peculiarities: slippery ice sheets, water channels in which it is better not to fall, and so on. The crystals that Crash has the task of collecting in each stage and some vehicles that the character can use within the increasingly frequent variations on the theme are also introduced, while the boss fights retain the original, indeed rather trivial, setting which provides an attack pattern that invariably ends with a stalemate that must be taken advantage of to strike the enemy. However, the maturity of the franchise arrives with Crash Bandicoot: Warped!, which puts the narrative device of time travel on the table to pit the likeable Peramele against Doctor Neo Cortex, supported in his last attempt to conquer the Earth by the evil Uka Uka, deviant brother of Aku Aku. Under the command of both Crash and his sister Coco, a feature that in the N. Sane Trilogy has been extended in an unprecedented way to some levels of the previous episodes, we will therefore find ourselves exploring medieval Europe, ancient Egypt, the Nevada of the 1950s, World War I and other locations, again determined to collect precious collectibles and defeat Cortex's allies. As expected, the major facets of these chapters are also reflected in the goodness of the remake, which apart from some inattention (the completely inert water within a scenario of Cortex Strikes Back) offers some truly suggestive and spectacular sequences, mostly right when viewed on a large Ultra HD screen. Which brings us back to the obvious technical superiority of Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy on PC. Using the test configuration we were able to play the collection at real 4K, with all settings at maximum and sixty solid frames per second: the best way to enjoy the experience packaged by Vicarious Visions, especially in terms of fluidity, given that on console it was decided not to go beyond thirty frames. The adjustments are very few, in truth: they range from resolution to the target frame rate, from v-sync to motion blur, passing through the quality of antialiasing, shadows, ambient occlusion, bloom, depth of field and the fur blur, which ~smooths the fur~ of the characters for a better rendering. In any case, this is a sufficient amount of settings to scale the experience on the less powerful configurations.", "date": "2018-06-28", "grade": "9.0"}
