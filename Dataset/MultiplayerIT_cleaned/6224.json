{"name": "A lezione da Leonardo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152762-art-academy-atelier-a-lezione-da-leonardo.html", "text": "In five years, the Art Academy series, developed by Headstrong Games, has already reached its third main episode (yes, there are also spin-offs); it's not that it was a sensational commercial success - the best-selling chapter remains the first for Nintendo DS, with about two and a half million copies - but the quality of the work, added to the probable low cost of construction, meant that Nintendo (here as producer) continued to invest in it. This despite the fact that the game is part of that ~Touch Generation~ daughter of the Wii / DS era now left behind, a line of products that had - and in this case - very little playful. It is only out of habit that we can define Art Academy as a ~video game~: much more than its half-brother Wii Music, it is software for learning to draw and paint, taking advantage of the control granted by the Nintendo touch screen. In this, in its aims and setting, the work has not changed at all: yet it has gradually improved, taking into account the criticisms and opinions of users. In fact, all the main shortcomings of the previous episodes have been patched up, if not even resolved; we will delve into the subject shortly, while clarifying that both in intentions and in implementation, it is always a software for introductory painting, certainly not a tool for professionals. Art Academy is a great introduction to painting software, and this one for Wii U is the best Everyone in class Art Academy: Home Studio is made up of about thirty lessons - plus the free drawing mode - which are in turn divided into various types and topics. There are the basic ones and, accessible immediately, the advanced ones; the time required to complete the latter varies enormously from player to player, so much so that it is impossible to provide a reliable estimate. The minimum duration is about an hour, the rest depends on your degree of ability, speed and perfectionism. From this edition there are also some specific teachings for certain materials, such as charcoal, so as to further vary the experience; a lesson is not equivalent to a topic, in fact for each topic there is a main test and other optional ones. In this aspect perhaps lies the only playful legacy of the software: apart from the basic / advanced dichotomy, to unlock each lesson you must first complete the previous one (which represents only a personal challenge, given that the CPU does not judge the work). A setup to protect beginners, so they can't venture too far in the first place. From a notional point of view, Art Academy has always been a work of value, but this time the guys from Headstrong Games have outdone themselves: in the previous chapters, the major flaws of the lessons lay in the superficiality reserved for the initial drawing phase, and above all in the drastic jumps from one processing step to another, which originated ~holes~ that were difficult to manage by inexperienced users. On Wii U they have brilliantly remedied both problems: in the initial construction of the figure, for the first time (and finally), we reason by identifying simple geometric shapes, we talk about masses, volumes and plasticity, but above all we teach, for as much as possible, to observe like a draftsman. With regard to the various passages however, at the cost of giving up some rhythm, there is a slavish accompaniment by the user (the explanations can still be skipped, if deemed useless). This doesn't mean that once you complete all the lessons, if you don't already know how to do it, you will be able to paint; for sure, however, you will know various materials, from oil paints to pastels, you will know more or less how they behave and most likely you will have various extra tools to understand a painting. You will know how and why certain shades are combined, why it is not recommended to use black, what is chromatic gray; your gaze, in general, will be more competent. And you will achieve these results by making images that, if not exceptional, will still have their own dignity... regardless of your talent. Sharing Another deficiency of the previous Art Academy, probably the main one, was the lack of importance given to the sharing of the works, effectively confined to one's console. The images, given the resolution, could not (and cannot) be printed; however, more could and should have been done in this area even before the arrival of Miiverse. Having clarified this, Miiverse certainly helps: circulating your drawings is now easy and quick, the same thing for comments, advice and so on. Even if you don't want to access the Nintendo ~social network~ - to save time - you can admire the works of other usersEntries in the virtual bulletin board, reachable from the main menu of the game. A functional tag system has been inserted (still life, animals, etc.), so as to facilitate the search. Furthermore, in Art Academy: Home Studio it is possible to record - and upload to Youtube - the entire painting process, also selecting the execution speed of the film. Needless to specify how interested it is to review one's own accumulated traits, as well as observe those of others. In addition to admiring the evolution of a well-made (digital, clear) painting, it is intriguing to note the movements of the brush, so as to understand the intensity and direction of the stroke. Right here, alas, lies the only, insurmountable limit of Art Academy: Home Studio, or rather the accuracy of the control system. For the basic use that the ~game~ requires it is adequate, but it is impossible to improve and achieve high levels of precision through the Wii U touch screen; for the same reason, even in this edition, it is a useless product from a professional point of view. Not that it has to change, don't get us wrong; however greater sensitivity would help at any level, even in a simple simulation perspective. A lack caused by the hardware, certainly not by the skill of the developers, who on the contrary have proved worthy of praise in every aspect, giving life to the best Art Academy published so far.", "date": "2015-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
