In many ways, it is a distant vision from that which gamers properly speaking could have, and it is precisely for this reason that these productions often manage to make inroads among casual gamers, a category that represents the majority of mobile device owners. Let's take the guys from Umbrella Games, for example: it's a team made up of just three people, who have done a minimum of apprenticeship at other studios and then decide to make mobile games independently. Their debut title, Zig Zag Boom, was practically a variation on the theme of Flappy Bird, with an infinite zig-zag corridor that you had to cross by quickly making corrections to the trajectory of our cursor, with a simple touch. The next game, Boom Dots, put us at the wheel of a sort of ~space ram~ that had to intercept alien spacecraft headed towards the earth, a sort of endless-based Space Invaders. In short, we are talking about a team that has always pursued the simplest and most intuitive ideas, totaling over eight million downloads to date. And, judging by the growing leadership board, Loop Mania is likely to be a big hit as well. Loop Mania is one of those titles that interpret mobile gaming in its most essential sense Rebound! The basic concept of Loop Mania is tremendously simple: on the screen there is a circle inside which the sphere we control rotates, which has the task of collecting the most points in a single game. By tapping the touch screen we can make the sphere pass from one part of the circle to the other, a maneuver that proves to be fundamental because at regular intervals new spheres invade the same space, moving at different speeds, and a collision with one of them will lead automatically at game over. Of course, unless the ~enemy~ is in a diametrically opposite direction to ours, in which case we can destroy it by changing sides and crushing it. We hope we have explained ourselves well, because in reality we are dealing with one of those products that must be seen to be understood, and which in fact can be understood within a few seconds. Loop Mania is an essential production, both in terms of coding and, above all, of graphic assets, which are limited to circles and spheres with flat colors, often pastel, and with writings that enhance the execution of any combos. In fact, eliminating other spheres and surviving for a long time multiplies our score, and it is precisely the search for the high score that pushes us to play a game and then another. In short, the intention of Umbrella Games is clear: to offer an experience that is tremendously simple and immediate, but reactive and precise at the right point, hoping it will turn into a sort of videogame drug, a thought crusher to pull out even for a few seconds, now and then. The presence of quite a few rather invasive advertising films can only be avoided by making an in-app purchase of 99 cents, an investment that we suggest you make if you like the game.", "date": "2016-04-30", "grade": "6.5"}
