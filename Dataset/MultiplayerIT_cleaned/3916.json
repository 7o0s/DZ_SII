{"name": "Transformers Bumblebee", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/transformers-bumblebee-recensione.html", "text": "Transformers Bumblebee tries to take advantage of the renewed popularity of the Hasbro franchise, in particular that related to the film that will be released in Italian cinemas on December 20 and which will not only star the dear old Beetle, but will finally propose a classic design for Optimus Prime and the others Transformers, inspired by the cartoon aesthetic of the 80s. Developed by Budge Studios, the game is a mix of vertical scrolling endless runners and shooters in which our task is to face no less than twenty-five Decepticons in a sequence of increasingly complex stages, to arrive at the final confrontation with the evil Megatron. The character we control, initially only Bumblebee, begins his run in vehicle mode: in this situation it is necessary to avoid traffic and obstacles on pain of losing vital energy, collect gold tokens and possibly destroy elements of urban decoration to multiply the score. Along the way you can get bonuses such as the traditional magnet or a repair kit to restore some health, after which you must venture inside an enemy base assuming the form of a robot. At that point the game embraces the traditional mechanics of shoot 'em up, with our Autobot automatically firing his laser rifle and dodging the many projectiles that are launched at him from turrets and Decepticons, all the while gaining momentary power-ups. Once this phase is over, you return to vehicle mode on the streets, at a higher speed, to then beware of the ramming of hostile cars that we will have to dodge and take on the counter in turn. The level closes with a boss fight with one of the twenty-five commanders mentioned above, each with different attack and movement patterns: a nice gameplay exercise, which improves a structure that is otherwise a bit too simplistic and repetitive. Controls, characters and graphics While re-proposing the style of Generation 1, Transformers Bumblebee deviates from the mechanics of previous mobile tie-ins dedicated to transformable robots, such as the strategic Transformers: Earth Wars and the fighting game Transformers: Fighters, focusing on immediate action and on a very rich, which using the two available currencies (gold tokens and gems) allows not only to enhance Bumblebee's attack and resistance, but also to unlock numerous other Autobots: Ratchet, Arcee, Sideswipe, Moonracer, Stealth Bumblebee, Prowl, Jazz, Novastar, Mirage and of course Optimus Prime. The price of each individual character increases according to the power of the same, but it is possible to collect enough gems to obtain them all without spending real money, although it takes a lot of patience. In short, from the point of view of the freemium dynamics, the Budge Studios game is rather permissive, the energy of action necessary to face the missions is abundant and you will hardly find yourself having to wait for it to recharge. After that it is clear that each new stage will correspond to a higher challenge, which will require the use of stronger and more resistant Autobots in order to reach the end of the path. Unlocking new characters will also act as a ~continue~, given that at game over we will be able to decide to spend very few gems (from one to three, in general) to be able to resume the race with another robot, without therefore losing the progress made up to that point . The system works well, but suffers from a significant defect concerning the touch controls. Anyone who has had the opportunity to try their hand at the best shooters for iOS and Android knows how important it is a control system that occupies a very small portion of the screen so as not to cover the graphics in any way, and that is also able to recalibrate every time we raise and lower our finger. +2 This unfortunately does not happen with Transformers Bumblebee: the game uses a real proportion between the touch inputs and the movements of the character, without repositioning the virtual stick and thus giving rise to unpleasant situations when you return to the game by touching the wrong side of the touch screen and perhaps smeared on a rock. Hopefully an update will fix this, although the title has been out for some time now and so far the developers don't seem to have felt this kind of need. From a technical point of view, we move between highs and lows, the in-game graphics are generally very simple and without treble, but the audio sector uses the famous ~transformation~ sampling and the original theme of the television series: although it only happens in some situations, it is a prodigious hook for the many nostalgics of the cartoonmato.", "date": "2018-12-05", "grade": "7.0"}
