The gameplay of Gladiators is undoubtedly a remarkable essay of originality, as well as its most characteristic hallmark. To begin with, taking up a trend from recent years, the managerial component of resource management and base construction has been left in the background, favoring a more direct approach to the game, such as to emphasize the tactical-strategic elements. After all we are in an arena and we are gladiators, what would be the point of going in search of gold, tiberium and stuff like that? We will start each mission with a more or less large handful of units, which will accompany our Hero as he explores the map and collects power-ups. Yes, because bonuses are scattered everywhere on the playing field ranging from the usual healing pack to improvements in firepower, passing through energy shields and so on, all of which can be inventoried and used when necessary. An endowment worthy of an FPS and it is no coincidence that the multiplayer option of the game includes a mode called deathmatch! Exploration of the immense arena and identification of bonuses is a strategic element that should not be underestimated, but we must not forget to collect the special Cards as well. As mentioned, we will not have to extract minerals from the ground to buy new units, but by identifying the points where these cards, similar to tarot cards, are generated, we will be able to earn and accumulate credits to spend in the Respawn-Zones. These neutral areas are scattered across the map and capturing them is critical, as they are the only source of reinforcements you will find once you enter the arena. By spending the acquired credits it will be possible to infinitely clone one's men, and if a player were to take control of all the Respawn-Zones, his opponent would have no way to counter him.

Consequently, in multiplayer games we will inevitably witness a real race to see who first reaches these strategically essential areas, with furious skirmishes along the way and once they arrive near the coveted finish line. Another decidedly innovative element of the Gladiators gameplay is the particular line of sight management system or the portion of the scenario visible to the eyes of our men. It is a consolidated habit in the RTS to introduce the so-called fog of war, offering the usual shadow that covers unexplored areas or areas far from our army. With the introduction of 3D graphics in strategic games, there has almost never been an equally incisive evolution regarding this issue, and still today, for example when playing Warcraft3, each unit has its own visual range within which it sees everything, regardless of the obstacles that may come between you and the target. It is no coincidence that a very popular tactic is to fire on enemy bases with catapults, from behind the protection of extensive forests. In Gladiators on the contrary, there is no fog of war and the geography of the arena is perfectly visible from the start, but the enemies will not be visible to the player until a straight line can be established between his units and the opponents, which they can also be found a few centimeters away, hidden in the thick of the trees. This introduces the need to analyze and evaluate terrain features much more carefully than usual and allows for highly elaborate tactics such as ambushes and surprise attacks.

Is it worth breaking the proverbial piggy bank to buy The Gladiators? Our answer is yes, but on condition that we are actually looking for an atypical product, which deviates to a large extent from the canons of RTS and aims to introduce something new and daring. And likewise be willing to give him something on the technical side just to savor this breath of fresh air.
