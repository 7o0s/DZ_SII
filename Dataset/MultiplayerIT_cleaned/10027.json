For the occasion, it earned an HD in front of the name, due to the use of the new graphics engine developed by Croteam for the third installment of the series, still unpublished. As some of you know, The Second Encounter is not a real sequel but a sort of chapter 1.5 of the original game, i.e. the maps and settings are completely different, but the monsters and weapons are identical, apart from some exceptions relief like the electric saw. Despite the lack of originality, lovers of good Sam received him well and gave him a great success. The reason is very simple: technological reasons aside, it is one of the craziest (and most difficult) first-person shooters ever made. Already the plot is indicative of the light-hearted and hardcore tone, with Sam leaving for Sirio after defeating Ugh-Zan III at the end of the first episode. Unfortunately, things don't go as they should and ours finds itself in a Mexican jungle surrounded by monsters and ... developers (they are an Easter egg that must be found). Unfortunately we have suffered a sore point to report, because the introductory sequence with the big heads that make the spaceship explode has been cut. Hopefully it will be added soon with a patch, as many fans are already requesting on the official forum. Readymake The single player mode is identical to what we knew, but the graphical improvement is there and it is evident. Just compare the images of the new version with those of the old version to realize the step forward made in terms of technology: bigger textures, realistic grass, more accurate enemy models, improved special effects and a more modern general feeling. In short, if it weren't a remake, it could be mistaken for a new game in all respects, also because the gameplay is unusually fresh despite the years. The Serious Sams belong to the ranks of hyper-frantic shooters in which you have to face hundreds of enemies at the same time. More than Duke Nukem and Painkiller, excess is the fundamental key to the gameplay in the Croteam title. Playing from the normal level upwards, it is easy to find the larger areas literally overflowing with enemies who attack everyone at the same time, from all sides, and who require a highly developed skill to be eliminated. Players accustomed to modern shooters, in which the opponents are few and happy to be killed by the player standing still to get riddled (the famous good manners of the monster), will surely find themselves lost in front of the infernal waves of Serious Sam. In fact, the level of challenge is really high and continuing through the levels is not easy for anyone, but it is the game itself that does not pretend to be anything else, so there is no need to consider the difficulty a defect. Basically it is a stylistic choice and must be interpreted as such. Of course, if the easy level of Aliens vs Predator worries you ... forget it. Novelty? Few... The biggest flaw of Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter is the same as the first remake, or the lack of significant news. In this case, a fairly superior job has been done, with the addition of several multiplayer modes (Survival, Co-op, Team and Versus) and with better integration with Steam, but otherwise the developers have limited themselves to one copy carbon of the original. Sure, the co-op mode is still great and a lot of fun, but a few new single-player levels couldn't hurt. Maybe, why not, an entire extra episode, also considering that we are talking about a ten year old game. Frankly speaking, those who have finished the original will have little incentive to throw themselves into this one. Perhaps the luck of Second Encounter is that few shooters of the same type have come out since then and the fans are in a bit of withdrawal symptoms. Also counting the fact that the official sequel, Serious Sam 2, is infinitely inferior to it (it only had the technical part left as a plus... but given the remake, it now loses even from that point of view), we can recommend without hesitation also this second makeover to all those who are looking for a challenging first person shooter that can remind them of the meaning of the words frenzy and challenge, available on Steam for 19.99 euros.
