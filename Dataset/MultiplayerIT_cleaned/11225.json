The library of Wii-Ware titles is enriched with a game very similar to Link's Crossbow Training, one of those titles that use the remote control as if it were a shooting weapon, basing their gameplay around a concept very similar to shooting as a sign of the Luna Parks. Let's talk about Wild West Guns, which as the title suggests takes place in the setting of the American prairies full of Indians, saloons and vultures. The setting has always been one of the most fascinating, and all its clichs are well reproduced, along six levels, by the developer Gameloft. Wild West Guns works perfectly with the Wii-Zapper, for those who already bought it, otherwise it's perfect without it. Each game level is divided into three subsections, in which it is necessary to obtain a certain score to unlock the next one, adding up the dollars earned in each sub-chapter. Wild West Guns is very similar to the Nintendo title, tracing its greatest merits. First of all the controls: precise, without ever errors or hesitations, even in the most frenetic and agitated sessions. Accuracy is essential, because by hitting enemies in the head you get more points, and during the shootings you have to try to hit other objectives, often very small and hidden. A rough control would have undermined the very nature of its gameplay, that is to score the most points, but fortunately this is not the case. during the shootings you must also try to hit other targets, often very small and hidden Wild Wild West! In order to continue through the levels of Wild West Guns you need to obtain minimum score thresholds, thus overcoming a sort of barrier between the levels in which it is possible to advance only with a lot of practice and memorizing every detail that can get us points. Already from the second level the first difficulties begin which force us to optimize the shots fired, rationing them to get more points. Only after trying the same patterns many times can you hope to move on to the next pattern, but this is a calibrated difficulty and not a frustrating one. The gameplay is very varied, with very different tests that draw inspiration from all the settings and symbolic characters of the world of the West: there is the can race, the saloons, the Indians, the challenges with the bandits, but also original tests like the one that sees us busy saving rabbits from hungry Condors. In the Gameloft title there really is all of the West, and you can live alongside a friend of ours. There is a two-player mode, for cooperative or challenge: a factor that greatly extends the longevity of Wild West Guns, otherwise crushed by its only six schemes. There is also an achievement system that is somewhat reminiscent of Xbox 360 titles: to complete the game 100% you will have to sweat! Fauna, flora and characters of the old Far West All the settings of the classic Far West have been well reproduced with great detail and a decidedly appreciable and clean graphics. It is precisely these details that make the difference: in Wild West Guns every object or animal is interactable and gives points if hit. Therefore, in a saloon there are bottles everywhere, glass, windows, chairs and tables, wall clocks, paintings and much more, almost all with its own physics. Fauna and flora are reproduced with equal care: we can cross prairie dogs, horses, bales of hay, cacti, bushes, vultures, hawks, frogs, mice, chickens, cows. Enemies belong to a maximum of four or five categories, however. Indians, bandits, cowboy women, suicide bombers and little else. Perhaps there would have been more work to differentiate this aspect, but given the genre of the game, one cannot complain anyway. the settings of the classic Far West have been well reproduced with great detail and a decidedly appreciable and clean graphics Fauna, flora and characters of the old Far West The levels are built with a good number of polygons, particle effects for explosions, convincing lighting and even variable weather conditions. For a title that bases its premise on the Luna Park genre, that's no small feat, and its 1000 points (necessary to download it from the Wii-Shop service) makes it count for all. The style used for the characters is the famous cel-shading which gives a cartoon effect, but in general everything else is also very colorful. A slight drop in frame-rate can be seen on occasion, particularly in moving patterns like the train assault, but otherwise the frame-count remains constant and solid. The audio sector consists of some typically western background music, but all quite repetitive and dull, as well asand the sound effects, which are not even many and tend to repeat themselves frequently. The built-in speaker of the Wii-Remote is well used, however, and reproduces the shots of our Colt very well. Comment Wild West Guns is a well-crafted title, and above all fun, by virtue of the many situations in which it puts the player to the test, through settings reproduced in an excellent way and always well characterized and different. In spite of its only six schemes, Gameloft's title manages to have a worthy longevity, thanks to its level barrier system, two-player option and achievements to unlock. The audio-video sector is fluctuating, offering good graphics, full of details and colorful, but an audio that could have been more refined and varied. Wild West Guns is strongly recommended, especially to those who have not already purchased Nintendo's Link's Crossbow Training, a title which obviously draws its inspiration and which it is very similar to.
