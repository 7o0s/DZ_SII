If the first half hour of the game does not offer anything truly innovative from this point of view, the complex of puzzles and situations that will have to be faced during the race for the presidency is simply excellent, with the player committed to doing any meanness to ensure that the deranged rabbit Max, can get the better of the giant animated statue. Unforgettable, especially, the televised confrontation between the two, which will be resolved with a sequence of bizarre electoral promises and a surprise result. What has just been described represents the main narrative block, which in any case is accompanied by a whole series of secondary or in any case less important moments, in which it is always nice to find the most loved characters from previous appearances. Sybil, the ~all-rounder~ friend of Sam & Max, will change two professions, even going so far as to offer consultancy for the Carbon-14 dating of objects, while the owner of the general store on the street corner, Bosco, will prove himself this time strongly interested in Russia and, with yet another political reference, in communist ideology. Little, very little space has been reserved for driving sessions which are gradually becoming less and less important, probably as a result of not exactly flattering feedback in this regard from the community of enthusiasts. The playability has not undergone any tweaks, resulting as always immediate, so much so that the controls are entrusted solely to the arrow and the left mouse button, in addition to the space bar in case you want to skip the dialogues. Absent the hoped-for improvement in the management of objects - the only flaw together with the usual back tracking sessions - which unfortunately can almost never be joined together or modified, so as to increase the depth of the puzzles. Longevity is perhaps slightly higher than the previous chapters, especially thanks to a slight increase in difficulty which now, without ever being frustrating, requires a greater imaginative effort and a few more attempts. The usual, inimitable, class of all time The design work done by Telltale's graphic designers in an attempt to create an ironic version of the White House was splendid. Many truly existing environments, such as the oval office or the president's office, have been reproduced in an alternative way, with bizarre and always excellently designed details. The other settings remain unchanged, with the exception of a new shop opened along the road where Sam & Max's office is located and about which it is better not to reveal anything - suffice it to say that all those who have tried Situation Comedy will like it. Technically there are no differences from what was seen previously, with the now tested graphics and the usual, splendid dubbing, to make both sectors pleasant. Only the musical themes received extra attention, with a richer track list.

The irony and irreverence that we have learned to appreciate in recent months find new lifeblood in dealing with political issues, while the puzzles are always amusing and exciting. All packaged in a pleasant and easily assimilable form even by PCs with less ~pushed~ configurations. A must have for all fans of the curious duo, which should also be tried by those who, until now, have kept away from the excellent series by Telltale Games. Advised. Pros More and more irreverent Well-structured and balanced gameplay Chuck Jordan is a guarantee Cons Rather limited item management Will Telltale be able to maintain these quality levels? Following a not very happy third episode, Season 1 of Sam & Max returns in all its splendor and, with Abe Lincoln Must Die!, offers all fans an adventure of absolute quality, perhaps the best, to date. of this long series. Part of the small rebirth we are witnessing can only be attributed to Chuck Jordan, former screenwriter of The Curse of Monkey Island, who for the occasion created a davtrue exceptional, for fun and topics covered. After a thousand forays into the world of entertainment and the underworld, the two private detectives will have to contend with nothing less than a president of the United States of America under hypnosis and a statue of Abraham Lincoln with a life of its own, as well as participating in elections and exploiting like the American missile arsenal. Politics at the center of the entire experience, therefore, with jokes and allusions that spare no side and which, the only note, risk displacing less informed users about Yankee affairs.", "date": "2007-03-06", "grade": null}
