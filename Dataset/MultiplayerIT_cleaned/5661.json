Blood, tattooed people, spectacular knockouts, yelling commentators, chokes and physicists trained to the extreme. These are the components that have led the world of mixed martial arts to become one of the most successful sports of recent years and have allowed it to overshadow the noble art of boxing in the category of combat sports. Everything in the UFC is designed to be spectacular and extreme, from the press conferences to the moment in which one of the two fighters attacks the now helpless opponent, waiting for the referee to throw himself in the middle. The question is: will this second Electronic Arts title, despite having brought bad luck to its athletes on the cover, will it have managed to transport all of this to our monitors? UFC 2 has arrived on consoles with its load of blows, blood and bruises: here is our review! 250 ways to get hurt Two years ago Electronic Arts took over the UFC baton from the cold hands of THQ after trying to create its own title dedicated to MMA, and putting the same Fight Night team in charge of the project. Despite the experience of the developers, the game lacked interesting content and failed to make the most of all the variables of a fight in the octagon. Each MMA fighter has his own peculiarities and if the game has always shone in the striking phase, the same cannot be said of the clinch and ground fighting, undoubtedly very complex moments in which the schematic of a video game can never be compared to the subtleties and strategy needed to carry out a Brazilian jujitsu hold. In this second chapter, things seem to have improved, both in terms of content and game mechanics. We are not dealing with perfection, but there has certainly been progress. Let's start with the game modes: at our disposal there will obviously be the possibility of creating your own personalized event, choosing two of more than 250 wrestlers (with two versions of Mike Tyson included), divided between men and women. If, on the other hand, you just want to fight with a friend or against the computer without thinking too much about fatigue management, clinches and submissions, there is Knockout Mode. In this mode, each wrestler has five or more life points available and each hit to the body or head takes one away. This rule generates very fast and brutal fights, which always end with spectacular KOs, in which we can appreciate the development team's effort to try to vary the animations. Wrestlers collapse onto their sides, stagger and slowly fall to the ground or pass out on the spot and fall face forward, as if someone had flipped the right switch, giving the whole thing a touch of realism. For those wishing to learn there are tutorials that teach the management of standing, clinch and ground fighting, while those who prefer to fight online will find a lot of wrestlers waiting for them (although at the moment we cannot comment on lag, matchmaking and management of servers). Those who want to carve their name in the Olympus of the UFC, on the other hand, have two options: the offline Career and the UFC Ultimate Team. Looking for glory Career mode will allow us to create our alter ego from scratch or import the characteristics of our favorite fighter. We will be able to choose gender, weight, height, age, nickname, tattoos, hair, mouthguards and obviously the fighting style, which will influence the characteristics and the approach to the fights. Once we have decided who we want to be, it's time to get into the ring and demonstrate our worth starting from the basics: the first fights will in fact take place in the arena of the Ultimate Fighter, the UFC reality show in which the champions of the future are forged . Based on our first race we will be assigned to one of the two coaches, trying to eliminate the challengers of the opposing faction one by one in the subsequent ones. If we manage to do it, we will be able to make our debut in the UFC in one of the minor events, arriving, KO after KO, to fight for the title and its subsequent defense. When we are not fighting we will obviously have to train, completing short tutorial sessions dedicated to the various sections of MMA combat: submission defense, kicks, blocks, ground transitions, clinch defense, throws and so on. Each workout has three levels of difficulty, which correspond to three different probabilities of suffering an injury that will limit some of our features for inagainst next. These workouts aren't particularly fun and in some cases they aren't even studied well, given that for example in the one dedicated to the save our opponent will hit too little, preventing us from getting a good score, but luckily if we get a positive evaluation we will no longer be forced to repeat the session. From then on, just press a key to get the same score. The clashes will also give us experience points that we will be able to spend to learn new moves or unlock perks that will guarantee us a small advantage in the ring, such as faster health recovery, more painful elbow strikes, a higher percentage of stunning with head kicks and so on. These perks are divided into three main branches: physical, ground fighting and striking. In managing our wrestler we will also have to be very attentive to the fans and the passage of time. As we get older we will be more prone to injuries and sooner or later we will be asked to retire. However, if we are able to cultivate our fan base, perhaps with particularly spectacular victories, we will extend the longevity of our career. Having said that, the Career mode, while guaranteeing a certain degree of fun, felt a bit rushed to us. The epic moments that could make each clash even more exciting are missing, a story is missing, perhaps some crossroads, the construction of a rivalry made up of press conferences and arrogance to show off in the weigh-in ceremony is missing. In short, what surrounds the UFC is missing. Also, the character development felt slow and poorly structured. Initially it will be very easy to bring the matches home, but when the going gets tough our alter ego will in fact be unprepared for the fight and will end up knocked down very quickly. In short, at the beginning it's all too easy, afterwards it's all very difficult. We don't know if it's intentional, but it feels weird to win 15 fights without even a scratch and go down on 16 as if we were inexperienced rookies. To be honest, longevity is also missing, one afternoon, maybe two, is enough to become champions. Xbox One goals There are 33 achievements in UFC 2, for a total of 1,072 points. To get them we will have to knock out our opponents with certain moves, stun them, become champions in career mode, challenge someone online, climb the relative rankings and complete all the challenges with the highest score. In short, if at first it may seem easy enough, you will need to spend a lot of time playing the game, especially in combat against other players. Fighters and figurines The other way in which to develop your own character is the UFC Ultimate Team, which takes up in all respects the concept of the Fifa Ultimate Team, applying it to the world of MMA. At our disposal there will be five slots, in which we will be able to create as many fighters and put together a real team. Each wrestler, with his victories, will contribute to the team's score, ensuring any bonuses to be redeemed to obtain currency that can be spent. Unlike the career mode, in the Ultimate Team the training is based on the cards that we will find in the packages, which can be purchased in the appropriate store. These packages are divided by weight category, but there are also universal packages with cards that are suitable for each class. The cards, which have different degrees of rarity, in turn can unlock a new move or perk, increase stats, grant us a temporary health bonus or restore the fatigue that we will consume clash after clash. The money to get these cards will come from online and offline battles and, obviously, from the real money that we decide to spend. Just like in FIFA we can choose whether to challenge a human or warm up with artificial intelligence, but in the first case the rewards will be higher. Each match will allow us to advance in the league, allowing us to aim for the title and move on to the next one, where more experienced fighters and even more interesting prizes await us. Unfortunately, the lack of online during our test prevented us from touching the progress in the virtual arenas and from a single player point of view we were a bit disappointed. All offline fights took place against the same fighter, that is the standard template with ~name~ written instead of the name and whose skills improved slightly fight after fight. We can't tell you if it will be like this also in the final version of the game, in any case the will of Electronic Art to push, rightly, towards the clash between players, rather than between player and computer, is evident. On this point, however, we will return after the review for further updatesnts. The aesthetics of the KO Ok, we've seen the modes, but how is the game once in the ring? In a nutshell, it is a feast for the eyes that confirms the excellent work done last year and more generally on combat sports by the Electronic Arts team. Being able to focus only on the wrestlers, these are reproduced with a manic abundance of details, made of sweat, faces that contract from pain or effort, cuts, bruises and broken noses. The only flaws perhaps concern a certain rigidity of the animations, especially when walking and when passing from shots to parries and vice versa, and some interpenetration of solids, especially in the ground phases. As far as the game mechanics are concerned, the transition between the various clinches and the ground fight has been revised with a simpler and more intuitive method: to move to the desired position or get up again, you will need to hold down the analog in the chosen direction. The success time of the command depends on tiredness and skill, but also on the opponent who can hit us to make us start from scratch or oppose our decision by pressing a backbone and tilting the analog in the same direction. Put like this it seems easy, but if our wrestler is not good on the ground or is very tired, our life will become hell in which we will no longer be able to get up or we will be forced to suffer the knees in the face of a wrestler much better than us in the clinch. From this point of view, holds prove to be much more effective than strinking in concluding a match, because they allow an expert player to gain the upper hand in a very short time. The submission system has remained identical, with the minigame in which we have to defend ourselves by moving the analog in the various directions or attack by counteracting this movement, but in the offensive phase it has been enriched with the possibility of modifying the running submission and obtaining a further tactical advantage. In stand-up combat, on the other hand, decidedly absurd and sometimes random situations may occur, which represent the good and the bad of the game. At times the fighter will be able to take four or five kicks in the face in a row without falling to the ground, at others he will fall like a rag after a well-placed punch, or maybe he will be able to take us to the ground despite being dazed and staggering. On the one hand, all this is appreciable, because in a certain sense it renders the unpredictability of these clashes, in which even the underdog can place the shot of his life or we can witness miraculous recoveries on the other, it can sometimes be frustrating. However, we specify that it is not the norm: if a player is in full control of the match, 9 times out of 10 he will bring it home. One thing we really don't understand though is why, regardless of the class and level of the wrestlers, the AI always seems to tire much less than us.", "date": "2016-03-10", "grade": "8.0"}
