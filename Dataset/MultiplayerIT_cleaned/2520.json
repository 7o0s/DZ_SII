{"name": "Armored Core 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/armored-core-2.html", "text": "Lasts the life of the mercenary! As previously stated, you will be a Raven, a member of a respected and elite circle of mercenaries who serve anyone willing to pay for your services. After the interesting initial movie you will be put on board your first mech (the view will be in the third person) to face the first mission: to destroy a series of robots to achieve the qualification of Raven. This first stage serves more than anything to make you practice with the commands but it is already an indicator of what will await you during the approximately 35 missions that make up the title. These are very varied and range from escorting a vehicle to eliminating everything that stands in front of it, from defending a bridge to destroying crazed robots that ~infest~ a factory, in short, there is certainly no lack of variety! After completing a mission you will get others (you will receive emails by reading which you will have access to the new assignments); you will also receive cash prizes to spend on repairing the damage, buying ammunition and new pieces. And here begins, in my opinion, the juiciest part of the game: money permitting (it really takes a lot in some cases!) you can in fact modify every single element of your robot, from the head to the propulsion systems, from the armament to the limbs, in short with with a little patience you can create the mech you've always wanted by varying its color and even the logo (there's an editor especially for this): you'll be spoiled for choice! Of course the ~processing~ is not an end in itself but necessary to be able to continue on the difficult path that will take you to the final mission: getting to the end, I'll tell you right away, will be a feat for few given the absurd difficulty of some levels (in one of the first you will be literally attacked by a myriad of flying objects that will drain all your energy in the blink of an eye!). To make matters worse, I would like to point out that the ~easy~ difficulty level is not provided, which says a lot about the difficulty of the game. The purchase of upgrades therefore becomes essential if you want to have any chance of surviving, also hindered not a little by the control system: it is really bad to see your robot move easily in all directions and then find yourself in serious difficulty once you want to rotate it . In truth, the control system has even been improved compared to the Japanese version which did not include the use of analog sticks but one wonders why a greater effort has not been made. For the rest, nothing to report: piloting the mech is quite simple and the automatic targeting system of some weapons helps not to panic when the enemies become more numerous. As for the game modes, in addition to the missions, it is possible to try your hand at one-on-one combat in the Arena mode: start from the bottom of the standings and climb it by destroying whoever separates you from the podium. This mode is very useful for making some money easily but above all for testing the trinkets you have just purchased, and if you are destroyed you will not have to pay the repair costs or the spent bullets. There is also a versus mode in which to challenge a friend via split screen or i.Link cable. Old chicken makes good soup... Moving on to the technical implementation, the first word that comes to mind is ~honest~; although it was one of the first titles to come out for the ~black goddess~ its cosmetics still leaves you stunned for the definition of the mechs reproduced down to the smallest detail, including the customized logo, while the quality of the textures that cover the moving objects is good even if lately we have seen better (read Z.o.E.); the numerous cutscenes between one mission and another are also well defended. As for the effects, nothing to say: the splashes of water that rise as the robot passes or the various explosions or, again, the fire launched by the weapons of some enemies, are beautiful to see, while the speech is different as regards the backdrops, well made but really bare! With regard to the soundtrack, it must be said that overall there are techno tracks that are not very incisive which however have the advantage of not disturbing the game sessions (in practice it is as if they weren't there), while the special effects, although not very numerous, are well done. Finally, it should be remembered that the soundtrack is in Dolby Surround, which means that those with an Audio/Video system can enjoy a much more engaging sound than the usual stereophonic mode (when will Dolby Digital be used in video games?). And here we are atthe end! Ultimately a more than discreet title that associates an uncommon depth and longevity to the beauty of the graphics sector (just remember that it is possible to create an almost infinite number of different robots), undermined only by the poorly calibrated difficulty (but with all the time that they had to do the conversion couldn't they tweak the challenge level down?). If nothing else, those who complain about games that are too easy will find bread for their teeth Otherwise it will not be comparable to Z.o.E. but it is still a valid title dedicated to all lovers of Gundam and various big robots (ah, it has nothing to do with the game but I still wanted to tell you; do you know that perhaps Mediaset will broadcast one of the latest Gundam series? I don't see the 'now!) and for those who have bought the i.Link but don't know what to do with it! Pros: Possibility to develop mechs Good technical realization Variety of missions Cons: Control system Excessive difficulty of some missions High cost of upgrades We are in the year 196. After a war that brought about the so-called ~Great Destruction~, enormous progress was made in the colonization of Mars thanks above all to the important discoveries by Uncle Matrix, the most powerful terrestrial corporation. His research has meant that, in a few years, many other corporations moved to the planet and with them an important percentage of the earth's population. Unfortunately, new political and commercial interests have brought new life to the struggles between the various corporations, reaching peaks of intensity never touched before. This is, broadly speaking, the scenario where the events of the first transposition of the series (previously on PS) on Sony's 128-bit platform will take place. Armored Core 2 was one of the first titles to come out after the launch of the console in Japan but only now we European users can take on the role of a Raven, a mercenary always looking for new missions to complete. The game was then received quite positively, but with all the time that has passed has it maintained its appeal or has it lost some ~piece~ along the road of localization (which, it seems to me fair to report, stops at the instruction booklet only)?", "date": "2001-05-03", "grade": null}
