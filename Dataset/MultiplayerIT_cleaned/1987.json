{"name": "Disney Chi  PK?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disney-chi-e-pk.html", "text": "PK, a made in Italy hero Before telling you about the game, I think it's important to underline that the Disney character of the game, PK (Paperinik), was born from the brilliant minds of some designers from the Disney Academy in Milan. Subsequently, the resulting comic of the same name gained success not only in our country but also in the rest of the world. Similarly, Disney's Who's PK? was created with the important contribution of the local branch of Ubi Soft while the development took place in the Ubi Soft Studios in Morocco. The game has been designed to appeal to all Disney fans and therefore will be distributed worldwide and not only in the country where PK was born. After the pleasantries we witness a well-crafted presentation that will make us participate live in the transformation of Donald into Donald duck. The transformation will be carried out by a mysterious creature who will also list all the objectives to be completed during this long adventure. Immediately from the first screens you are truly amazed by the graphic style chosen for the creation of the title. The game features a perfect mix between cartoon and 3D style; all this creates a truly commendable graphic beauty. The colors are very lively even where they shouldn't be and it will seem like watching a cartoon like those on TV, with the only difference that we control everything with the help of the trusty joypad. The game certainly manages, at first glance, to positively impress both enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts, but it is better not to spread enthusiasm because the defects are lurking and a proton cannon will not be enough to eliminate them. The characters are well defined. Not only the name and the license of PK are exploited, but the commitment of the SH is immediately recognized which almost manages to make people fall in love with the character again. The enemies themselves have a very particular style. The word ~enemy~ evokes an ugly or at least threatening creature while the enemies in PK are gaudy and very nice both in appearance and in movements. This allows the battles to maintain the classic lively atmosphere of all Disney games. Even the little ones will be able to have fun with a shooter without the unsuspecting parents surprising their child immersed in a bloody splatter. We are talking about ~Disney culture~ where even the enemies are appreciated and where fun and joy remain at the base of everything. But where do you jump? The controls are really very accurate and the pressure of R2 and square will be enough to aim and hit an enemy several times, with the possibility of changing objectives using the right analog stick. In general, the commands respond well even if sometimes it will be difficult to find the platform on which to jump because it is well hidden in the setting, but this is neither a problem of controls nor of graphics, the attentive eye of the player will simply be enough to identify immediately the point to move on to the next scenario. The accessories that you will find during the adventure are fun. In addition to the basic cannon, you will find many other hyper-technological gadgets that are easy to use and very rewarding if used in the right way and at the right time. This is not new to me Unfortunately, even this title is not free from defects. The defect is mainly one, but depending on the weight that each of us will give it, it can prove to be overlooked or insurmountable: linearity. The game is linear too linear, there is no freedom and you end up following an already pre-established path. Sometimes this lack of freedom can be irritating as it feels like you are bound to go to one point and it takes you back to the first scrolling platformers, where you followed an imaginary straight line with no possibility to space or vary. In short, it is a not insignificant flaw, but given the target it can also be considered an advantage. However, users aged 13 and over may find the title too easy. This defect only partially affects the positive experience offered by a successful game. Disney never lets us down This title is also excellently translated into Italian both in speech and in all the menus and subtitles present. After all, we shouldn't be surprised by these being ~Who is PK?~ a game made in Italy by the local Ubi Soft team. The voices are spot on especially that of Donald Duck before the transformation into PK is really hilarious. Perfect is also therelip-to-speech synchronization worthy of the best Hollywood movies. On the other hand, the sound effects are acceptable, undoubtedly well done and often followed by an on-screen writing that tries to imitate comics in this too; from the series: Bang! Crack! BOOM!. The background music is catchy and well paced and hardly tiring. More than newsstand.. Disney Who is PK? manages to fully satisfy enthusiasts and to please even those who have never heard of PK. The title has numerous touches of class and few defects for this reason it is to be considered a good game to be avoided only if you hate PK and do not fall within the target, if you are not part of these two categories you will have no excuses. More than newsstand! PK enthusiasts will immediately run to their trusted dealer to take home a title that uses a license to create a game that will disappoint very few. The Super Hero has arrived and is stronger than ever, now it's up to us to help him complete his adventure! Pro There is Paperinik! Very particular and accurate graphics Fair sound effects Excellent translation Cons Too linear Sometimes monotonous Medium/low target Mom, did you bring Mickey Mouse? All of us have browsed a Mickey Mouse at least once. How to forget the many afternoons spent reading, cartoons after cartoons, identifying ourselves with our heroes, who were nothing but ink put in the right places. Will the polygons be able to make us relive the same emotions? In the midst of the videogame era arrives ~Disney Who is PK?~ with the aim of reviving the adventures of Donald Duck, but this time in the role of his alter-ego Paperinik, hero of Duckburg, ready to free the world from the alien invasion.", "date": "2002-10-08", "grade": null}
