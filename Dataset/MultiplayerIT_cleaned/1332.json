{"name": "Drakengard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/drakengard-2.html", "text": "Dragonheart? The main feature of Drakengard, and here we recognize the master touch of Square Enix, is an excellent, engaging, exciting and decidedly mature plot, very different from the classic ~fairy tales~ to which we are accustomed, where the hero complexed and in crisis of identity must find its way, crown his dream of love with the protagonist of the moment and possibly save the world. The story of Drakengard is in fact so dark and atypical as to make the game forbidden to minors under 17 in America and to associate the atmospheres and characters of the story with the well-known manga and anime Berserk by Kentaro Miura, in which the cursed protagonist Gatsu really has a lot to share with our hero, Caim. We find ourselves in a fantasy-medieval world where two military forces oppose each other, the Union and the Empire, the latter intending to capture the beautiful and naive princess Furiae, Caim's sister and reincarnation of a powerful goddess. To protect Furiae, Caim is mortally wounded and, bleeding, he finds himself face to face with one of his most hated creatures, a dragon, of the same race as the being that tore his parents to pieces when he was still a boy. But the Dragon is also wounded and dying and so, to survive, the two make a ~pact~: as per tradition, Caim sacrifices a part of himself, his voice, and binds himself to the ancestral being, acquiring incredible powers. However, their bond will not prevent the Empire from kidnapping the poor Furiae and this will force Caim and his close friend Inuart (in love with Furiae) to embark on a journey to rescue the divine girl and the Verdelet priest charged with protecting her. Banal? Yes, so it may seem, but the plot of Drakengard will unfold over the course of thirteen chapters, transforming into a plot of extraordinary power, characterized by truly incredible and unusual characters, including a protagonist, Caim, in fact, far from trivial, who is not moved by heroic sentiments but by hatred towards his enemy which prevails over love for Furiae, and a Dragon who is totally different from what one might expect, a maternal creature with the voice of Gigi Proietti perhaps, but who even despises the same human race to which Caim belongs who, in a sense, is none other than his savior. Dynasty Dragons? As already mentioned, Drakengard is divided into thirteen chapters which, in turn, are divided into various episodes or, if we want to be more practical, levels. Most of the stages will see Caim, on foot, making his way through legions and legions of enemies, mowing them down with his weapons or riding the Dragon, which can be recalled in some situations by pressing a button. Other schemes, on the other hand, will have to be tackled almost as if they were a shooter, directly and solely controlling the Dragon and wiping out the hordes of flying enemies. But beyond this simple division of the stages, the spirit of Drakengard is summed up in a frantic pressing of the keys capable of disintegrating everything that moves. After all, it is precisely through the defeat of a certain number of enemies that it is possible to enhance Caim's weapons: our anti-hero, in fact, at the beginning only has the sword given to him by his father, but it will be possible to recover other weapons, including hammers, axes, spears and various knives; every time a weapon reaches a new level (there are four in all) its power, the number of attacks capable of chaining into a combo, the power and effect of the magic connected to it and even its aesthetic form. Magic? Yes, because each of Caim's weapons will allow the vengeful warrior to cast a particular spell at the enemies' address, consuming the appropriate spiritual energy (rechargeable by defeating other enemies). The problem with combat in Drakengard, therefore, is not so much its precise structure as its lack of variety. In the end, Caim has a single combo weapon (which can be interspersed with a sort of special blow, which can be performed at certain points in the sequence, capable of wiping out the surrounding enemies in an instant) and a single magic, which in the long run it transforms the stages into a continuous repetition of the same action, combined with Caim's discrete acrobatic skills and the intervention of the Dragon which, however, prevents the use of weapons to enhance them and consequently represents an extraordinary resource, upgradeable and evolvable in its own right time. After all, however, Drakengard is a pure action-game, a bit of a scrolling fighting game, which in itself implies a repetitive action structure but not for this boring or not fun. However, there are some variants that make Drakengard a little less monotonous: in addition to the stages riding the Dragon, it is possible to selectOperate one of Caim's bizarre companions at the start of each level and then use him for a short period of time by pressing a button and controlling him instead of Caim. The real problem, at this point, is not found so much in the variety of mechanics as in what their existence implies, and that is the enemies, afflicted by a decidedly questionable AI that manages their actions in a pre-established pattern, consisting in attack Caim once he enters their line of sight without any strategy, basically just to put up a transparent resistance consisting of blind attacks and little else. Dragons, warriors, dumb enemies and sorcery, so... but is the PlayStation 2 up to this boisterous mix of ideas? Drag-on PlayStation? Drakengard's major problem lies in its technical implementation. Globally we are faced with a massive product: dozens of enemies in action at the same time, spells, explosions, large combat areas, huge creatures and more. The problem is that the realization of all this is little more than sufficient: the polygonal models generally do not have who knows what level of detail and the animations are pleasant and accurate but not exceptional, in short, not up to the overall idea. Furthermore, in the most agitated situations (and there are many) there are noticeable drops in the frame-rate. Another rather obvious defect, although disguised as a precise stylistic and atmospheric choice, is a decidedly annoying fogging effect, which prevents the player from planning his movements with precision without resorting to the well-kept maps. The rest is debatable, we are not faced with the usual manga-style aesthetic characterization: everything has a more realistic, more gothic and less fantasy flavor, even most of the enemies have a revolutionary aspect due to the name they bear (for example, the canonical Gargoyles are parallelepiped missile-shooting turrets with a pair of wings that allow you to fly) and recall the aforementioned Berserk for the visionary bizarreness of environments and characters. To accompany the rather contradictory technical aspect we have an impactful soundtrack, well done, suitable for the various game situations but unfortunately abused during the entire adventure, resulting in the end being repetitive. Nothing to say about the dubbing, really exceptional. It's hard to be critical of Drakengard. It's a type of game that you love or hate: fans of scrolling fighting games and raw action-games will love it, being extremely satisfied by the violent and infinite dose of fights and enemies to torment; others will find a repetitive yet characteristic game mechanic accompanied by a wonderfully dramatic and complex plot, worthy of a Square Enix in top form narratively speaking. However, the mediocrity of the technical realization is indisputable, which does not excel in any field while showing a considerable dose of potential. Although a mix of ideas already seen and games already tested, Drakengard still represents a good experiment, an excellent first step and, potentially, the first episode of a saga that can only get better. Recommended for lovers of the genre and well-told stories. If we exclude Kingdom Hearts, indeed more JRPG/Adventure than action-game, we easily realize that Square Enix does not enter the field of the second genre mentioned by The Bouncer that accompanied the launch of PlayStation2 more than two years ago. And The Bouncer was already a mediocre title, an exquisite graphic demo characterized by a flat and not at all original play system. Yet, Square Enix had once known how to blow a strong wind of innovation on the gaming market, with titles like Brave Fencer Musashi and Threads of Fate, at the time of PSOne, small jewels of Japanese action video games. In a certain sense, this Drakengard is not even so surprising, which winks at Panzer Dragoon precisely in the period in which Panzer Dragoon Orta enriches the XBox toy library. But Drakengard, originally titled Drag-on Dragoon in Japan, isn't just an imitation of Panzer Dragoon... actually it also has an aftertaste of Dynasty Warriors, the famous Koei action-game series set in medieval China. But then, what are we faced with? A clone? An uninspired title that fishes here and there in an attempt to mix multiple ideas in a cauldron that pretends to be new? Perhaps. But can this really be a defect?", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
