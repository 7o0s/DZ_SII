{"name": "Deception IV", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/134299-deception-iv-blood-ties-fascino-diabolico.html", "text": "Reading the comments from readers, it sometimes seems that the, uh, game critic (aka ~toy reviewer~, which we like best) is like a dream job that allows us to earn money by having fun and only playing games that we like, a bit as if the editorial staff of Multiplayer.it were a gigantic warehouse full of video games that we can choose how and when to review. Aside from the fact that reality is quite a bit different and is made up of tight deadlines, late night deliveries and inconceivable Rambo tie-ins, there are also those days when you've been impatiently waiting for a package from America for more than twenty days , which may by now have been lost forever in the abyss of our postal systems. The doorbell rings, it's the postman: excited as a schoolgirl, but decidedly less glamorous than Sean Connery, you run down the stairs, open the door and find yourself holding a package sent by the editorial staff. You're already shivering because you weren't expecting anything, and you know very well that when TanZeN sends you something without telling you, it's because it's a piece of cake. Open the package, you find yourself in your hands a copy of Deception IV. And you frown. Deception IV is a cruel and perverse title, but also intriguing and original: for sure, it's not for everyone Wicked are born You frown because you have no idea what Deception IV is all about. Yet there is a IV, I mean, it's not exactly the first in the series, is it? A tiring multimedia search (twenty seconds on Google) reveals that Deception IV is the western title of the new episode of Kagero, and at that point you begin to understand both what it is about and why TanZeN sent it to you treacherously. Deception or Kagero, in fact, is a series developed and published by Tecmo (today Tecmo Koei) which was born in the distant 1996 on PlayStation with the Japanese title Koumeikan, then Deception in the West, becoming fairly famous both with this last title but also with that of Kagero starting from the second episode. Yes, it's a bit confusing, but we only saw the last Deception in 2006, more than eight years ago. The common denominator of each episode, however, is the same: the player takes on the part of the villain - indeed, the villain, given that the protagonists are all women - and must eliminate in the cruellest and most cunning ways possible all the intruders who to break into his home and make an attempt on his life. If already the premise is not exactly the most exciting, it must be said that the plot does not develop even so well: in the case of Deception IV, in this case, we find ourselves impersonating Laegrinna, daughter of the devil committed to looking for the twelve sacred verses that they will allow his father to be brought back to life and the reign of darkness to begin. Three she-devils with rather sexy features help her in her enterprise: Caelea of ~refined death~, Veruza of ~sadistic torture~ and Lilia of ~humiliating death~. Names and affiliates that are a whole program, given that the gameplay is mainly based on the use of environmental traps and pitfalls whose types depend, in fact, on the sphere of competence of each of the three she-devils. The story counts up to a certain point: divided into twelve chapters, it will simply see us defend ourselves against one invasion after another of enemies who intend to save humanity by preventing us from resurrecting the devil. Almost no twists, characters with a flat characterization like a sheet of paper, sporadic and inconsistent dialogues, a skimpy ending that leaves the time it finds. However, increasingly sadistic and violent trap combos can be performed, which further confuses our moral balance as we enjoy slaughtering our enemies. Playstation 3 trophies With a total of 41 trophies, divided into 22 bronze, 15 silver and 3 gold, Deception IV is not exactly easy to ~platinize~. It will be necessary to complete the campaign, of course, but also the missions, the requests of the she-devils, as well as killing many enemies in the bloodiest ways possible. Jigsaw's favorite game Deception IV is essentially a third-person adventure, as this is how we will control Laegrinna in the airy three-dimensional environments, but it is also and above all a puzzle game in which we will have to get rid of the enemies by placing various traps and activating them in real time to achieve real strings of combos that can reset the vital energy of our attackers as quickly as possible. The latter will begin to attack us one at a time but soon we will have to eliminate several at the same time, until we fight with the tough boss on duty. Their IQ is insane: once you get a glimpseLaegrinna, the enemies will advance towards her without caring about anything else and ending up on our traps without realizing it. In short, the trick is to position Laegrinna so that the enemies, chasing her, walk on the traps that we will activate at the right moment. The problem, however, is that the enemies are not all the same. Some are armed with bows and crossbows and will target us from afar, so we'll have to hide so that they're forced to move to have us in their line of fire. Others are immune to this or that trap, forcing us to resort to different instruments of death: it is a gimmick that Tecmo Koei has thought up so that the player doesn't always get stuck on the same trap combo, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well since there are simple universal combos with which it is possible to exhaust even the most resistant enemies. Despite the variety of traps, in fact, at a certain point the player gets tired of experimenting above all because of the poor placement of the checkpoints and the poorly balanced difficulty which sometimes literally prevents us from getting up after being hit: Laegrinna's animations are deliberately slow, but Tecmo Koei seems to have inadvertently created too fast enemies who manage to abuse them. The campaign is quite short, but fortunately the game also offers a very long series of missions of increasing difficulty, designed precisely to let our sadistic imagination fly and experience all those traps that we may not have been able or wanted to use during the story chapters. There are really diabolical and bloody contraptions that alternate with other funny and witty pitfalls, but the result is always the same: blood, heartbreaking screams and mutilations. And yet there is a twisted fun in bouncing an enemy like a ping pong ball from a spring-loaded platform against a barbed wire wall and then dropping a chamber pot on his head, forcing him to ambulate at the exact spot where we'll swing a nice sharp axe. It will be the modest Japanese-style graphic design and the dubbing entirely in Japanese, but it is practically impossible to take Deception IV seriously and, perhaps, this is precisely its strong point.", "date": "2014-07-07", "grade": "7.0"}
