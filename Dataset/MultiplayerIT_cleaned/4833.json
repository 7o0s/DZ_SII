At the basis of the concept created by Maciej Strychalski and Sean Wright there are in fact a multitude of reference points ranging from the very first episodes of Grand Theft Auto to the old Bullfrog Syndicate, passing through another great classic of the 90s such as Cannon Fodder. In short, given the times we are talking about a fairly unusual operation, from which emerges a strong-willed action shooter with an isometric view that tries to enhance components such as strategic planning, camouflage and stealth action in the frame of a futuristic Tokyo with a cyberpunk flavor . Contrary to what one might expect in the light of the reference theme, Tokyo 42 manages to stand out especially for the particular graphic style and the lively chromatic tones with which the scenarios have been characterized: a quality that catches the eye already at first glance and which captures the observer's attention even before being in tune with the playful mechanics. The game is available starting today on PC (where we carried out our test) and Xbox One at a price of 19.99 euros, while the PlayStation 4 edition will arrive in July. A Tokyo with a cyberpunk aftertaste The plot of Tokyo 42 is little more than a pretext to kick off the theme that will be the leitmotif for the entire duration of the single player campaign, or the intentions of revenge. The anonymous protagonist of the adventure is spending a relaxing evening in his apartment when he suddenly discovers that he has been framed for a murder he never committed. The police are about to break into the building, but unexpectedly a mysterious ally takes the chestnuts out of the fire and warns him to flee. Persuaded to find out what is behind this shady affair, the player's alter ego is urged to transform himself into a lethal killer and make his way without many pleasantries to discover the truth. Thus begins a singular investigation that will involve organized crime in the Japanese metropolis, leading to the source from which it all began. The journey confronts the player with the need to manage multiple combat styles, favoring infiltration dynamics over head-on confrontation. Tokyo 42 rests its foundations on a sandbox structure full of buildings, bridges and squares placed on various levels. The verticality and the quantity of perspectives that can be selected with the simple rotation of the view are closely connected to the characteristics of the gameplay and allow you to vary your approach based on the situations that arise and the style you prefer. Moreover, during our definitive test, some impressions that we had already had the opportunity to grasp in our hands-on a few months ago were confirmed, namely that the structure of the maps does not offer great variety in terms of level design, focusing more on verticality than on diversification of places. Stealth and strategy The Tokyo 42 game system requires a minimum of assimilation before being mastered properly. It is necessary to enter the order of ideas of favoring the attack from a distance and the escape, or vice versa leaning towards the stealthy style, since the frontal clash with the white weapon leads in the majority of cases to a rapid capitulation. The most delicate aspect concerns the perspective, given that it is possible to rotate the isometric view at will to enjoy radically different points of view and paths or portions of buildings that would be precluded with a static shot. By opting for the stealth mechanics it becomes necessary to crouch behind the corners of the scenario, taking care to escape the visual cones of the enemies alerted by any suspicious movement. If you intend to go unnoticed, all you have to do is unleash your trusty katana, but this does not prevent the use of firearms, starting with the sniper rifle through which it is possible to strike from a distance with less risk of be identified immediately. Conversely, there is no shortage of classic pistols, assault rifles or grenades, which however must always be sipped in relation to the context and one's strategic position. It will rarely be possible to get the upper hand in a multiple firefight from close range, also due to a deliberately laborious and not particularly precise aiming system. And it is properio for this reason that Tokyo 42 manages to involve and tease the player's attention, stimulating him to understand the most suitable approach in every situation. In this sense, the binoculars are very useful, which once activated allow you to scrutinize larger portions of the map to get a general idea of the positioning of the enemies and the paths available to you. A further variable is linked to the ability to change the appearance of one's alter ego if one is discovered, provided that the appropriate indicator that regulates its use is charged. In the continuation of the campaign, however, it will also be possible to obtain more specific disguises to be exploited to overcome enemy security lines without being identified. Overall Tokyo 42 offers a fair number of main missions but also various secondary activities that must be completed to forfeit reputation and continue the story. It must be said, however, that the aforementioned assignments do not present great variations on the theme, mostly providing for the killing of specific targets or the elimination of entire fringes of organized crime. To support the offline campaign there is also a limited multiplayer mode, which allows you to challenge other users through deathmatches. In these situations it is necessary to identify the position of the enemy to take him out before he gets the upper hand. Logically, mimicry assumes a central role, so much so that if you are identified it is essential to change your appearance to try to lose track of yourself again. Unfortunately on this front we are not able to tell you much more because during our test it was not possible for us to challenge other players.", "date": "2017-05-31", "grade": "8.0"}
