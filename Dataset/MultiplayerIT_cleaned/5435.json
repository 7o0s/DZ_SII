There is nothing strange, given that the very first Star Ocean, born in 1996, was born from a rib of Tales of Phantasia after part of the staff - including screenwriter Yoshiharu Gotanda - had left Namco to found tri-Ace. Unlike Tales, however, the Star Ocean brand has never really broken through, so much so that only five chapters and one spin-off have followed one another over the last twenty years. Despite the title, the series has never particularly shone, but has still been able to conquer a concrete niche of fans thanks to its science-fantasy elements which at times are very reminiscent of Star Wars. The last chapters, however, were rather disappointing especially in terms of sales, and it seemed that after Star Ocean: The Last Hope we had reached an impasse. Square Enix, however, wanted to give tri-Ace another chance, but the result is a title that is at times clearly low budget that will put even the most ardent supporter of the brand and of JRPGs in general into a crisis. The fifth Star Ocean is a manual on how not to revitalize an old franchise in crisis The stars are many Anyone who knows Star Ocean probably knows that they shouldn't expect who knows what sparks in narrative terms. The series has never offered particularly memorable plots, and the third episode, Till the End of Time, is famous - indeed, infamous - for its brave but questionable twists. The problem has never been the script of Star Ocean, in reality, as much as the characterization of the protagonists who only in rare cases distanced themselves from the most common stereotypes of Japanese animation. Integrity and Faithlessness is just one of those cases. The cast proposed in this fifth Star Ocean - a prequel that anyone can approach, thanks to the marginal connections with the rest of the series - is of a completely different level compared to the frankly unbearable one of The Last Hope: apart from the somewhat anonymous protagonist Fidel Camuze, we particularly appreciated the characterization of the sexy Fiore who, despite her clothing - or the almost total lack of it... - is treated by the supporting actors as a real scholar, sparing us easy gags of an erotic nature, but also those of Emerson and Anne, the two foreigners who will join the group in the most important moment of the adventure. However, for a game called Star Ocean, there are too few stars. It all begins on the primitive planet of Faykreed, where Fidel finds himself reluctantly taking the place of his father and protecting the village from a band of brigands. His mission will take a sudden turn when, in the company of his childhood friend Miki, he will witness the crash landing of a spaceship: the story becomes the triumph of the clich at the exact moment in which the two heroes come across Riala, a little girl with incredible powers who - coincidentally! - lost his memory. The search for his family will lead the trio to make new friends, fight in wars and discover that they are not alone in the universe and that, in fact, extraterrestrial visitors are poking their noses into Faykreed's affairs. The problem, mind you, is not the script. Integrity and Faithlessness is a story we've seen over and over, but it's no less compelling, especially when it finally catches on about five or six hours into the game - the problem is that we're already a third of its length by then . By completing the minimum wage of sidequests and playing at the standard level, the new Star Ocean ends in about twenty hours, something more if you want to sift through every secret hidden in the game. And this too, mind you, wouldn't be a big problem if the story, short as it is, had a sustained pace. Integrity and Faithlessness instead forces us to endless backtracking sequences in a handful of maps that are often too linear to witness long dialogues without bite. The fault is also and above all of the almost completely absent direction. The ~cinematic~ cutscenes can be counted on the fingers of one hand; the rest of the interactions between the characters take place in real time, without dynamic shots to emphasize them. The player is almost always free to move during the dialogues and rotate the camera at will, while the characters discuss the current crisis. The epic can only go to fry if we fail to see the expressions and mimicry of the protagonists or if we decide to discuss the possible end of the world lessthree we circle around a table or put ourselves in detention at the corner. The idea of tri-Ace was to grant the player the freedom to act even during cutscenes, forging the illusion of continuous and engaging gameplay, but that same illusion inevitably breaks every time you crash into the red lines boundaries that prevent us from straying too far from conversations, trapping us in what actually seems like a parody of that much-vaunted freedom. Playstation 4 trophies Star Ocean: The Last Hope is famous for being one of the hardest JRPGs to platinum, but Integrity and Faithlessness is another story: unlocking 22 bronze, 16 silver and 2 gold trophies won't be a particularly difficult task. difficult, but it will still require a little patience and a good skill especially in combat. Scissors, paper and stone Although spaceships criss-cross the sky, bringing trouble from distant planets, Integrity and Faithlessness travels on foot most of the time. tri-Ace has chosen an approach similar to that of Final Fantasy XIII and the latest Tales, in which Faykreed's cities are separated by maps full of monsters to fight. Unfortunately the notorious ~fast travel~ is unlocked only after several hours of play, while the needs of the plot impose an almost continuous coming and going that becomes repetitive all too soon due to the linearity of the paths that offer at most a few crossroads. If the script has never been the strong point of Star Ocean, we could do a completely different matter for the combat system which, in every episode of the saga, has always been the funnest part of the experience. Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness seems to promise a worthy mix of chaotic and technicality in the first minutes of the game, illustrating the very particular Chinese morra on which each engagement is based. Weak hits interrupt Charged Attacks that break through the parry that completely mitigates the damage of weak hits - simple, clear. Each fight then becomes a preventive interpretation of the animations, in which to mix side dodges and special moves that we can associate with two keys on the joypad and which change according to our distance from the target. And here falls the donkey. First, the new Star Ocean struggles to maintain a constant 60 frames per second during the most pyrotechnic fights - but also in calmer situations, as we will see later - also because what should have been its strong point represents its greatest weakness: all the heroes who join Fidel's cause can take part in each fight, for a total of seven fighters against an equal or greater number of enemies. It's chaos: the camera dancer can't hold steady on our goal and the riot of special effects that fills the screen often prevents us from interpreting the behavior of the enemies in time. We therefore end up resorting to almost completely random combos, discovering their limited and repetitive range that pales in comparison with the virtuosity of combat systems such as Tales of Graces f or Tales of Xillia 2. Ironically, the player's performances load an indicator that allows you to throw super powerful chain shots, but his mistakes in battle have exactly the opposite effect: it goes without saying that you end up saving Rush attacks until the bosses or more demanding encounters, such as the frustrating fights in which you have to protect certain characters they become the favorite targets of enemies, able to defeat them in a couple of hits if you rely on the limited artificial intelligence that controls the other six party members. The so-called ~roles~ are of little use, bonuses that we can unlock and assign to group members at will, determining their attitude in battle: despite the variety of roles, we did not notice major behavioral differences, and at each challenging battle we were forced to manually switch characters to manage their actions. In this sense, the learning system of special attacks does not contribute either. Each character can learn several special attacks and enhance them as well, modifying their effectiveness and cost, but each learning or enhancement is paid in tomes and the latter are extremely rare. Consequently, we end up keeping them waiting for better times, consuming them only to unlock the skills of the characters most useful for the clashes: therefore Miki fills up with healing spells while Fiore, who shares the same tomes, is reduced to a handful of attack spells. The fact that our Fidel only learned three special attacks after nearly ten hours of play has usfrankly left a bad taste in the mouth, limiting the potential of a combat system that was fun at first but extremely repetitive and confusing in the more advanced stages of the adventure. The beauty of women As we said, the story of Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is not particularly long, but the ~completists~ will spend several hours accepting and delivering the secondary missions proposed on the boards present in some cities. They're rather generic sidequests, actually, that push you to kill a certain number of enemies or collect a certain amount of items, and which add absolutely nothing to the plot but reward the player with tomes for special abilities, items and other goodies. In this sense, Integrity and Faithlessness relies on a decidedly vast object creation system, which in turn depends on the specialties, practically the professions and talents that the party can learn and which ranges from alchemy to cooking passing from the ability to see chests or rally points on the mini-map. The specialties are many, but once again the progression locks them behind most of the secondary missions, depriving anyone who does not have the desire or the patience to go hunting for enemies in the already explored areas of this component. Once again, tri-Ace failed to balance the various aspects of the game, suggesting that many ideas were implemented a bit haphazardly and without a clear direction. Which doesn't surprise us too much, since Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness was conceived on PlayStation 3 and then ported to PlayStation 4. The next-gen version was the only one to arrive in the West, but despite the higher definition of texture and the frame rate at 60 frames (not too constant, especially in the city and with the party in tow) which we mentioned before, the original DNA of the game is often noticed. The polygonal models of the main characters are intricate, well animated and full of details, but the same cannot be said of the enemies and supporting characters; moreover, it has a certain effect to discover that changing equipment does not visually affect the appearance of our heroes, not even at the level of individual weapons. It doesn't seem right to penalize Integrity and Faithlessness for its old-gen nature, and anyone who decides to buy it should accept that it is a technically somewhat backward product, reinforced however by a first-rate, careful and imaginative artistic direction. In this sense, we can only close the review by praising the soundtrack of the always excellent Motoi Sakuraba who, after Tales of Zestiria, has definitely enriched another JRPG a little more unfortunate than its predecessors in the space of a year.", "date": "2016-07-04", "grade": "6.0"}
