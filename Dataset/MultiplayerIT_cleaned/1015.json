{"name": "Blood Will Tell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blood-will-tell.html", "text": "The game Based on the manga ~Dororo~, by the master Osamu Tezuka, Blood Will Tell is one of the numerous Sega titles for 2005. The structure of the game is very, very similar to that designed for another tie-in, in this case a few years old ago: Sword of the Berserk. As in the title developed by Yuke's, in fact, the action is often interspersed with animated sequences that explain an interesting and current plot, despite having been conceived in 1967. In the role of Hyakkimaru, we will have to face an enormous number of spirits and monsters, up to periodic clash with one of the forty-eight demons. Winning the fight will mean getting back one of the stolen parts, and it is no coincidence that we will start with the eyes: the game begins in black and white, and will become color as soon as you regain ~natural~ vision. The character has a vast repertoire of slashes at his disposal, to which are added the moves available when the arms are ~shot away~ to release the blades, the machine gun and the cannon placed in the legs. These last two weapons obviously have counted shots, actually too much. In general, to tell the truth, there is a lot of abundance but little substance: using Hyakkimaru's moves and weapons isn't as fun as one would expect, perhaps because the action is never frenetic that much, perhaps because of the mediocre control system (especially view management). There is indeed an abundance of enemies, from level to level, and the graphic design of the bosses is very good. The ~kill all monsters and then fight the boss~ pattern only varies when momentarily taking control of Dororo, with a slight change in the tasks at hand. Otherwise, the boy moves alongside Hyakkimaru and you can decide what to make him do between four possible actions: stay close to us, fight, collect or search for objects. The technical realization Blood Will Tell boasts good graphics: the characters are very well drawn and the textures give the surfaces a certain believability. However, everything is driven by an engine that is not always up to par, which gives way to noticeable slowdowns when the screen becomes ~crowded~. The sound sector has something less and not more: the effects are good, while the music is almost always absent. The level of recitation of the dialogues (in English, subtitled in Italian) is average for the genre, therefore rather low. You can control Hyakkimaru (and, when it happens, Dororo) through the use of the left analog stick, while the pad buttons are deputies for attack, jump and action. The view is managed by pressing one of the back buttons: pressing it centers it, keeping it pressed maintains the ~verse~; while the right analog stick is only used to enter a sort of first person mode, completely useless for the purposes of the game. This unusual way of managing the virtual camera proves to be extremely annoying during the fights, which become cumbersome and therefore the opposite of what they should be: pure action and fun. It is not clear why the developers have not opted for a classic view managed by the right stick, assigning different functions to the back buttons such as, for example, the quick shot (which instead is activated by pressing the left stick on its axis ). Comment Blood Will Tell is a half-successful game, sadly. On the one hand, it tells a good story in a convincing way, thanks to the extensive use of animated sequences and a good technical realization; on the other, he fails to exploit the enormous potential of Hyakkimaru's character, locking up his numerous abilities in an oppressive cage made up of situations that are too similar to each other, cumbersome movements and clashes affected by an absurd use of the view. The new Sega title can certainly be a good choice if you are looking for an action game without particular pretensions, but it is undoubtedly a pity that the ideas available have not been exploited as they should in ~practice~. Pros: Engaging and well-told plot Good technical realization Huge arsenal Cons: Badly used weapons and powers Repetitive Mediocre camera management Kagemitsu Daigo will become the father of the ~son of light~, the one who will have the power to cast out demons. And the demons can't allow this: they corrupt Daigo, promise him the power to conquer the whole of Japan and in exchange they ask for his son, who is yet to be born, as a sacrifice. The man accepts, and forty-eight parts are taken from the child, stolen by as many monsters. In those conditions he is abandoned on the course of a river and picked up by a man of science, who decides to help him and keep him alive. When he realizes that the child, despite the impairments, manages to forperceive the environment that surrounds it and to communicate telepathically, understands that it is a creature destined for great things. And so, a few years later, he operates it: using all his knowledge, he returns to Hyakkimaru at least a semblance of normality. When he realizes that something about the boy attracts demons, he decides to operate on him again to equip him with a series of weapons: blades and machine guns in his arms, cannons in his legs. Hyakkimaru then leaves on a journey that will lead him to face the forty-eight demons that have marked his life, to take back what has been taken from him. When she meets Dororo, a young petty thief, she decides to continue her adventure with him", "date": "2005-03-07", "grade": null}
