{"name": "Winning Eleven 8 Liveware Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-8-liveware-evolution.html", "text": "As far as the game modes are concerned, which can be reached from a very beautiful and functional main screen, we are faced with the usual ones already seen and appreciated in WE8, and which range from the canonical Friendly to the Cup and League modes (customized or official), from the Master League with the traditional points training, to close this time with the long-awaited mode for online play which we will discuss later in the review. The changes, as always happens for this sort of ~expansion~ of the version released in the summer, are apparently few, at least at first glance. But once you take the field, the real and only testing ground for any self-respecting football game, Konami immediately gives the usual pure class lesson to the competition. The choice made in recent years by KTYO is now well known, beyond the acquisition of official licenses and the like, however, playability is preferred over anything else. Without paying too much attention to the typical graphic trappings of EA, the Japanese softo prefers to get straight to the point, giving the user what the user expects from a football game: realistic gameplay. And here, for a change, we are witnessing, for the umpteenth time (but will they ever cease to amaze us?) an improvement of what seemed perfect until yesterday. Even in this circumstance, as I was able to write for WE8, the gameplay borders on perfection, aware however of being denied, happily, at the release of WE9. The physics of the impacts and the ball, the passes, the animations, the long shots, the tackles, the general AI, the feints, the high cuts and the insertions of full-backs, wingers and forwards, everything has been ~evolved~ in the true sense of the word. And above all the annoying slowdowns seen in WE8 are practically absent. Kick Off! The action, the technical dynamics of the game develop in a much more reasoned, less frenetic way than in the previous chapter, which will please all those who appreciated this game mechanic in the recent J-League WE8. In fact, for the most demanding purists, it represents a welcome novelty. The slower game pace, in fact, guarantees a more sophisticated approach to the match, and greater planning of the schemes to be adopted. Especially if we consider that the improved AI of companions and opponents, once again as mentioned, increased upwards, will really be able to emulate the deeds of our real heroes on the field and consequently will also offer players a hard time more experienced. Thanks to these more ~evolved~ characteristics, it is appropriate to say, the players controlled by the game follow the schemes more carefully, applying themselves to the maximum in every action, carrying out movements without the ball based more on logic than on randomness and following finally more sensible on the part of the CPU, able to manage the match especially in certain situations such as an advantage acquired or a goal conceded. In fact, each team, depending on its technical skills and the schemes adopted, seriously acts differently to the events that take place during the race. Finally online, but not for everyone Winning Eleven 8: Liveware Evolution also improves the various online features, and could not be otherwise, already present in the previous episode, enhancing the system for network game support. In addition to the confirmed full compatibility with the PSBB Unit, the network service offered by the Konami title allows not only to update the rosters of all the teams, including the schemes, as it was already possible to do in the recent past, but also to add new features, such as the ability to create your own dream team or to further customize your favorites with new haircuts or gadgets. There are also several special options for online play, including national divisions and leagues and a special Konami cup, as well as the coveted dream of millions of fans: online games. Gamers who own the Network Adapter can finally try their hand at exciting challenges on the web with human opponents from all over the nation (at the moment this seems to work only for Japanese users, Westerners who rely on the import market seem unable to exploit this possibility), and the results will be visible in a specially created ranking on the web. In this sense, the service allows you to manage a chat and a friend list through a comfortable client where you can save the list of your favorite friends or challengers. Too bad Konami charges a separate fee to pay for online play through Sony Feega's payment service. Finally, I would like to point out an unusual presence: that of a specific stadiumly selectable for matches via the web, which is none other than the Euganeo di Padova! An A.I. creepy The CPU is more aggressive and attentive than ever (who has attended a course in Coverciano?) and will take advantage of any situation to beat you. Perhaps enhancing, where the application of the schemes is not enough, the specific ability of some champions such as Ronaldinho or Zidane, perhaps enhancing the personal action of the individual, the effective play to resolve the match in one's favor. The enhanced artificial intelligence of the players controlled by the system can also be seen in the defensive phase, a bit of the Achilles heel of the previous incarnation of WE, where we can now see certain blunders seen in the past, on the other hand, in more convincing movements from part of our defenders, much more careful and quick to move and close than the static ~bulwarks~ of WE8. From all this, I repeat, a more fluid but slow, reasoned gameplay follows. More beautiful. Visually and not only, I am also referring to the audio aspect, the match event is presented in an even more realistic way than in WE8, with the further addition of animated interludes during the match, such as the desperation of a defender who has just been sent off (a by the way, both the referees and the offside detection system have been significantly improved) or the unbridled exultation at an important goal and the re-proposition by the KTYO boys of chants that partially bring to mind the splendid ones of the unrepeatable Winning Eleven 6, at least for the national teams since for the club teams, especially ours, the chants of the fans are more like wails than the cheers of 70,000 unleashed ultras Conclusions It is becoming more and more difficult for the editor to cast votes for Winning Eleven. With each episode, the previous vote risks becoming null, and considering that on average the Konami title always receives a nice full 9, perhaps the time has come for us poor reviewers to invent a new parameter of judgment specifically for this saga. Extremely playable, realistic, rewarding, there are no words to describe the beauty of this Liveware Evolution. The absolute sensation of control over the players, the schemes and strategies of one's team, the feeling of being an active part of a ~real~ match make this game yet another KTYO masterpiece, the nonplusultra of football simulations. In short, the years go by, but Konami never ceases to amaze us, positively. Pros: Stellar gameplay. A.I. to levels never seen in the past. Commentary also available in Italian. Cons: Texts and players names in Japanese. Online game for Japanese users only. Causes addiction. It has only been released in Japan for a few weeks and yet, for a change, the Winning Eleven series has already managed to place another of its ~episodes~, Liveware Evolution, until recently in first place in the ranking of best-selling games in the Country of the Rising Sun, therefore appearing as one of the great successes of the current videogame season. By now it is universally known how the Winning Eleven series is unique and inimitable, and how it appears more and more similar to good wine: the more the years go by, the more it ages, the more good and valuable it becomes. It is probably for this reason that EA, realizing the impossibility of, I don't say emulate, but at least approach such a masterpiece, have now come to terms with it and have decided to stop aping the KTYO masterpiece and trying instead to enhance as much as possible the arcade style of their football saga. But no more talk and let's focus on this latest chapter of the most loved football saga ever. Let's start immediately by saying that of the much vaunted new licenses for the championships and teams discovered by all forms of officials, i.e. Bundesliga, Premier League and Ligue 1, there is not even a shadow, but all in all it was quite conceivable knowing ~Seabass  and associates, who tend to be unwilling to offer everything immediately, and indeed able to grant us the juiciest novelties only in small doses. The new licenses will certainly appear in WE9, the last chapter of the saga for Ps2 arriving in August. In this LE we will have to ~make do~ with the previous ones (Serie A, Liga and Dutch Eredivisie), with the increase in the number of teams in the Italian League from 18 to 20 clubs, which translated into a nutshell means official jerseys and rosters also for teams like Palermo, Messina and the other newly promoted, and a very strong increase in the number of real faces of the most important players. Among the new ones, I would like to point out, among others, the players of the Portuguese national team Maniche, Ricardo Carvalho and P. Ferreira and our De Rossi, Toni, Oddo, Gilardino, while the ~old~,that is, the various Del Piero or Totti have been retouched and significantly improved (but they were already perfect). All updated to the current season (excluding the January transfer market, so use the internal Editor for recent transfers).", "date": "2005-04-22", "grade": null}
