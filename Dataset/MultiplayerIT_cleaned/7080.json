Its creators, who are the same as the underrated NieR, have made it unique in some ways, above all because of provocative plots that mix, sometimes in an extreme way, adult themes, stories of violence and sex, but also a lot of irony. In this sense, as an example, just think of the fact that Furiae, the little sister of the protagonist Caim in the first game, was in love with his brother, or that other characters, such as Leonard and Arioch, were respectively a pedophile and a devourer of children. The particularity of the events, therefore, combined with a gameplay that is sometimes repetitive but also fun in some passages, meant that the first two episodes earned a fair number of fans in our area too, and pushed the developers to continue on that path creating a third chapter that was released on the Italian market just in recent days. Drakengard 3 is available exclusively in digital form on the PlayStation Store, with a standard edition priced at 49.99, and a limited edition collector's edition at 69.99. This special version includes a download code for the game, the ~Novella~ volume, a CD with a selection of songs from the soundtrack, a double-sided poster and four extra contents, namely a Caim-inspired outfit, a level add-on featuring One, Zero's sister, the ~Giant Baby~ hat and the Japanese dub of the game (10GB of free space required), all collected in a special box set. This means that those of our readers who love to collect games on disc media will have to turn to the North American and Canadian markets, where the title is available in physical format. Drakengard 3 is the new chapter of the irreverent action RPG series created by Cavia Not a real sequel Drakengard 3, behind which there are always the director Yoko Taro and other former members of the defunct Cavia team, now merged with Access Games, despite the number included in the title, is not a real sequel to the second episode (the one actually it was originally what later turned into NieR), but a prequel to the first, as it is set in an unspecified era prior to the adventure of Caim and his dragon Angelus. The plot, which is undeniably one of the strengths of the saga, at least for those who appreciate the unconventional style for the genre, therefore narrates a medieval world governed by the Intoners, six sisters capable of unleashing powerful spells by singing magical melodies, and sees an all-female cast of protagonists. Thanks to their extraordinary powers, the sorceresses managed to restore peace to the world, with One, the second of the sisters, proclaimed queen and guide of all the Intoners. But the newfound harmony is endangered when Zero, the eldest, in whose right eye a flower has blossomed that has extended her life giving her a special body, tries to exterminate the others with the help of Mikhail, a huge dragon with the mind of an eight year old. Thus begins a long adventure that between bloody fights, gags and often hilarious moments will lead players into a truly unusual fantasy world. In fact, the six sisters have a certain sexual appetite, and as tradition for the works of Yoko Taro and associates, the game will not lack moments characterized by disrespectful and hot dialogues, and censored sequences. Just think of the topics that can be discussed with characters like Five, a divinity without inhibitions who loves to tell people about her nocturnal adventures, who makes ambiguous jokes and who will eventually reveal a twisted passion for her sister Zero, or like Four, the shyer than the goddesses with self-esteem issues and therefore the only one of them still a virgin. It's just a pity that some subtleties of the plot or of certain jokes could escape those who do not know the English language well, since there are no Italian subtitles in the game. In any case, closing the story topic and going on to analyze the gameplay, let's say immediately that Drakengard 3 does not deviate so much from the original formula, re-proposing the combination formed by the dragon and its knight who opposes entire enemy armies alone. In fact, the gameplay is divided as a tradition of the saga essentially into two phases, one on foot and one in flight, even if this time the game sessions appear a little more cohesive with each other. Combat takes place in real-time and dynamically, with the player in control of the mighty Zero jumping, dodging and slashing at opponents like a classic hack and slash game with a light RPG twist. But whilefighting furiously, the goddess can take advantage of a weapon swap system that allows her to swap one of the four currently equipped on the fly, without interrupting the offensive, so that she can launch consecutive blows and very powerful combos. The change of weapons, which in total during the adventure are about sixty and which can be upgraded using money and basic materials, takes place with the simple pressure of one of the lower back keys of the pad, and the thing is important to properly exploit the peculiarities of each according to the weaknesses of the opponents. Which to tell the truth do not constitute an excessively high challenge for the player, resulting more than anything else cannon fodder. At least for the troops, given that the bosses are more difficult to kill and make the clashes more pleasant. Furthermore, as Zero kills her enemies in a blaze of blood, a special energy bar fills up to allow her to enter Intoner mode, a critical phase where she can launch a sequence of attacks of unprecedented violence. Playstation 3 trophies Drakengard 3 gives away forty-seven trophies, of which 34 are bronze, 9 silver, 3 gold and 1 platinum. To obtain them you have to satisfy some requests of increasing difficulty, such as collecting five weapons or opening fifty chests, gradually up to the most difficult ones, such as eliminating a thousand enemies during the adventure or bringing each weapon to the maximum upgrade level, to then reach the coveted platinum. Swords and dragons In case of need, Zero can also rely on Mikhail. The dragon can in fact be ridden by the protagonist even on the ground, and attack both from there and from the sky: in the first case he can use his fangs to bite his opponents, or his fiery breath to burn them, while getting up in flight he can always incinerate them with the same method, or crush enemy soldiers with your own weight by diving into them. Described in this way everything may seem beautiful and fun, but in reality Drakengard 3, as well as the titles of the series that preceded it, suffers from a certain underlying repetitiveness which in the long run can bore non-fans. The game is characterized in this sense by an extreme linearity in the missions, which certainly also contributes to an uninspired level design in terms of variety. Even the secondary quests, perhaps useful for obtaining money or materials, as well as for trying to break the rhythm of the main one and increase longevity, are boring after a while. In any case, each of these assignments has its own time limit within which to complete a series of objectives, and has particular requirements that force the player to change his style of play from time to time, because he may be forced to fight using only one sword or to do without certain moves, or because he has to find specific objects and enemies or break into chests. As if that weren't enough, to the problems mentioned above there are also annoying slowdowns during any moment of the game due to a dancer framerate, and a camera not always positioned properly during battles. Still on the subject of defects, but moving on to the aesthetic part, Drakengard 3 unfortunately takes steps backwards compared to the aforementioned NieR (being the previous Drakengards released on PlayStation 2, let's take him as a reference for a comparison). Graphically, a certain paucity in terms of detail both in terms of texture and color palette is evident, especially for the environments (which already in Cavia's last adventure did not make one cry for a miracle), while the models of the characters are of decent workmanship main ones, which boast a good character design, and which differ from the secondary ones for greater attention to detail. As for the audio part, however, the opposite is true: here we found the English dubbing excellent (the Japanese one is available separately, as mentioned at the beginning), while the soundtrack turned out to be varied and well made, resulting , thanks also to some unforgettable songs, as one of the best things done in the whole game.", "date": "2014-06-04", "grade": "6.3"}
