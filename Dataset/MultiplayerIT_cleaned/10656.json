{"name": "Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-recensione.html", "text": "That of fighting games is already by its nature a minefield to slip into when you are a young development team with high hopes. It is, after all, a genre where the ~easy money~ is not contemplated and you have to deal respectively with an often very vocal hardcore fanbase, complex mechanics hand in glove with a myriad of data and calculations and a rather saturated market where there is no shortage the supporting columns. To offer something that has never been made, therefore, is in itself a feat bordering on despair and when one tries to abandon the typical complexity of these titles in favor of more accessible systems, the general response is a loss of interest both from newbies to the genre as well as the veterans of the community. In this obstacle course, however, there is a single name that has been able to avoid practically every danger with a grace unattainable by all the others: Smash Bros., a series so stratified to be today both the most played by casual users and one of the most supported by expert gamers. Over the years, the Sakurai saga has managed to renew and improve constantly, up to that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate which to date most likely has the best roster ever seen in a fighting game (recently completed with the arrival of Sora ). Yet even in this absolute state of grace, a stain remains: the latest Smash has an atrocious netcode, which makes it extremely difficult to play online with serenity, much less organize remote competitive events in the problematic Covid era. A window to a knockoff with its own personality, therefore, exists outside of simple non-exclusivity and Fair Play Labs, accompanied by Ludosity, have decided to seize the opportunity by creating Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl: a ~clone of smash~ with netcode rollback (and therefore should be infinitely more stable on the net), focused on the competitive and strengthened by some of the most iconic characters in cartoon history. The validity of the combat system, however, largely rests on the Ludosity, given that it is a group of developers (always fans of the Sakurai series) with already active Slap City, another similar title. As we will see in the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl review, they are much more solid than average premises to rely on. Gameplay: Smash but not too much Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl: a very graceful Patrick Ludosity's passion for the title that inspires everything immediately becomes crystal clear as soon as you get your hands on one of the twenty characters available on the roster. Although, in fact, they are faces very different from those of the Nintendo fighting game - including Spongebob and Patrick, a couple of Ninja Turtles, Danny Phantom, Ren and Stimpy, and many others - their sets of moves are often partially borrowed from those of Sakurai's work. Let me be clear, we are not talking about a carbon copy and it is not easy to invent completely original moves in a similar title, but most of the characters remain reworkings of fighters already seen, albeit modified so as to be unique compared to their ~Nintendian~ counterparts ~. Things start to change seriously when you go into more detail about the combat system, because - while relying on fundamentals almost identical to those of Smash Ultimate, including percentages instead of life points that indicate your ease of ~launching~ out of the screen and three lives per character - Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl features some distinctive mechanics that completely change the approach to combat. Let's start, for example, from movement, given that in All Star Brawl it is not possible to perform quick dodges during the parade. However, using the guard key in the air allows you to sprint in the chosen direction and the presence of the double jump makes the basic aerial mobility higher than that of Smash. The absence of dodges on the ground, however, does not mean that there are no advanced options of this type: simultaneously pressing the jump and block while moving allows you to perform the so-called wave dash with some ease, a constant rapid movement that it is practically mandatory to master against experienced players. What's more, if you dash straight down into the air you land with much faster speed than normal air movement, you can ~lock~ your character's direction so you can seamlessly continue the offensive as you move away from the enemy, and There is also a short jump here if you briefly press the jump button. Yes, in short, as you can see the game is only apparently basic and we have abarely started. Amazon offer Nickelodeon All Star Brawl - Playstation 5 49.99 See Offer The absence of dodges, in fact, has modified the aforementioned guard, which is not consumed if hit several times, but leads to a stun if you are hit parrying at the edge of the arena (which risks making you immediately lose one of the three lives ). Instant parries or pressing in the direction against enemy attacks are more effective, and doing both with perfect timing results in executing a perfect guard that leaves you with the advantage for a counterattack. Still speaking of defensive options, then, it is even possible to send projectiles back to the sender with attacks, or even use a grapple to transform them into throwable objects (every time they are repelled they speed up). Attacks have undergone similar changes: here there are no chargeable smash shots, but rather slow heavy attacks that work on a rock, paper, scissors system where one direction beats the other when used simultaneously. Normal strikes instead work in a similar way to the ~tilts~ of the Nintendo game, while the special moves are practically identical in functionality, with the upward ones also representing the best recovery moves in order not to end up out of the arena. All in all? It's a great system, much more technical than we expected, and extremely fun. The greater emphasis on combos (which are also easier to execute) makes everything more frenetic, and it is evident how someone already well trained with the Smash system can convert his skills with great ease into the competitive Nickelodeon All-Star. Let me be clear, overall we find everything a little less intuitive and refined than Smash, but if we consider the level of the original game, what has been achieved by the developers remains absolutely praiseworthy. Contents: after the online void Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl: Four-Way Matches are chaotic but hilarious Seen in this way, the work of Fair Play Labs and Lodosity would seem to have all the credentials to deal with some of the most famous fighting games in circulation and not only with the other ~Smash clones~. However, if we analyze the production values of the game and its contents, the building begins to show some cracks. After all, we are talking about a title developed with rather limited resources and time, in which the central focus of the developers was clearly (and slyly) the gameplay. All the rest is therefore skin and bones, with meager methods and no particular attractions and an online designed exclusively for maximum functionality at the expense of the variety of options. Nickelodeon Brawl therefore offers training with weak customization options (but, curiously, the ability to advance moves frame by frame and view hitboxes), a still-image tutorial, a negligible arcade mode against artificial intelligence and devoid of narrative, a timed mode, and a truly chaotic Sports mode designed for more casual players, where to win you need to throw a ball (there are various types) into the center of two star targets. We found the latter a quite amusing extra in its delirium, but it will hardly be taken into consideration by the community. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl: Bikini Bottom is always an atmospheric arena The same online is somewhat limited: it is possible to create lobbies, or select between ranked and quick matches, yet the matchmaking is not particularly tweakable (albeit fast), and it can happen to find matches with serious connection problems. If nothing else, the netcode seemed to hold up just fine: after the first few days of clogged servers and various crashes, things quickly stabilized and now most games run without problems or latency (apart from the rare freezes). Excellent, and we are head and shoulders above the online Smash Ultimate, albeit with the need for a few more options. Even from a technical point of view, the game does not impress either for the quality of the three-dimensional models or for the arenas. The charisma of many of the fighters therefore saves the shack, as well as a decent variety of scenarios in which to fight (including even some atrocious paintings that are practically the equivalent of the worst arenas in Smash, for example a really unnecessary imitation of Pokfloats ...). Considering the resources behind the software houses involved, however, we do not believe it is the case to complain in front of a solid work in this field.", "date": "2021-10-08", "grade": "7.0"}
