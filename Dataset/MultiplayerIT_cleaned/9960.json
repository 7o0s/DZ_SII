{"name": "Iron Man 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77983-iron-man-2-una-corazza-anche-su-wii.html", "text": "Tested version: Nintendo WiiWith the ~broken promise~ represented by The Conduit and the discreet Tournament of Legends in the archives, High Voltage Software is dedicated to developing the Wii version of Iron Man 2 starting practically from scratch and ignoring, fortunately for us, the tie -in of the first film ever for the Nintendo platform. What comes out is not a masterpiece, mind you, but it is in any case a title that has its own reason, able to put the player in front of quite demanding challenges and insert into the plot (which has nothing to see with the film or with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game) characters such as the Crimson Dynamo, Mauler, the Black Widow and even Firepower, who fans of the Marvel superhero will remember for being the one who defeated Tony Stark when he wore the Silver Centurion armor. In the first place, it was decided to clearly separate the sections on the ground from those in flight, the latter limited to specific stages in which, moreover, we cannot control the path but only move the character (or possibly accelerate his pace) on the screen because can avoid enemy fire and attack in turn. The action in Iron Man 2 therefore takes place mainly on the ground, with the Wii-mote which allows us to control an on-screen viewfinder and the A and B buttons respectively for activating the main and secondary weapons, both selectable by pressing on the d-pad. The single repulsor beam can therefore be replaced by the one carried with both hands, by a short-range ~explosive~ version or by a persistent laser, while as regards the secondary weapon we have the small homing missiles fired from the shoulders, the much more powerful rockets that start from the forearm and the inevitable uniray that is released directly from the Arc reactor. Password: unstoppable In this second tie-in, Iron Man behaves exactly as you would expect from a character equipped with armored armor, that is, he easily defeats all ~normal~ opponents and has to engage a little only with the numerous robotic enemies present within the stages. The use of homing missiles is a prime example, in fact they can eliminate human threats in an instant, even if there are several targets to hit, just like in the first film. To take down the huge drones and armored soldiers requires more firepower, so go with the dual repulsors and do not skimp on the more powerful missiles. The uniray ends up being somewhat sidelined due to its long charge times, but once released it is devastating and can one-shot destroy most opponents. The combat system as a whole proves to be quite satisfying and gives a good feel, with enemies reacting to explosions and stopping. In short, there is a lot of physicality in these situations, physicality which absurdly, however, is lost during hand-to-hand combat, unhappily controlled by the shaking of the Nunchuk, which are distinguished by imprecision and approximation: very often hitting an enemy with a fist proves to be a tough undertaking, much better to keep shooting. Between one stage and another, the technology points collected can be used to upgrade the armor, both that of Iron Man and that of War Machine (it is possible to face most of the levels using one or the other character freely ), acting on factors such as resistance and the ability to regenerate energy, but also on the efficiency of the thrusters and obviously on the power and type of weapons. The upgrade menu is very well organized (light years ahead of that abomination seen on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions) and the technology points are distributed intelligently, i.e. through objects to collect rather than based on the score (since in any case must eliminate all enemies). The numerous fights are often interspersed with the search for switches or characters, and the action is therefore varied enough not to get bored. Of course, a technical realization that was up to the situation would have been welcome: apart from the Iron Man armor, which is really well done, the graphics of the game leave much to be desired. The developers have used The Conduit's engine and it shows due to the excellent frame rate, but there are many gray areas and the amount of small bugs seems endless. The polygonal models of the characters during the cutscenes are something terrible. And of the Italian dubbing, well, enough has already been said in the review of the PS3 version: the worst that this writer has ever heard.", "date": "2010-06-10", "grade": "5.8"}
