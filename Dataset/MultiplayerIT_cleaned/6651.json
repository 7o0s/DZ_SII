Sitting next to the fireplace, I wait for dinner, reading news and blogs with the laptop on my lap. Between an article on North Korean hackers and a hundred lists of games of the year, comes - as inevitable as the grandparents' bingo and the hateful poem of the younger cousin - yet another inconclusive discussion on what it is, what it isn't and what it should be a video game. I read a little bored and a little amused, while my hand keeps tapping on the iPad screen, without even looking at it. I already know that, under the signs of a thousand fingertips, my hero is slaughtering hordes of titans, flanked by wizards, archers and knights. Someone would find it more difficult to define Tap Titans as a game than they would with an anti-stress ball, yet I've been going on all day: at breakfast, in front of the TV, while reading a book. Even now, as I write this review. Tap Titans is a game where you face an endless wave of monsters by tapping on the screen One tap to rule them all Developed by Game Hive, Tap Titans is basically a clicker game masquerading as an action RPG with a fantasy setting. It is an absolutely new idea (just think of the Flash game Clicker Heroes), but one that the Canadian team has managed to replicate in a decidedly more effective and graceful form. In fact, the protagonist is a hero who, aided by a handful of allies, must take out a series of titans who mostly remain stationary to be beaten up. All you need to do is flick the screen to attack with your sword, to collect loot, and to power up your alter-ego and your companions. ~And then what?~, you may be wondering. And then that's it. The game is a continuous cycle in which you eliminate enemies to earn gold, useful for leveling up your characters in such a way as to be able to defeat increasingly stronger Titans. All by simply tapping your fingertips on the screen in order to do as much damage in as little time as possible. Tap Titans stands out for two reasons, however. First of all, unlike the vast majority of clicker games, it is graphically well-finished, lively and very pleasant, which is saying something considering that the previous Game Hive games did not stand out at all for style and aesthetic taste. In particular, not only are the characters, backgrounds and interface very consistent with each other, but everything appears more alive and sparkling thanks to the animation work done by Jay Edry. Furthermore, a few minutes with Tap Titans and it is evident how the development team founded by Chris Doan and Mark Wang has done their homework, taking strong inspiration from the more recent Bitcoin Billionaire. As in Noodlecake Studios' game, Tap Titans is based on a system of small rewards, and every minute you are able to upgrade some units, hire new allies or unlock other upgrades. There's a constant sense of progression, and leveling up your teammates makes it both easier to defeat your opponents and racks up more gold when you're not playing. It can get to the point where you don't need to touch the screen (and actively participate in the fight) except during boss fights, when you need to eliminate your opponent before time runs out. The protagonist's special techniques are a welcome addition, as are each ally's passive skills, which can increase the money collected, the damage dealt or the effectiveness of each touch on the screen. Furthermore, having reached a certain level, one can decide to increase the prestige of one's hero, starting over from the beginning but this time obtaining artifacts which confer significant bonuses and allow one to advance more easily. From Bitcoin Billionaire, Game Hive also drew inspiration in the implementation of advertising and microtransactions: in exchange for attractive bonuses, the user can freely choose whether to view an advertising film or click on a banner. Too bad that currently the system is half broken, with sometimes excessively long movies, keys that don't work or, even worse, rewards that are not conferred. However, the biggest problem of Tap Titans does not lie in the various bugs that are encountered from time to time, but in the enormous imbalance of the game economy. Making a balanced clicker game is not an easy undertaking, and it is evident that the authors are in their first experience with the genre. The cost/benefit ratio of enhancing weaker allies soon becomes inconvenient for the player, and once you get to a certain level the enemies become so resistant that beating a single boss requires too much expense and too long a wait. They are just some of the design choices that go to ruin what otherwise potought to be easily one of the best clicker games out there.", "date": "2014-12-29", "grade": "7.0"}
