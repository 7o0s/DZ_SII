Daisuke Amaya aka ~Pixel~ worked on Cave Story for five years until he was able to finish and release it in December 2004. Since then the rise of both, work and creator, was sensational: there is not a single list of the best indie-games in the world that does not include Cave Story, and the game has been ported to many platforms, including PSP and Xbox. Six years later, it's out on Wiiware; but why would anyone be interested in buying it with this delay, since it can be downloaded for free - on PC - since 2004? Because this version, restructured by Nicalis and perfected by ~Pixel~ himself, is undoubtedly the best on the market: essentially a Cave Story Deluxe. Platformvania A term has not yet been coined for games with a ~Metroid-like~ map, but it must be found as soon as possible, because there are more and more developers who use it as a founding element of their work: we are talking about the so-called ~Metroidvania~, titles with a unitary setting that rely on backtracking. In recent years, in addition to the various Metroid and Castlevania, the Megaman ZX and Darksiders category have been fleshed out, but above all a mini-invasion of ~platformvania~, including the two Lostwinds, Kirby & the Amazing Mirror and, precisely, Cave Story. The map of the Nicalis title is not as complex as that of the best Metroids, but it is quite similar: unlike in the Nintendo game, however, the various (macro) areas are not all interconnected, but can be reached from a central village which acts as a glue. The essence of Cave Story, as well as a cohesive setting, is made up of a platform soul and a shooter, although its real strength lies precisely in uniting these three elements without appearing separate. To top it all off there is a more than good story, especially considering the standards of the genre: sure, it relies on various clichs (amnesia of the protagonist above all), but the fact that the dialogues and actions directly influence the events of the game (and therefore the ending of the same) is not common, also because Cave Story manages these moments with a mastery alien to many big budget projects - rarely explicit when facing a crossroads of a moral nature, for example. Overall then it's a great game, but its craftsmanship probably caused it to be over-glorified. Many critics have called it the best NES game ever created, but this statement is wrong for two reasons: first of all, Amaya's project could hardly have been released on the NES (even in its original version) given the size and level of detail of the settings, not to mention the amount of enemies on the screen. Secondly, admitted and not granted that it could have been released on a console of the time, it still has some drops and smudges that the masterpieces of the period did not have. The jumps, however accurate, are modulated only in relation to the pressure of the buttons, because they take little account of both the character's gait and the changes in direction: they are more similar to those of MegaMan than those of Super Mario, in short. In terms of level design, the truly brilliant touches can be counted on the fingers of one hand: many missions are based on the trivial find the object-return the object, but above all the maps, although they are brilliant to cross, do not reserve big surprises in the phase of exploration (such as the hidden streets that are often hidden behind the ~usual~ fake tile). Shoot'em up We spent an entire paragraph listing the game's flaws because the rest, in short, is great. As you may have guessed, the shooter phases are by far the most successful: not only that, with their quality - and capillarity - they manage to raise even the rare uninspired areas from mediocrity. The controls are excellent - reactive and intuitive - and the design of the enemies is impeccable, but above all the combinations between jumps and shots are excellent, satisfying and unique: rather than a hominid with a hat, in the most exciting sections of Cave Story you will seem to control a Warlord straight out of The Terminator. And this is not because epic scenes appear on the screen, on the contrary: many of the enemies are drawn in a kawaii style, and as far as we know they could have come directly from the world of Hello Kitty. Simply, in its best moments, Cave Story makes you feel like a Terminator: while the graphics tell you that you are witnessing a fight between puppets, the pad assures you - and communicates it in your veins - that you can destroy anything you come across . It goes without saying that the opposite usually happens, and this reversal is one of the main principlesPali causes of the success of the Amaya title: how many times, especially in the last decade, have you watched an introductory movie with a fight between demons, and then go to play and simply have to press ~A~? Here, in Cave Story, as in many old-school titles, fortunately the process is the opposite. All this is true for both the classic and Wiiware versions: as we said at the beginning of the article, the biggest difference between the two lies in the graphics, much more accurate in this 2010 edition. Fortunately, although the various objects/elements are more detailed than the original, they have not lost their charisma - and this happens more often than you might suspect. In addition to the graphics, there have been some playful adjustments here and there, all decided by Amaya herself, and more options and secondary modes have been added (boss can be replayed, for example). There are three levels of difficulty, even if, compared to current standards, the lowest should be understood as medium, while the highest as verging on the impossible. It will last you several hours, but above all, once you finish it, you will want to play it again.", "date": "2010-12-20", "grade": "8.6"}
