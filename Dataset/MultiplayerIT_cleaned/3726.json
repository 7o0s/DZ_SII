This is the premise of Zanki Zero: Last Beginning, a strongly Japanese-style RPG (but with some very particular characteristics) which you probably have never even heard of until now. A very niche genre, one of those that almost always interests a very small circle of enthusiasts here in the West; yet it is a production not only valid from the point of view of gameplay, but also deeply inspired in its narrative sector. We've spent a good amount of hours on Garage Island, and while the world is now over there may still be a few readers left for our review. Plot: The world ends, the story begins The plot of Zanki Zero: Last Beginning opens in a melancholic and absurd way, an incipit that immediately reveals how behind the production there are the names of the producers of the well-known Danganronpa series. Haruto Higurashi, employed at a Japanese publishing house, decides to take his own life for reasons that will be explained later in the title and that we have no intention of anticipating: he throws himself from the top floor of a very tall skyscraper and closes his eyes shortly before of impact with the ground. A few seconds later he wakes up by the sea, on an unknown island, and soon realizes he's arrived on Garage Island. This is where the highly symbolic dimension of Zenki Zero: Last Beginning begins, the same one that will accompany the player in every single moment of the narrative, from its beginning to its end. The lines from Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto almost come to mind: ~what is lost either through our fault, / or through the fault of time or Fortune: / what is lost here, gathers there~; that is to say, on the Moon (a very distant world from ours) it is possible to find the lost things of planet Earth, even if a little in bulk. The same happens in the game world of the creators of the Danganronpa series: Haruto's life has just ended and he has lost everything, but somehow (in a very twisted and distorted way) he will find some pieces along the path of his new existence on the island. Some buildings, areas and people bring back memories, which he will insist on during the more than thirty-five hours of gameplay needed to get to the end credits. But above all, Haruto is not the only inhabitant of Garage Island: with him there are seven other characters, new protagonists of a world that has gone downhill and has been extinct for who knows how long now. Do we really have to guide you in the symbolic narration of Zenki Zero: Last Beginning, depriving you of the pleasure of discovery? Let's throw just a few ideas: the relationship between life and death, between the ego and external reality, the magical symbolism of the number seven and the relationships between the seven supporting characters and the seven deadly sins of the Western religious tradition. However, if all this does not interest you and instead you prefer to enjoy a Japanese RPG simply by turning off your brain, know that the plot is managed all the time in an optimal way from the point of view of narrative direction: prologue aside, each chapter of the story is dedicated to a specific character. Everyone, somehow, has to live with the end of the world, and maybe even find a way to bring back the tragic events that saw her protagonist. Playstation 4 trophies Zanki Zero: Last Beginning has a large number of Trophies on PlayStation 4, including the coveted Platinum Trophy: it will take about fifty hours to obtain it. The main narrative will be completed, paying attention to the collectibles dedicated to all the characters present; in addition, all the structures of Garage Island will be upgraded to the maximum level. Gameplay: many genres in delicate balance Zanki Zero: Last Beginning is based on a very delicate balance of very different genres, apparently irreconcilable with each other; the demonstration that careful gameplay management can lead to very satisfactory results, even starting from decidedly heterogeneous material. Considering then that the experimentation takes place within an extremely conservative genre such as the Japanese survival RPG, the whole operation takes on even greater interest. Zanki Zero: Last Beginning is above all an RPG that corresponds perfectly to Japanese canons: a main character is managed within his party of companions, paying attention to fundamental aspects such as the equipment and weapons of all present. Haruto can be accompanied on his adventures between threefriends at a time, but each of them is changed according to the player's objectives, who can take advantage of their specific characteristics at any time. However, the survival component is pressing: it is not enough to explore the game world in all its areas, which will gradually be added to the Garage Island base, we must also pay attention to the health, dehydration, stress and physical needs of all present. If this attention is lacking, their combat effectiveness will suffer very soon and on more than one occasion will lead to early and violent death. Again, Zanki Zero: Last Beginning is a dungeon crawler: you have to explore game areas (more or less contained) by moving as if inside a chessboard. The character's movements take place along the north-south and east-west axis, for contiguous squares; at the same time, the left analog allows you to explore the surrounding environment that is framed at that precise moment, to collect objects, interact with important elements of the scenario, save the game at certain checkpoints, and much more. The result is a very particular mix between the exploratory title, the RPG, the dungeon crawler and the visual novel; strongly belonging to the latter genre are also the many narrative and dialogue phases, in which the game action is interrupted (literally) to make room for the conversations between the various protagonists of the adventure. Each of them has unique character peculiarities, ambitions, memories and desires: sooner than you think you will have already fallen in love with some rather than others, thus establishing an emotional (or emotional) bond with the entire narrative. If the spark does not strike (this must be underlined) Zanki Zero: Last Beginning will soon begin to show some of its more obvious limits: a fluctuating balance between exploration/combat and statistical/dialogue phases, a rather limited variety of enemies present and a certain repetitiveness background which, moreover, is common to the entire genre to which it belongs. The latter aspect, however, is quite a value for some players; on the other hand, it is not possible to consider the technical and graphic sector of the title in a positive way, anchored to a transition phase that has never been completed between the last generation of consoles and the current one. Let the backgrounds and anime-style scenes of the dialogue phases pass, with a quality tending towards the top: polygonal models of the enemies present, aliasing and details of the surrounding world during the exploratory phases seem not only not very memorable, but also poorly cared for. It is certain, however, that it is an ambitious RPG with a very particular charm. We strongly advise you to take a look at it: it might surprise you.", "date": "2019-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
