{"name": "La Mulana 1 & 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-mulana-1-2-recensione.html", "text": "It's been like 15 years since the first publication of La-Mulana, at the time a game so underground that it hasn't even made it to the West, and in the meantime the series has achieved considerable notoriety, so it's likely that you already know what to expect from this review of La-Mulana 1 & 2 on Xbox One. A brief historical excursus to understand where the two titles in question derive from: the first La-Mulana came out in 2005 on PC as freeware and remained confined above all to Japanese territory, except to reach some western pioneers, then expanding further thanks to a patch in English . Global distribution only came between 2011 and 2012 with the landing on WiiWare and PC of an entirely revised and corrected version, a sort of general remaster of the first chapter. The success of this paved the way for La-Mulana 2, funded through a Kickstarter in 2014 and initially released in 2018. Finally, the launch on current platforms comes these days with the collection La-Mulana 1 & 2, which proposes both the chapters together in a physical collector's package, also available separately in digital version. La-Mulana is one of the best products of the Japanese indie scene, which continues in parallel but in a way that could be defined conceptually different from the western one, although the geographical subdivisions in the current videogame industry now make little sense. However, there is some characteristic that leads us to speak of a particular identity for the Japanese underground panorama: what is often noticed, as in this case, is a strong link with the classic tradition of the local video game, a search for solutions and styles history and the will to re-propose challenges capable of being as demanding as those of the 8-bit era, but filtered through a more modern taste and above all a certain awareness of the maturity reached by the medium. This vision leads to playing with the narrative and meta-game elements, while remaining firmly anchored in solid and tremendously challenging mechanics. We saw it with Cave Story, the real ~father~ of doujins and the Japanese indie scene, with Downwelle clearly with La-Mulana, who returns in complete form and in a double pack that it would be better not to miss. La Mulana 1 The first chapter of La-Mulana was reviewed on these pages in 2012 and the evaluation remains substantially unchanged despite the past years. This is because, as is evident, this game tends to transcend a precise temporal location, both in terms of its aesthetic aspect and above all its gameplay. It could be defined as an ante litteram metroidvania, given that at its original release, however close to that of the other famous exponent of the hybrid genre, Cave Story, this sub-genre had not yet been identified in a known way as it is now and certainly was not so widespread. However, it represents a particularly fitting example of that mixture of game types: it is a very demanding 2D platformer, based on the fight against numerous enemies that crowd the levels within a large interconnected map, with the possibility of opening passages following acquisition of new skills by the protagonist. The original goal was to pay homage to the MSX classics and in particular Maze of Galious, but above all with the remake it has been considerably enriched and expanded in terms of content and game mechanics. The protagonist is Lemeza, a whip-wielding archaeologist/adventurer who finds himself exploring the ruins of ancient civilizations to uncover numerous mysteries. If the idea may seem derivative, it is because in fact it is and also in a deliberately obvious way, this too being an element of recovery of the classics of the past, but everything is also filtered in a humorous perspective, making fun of the clichs of the genre adventure both on the cinematographic and above all videogame front. Lemeza is able to whip enemies and use equipment that expands as you progress through the game, buying new items and unlocking more abilities as you progress through the huge map. Beyond the bosses, which can be quite challenging, the enemies are threatening above all for their number, but the risks are largely represented by the numerous traps and the layout of the platforms. However, the biggest challenge is represented by the puzzles, mainly because they are scattered over very large areas and often have solutions and connections that are difficult to guess. On closer inspection, there are many clues to understand how to operate within the numerous rooms of the gigantic map, but it is often necessary to unlock new skills - especially new softwarefor the laptop that serves as a constant support for Lemeza, in translating documents and interpreting drawings - to decipher them. In any case, the puzzles are often ~distributed~ over various areas of the map and it is not always easy to immediately understand the effects of our actions. In this sense, puzzle design often runs the risk of being a bit dispersive, even if there is a logical explanation for each piece, which can only become clear at a later time, just as it happens to understand the meaning of some new acquisitions in terms of equipment only by advancing on the map, or having to go back in the first areas to unlock semi-forgotten or not very visible passages. It is nothing new, in hindsight: it is simply the purest essence of the metroidvania, which makes backtracking and the total connection of the map its founding elements. La Mulana 2 Six, seven years after the first chapter and after the inevitable fundraising campaign on Kickstarter concluded with obvious success, La-Mulana 2 has arrived on the market and has been reviewed in these parts with an excellent evaluation, which also in this case we can only confirm. Less incisive than the progenitor, inevitably, the second chapter however represented the perfect evolution of the initial concept, improved and smoothed (but not too much) until it reached a videogame form that initially may seem a little more accessible and trendy but which he soon proves that he does not give up on the fundamental characteristics of the series, namely the sense of challenge, the vastness and the difficulty. The protagonist this time is Lumisa, Lemeza's daughter who followed in her father's footsteps by becoming an adventurer archaeologist too and now finds herself having to look for his traces because her father apparently disappeared. The sequel takes itself even less seriously than the progenitor and this is evident right from the start: the La-Mulana complex has become a tourist attraction managed by the old Xelpud, who in the meantime seems to have made a lot of money and having given himself to a dissolute life, but always with a great passion for information technology (as well as for women, and Lumisa's attractiveness certainly does not go unnoticed). The ruins are in a pitiful state but this new situation allows you to insert numerous gags in the exploration of the map, deriving from the various warnings and tourist information scattered around. Within the usual labyrinth of rooms, corridors and puzzles we also discover a new area responsible for the dark events that have recently occurred, namely the mysterious Eg-Lana. Again the map is huge, branched and layered and the game does everything to make you get lost in its maze. The rooms are littered with clues and the character progression, which allows the purchase of new equipment and useful skills, only partially simplifies exploration. The level design can seem easily convoluted, artificially complex, even compared to many modern metroidvanias, also because the map tends not to provide indications and this combined with the dispersion of the puzzles, which unfold over different rooms and even different areas, can create confusion and even be frustrating. It is a game that truly recalls an old-time spirit and in its quirks and excessive difficulties it is above all reminiscent of Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest. In short, you must keep this level of challenge in mind when approaching La-Mulana 2 and perhaps accompany the exploration with some notes on a sheet of paper, just to make it clear what levels of nostalgia we are at. The structure based on exploration between platforms and puzzle solving, the combat system focused on the whip - another clear reminder of Castlevania - the enormity of the map that requires backtracking and continuous research are all derived directly from the first La-Mulana, here though pushed to paroxysm: it is true that the game appears softer, more refined in many respects and less rough, but it also presses decisively on the peculiar elements of the first, becoming even wider and even more difficult in many respects. An evolution in mechanical terms can be found in the organization of the interface, which makes it easier than before for NPCs to read messages and access the laptop's support apps, which are also subjected to a form of micro- separate management given the need to install and uninstall them as needed due to limited space. A bundle of joys and sorrows The extreme similarity between La-Mulana and La-Mulana 2 becomes even more evident in the new all-encompassing package, where we find them side by side. The collectors edition is however intended above allto those who already appreciate the series and intend to dedicate a physical space to Nigoro's work complete with a special package and physical and tangible bonuses. The overdose effect that the collection can easily generate is therefore easily assimilated by connoisseurs. All the others could find themselves choosing between buying one or the other chapter and in this sense the choice is difficult: the first chapter has the incisive force of the original, perhaps endowed with a greater compactness and more contained than the exaggerations than the second, but La-Mulana 2 is certainly more refined in every sector, from graphics to gameplay, perhaps emerging as the best synthesis of the concepts expressed by the series. The two episodes are very similar in appearance also because the second recovers part of the original settings by redesigning them according to a new style, but this is especially true for the beginning, given that the deeper development of the games follows different dynamics and opens into very different. The choice between the two is therefore difficult because if the second is probably the most advisable due to a better appearance and a greater wealth of content, it is also true that it pushes even more on the difficulty in the long run, so you have to be prepared. The first chapter still becomes a must in case you get caught up in the spirit of La-Mulana, but at that point it is possible that you will seriously consider purchasing the complete package of the Hidden Treasure Edition. What must always be kept in mind, however, is that despite their peaceful aspect, these games are extremely demanding, almost masochistic: in this sense, although the parallel is in many ways improper, it can be said that La-Mulana 2 appeals to that spirit focused on the extreme challenge that has decreed the success of soulslike in modern times, what some call the ~masocore~. The difficulty is combined here with the vastness of the settings and more closely recalls the classic tradition of 2D action adventure of the past: one thing that can throw off the modern gamer is the lack of time dedicated to the initial preparation, therefore. The tutorial is essentially not there, the mechanisms of the game must be discovered as we get into them, exactly as it happened in the past when the information was delegated to the instruction booklet and the game limited itself to throwing us in the middle of the game. action. By the way, precisely in line with this spirit Nigoro has made available an official digital guide of over 60 pages that recalls the good old manuals of the past, study it at this address.", "date": "2020-03-10", "grade": "8.8"}
