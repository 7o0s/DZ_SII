A concept that the Crazy Labs developers obviously wanted to make truly tangible, to the point of pushing them to create real models for each single stage to verify with their own hands that they were 100% accurate. Let's go now to see if this commendable dedication has contributed to the creation of an equally valid title... Fold the World is original and well structured, but lacks the quid to become a little jewel I explain it The protagonist of Fold the World is Yolo, a kind of anthropomorphic slinky spring (we really can't find better words to describe him) engaged in an adventure to defeat the King of Darkness and liberate the Paper Kingdom, or something like that: the story that acts as a glue at the various levels is actually so negligible that the developers themselves have well thought of giving the user the freedom to choose whether to avoid it being even narrated through the few static images that occasionally peep out to illustrate the gait of the events. The strengths of Fold the World are obviously others, and reside above all in a playful structure capable of finding the right balance between the immediacy of the mechanics and the depth of the puzzles. Each level develops on sheets on which portions of a linear path along which Yolo can move are traced: the player's main task is to fold the flaps of cardboard along the appropriate perforations in such a way as to compose a road that allows to the protagonist to reach the exit. Easy said (and also done, at least in the first tutorial-like frameworks), user engagement becomes more consistent as Fold the World adds elements to the equation: there are puzzle pieces to collect to increase the score, holes in the paper that allow Yolo to reach the opposite surface of the sheet, bookmarks that act as mobile platforms, teleporters and so on, in a progressive crescendo that leads the more advanced stages of the 60 overall to prove decidedly difficult. Fold this for me Fold the World provides help to help those who find themselves stuck in a certain level, in the form of suggestions that can be purchased through the rainbow gems that are obtained by overcoming the various puzzles: given that they also serve to unlock access to Later worlds, it is easy to understand that we are facing the main source of income of the application, which in fact does not skimp on ads offering paid packages. Although other ways to obtain gems are contemplated (above all the viewing of advertising films), at a certain point in the adventure it becomes almost inevitable to put a hand in your wallet if you want to continue, even if it must be said that the prices of the items made available from the online store are more than honest. Fortunately, the developers were smart enough to put these barriers far enough in the game, allowing anyone to enjoy a large portion of Fold the World for free and therefore understand if it is worth spending a few euros to be able to move forward. However, what is not very convincing about the Crazy Labs product is the somewhat nebulous way in which the scoring system is managed: it is not clear whether the number of folds, the time elapsed or what else are taken into consideration, thus discouraging the player to retrace his steps to beat his own records and get better rewards. However, Fold the World is not one of those puzzle games that favor the competitive aspect, and this substantial lack of bite is another defect that could lead more than one to abandon it before its natural conclusion. From a technical point of view, then, the game does not showcase properly memorable qualities: we have already mentioned the bizarre (wanting to pay him a compliment) design of the protagonist, and the speech is completed by a clean and colorful but also rather monotonous graphic realization and by an all in all insignificant sound accompaniment.", "date": "2015-11-07", "grade": "7.5"}
