{"name": "Starship Troopers - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/starship-troopers-recensione.html", "text": "Media infantry When Robert Heinlein wrote his Space Infantry back in 1959, he could never have imagined the scope that his work would one day enjoy, enhanced by the powerful multimedia sounding board. In fact, the holders of the rights must be well aware that they have a brand with great potential in their hands: after two films, in fact, now the second videogame is on its way! The ingredients are all there: super-armored marines, millions of horrible insect-shaped aliens, spaceships and a complete and structured war scenario. If mixed with skill, the cocktail will certainly be explosive. LANDING! The plot is simple: the planet Hesperus, once a thriving mining colony, has fallen into the clutches of insects and must be reconquered. With this task, a fleet is sent into orbit, with a large contingent of marines to which is added a handful of supersoldiers: the lions. As a newly trained lion, we step in at the crucial moment. Without specifying how and when, we find ourselves almost immediately on the surface of the planet, with our beautiful rifle and ready for action. From the first moments you notice (and it is impossible not to notice it) the genes that enrich the DNA of our game. The marines who fight alongside us, the salacious jokes and dramatic comments, the energy shield that protects our health and recharges when hit, all of this can't help but remind us of Halo, while the dark atmosphere, illuminated by the weak ray of the torch, xenomorphic aliens and abandoned and decaying structures cannot but evoke echoes of Aliens and, consequently, of the AvP series. In the chromosomes of our lion there are important genes, therefore. But let's not digress, we have just landed and a hostile panorama extends before our eyes... The roar of the lion Hesperus is a hostile, barren and rocky world and seems to be more comfortable for arachnids than humans. Rocks and deserts are everywhere, but above all ravines from which endless waves of enemies emerge without stopping. we will be covered from head to toe in the green guts of disgusting spiders at the end of each mission The roar of the lion The primary feature of Starship Troopers is the huge amount of bugs that will pop up on the screen at any moment. The pauses between one fight and another are reduced to the bone and to counter these attacks we will have to rely on our equipment of soldiers. Strangely assorted equipment, indeed, but let's see in order. The service weapon is an automatic rifle with a grenade launcher. The characteristic of this weapon is that it has infinite ammunition, but after a while it gets hot and we have to take our finger off the trigger. The grenades are not very powerful but they are enough to thin out groups of insects that are a bit too daring. To be used sparingly because, of course, there are few. The roar of the lion What is surprising is the redundancy of some weapons: know that there are two identical rifles, except for the secondary shot, and most of the weapons are all automatic. With few exceptions, we will have the basic automatic rifle, an automatic rifle with armor-piercing bullets (very useful against tiger insects), in addition to the sniper rifle we have another automatic rifle but with zoom and finally we have yet another automatic rifle with rate of fire particularly high. Not bad, right? Luckily, lovers of traditional weaponry will still be able to count on the inevitable shotgun, a couple of rocket launchers and the classic sniper rifle. Of course, given the sheer amount of shells expended during battles, it's imperative that adequate supplies are scattered throughout the maps. If as regards the medical kits there is a worrying shortage, for the ammunition instead we are faced with a choice that is decidedly to be appreciated: in the economy of the spent bullets, we will find around the boxes with infinite ammunition, from which to stock up every time that we will need it. To give a practical example, imagine being alone inside a crater, surrounded by a hundred slobbering cockroaches attracted by your tasty flavour, imagine that at a certain point, while you are reaping victims, you hear the click of the unloaded rifle. .. here, this can never happen, because in that crater there will certainly be, somewhere, a nice box with ammunition always ready for a couple of weapons. The roar of the lion In case you haven't figured it out, on the battlefield it will be just like in the movie, ~insects, sir, by the millions.~ Of course they won't really be millions, but the impression is just that: we will be covered from top to toe with the green entrails of disgusting spiders,at the end of each mission. We have all kinds of them: warriors, armored warriors, dragonflies, small insects and large insects, in addition to huge insects, we have insects that charge with their heads down, others that spit plasma, others that spit flames, still others that blind. In short, there is something for all tastes. To push us forward towards the enemy is, in addition to a sense of duty, a whole series of missions created specifically to mud our new military overalls. They range from protecting unconscious technicians in the midst of an enemy assault, to destroying enemy positions, recovering lost officers and so on. We can say that the game designers have implemented all the most proven tricks of the trade. There are the events that trigger when the player performs certain actions, there are the timed phases (very odious!), there are the fixed positions to be used from time to time and, inevitably, there are the orders of the superior who will take us forward and back for Hesperus. Some solutions are ingenious, others predictable. Do you think that at some point you will be forced to stand still under the incessant attack of a horde of angry insects. If it has more than two legs, kill it! This sentence contains the whole spirit of the game: a non-stop massacre filled with the cynical and irreverent military spirit just like in the film. Some of the characters we meet will be obnoxious, to the point of making us want to kill them even if they only have two legs (who said Psi-Ops?), but the periodic 99.9 percent of our bullets will go in the direction of the bugs. And this is, unfortunately, the main limitation of the game. often the adrenaline teeters dangerously on the edge of boredom If it has more than two legs, kill it! The outdoor levels alternate with indoor ones with a balanced choice and the missions are always studied in such a way as to take us to the center of the action without downtime, however this variety does not affect the gameplay, which in some moments is repetitive at the point that often adrenaline teeters dangerously on the edge of boredom. If already advancing making your way through hundreds of enemies can soon get boring, finding yourself fighting the very long battles against the biggest insects becomes decidedly exhausting. Fortunately, after the first stressful levels, a greater presence of the exploratory element, interspersed with short action phases, manages to create a more tense and dramatic atmosphere. In this case we are often accompanied by the inevitable marines, who show off a rather flat and simplified AI, but capable of doing its duty, after all they are just cannon fodder already out of the box. a greater presence of the exploratory element, interspersed with short action phases, manages to give life to a more tense and dramatic atmosphere A rocky world So far we have talked about many things but we have not analyzed the technical aspect of this Starship Troopers. The game is built on the SWARM engine, responsible for rendering all the insects that appear on the screen, enriching the rest with special effects and dynamic shadows. The refraction effects through glass and minerals are nothing short of stupendous and the glare effects are equally beautiful, not to mention when we will see the plasma erupting from the bodies of colossal insects and then crashing to the ground. In short, the Strangelite guys have shown that they know how to use shaders well. A rocky world However, the performance that this SWARM is able to present is of a completely different kind, unfortunately proving to be so heavy that it is almost impossible to enable any form of shade even on medium/high power machines and it was evidently imperative create angular and rough models, to keep the generated polygon count low. And indeed, the models of the marines, dropships and various structures are unpleasantly angular, in stark contrast to the beauty of the effects. In short, the effects are nice, but the graphics are old-fashioned (it looks like a game from a couple of years ago) and the frame rate is unjustifiably low, playable but low. Test setup To test Starship Troopers we used a machine that is placed in a medium/high range, making it medium is the presence of a video card that is not exactly of the latest generation, but which is still a very honest polygon grinder equipped with a good quantity of memory. Here are the specs: CPU: Athlon 64 3200+ RAM: 2GB Video: Radeon 9800Pro 256 Final comment Those expecting a revelation will be disappointed. Starship Troopers is an honest shooter that adds nothing but, rather, reshuffles the good things that have been done in the past, alternating ups and downs but, allall in all, with quite convincing results. The strengths and weaknesses are those already seen, the game offers spectacular moments and then withdraws on itself showing its weaknesses. Unfortunately, alternating adrenaline and boredom, the repetitiveness of the game pattern can easily take over and tire the player. For us Italians, then, the gaming experience suffers another blow due to inadequate dubbing, in which only the good narrative voice of our superior stands out, while embarrassing moments are reached with some voices so caricatured as to be grotesque ( listen to the technicians and the Psi-Ops officer). More than an added value, dubbing is a subtracted value. Amen. In conclusion, Starship Troopers is an honest and pleasant game, but constantly poised between fun and repetitiveness and afflicted by too many flaws in the graphics sector. It will make movie fans happy, but it can make the most demanding players turn up their noses, who perhaps expect something more, especially in this period full of big guns of the genre. Pros It's like the movie Nice special effects Lots of enemies to slaughter Cons Too repetitive Heavy and angular graphics Poor voice acting (alas) The ingredients are all there: super-armored marines, millions of horrible insect-shaped aliens, spaceships and a complete and structured war scenario. If mixed with skill, the cocktail will certainly be explosive.", "date": "2005-11-26", "grade": null}
