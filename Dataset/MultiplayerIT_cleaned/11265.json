Pirate shooter The game structure is based on the traditional system of the genre: we pilot the ship within more or less narrow spaces, shooting everything that comes within range, collecting bonuses (treasures, additional weapons and in some cases new members for the crew being able to change the ship's stats) and basically trying to survive long enough to get to the bottom of the levels. Logically, the choice of the subject imposes some variations on the theme: the ship fires with the cannons placed along the side, therefore with lateral ~broadsides~, and not in the direction of the tip, which forces rather convoluted evasive and aiming maneuvers. Another addition inserted perhaps to give a better idea of navigation at sea, is the fact of having to turn through the right-left movement of the analog stick (the interface provides for the exclusive use of the Remote Control and Nunchuck) and move forward or backward by moving the stick along the vertical axis. The movement is therefore relative to the direction of the bow, and not to the position on the screen, which determines a certain cumbersomeness, however adequate to the idea of piloting a sailing ship. Strangely, instead of sailing in the open sea, we find ourselves more often than not piloting the ship inside narrow channels, or along rugged coasts that make navigation a sort of obstacle course, rather than an exploration of new horizons. In these waters, we will find ourselves practically having to sink everything in front of us, pirates, merchant ships and navy ships, in a perfect realization of the chaotic and anarchic line of conduct imposed by the (albeit officially false) role of pirate. No particular depth, therefore: the game only requires you to arrive intact at the end of the level. Despite the fascinating setting, the graphics remain on rather dull levels, without the bright colors or the particular effects of the water that one might have expected, with a rather anonymous characterization. Note the presence of multiplayer for up to 4 players: an excellent initiative, although it does not manage to enrich the feeble gaming experience that much. Comment Pirates: The Key of Dreams fails to stand out from the rest of the WiiWare games. Or worse, it fails to revive the offer of the online service for Wii, which for some weeks seems to have flattened out at rather low levels. The idea could have been interesting, but in fact the game is a shooter without the vivacity necessary for the genre, and marred by a decidedly mediocre technical realization. The concept seems badly set up: if you choose the pirate setting, why not exploit all the evocative power available, embellishing the gaming experience with the strategic and mercantile aspects that can derive from it? Vice versa, if you decide to bet everything on very simple fights, it makes little sense to choose a control system that is not very intuitive and satisfactory, and to set the whole game on a bland and relaxing pace. To this logical discrepancy is added the anonymous technical realization, which contributes to making the game unmemorable. Pirates is not a bad product, but in a few (albeit fun) minutes of play it already shows all it has to offer, and for 1000 Wii Points one would frankly expect more.Pros Interesting setting Fun at first Presence of multiplayer for four players Cons Monotonous and simple Graphically anonymous Cumbersome controls For some years now, the pirate world has been experiencing a sort of revaluation in a romantic key: leaving out crime, cruelty, hard life and scurvy, we have begun to see life in the shadow of the Jolly Roger as an exhilarating adventure between beautiful Caribbean seas. The wonders of fictional reality. The gaming world, in particular, has managed several times to express the best of itself through the pirate subject (Monkey Island, or the old Pirates! by Sid Meier, to give two examples), so much so that every new release based on such a setting with a certain, hopeful, expectation. This Pirates: The Key of Dreams therefore represents a product capable of arousing a certain interest, even if only by virtue of the fascinating subject: in the test of facts however, especially for those who remember the complex simulation-strategic setting that characterizes Sid Meier's pirates, this game can be confusing. It is, in fact, a simple shooter set in a pirate setting. The story sees us on a mission for the British navy, undercover, aboard a pirate ship. Theraids in the Caribbean seas have in fact become a first-rate problem, especially due to the interest these robbers have for a particularly coveted treasure: the Key to Dreams. This, in fact, guarantees absolute power to whoever owns it and must clearly not fall into the wrong hands (least of all if equipped with a hook). For this we embark, disguised as pirates and flying the black flag with skull and crossbones, in search of treasure.", "date": "2008-08-06", "grade": null}
