Tributes and evolutions of various kinds which also include Shadow Warrior, a modern remake of the homonymous 3D Realms shooter. Of the original here we find the style, the square houses, the life bar, the secret areas, the frenetic combat and the violence. But we do not find the vehicles, replaced, in a remake that changes several elements, by the evolutionary system of the character and by an enhanced movement system that includes rapid shots, prodigious dodges and martialist landings. All elements that alter the gameplay in an absolute sense but which are particularly effective when combined with the sword which is also the protagonist of the plot and, combined with the healing powers and telekinetic thrusts, brings to mind the immortal Jedi Knight. In the new Shadow Warrior Lo Wang's tongue is less sharp but his katana has a perfect edge Come get some Wang Shadow Warrior does not have a blockbuster narrative system, but still manages to surprise thanks to skits and well-chosen jokes that once again live on oriental stereotypes, double meanings and that irreverent charge that made 3D Realms titles memorable. There is not the impressive number of sentences that Lo Wang uttered in the original title and the general vulgarity is lower, also thanks to the meta-references of a protagonist aware of being immersed in clichs, but there is no shortage of fortune cookies, some narratively stronger interludes and a rock ovation opening. The plot is functional to this over the top setting, it doesn't try to surprise but is content to entertain the player by often resorting to quotes. The protagonist, summa of the stereotypes of Western and Eastern action actors, must recover a sword and to do so he is forced to defeat armed henchmen and hordes of demons. An impossible task for a human, unless he can use special powers granted to him by a decidedly atypical demon. And it is the latter which, in addition to justifying the acquisition of mystical abilities by the protagonist, guides us in understanding what is happening. And it does so with irony and spot-on dialogue, excellently dubbed in English and supported by Italian subtitles, which alternate with the protagonist's lines, creating the perfect mix of eighties action. All enriched by a good dose of splatter which in Shadow Warrior is a central element of the experience. Opponents' heads can be used as a weapon, enemies' appendages explode in a cloud of blood, and most importantly, the sword chops up demons and humans like carrots on Gordon Ramsey's table. A spectacular splatter component, made digestible by the graphic style and the grotesque look which, like the movement system, adds up to the elements that make the sword the weapon capable of giving greater satisfaction. On the other hand, the developers themselves claimed that it would have been possible to finish the game with just the katana and the statement proved to be true although the other weapons still allow you to shoot down enemies in quantity and are essential for remotely triggering barrels and other explosive elements which allow you to kill or weaken entire groups of enemies. In any case, the only real flaw in this approach emerges in the fights with the classic bosses, large creatures that are not affected by various skills and must be hit several times without this producing any visible effects. But if nothing else, in most cases, the end-of-level monsters summon creatures, go through different stages and in some cases are visually spectacular saving the experience from an unpleasant flat spot. The important thing is to fight Shadow Warrior is a sort of encyclopedia of period shooters with firearms that spew loads of shots, healing powers, offensive powers, secret areas galore, swords and explosive barrels everywhere. The evolution of the character is structured through three separate trees whose entries can be unlocked by drawing from three very distinct resources. Weapon upgrades require money while skills are based on karma and Ki crystal powers. The latter, among other things, make exploration fundamental, like money and the various secret areas dedicated to the original Shadow Warrior, not being available in any other way than by looking for them. Karma, on the other hand, can be both found by exploring and earned by fighting with the style of killing which can grant bonuses. Many of the skills require more than one rank to becomeeffective while weapon upgrades are immediately effective, significantly increasing the damage of firearms and also transforming the gun into a repeating killing machine. The only weapon that initially does not allow you to install add-ons is the sword but this, as anticipated, can count on a movement system specifically designed to make it usable even with enemies that strike from a distance and, moreover, can be upgraded through some specific abilities that make her extremely dangerous. And, of course, it's even more so when combined with control powers, which include moves capable of stunning and knocking down enemies, or with healing and protection powers that allow you to get close to even the most dangerous creatures. To activate this type of power it is necessary to press a directional key twice, different for each skill, and hold down one of the two mouse keys. An intuitive system even if not always comfortable. In fact, launching a lunge loaded with Ki, a decidedly powerful move, requires double pressing the ~forward~ button and this makes it difficult to activate the skill while backing away. In any case, between double weapons and shooting upgrades, there is room to refine one's combat skills and this is essential to overcome a certain repetitiveness due both to the lack of variety of opponent types and to the aesthetic component of the title. Shadow Warrior, on the other hand, is so faithful to the original that it even traces its aesthetic roughness. There isn't the mix between 3D and 2D of the classic 3D Realms shooter but there are spartan models, square houses and environments that don't shine in terms of complexity or richness. Fortunately, some more refined environments take care of balancing the shortcomings, large caves full of lava waterfalls and particularly inspired views enriched by dozens of lights and huge mirrors of water that reflect them. In all this the bamboo canes sway, explosions abound, particles are wasted and the engine, at least on our configuration, maintains a good fluidity regardless of the number of creatures that attack us. Not that this is surprising given that the Shadow Warrior engine is not particularly complex and the only heavy effect, which could give some problems on mid-range configurations, is represented by reflections in real time.", "date": "2013-10-01", "grade": "7.8"}
