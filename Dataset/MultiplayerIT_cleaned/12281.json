{"name": "Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/untold-legends-dark-kingdom-recensione.html", "text": "The Shadow of the Dragon watches over us The Shadow of the Dragon is an elite squad of warriors who have protected the dreamlike kingdom of Dureth and its rulers for centuries. Imbued with evocative magic, its components have the incredible gift of knowing how to absorb the essence of enemies. When a revolt of barbarians threatened the northern borders of Dureth, the Shadow of the Dragon immediately intervened to restore peace to the territory; however, after years of exhausting battles, rumors of an obscure corruption have reached the ears of its militants. Rushed to verify for themselves, the knights found themselves faced with a sad truth: the king is now addicted to evil, and has subjugated the kingdom with the help of evil creatures. The time has come to fight against the newborn ~Dark Kingdom~. Hack and Slash Forever Hack and Slash is a genre that, after the glories of the 80s (especially in arcades), experienced an inevitable decline, due to the total lack of ideas that could give it new vigor. Today, with NextGen now in full swing, one would expect that depth necessary to feed the interest not only of nostalgics, but also of the hard core of Hardcore Gamers. The fact remains that, right from the start, Untold Legends shows that it does not deviate particularly from other exponents of the genre, such as Baldur's Gate and Champions of Norrath, who actually achieved great success on PlayStation 2, not enriching the gaming experience with some original and innovative ideas, indeed. After choosing the difficulty level, which has 4 challenging levels, your character's class selection will be enforced. Here too we are faced with the typical canons of action-RPGs, and it will be possible to impersonate a Warrior (all muscles and thirst for battles), a Wizard (complete with a long white beard) and an Explorer (the only woman in the company, which makes agility its primary gift). Although they enjoy different physical and magical parameters, whichever character is chosen, the game tactic will not deviate in the slightest, limiting itself to the frantic pressure of the attack keys. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, Untold Legends certainly does not highlight the capabilities of PlayStation 3. The models of the characters are well defined, and the frame-rate remains constant even in the most agitated phases (very numerous, given the genre), but especially the scenarios are of absolute poverty, and practically devoid of the slightest interactivity. Furthermore, the camera, despite being totally rotatable, does not disdain to create some headaches in the presence of trees or structures capable of hindering its range of action, compromising the most demanding clashes. From the sound point of view, however, we note the catchy orchestral music that will be the background to the player's deeds, without ever bothering him. An exponent of a genre that is certainly not mass-produced, Untold Legends embodies only a part of the main qualities of action-rpg, without making any significant innovation. The title is therefore recommended to Hack and Slash lovers and to all nostalgics chasing ~old~ emotions in a modern (but not new) key, especially if they have the opportunity to face the adventure in the company of one or more friends (offline and online). Those who are looking for a lasting and stimulating adventure, or a fully next-gen graphics sector, would do well to turn their attention to other titles. Pros Immediate control system Fun in multiplayer... Cons ...much less in single player Role-playing component poorly developed Graphically subdued The Merchant at the Fair Once on the battlefield, the immediacy of the control system is striking: the not excessively high number of moves is achieved thanks to the combination of the square and X keys; the grip is buckled to the triangle; to the circle the jump; at the triggers the parry and the dodge. By defeating enemies, they will release globes that will affect three parameters: health, Mana (magic energy) and Essence, useful for updating your equipment in the numerous Temples present along the adventure. In terms of gameplay, the gaming experience adapts to the typical canons of the genre: little strategy, a lot of chaos and attack buttons sometimes pressed at random in the hope that one's alter ego will be able to vanquish the hordes of enemies that rage on the screen . The fun is proportional to the number of players who will take part in the adventure; it is in fact quite tedious to face the 27 levels alone, and it is therefore recommended to exploit the multiplayer potential of the title; it is above all online that the game offers the greatest satisfaction, with the possibility of facingKing the dungeons in the company of 3 friends (against only 2 players offline). What is surprising is the obligation to register with Xfire (https://www.xfire.com) in order to take advantage of the voice chat, instead of using the console's internal libraries. The Merchant at the Fair The role-playing component, on the other hand, is very limited: the accumulated experience will obviously be spent to increase the character's characteristics at will (health, attack, defense, etc.) and learn to master the most devastating spells. However, a greater depth was expected, especially as regards the equipment: in addition to the fact that objects of the same level (leggings, cloaks, etc.) often have the same aesthetic aspect, the absence of a merchant to whom the to sell, or from which to buy, weapons and clothing. The only possibility of freeing up space in one's inventory is in fact to literally abandon one's equipment, without any pecuniary gain to invest in upgrading one's paraphernalia. Interesting, however, the presence of stones that give your weapon additional effects that affect the gameplay. After conquering legions of fans on PSP with two popular episodes, the Untold Legends saga also arrives on the Home Console, with an unpublished title aimed at showing the NextGen potential of the newcomer from Sony. A breath of fresh air, or the classic reshuffle of clichs that has been offered to us for more than 15 years now? To the review the arduous sentence.", "date": "2007-05-15", "grade": null}
