{"name": "The Sims", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-3.html", "text": "The Sims-ons In addition to the classic game mode on PC, the console edition offers a new objective mode. The beginning of the adventure in itself does not seem to be very exciting: whatever the physical and behavioral characteristics chosen for your alter-ego, you will discover that you are a penniless, idle and very clumsy boy in every task. Add to this the shame of having to live with a grumpy mother who is always in the mood for reproaches, and you will understand that there is only one possible solution to all this: to leave. It is no coincidence that this disastrous initial situation works very well as a tutorial for every newcomer to the world of the Sims, given that in a short time, by learning the basic functions of our character, it will be possible to start the real game. You will have to build the rest of the story yourself: look for a job, find a home and start having ties with the people around you, from friendships to loves, and everything else will come by itself. Although there is great freedom of action and interaction with each component of the game, to continue in the best way it is advisable to complete some more or less important objectives, suggested from time to time by the game itself. Learning how to fix an appliance, or how to prepare excellent dishes using the stove, will not only allow you to acquire greater credibility with others, but will also unlock objects and prizes that can be purchased separately to beautify our home. And by developing a particular aesthetic sense in our Sim, our home will also be furnished accordingly. Talking about every aspect of our character and the environment that surrounds him, and how they are mutually influenced by an enormous amount of variables is practically impossible: trying The Sims directly, everyone is faced with a ~blank~ story, which can be carried out according to personal and arbitrary decisions by each player. Telephone caaasa Having to talk about the technical realization, it should be noted that this version for nextgen consoles can rely on a completely renewed polygonal engine, which performs its duty very well without surprising. The design of characters, objects and game environments, although spartan and unrefined, is very functional and easy to understand. The management of the camera also, apart from rare cases, allows you to easily frame the playing area and quickly identify objects and characters. Certainly as a first impact one could be quite disappointed by a technical realization not in step with the times, but the actions to be taken are so many that the visual sector definitely takes a back seat. Even the sound performs its function in a more than good way, especially as regards the numerous sound effects, even if the lack of a real musical comment sometimes leaves a certain sense of emptiness. Although it is a question of carrying out, for a good part of each game, a series of daily actions that each of us has been repeating for a lifetime, there is certainly no shortage of fun, and everyone is completely free to build a life, a family and a reputation as a best believe. The same artificial intelligence of the supporting characters will give a pinch of unpredictability to the Maxis game: they will have their ~wrong moons~, or they will react badly in the face of your excessive insistence, and even making peace won't be exactly easy. But the real terror in the transposition of similar games from PC to console is represented by the control system: initially designed for the mouse/keyboard combination, once converted to the levers of a joypad the controls often become a real nightmare. Fortunately, this is not the case with The Sims: the GameCube pad, after a somewhat traumatic initial impact, behaves very well, and all the statistics of our virtual character are always under control. Furthermore, a very intuitive ~point and click~ interface, accompanied by drop-down menus, allows you to quickly perform all actions by highlighting the single object to interact with, including people. It will be essential to keep an eye on the many variables and characteristics of the player, which are continuously modified by the interaction with the element of the game or even by the simple passage of time, which create an infinite number of possible situations, and leave each player free to manage the own virtual life. In addition to the objective-based single-player mode, there is also the possibility of challenging a second player in split-screen: these are timed skill tests, such asbeing able to make friends with as many people as possible or prepare dishes in the kitchen. Nothing striking, but definitely fun to play with a friend. One last note to underline the great expandability of this game, which also allows you to import characters and cities created by other players from other memory cards, thus offering a high degree of interchange between multiple players. Conclusion The Nintendo cube is certainly not new to such products, but the various Animal Crossing and Havest Moon (soon to be released) satisfy rather different needs, and remain far from actual reality. It is therefore easy to imagine that, especially for those who love simulation games, The Sims represents a decidedly interesting title, given the high degree of realism offered, even if the gameplay is starting to feel the weight of the years a bit. The title, apart from the new game modes and the three-dimensional engine, is substantially identical to the PC counterpart, which came out a few years ago: if you have already had the opportunity to immerse yourself in the world of the Sims on a personal computer, this re-edition for the GameCube does not offer sufficient insights to justify the purchase. For everyone else, however, it could be a welcome surprise. Pros: Great variety of situations and characters Very detailed simulation Easy to start, impossible not to continue Cons: Average technical realization Multiplayer mode virtually superfluous Think about it, it almost sounds like a contradiction: to escape a few moments from boring daily life, I turn on the GameCube and immerse myself in a real-life simulation. Strange right? Yet this Maxis title is one of the most successful games of recent years and has made millions and millions of converts all over the world on PC. Will the same happen on consoles too?
