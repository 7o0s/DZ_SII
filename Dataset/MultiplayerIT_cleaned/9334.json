It is not an easy question to answer, despite the deep sedimentation of its conceptualization in our culture, the result of many revisions over the centuries. More precisely: how do you define a hero in an ambiguous moral-ethical situation? How do you distinguish him from a villain? Does performing incredible feats while serving an oppressive power still make heroes? Probably for that power yes, which will tend to celebrate everything that preserves it as such, but for the others? These and other questions are, or would like to be, the thematic focus of the game you are about to read the review: Scarf. Gameplay Some of Scarf's sceneries are really beautiful We started talking about Scarf at the end of August 2018. The Uprising Studios game immediately struck us for the visual style and for the idea of the scarf around the neck of the protagonist, a blue anthropomorphic being, which many remembered without too many mysteries Journey, you want also due to the desert setting of some scenarios. Since then, a lot of water has flowed under the bridges, many had even given the game for dead, but in the end it really came out. The gameplay begins with the birth of the protagonist who immediately gets to know the scarf. The latter is not an inanimate object, but a sentient being in the shape of a dragon, part of a larger and more powerful entity, trapped by some rebel servants, who have created their own worlds using its energy. Our goal is to enter these parallel universes and look for their creators, to suck their souls, so that we can open the portal of the entity and restore the original balance in a sense. All this translates into an adventure made up of only three large levels, in which we have to jump between platforms and solve some puzzles to reach our goal. During our wanderings, we will also be able to find some memories, which will allow us to access what is the real story behind our mission, actually quite clear right away, considering the aggressiveness of the scarf. These memories are theoretically hidden. We say theoretically because in reality they are easily identifiable, thanks to real signs placed in front of the places where they are kept. For example, we found all nine (three in each world), in the first game. For the rest in the levels there are other collectibles to find: drawings, also very easy to identify, and toys, less visible because they are very small. Limits Are we the good guys or the bad guys? The main problem with Scarf is that that's all, in the sense that it solves itself in a linear sequence of really simple jumps and puzzles that, in most cases, only require you to take the only action available to move forward, without offering any big reasons for deepening the scenario. Theoretically, the fulcrum of the gameplay should be the scarf itself, thanks to the powers it gives to the protagonist: a double jump, the ability to glide, to launch using it as a slingshot and to cling to grips (grappling hook type). The trouble is that they are almost all under exploited and the level desgin doesn't do much to highlight them in a creative or original way. It goes better with spheres that raise the water around the hero, which at least offer an interesting scenic effect, but even in these cases it is enough to follow what is the only road available from time to time to avoid problems. Considering that in Scarf there is no fighting and that the platform adventure part offers a very meager challenge, you will understand how the game struggles to arouse interest, apart from its visual style, which we will discuss shortly. Everything seems too obvious and direct. The only relevant sections, at least because they require a minimum of exploration, are the open ones, i.e. the large areas where you have to go around to recover the embroidery of the scarf to be used to unlock the passages, otherwise inaccessible. Scarf's puzzles are super easy, even when they don't look easy Again the puzzles are very simple (push the plate with the block placed a meter away, move a giant flower to create a platform, lower or raise the water of two swimming pools using two levers and stuff like that) , but at least you have to make the effort to locate the embroideries. There are very few variations on the theme. Each level has its own characteristics that should give more specific difficulties. For example, in one there are strong winds to be exploited with a hang glider, while in another there are animals that must be frightened or attracted by collecting objects and so on. Unfortunately, even these characteristicsistics are little exploited, due to a flat level design, which sometimes seems to forget them or which is simply not interested in giving them space. Thus they are used in the most basic way possible and end up becoming a dead letter in a short time. To say: we arrive at the end of one of the worlds in a room full of rays that create a barrier around one of the beings whose soul we have to suck. On the surface it seems a very intricate situation, but in reality we soon discover that it is enough to reach the four levers connected to the spokes to solve everything. Artistic direction What will these ancient and silent places hide? Nothing. As mentioned, Scarf's strong point, probably the only one, is definitely its visual style. Or, at least, it should be. In fact, the developers have done everything to make it evocative, taking us through large natural scenarios (a kind of large island, a desert world and a more lush one) full of ruined temples and silence. At least from a scenographic point of view, Scarf works, even if it has a decidedly derivative imagery, which immediately brings to mind the aforementioned Journey and other titles that have made similar choices. However, some passages are really beautiful, despite the polygonal minimalism, and offer interesting visual compositions, made up of vast, ancient and motionless environments, which seem to hide who knows what mysteries. Their only problem is that they don't connect much with the underlying theme of the game, resulting in a bit alien to the story told (actually very thin). The powers of the scarf are underused In other words, they are made to be beautiful, but they don't have a great weight on the narrative, limiting themselves to a generically evocative function of referring to certain atmospheres, sought after regardless of everything. They do their duty, they also like them, but they leave the time they find. The music goes in the same direction, even if it is more pregnant and present, in its underlying discretion. In general, the artistic work makes sense in itself and works as a whole. Let's say that each level is a kind of big picture that you can admire independently, provided you forget about its function. Whether this is good or bad depends very much on how one interprets the whole experience.", "date": "2021-12-20", "grade": "6.0"}
