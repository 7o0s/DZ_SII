{"name": "Shaun White Snowboarding", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shaun-white-snowboarding.html", "text": "The genre of snowboarding simulations, which has always had very little ~simulation~, for some years now seems decidedly in crisis: after a series of successful titles, which combined entertainment and spectacularity in an extraordinary way, this vein has not been able to renew itself in occasion of the advent of new generation systems. Shaun White Snowboarding is one of the first products that attempts to fill this void, and comes with a different structure than usual, which encourages the player to explore the locations in a sort of ~sandbox~ with missions rather than putting him in front of the various races in sequence. It also uses the online mode in an innovative way, allowing us to play with friends or strangers with disarming ease. All potentially positive elements, which however collide with a gameplay that is unfortunately limited and devoid of the emotions that titles like Cool Boarders or SSX were instead capable of giving during each race. Does the mobile reduction of Shaun White Snowboarding have anything in common with the console version of the game? No, unfortunately not. Right from the start, the game developed by AMA looks like the most classic of mobile arcade games, with a career mode made up of ten almost identical events, divided only into two types: downhill and ramp. In each race we will have to face an opponent indirectly, exceeding the relative record in order to unlock the next event. If this proves to be quite simple in the descent, the same cannot be said of the ramp sessions, truly terrible and made even more frustrating by a control system that responds to inputs in a far from punctual way, often making us lose precious points. The controls change depending on the type of race, as well as the camera used by the game. During the downhill run, our character is framed from the side and our job will be to make him jump at the right time (button 5) and to make him perform enough acrobatic maneuvers (acting on the four directions of the d-pad) to get the points needed to pass the challenge. In the ramp sessions, on the other hand, we will see our snowboarder from behind as he moves from left to right, along the entire length of the gully, and we will have to make him perform stunts on each jump before reaching the finish line. It is at this juncture that the AMA product gives its worst, unfortunately, due to the poorly adjusted difficulty level (it is practically forbidden to make mistakes) and the aforementioned fallacious response to commands. The graphics make use of the usual bitmap/vector hybrid to represent the character and the track respectively, with fairly smooth scrolling and a good feeling of depth without parallax. The use of colors is discreet and the animations are passable, but it is clear that the fully polygonal solutions (see the latest Tony Hawk for mobile or the various Moto-X Freestyles) guarantee much better results. The downhill sessions, with a side view, are definitely better than the ramp, by the way. As for the sound, there is little to say: some MIDI music far from engaging, but at least it is possible to adjust the audio independently.
