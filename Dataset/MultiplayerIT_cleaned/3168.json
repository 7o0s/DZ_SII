In this way, the game finds itself in a situation similar to that of many other GOTY editions released on the market: in fact it is a product capable of offering the complete and most refined experience possible of the original, the purchase of which assumes a lot of sense for all those who have not yet tried the game (perhaps not many, at this point, at least as regards the most obvious audience of enthusiasts) but who see all the others now projected towards waiting for the next step and much more decisive by the development team, hoping at this point for a new chapter. This, however, cannot detract from the value of the game, because in fact DiRT Rally 2.0: Game of the Year Edition simply represents the best rally game on the market, which also solves the few drawbacks that emerged in the original and offers a real cornucopia of content to play, including cars to use and circuits to race. Codemasters is one of those teams that show their passion for video games in their works and the story of DiRT Rally passes right through the crystalline fixation for the racing world that has characterized the British studio since its foundation in the 80s. made a distillation of love for motorsport, in particular the one concerning the crazy races on dirt roads a few centimeters from abysses, trees, walls and so on. Started as an ongoing project through an early access phase on PC, the title was then consolidated with the release on consoles and with the arrival of the second chapter, up to this GOTY Edition which is in fact the sum of everything the work done so far by Codemasters on this series. It is generally defined as a sim-cade, above all due to the great scalability of the difficulty level and the simulation elements, but it is a title also designed for the more experienced, so much so that it does not easily forgive players for mistakes and requires at least a minimum of passion for the racing world so as not to be frustrating, given the price to pay for every slightest driving mistake. The complete experience For everything concerning the structure of the game, its basic mechanics and main features, we refer you to the review of DiRT Rally 2.0 by Rosario Salatiello, because that's the game, but this new edition significantly enhances the initial offer with an impressive amount of content, thus going to compensate for those gaps that represent the major weaknesses found in the original. Indeed, after the long evolutionary path of the first chapter, the players initially felt somewhat betrayed by the new reduction in content, in terms of tracks and cars, seen at the launch of DiRT Rally 2.0, with Codemasters having already foreseen an intense plan of DLC following its release, divided into four seasons. The solution, although it is now consolidated and canonical in the current videogame market, always remains a little indigestible, for this reason many had shown a little disappointment with the initial package of contents offered. Well, DiRT Rally 2.0: Game of the Year Edition from this point of view truly satisfies anyone, including all four seasons in DLC released after the launch and also adding the rich expansion Colin McRae: Flat Out, which adds another nice amount of racing and events all themed with the legendary Scottish driver. In short, to the accusations of having turned with the handbrake on on the content front, as regards the first release of last year, Codemastres responds in this case with a total of 81 selectable cars (which can be conquered in the race or unlocked depending on the events) and 26 new environments, with 12 themed courses only within the package dedicated to McRae. We therefore find the four seasons of additional content released so far and the DLC Colin McRae: Flat Out: those who already own the original title and at least one of the various season passes released during the year can access this package for free, which can be otherwise purchased separately, support for virtual reality viewers on PC has also been extended to all contents, in particular for Oculus Rift. To get an idea of the amount of content in this edition, between the four seasons and the further expansion, you can take a look at the infographic below, which summarizes the rallies, tracks and cars within the game. Allor this makes DiRT Rally 2.0: Game of the Year Edition practically unassailable, considering the quality already expressed by the original in terms of driving model and technical system and the amount of content that now supports it in this new version. The only front that remains uncovered at this point is that of novelty: it is still the same game released a year ago, which in purely technical terms did not already present enormous steps forward compared to what we saw in the first chapter, projecting us to this point waiting for a DiRT Rally 3.0 that we await with open arms, moreover at the threshold of the next gen with PS5 and Xbox Series X. Colin McRae - Flat Out So let's analyze the Colin McRae: Flat Out package, which represents the truly new introduction of this cornucopia of rally content, as well as the only real addition for those who already own the original with the season pass. Meanwhile, Codemasters' link with the Scottish driver is historic and can only move us further: beyond the most recent references, it's impossible not to immediately think of the historic 1998 Colin McRae Rally again by Codemasters, one of the titles that cemented the myth of the first PlayStation in the racing game field. The new expansion allows us to relive various phases of the legendary McRae's career, starting from the 80s to get to the consecration of the 90s, through the world title arrived in 1995 which made him conquer the record as the youngest driver ever to become Champion WRC extension. All this unfolds through 40 ~scenarios~ that refer to some characteristic stages of his career, from local races aboard Minis to the historic races held on a Subaru Impreza, moreover introduced as a new car in the S4 Rally and Legacy SR versions. Also present is the unpublished setting of Perth and Kinross in Scotland, to represent the beginnings of the pilot and his real ~home~ where he grew up in terms of driving, between the dirt roads and forests of northern Great Britain. In terms of variety of content, in terms of environments and cars, it is perhaps not comparable to the packages offered by previous Seasons, but this DLC is able to give a sort of additional ~story~, presenting a new Colin McRae-themed career. The latter is also interesting because it is divided into different situations: the ~scenarios~ in fact are not simple stages of a rally, but present different starting and victory conditions, ranging over historical moments and various episodes that manage to offer something truly new compared to what we have seen in DiRT Rally 2.0 so far.", "date": "2020-03-27", "grade": "8.7"}
