{"name": "Non  un golf per vecchi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/179213-golf-clash-non-e-un-golf-per-vecchi.html", "text": "If golf understood as a sport is undoubtedly elitist, its videogame incarnation is instead extremely popular: this is also and above all true in the mobile sector where games belonging to this genre abound, especially in its more arcade sense. In principle, therefore, the Golf Clash present here is anything but original, but just look a little more in detail to notice how the Playdemic product actually tries a different approach than usual: let's see what it is. . Golf Clash does everything right but ends up getting a bit bogged down in its free to play mechanics Fast golf Most golf games follow a fairly well-established script, which consists of a series of courses to be tackled by challenging artificial intelligence or human opponents in the usual goal of finishing the competition with as few strokes as possible. Golf Clash, on the other hand, starts from a different premise, starting up online competitions between two players that last the time of a single scenario picked at random from the software catalogue: whoever puts the ball in the hole first wins, and if both participants succeed with the same shots activate a play-off which rewards the one who gets closest to the flag with a single drive. Simple but effective premises, which rest on a decidedly skilled game system in offering great immediacy but without precluding a certain depth. During his turn, the user can use a special bird's eye view to select the range and trajectory of the shot he will carry out, with a box dedicated to more refined players that allows you to vary the point of impact with the ball to give an effect to the shot. Once this is done, the camera moves behind the ball, which must be dragged downwards with the finger to give it the desired power and released when a special arrow that swings from right to left is close to the center to obtain a perfect shot: at the increase in strength, the motion of the indicator becomes increasingly rapid, making things more difficult for those wishing to attempt a particularly long throw, triggering an interesting mechanism of risks and rewards. The direction and intensity of the wind, the slope of the course and the type of terrain in which the ball is located are all factors that must be taken into consideration, and it is therefore evident that Golf Clash is a title that - while remaining within the limits of 'arcade - can give some satisfaction even to the most seasoned players. Too bad that Playdemic has decided to get bogged down in an all too cumbersome system of progress, rewards and upgrades and which in the long run marks an indelible mark between those who decide to invest some money in virtual currency purchases and those who prefer to keep the credit in your pocket. Basically, for each match a sum of coins is withdrawn from the account of both players which goes to make up the prize money that the first place winner will win: moreover, the progress in the online rankings (with consequent access to the most prestigious tournaments) is determined by the number of cups in your possession, the number of which increases or decreases depending on whether you win or lose. By playing and completing certain actions, chests are then obtained (which to be opened require an outlay of gems or a more or less long waiting period depending on their value) containing cards useful for unlocking new clubs and balls with different characteristics: obtaining more specimens of the same type you can proceed to level up the indicated object, upon payment in a quantity of gold coins that is difficult to sustain without going through the inevitable in-app purchases. If all this already seems too bizarre, it should be noted that this is only the tip of the iceberg of the unnecessarily complex structure at the base of Golf Clash, to the point that it is no exaggeration to say that you end up wasting more time in the menus related to upgrades and purchases than on actual playing fields. It would have been much better to see Playdemic infuse all this effort into more constructive aspects to the actual gameplay, perhaps making it easier to play a game against friends or providing the application with support for asynchronous multiplayer.", "date": "2017-01-27", "grade": "7.4"}
