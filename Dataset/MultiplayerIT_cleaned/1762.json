{"name": "Medal Of Honor: Frontline", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-frontline_a.html", "text": "Wild porting The traditionally most interesting aspect in the case of porting is the strictly graphic one, and unfortunately we must consider how Medal of Honor: Frontline in this cubic incarnation has not enjoyed cosmetic upgrades worthy of the power of the Nintendo console. In short, the improved elements in the technical sector of the EA title compared to the PS2 version are few and not very relevant. Among these, however, immediately detectable is a compression of loading and saving times, rather slow on the Sony platform. In terms of actual game action, however, the only aspect that strongly differentiates the two versions under consideration is the fluidity, much greater in the Gamecube incarnation of Medal of Honor: Frontline. While not reaching very high peaks and presenting occasional but not too annoying slowdowns, the frame rate of the EA first-person-shooter still travels at absolutely discrete regimes, however far from the glories of titles such as Timesplitters 2 and Metroid Prime. Fluidity aside, the Gamecube version of Medal of Honor: Frontline can be said to be essentially graphically identical, for better or for worse, to that for the Sony black monolith. It goes without saying, therefore, that the textures present an often decidedly unsatisfactory definition (literally making your skin crawl in some cases), that the quality of the animations - facial and otherwise - of the characters on the screen is not always up to par and that the whole , in general, has an all too ~pc~ look, which could make some turn up their noses. In general, however, even if it would have been reasonable to expect more substantial improvements for this Gamecube version, the cosmetics of Medal of Honor: Frontline proves to have a moderate impact, especially as regards the care and definition of the various settings. The new advancing If on a purely technical level EA has applied the theory of the ~basic minimum~ in the conversion process, the US software house has certainly not wasted even with regard to playful contents. The single player mode has remained completely unchanged: missions, objectives, weapons and enemies are the same as in previous versions of the game. There was not even an attempt (which would have been really appreciable) to make the control system more precise, which, as in the PS2 incarnation, suffers from poor reliability in pointing operations. Obviously, the global quality of the product has also remained unchanged: therefore, also in this Gamecube version, Medal of Honor: Frontline is a fairly good quality FPS, extremely accurate as regards the historical background and the creation of the game scenarios (of great impact, in this sense, the initial level set in Omaha Beach during the terrible landing in Normandy), but absolutely not free from defects. Defects that could have been eliminated if only EA had faced the conversion process with greater commitment. Further confirmation of this thesis comes from the only real novelty of this cubic version of Medal of Honor: Frontline, or rather the multiplayer mode, really disappointing. What should have been the right remedy for a not too high longevity has instead turned out to be a useless and extremely incomplete surplus: also a victim of the aforementioned poor precision of the control system, the multiplayer mode of Medal of Honor also suffers from a disheartening limitation quantitative (only deathmatch is available, single or in teams, there are no bots and the modifiable parameters are very few) and of an arena design that is absolutely inadequate for the action, with scenarios that are either too extensive or too convoluted, or simply too uninspired. Comment Medal of Honor: Frontline is presented to Gamecube users substantially unchanged compared to the other versions: and if this is a good thing from a certain point of view, given the effective solidity of the game structure and the all in all discreet graphic design, the shortage of changes made by EA undoubtedly leaves a bad taste in the mouth. In addition to the wide margins for improvement of the graphics, Medal of Honor: Frontline could have become an excellent title if only the US developers had concentrated on eliminating the defects of the gameplay rather than ~engaging~ in the creation of a multiplayer mode of which, sincerely could have been largely done without. Ultimately a good game, but which, as often happens, could have been better. Pros: Intriguing setting and historical backgroundvery nice Excellent sound accompaniment A fairly challenging and captivating FPS Cons: Useless multiplayer mode Can be improved from a graphic point of view Inaccurate control system Scarce innovations compared to previous versions. As further proof of the fact that Gamecube is absolutely not a toy console dedicated to younger users, the latest exponent of the serious FPS series of war Medal of Honor: Frontline also arrives on the cubic Nintendo platform, after having entertained PC users and PS2. And just the time that elapsed between the publication of the first two versions and the one subject of this review had boded well for the addition of improvements to the latest edition. Improvements that are objectively there, but appear too marginal.", "date": "2003-02-11", "grade": null}
