{"name": "In caduta libera", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100959-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-force-mass-x-acceleration-in-caduta-libera.html", "text": "Many readers will probably remember Mirror's Edge, a particular and perhaps too underrated DICE title whose incredible gameplay novelty consisted in experiencing the adventures not in the simple role of the beautiful Faith, but rather of really ~being~ her, impersonating her thanks to the special dynamic shot from his actual point of view. It was therefore an ~active~ first-person shot, closely related to what one's character experienced and which thanks to Faith's agility returned truly unique sensations of participation. But what if this sort of ~intense first-person thrill~ were placed in an even more spectacular and unpredictable context such as extreme skydiving? To this seemingly unreasonable question, try to answer AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!(Force = Mass x Acceleration), whose title, with the annexed second principle of dynamics, in hindsight already represents a whole program by itself. Watch out below! With a perfectly onomatopoeic name, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!(Force = Mass x Acceleration) it could only deal with terrifying falls into the void, generally accompanied by just such a scream. The protagonist of the story is a courageous stuntman angry with the system who usually manifests his discomfort by parachuting into all kinds of obstacles, obviously trying to avoid them. The point of view is therefore the direct one of the stuntman: the breathtaking view is perfectly perpendicular to the ground and the special graphic effects will make the fall seem so real that you can almost feel the wind. In fact, the heart of the game is all here: being able to get to the ground while avoiding obstacles. Of course, however, there are also secondary objectives, interesting and able to make more fun what would basically be just the umpteenth demonstration of the force of gravity: in fact, during the flight phases you are totally free to move, using the sensitive accelerometers of your device iOS. The use of the sensors proves to be perfect and very precise in this case, even when holding the device in a vertical position (although it is still recommended to position it parallel to the ground). A simple and intuitive control system that contributes even more to the sense of identification; dodging buildings, balustrades and beams will be natural already after the first missions. Among the aforementioned secondary objectives is the ability to ~kiss~ a building or ~embrace~ a beam, that is, practically pass close to it during the fall; the success of this movement is indicated by a change of color of the obstacle involved and rewarded with a score resulting from the real proximity and duration of the brush stroke. Getting carried away playing AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAA!!!(Force = Mass x Acceleration) means that the risk bar is moved further each time: the type of approach in fact varies depending on how much you are willing to jeopardize your safety. For example, a fall can easily be tackled ~marginally~, that is, passing from the outside of the structures and approaching just every now and then to bring the fur home safely; but once you get used to the mechanics, the desire to cross narrow skylights, articulated buildings and rows of ~spiral~ beams will become irresistible and tremendously satisfying in terms of the score obtained. In the most difficult places to reach there are also bonus tiles to break, with an increasingly higher value depending on how easy or otherwise access is; the other evaluation parameters are the stunts performed while falling (which vary from rude gestures and the use of spray cans to graffiti performed literally ~on the fly~), the level of health of one's bones, subject to breakage in case of too violent collisions with the walls, and the precision in landing with the parachute, to be carried out within a precise area marked by a red circle. Based on the points obtained, jokingly called teeth, it will be possible to unlock the following missions, up to a maximum of 47, including some interesting tutorial videos. During the game there are also numerous paradoxical and amusing easter eggs, which we leave to the player the pleasure of discovering. What has already been mentioned regarding the sensation of speed transmitted by the game must be taken up again when speaking of the technical sector: this excellent result is in fact thanks to the incredible fluidity, perhaps allowed by the lack of real action (you do nothing but fall down) and by the simplicity of the elements present on the screen, given that the buildings are essentially parallelepipeds; however the whole is very colorful and witha good level of detail, such as to make the more experienced recognize the different American cities of setting. In general, therefore, a good job also from this point of view.", "date": "2012-04-04", "grade": "8.2"}
