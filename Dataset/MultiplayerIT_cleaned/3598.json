{"name": "A.O.T. 2: Final Battle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aot-2-final-battle-recensione.html", "text": "A.O.T. 2: Final Battle is the new edition of the tie-in of The Attack of the Giants developed by Omega Force and produced by Koei Tecmo. The subject of this review is the full version of the package, however also available as a simple update for those who already own the base game, although in this case at a frankly disproportionate price: 49.99 euros for the extra missions inspired by the third season of Attack on Titan, some new weapons and the Reclaim Territory mode seem a bit much to us. It is obviously a pity, because the publisher's choice will penalize the most enthusiastic fans of the franchise, those who bought A.O.T. last year. 2 and that they will have to wait for at least one discount before being able to update the experience with the new content. All while waiting for a new, inevitable episode that will make its debut in conjunction with the fourth and final season of the anime. Original gameplay and structure As reported in the review of A.O.T. 2, the game uses the expedient of the unpublished protagonist (strictly silent, to the detriment of the narrative rendering of the cutscenes) to make us retrace the events of the first two seasons of The Attack of the Giants within a story mode composed of various missions, in which we will obviously have to deal with the real characters of the anime and we will play a supporting role with respect to their actions. The yield of the three-dimensional maneuver is good, in some moments excellent: using the main buttons of the controller it is possible to shoot the harpoons and project forward rapidly, like new Spider-Man, swinging between the buildings located inside the walls and using the gas from the thrusters to get extra thrust in mid-air. The spectacular nature of these sequences is evident, and it is therefore a pity that in many situations these mechanics become chaotic and/or cumbersome: as long as the character manages to execute our inputs perfectly, the action remains fluid and offers even galvanizing moments for those who knows the work of Hajime Isayama, but it happens all too often to get stuck against a wall or to run into camera frenzy when moving close to a barrier or the targets are too numerous. However, where you are outdoors, in the absence of grips, the situation becomes really complicated but at least this faithfully reflects the original story and the prerogatives of the equipment that the soldiers use to face the titans. In this regard, the combat system works fairly well and offers great satisfaction when you manage to score an elimination, anchoring yourself to the scruff of the giant on duty and quickly projecting yourself against it to cleave it with your own blades. Here too, however, frustrating and cumbersome situations occur when the enemies remain on the ground or group together, causing the harpoons to be released and forcing us to choose different trajectories in order to score a valid shot. While on the one hand the choice of an unpublished protagonist, to be created using a fairly complete editor, diminishes the narrative value of some sequences, on the other hand it allows you to build an interesting RPG-style progression based on the materials collected and the technologies unlocked because our equipment gradually becomes more effective, with the possibility of purchasing sharper and/or more resistant blades, more capacious cylinders or capable of launching us at greater speed, grappling hooks with a wider range of action and so on. Xbox One goals The Objectives of A.O.T. 2: Final Battle include those of the original edition and a series of new achievements added for the occasion, which are obtained by completing the missions of the story mode based on the third season and above all by unlocking the contents related to the Reconquer Territory mode. New missions and content A.O.T. 2: Final Battle was created with the aim of riding the wave of popularity of the third season of Attack on Titan, and for this it adds a second independent story mode to the basic package, which can be tackled even without completing the original one, made up of missions which retrace precisely the last episodes of the anime. In this case, both the RPG progression and the anonymous protagonist are missing, since you put yourself in the shoes of the various main characters of the series based on what actually happens. The approach is typical of tie-ins, in which we try to transform even events that do not lend themselves badly to that type of interpretation into action, and this is why we move a bit between ups and downs, even with missions identical to each other, an abundance of optional assignments and narrated interludes.Some new weapons introduced for the occasion, such as the set of pistols and the Spears of Thunder, offer an interesting variation on the theme and allow you to eliminate enemies in a different way, often with less effort: it's nice that the developers have thought of shuffling the gameplay cards a bit, but the use of this equipment appears unbalanced on the challenge front and ends up trivializing fights that with standard equipment would require much more time and effort. The same discourse obviously applies to the transformation into a giant, which returns from the first episode for some of the protagonists. The unlocking of the missions sometimes follows a bizarre order, and thus it happens to arrive at the last chapter of a storyline and then relive certain sequences in the next: an apparently senseless choice, especially where the intention was precisely to follow the story of the third season faithfully. Unfortunately, getting to the end of the new campaign doesn't take a lot of time, especially if you focus on the main levels ignoring the optional battles, but luckily the Final Battle edition also includes another new mode, Reclaim Territory, capable of providing more substantial and lasting. Without following the plot of the Attack of the Giants in this case, you choose a character and manage a base with the aim of expanding the territories under the control of humans after the invasion narrated at the beginning of the anime. This means going to certain places and clearing them of the presence of the titans, of course, but also returning to the starting point and using the materials collected in order to expand and enrich the structures, build new equipment and so on. Finally, a few words for the technical realization: played on Xbox One S, A.O.T. 2: Final Battle seems to suffer from fewer uncertainties in the frame rate and pop-up effects compared to the original edition, but the improvements made to the experience are unfortunately limited to the minimum wage and in fact the chaotic and cumbersome situations to which we have persisted referenced throughout the review. Even on the front of the cutscenes, the work done appears a bit limited, with an overwhelming majority of static sequences which are however embellished by the excellent dubbing in Japanese (subtitled in Italian) and by truly inspired music.", "date": "2019-07-09", "grade": "7.0"}
