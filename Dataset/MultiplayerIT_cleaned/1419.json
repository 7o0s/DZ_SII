{"name": "Spellforce", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spellforce.html", "text": "It all starts with a disaster Almost all fantasy games begin with a tragedy, which it is up to the hero to face. In this case, the thirteen most powerful wizards in the world, in their constant thirst for power, have released such an amount of magical energy as to crumble the planet into a series of fluttering and floating islets, connected to each other by magical portals. These magicians have placed here and there some magical altars capable of evoking heroes and warriors ready to fight alongside them: these characters, called runic warriors (because their creation requires not only the altar but also a special rune that activates it ), are completely devoid of feelings and free will, they blindly obey their master, like robots or golems. Our hero is just one of these runic warriors, but almost at the beginning of the story the wizard who summoned him is betrayed by one of his assistants and imprisoned: the hero thus finds himself untied from his creator, alone in battle and capable of independent choices. The first phase of the game in Spellforce is character creation. The passages are typical of the role-playing game, and this clearly increases the illusion of the enthusiast: one must successively choose the sex, the external appearance of the face, the main and secondary specialization, the physical and intellectual characteristics (not plus race, despite the developers' initial plan: now the avatar has to be human, for plot reasons). We have already spoken with some diffusion of the creation of the character in the first look dedicated to SpellForce; here we reiterate the presence of the typical rpg specializations, with an evident inclination towards the D&D setting: it is possible to create the strong warrior, the agile archer or the intelligent wizard. The secondary specializations allow you to better define the preferences of your alter ego: the fighter can be specialized in light or heavy weapons, in armor or in shields; the mage can focus on elemental magic or healing magic, and so on. Intellectual characteristics (intelligence, wisdom, charisma) exclusively govern magical skills and not the dialogues or reactions of NPCs, which are predefined and do not depend on the chosen character. It all starts with a disaster The avatar is the only unit that remains under the player's control throughout the campaign; it is also the only unit that receives experience from combat and solving quests. Experience naturally leads to level advancement: with each passage, the hero gets two skill points and five characteristic points. With characteristic points it is possible to increase strength, constitution, dexterity, agility, intelligence, wisdom and charisma; each increase corresponds to an improvement in the actions connected to each characteristic: the use of weapons in hand-to-hand combat with strength, the ability to score with dexterity and so on. Certain major and minor specializations have certain characteristics as a requirement: for example, it is not possible to raise the skill in heavy weapons beyond a certain point without also increasing the strength at the same time. With the two skill points it is possible to increase the specializations already acquired or acquire new ones, provided that the requirements are met. Increasing an already acquired skill does not only result in an improvement in the performance related to that skill, but above all the possibility of using more powerful weapons or spells. In fact, almost all weapons and spells (with the exception of the simplest ones) have rather onerous requirements: in order to use the most devastating ones, you need to ~specialize~ your character, continuing to put points in the same skill area. Nevertheless, it is possible to create a character with many different abilities: at the expense of power, you will get a more versatile avatar, comparable to the multiclass characters of ~pure~ RPGs. A strategic interface At the end of the creation of the character we will find ourselves catapulted into the tutorial, or in the first mission of the campaign in case we had decided to skip it. The default view shows our character from above, with a setting very similar to the best-known real-time strategy titles. The interface is minimally invasive: the various resources in our possession are listed in a thin upper bar; at the bottom right is the minimap, which shows all the current game area already explored; at the bottom left is the selection window, which shows information about the selected unit or building; finally bottom centerthere are action buttons, with which we can give orders to our units. The only constant feedback in the play area is a green circle at the foot of our avatar and any other heroes summoned; all other units or buildings are highlighted only after our selection, which is done with a simple left click. The right click corresponds to the so-called ~quick action~: acting on clear ground will be equivalent to a move order, acting on an enemy will be equivalent to an attack order. It is possible to gather any type of unit in a group and assign a number to that group, so as to recall it more easily; it is also possible to select a hero within a group without deselecting the group itself, similar to what happens in Warcraft III. As you will have already noticed, all these features do not show anything innovative, and go to fit, on the contrary, in the more consolidated strategic tradition: the just mentioned Warcraft III can indeed be safely considered as the inspirer of most of the mechanics of the SpellForce interface. A strategic interface The ~role~ component of the game engine comes into play when we focus our gaze on our runic warrior and his heroic companions, who can be summoned through the appropriate altars and the appropriate runes. The management of these characters, in fact, is much more detailed than the management of heroes in other strategic titles. First of all, our avatar has a very detailed inventory, made up of the backpack and the objects worn. If he is able to use magic, he also has at his disposal a ~book of spells~ where he can learn arcane actions from scrolls, bought or found around; once learned, spells can be memorized and then cast on the play area. There is no limit to the number of times a spell can be cast once it is memorized; the only requirement is that the hero has enough mana, the classic magical energy that recharges over time anyway. The book of spells is also often used by non-magicians: in fact, sometimes even warriors obtain some special move, which is used in the same way as spells. The inventory screen has other pages as well; for example, there is a diary that keeps track of assigned missions and gives a brief description of each; there is the section dedicated to the detailed description of the character, used mainly when leveling up (only our hero levels up, all the other summoned heroes always remain in their initial conditions); there is a section dedicated to runes and one to ~projects~; we will talk about these two later. The inventory isn't the only new element of the interface: camera management is also particularly versatile, above all because it literally allows you to literally transform SpellForce, at least aesthetically, into a third-person role-playing game. It is sufficient to zoom in on the back of our avatar: the shot will ~paste~ in that position, and our character can also be moved using the keyboard arrows. This is certainly an element of originality, but these virtuosities turn out to be of little use in the end: the player is pushed to always keep the view at the maximum possible distance, so as to better control the situation from a strategic point of view; moreover, as we will see later, this attention to detail gives life to a particularly heavy game engine, with sometimes lethal consequences for playability. We build our settlement Generally each mission begins with our rune warrior as the only unit under our command; in rare cases the objectives can be achieved through a party restricted to the protagonist and a few summoned heroes, but most of the time to get to the bottom of it we will have to put together a very large army. To do this, you have to start from the beginning: summon some humble workers, have them build resource gathering structures, accumulate the necessary materials, build military buildings and finally train the longed-for soldiers. Your settlement can belong to one of six player races featured in SpellForce: humans, elves, dark elves, dwarves, orcs, or trolls. To start building you need two things: an altar of the appropriate race and a rune of the workers of the same race; we will always be in possession of these two things at the right time, so it's just a matter of using them correctly. It is enough to approach the altar,activate it via the rune and start training workers. A small element of innovation consists in the fact that the runes connected to the same race are not all the same, but are distinguished by a ~level~: there may be, to be clear, a rune of the level one human worker and a rune of the level three human worker. By using the second instead of the first, we will obtain decidedly stronger and more efficient workers; the result is that advancing with the campaign not only the power of our avatar advances, but also of the villages he created. Another new element is constituted by the ~projects~: initially, we will know only the projects of the simplest human buildings; to build the more advanced ones we will have to acquire the related projects, buying them or finding them around like any other object. Once the first group of workers has been summoned, it must be put to recover resources. The element of greatest distinction between the different races is precisely constituted by the different use of natural resources: some resources are needed only by certain races and therefore can only be harvested by them; others are gathered from all but used differently (for example, humans use stone and wood to build buildings; elves, however, use only wood). The collection can take place directly through our workers, or in a more sophisticated way by building structures dedicated to optimizing this important aspect. When the construction of a building dedicated to the collection of resources (for example, the woodcutter's hut) is completed, its builders are immediately transformed into ~craftsmen~, who can collect the relative resource much faster, and in some cases even create the resource from scratch (this is the case for example with wheat farms). Once you have accumulated a good amount of resources, it's time to think of some defensive structure to protect the settlement from enemies: our workers and craftsmen, in fact, are not particularly strong and are destined to succumb if targeted by the blows of a unit military; each race has its own defensive building, like the classic crossbow towers in the case of humans. The monument only supports a certain amount of workers and soldiers: to train more we need to build some ~headquarters~. Eventually, we can start summoning some soldiers; to do this, you need the appropriate buildings: the armory for close combat warriors, the archery area for archers, the temple for clerics, the academy for magicians and so on. It should be emphasized that often even these buildings need a craftsman inside them to function; moreover, the summoning of units always takes place at the monument: military buildings serve only as requirements, and sometimes also to develop technologies that enhance the related soldiers. Since the altar cannot be moved, it is impossible to summon units in other places other than those foreseen by the programmers: this greatly restricts the scope of applicable strategies, making it decidedly more prudent to lock oneself in defense for a long time rather than attempting to build outposts in other places on the map. It may be interesting to underline that the workers show a very self-sufficient nature: once assigned to the collection of a resource, it will no longer be necessary to deal with it for a long time. However, there are drawbacks: it is not uncommon for a woodcutter to provoke violent enemy offensives by trying in every way to cut down a tree too far from the settlement. As in many real-time strategy games, even in SpellForce the units show an innate suicidal tendency; at least in this case the matter is more justifiable, given that we are always in the presence of ~evoked~ units, devoid of real personality. However, we do not believe that this can console the player much from the settlement pulverized due to woodcutter or hunter: in these cases the speculative justification is very unsatisfying ... To arms Clashes with the enemy are perhaps the activity that keeps the SpellForce player most occupied. Whether it's enemy attacks, signaled by the classic sound warnings present in every self-respecting RTS, or whether it's our offensives, sooner or later (usually sooner) the word must go to arms. As we have already explained at length in the first look, SpellForce boasts as a spearhead among its innovations a combat system never seen before, called ~click'n'fight~ (click and fight). It is an innovation almost loudly requested by the", "date": "2004-01-08", "grade": null}
