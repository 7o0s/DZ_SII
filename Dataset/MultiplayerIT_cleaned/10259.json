That must be exactly what the programmers at Mad Processor thought, a Germany-based team that recently started programming on the Apple platform. And their debut title, Parcel Panic, is truly an excellent calling card. The hard life of the bellboy Those who have played the aforementioned Sega arcade will certainly find many similarities in Parcel Panic: here too it is basically a question of having to go from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Therefore, although the source of inspiration is clearly evident, the production of Mad Processor does not skimp on interesting ideas; first of all, the protagonist this time is not a taxi driver, but a delivery boy busy delivering parcels, or rather crates, across an island that acts as a theater for the action. Unfortunately, relaxation is definitely not part of our alter ego's job, since the fundamental element to constantly keep an eye on is a clock with its countdown; the time available is that which will therefore have to be used to make the greatest number of deliveries between hotels, farms, churches, ports, fast-food restaurants, and so on. By managing to reach the goal very quickly, it will be possible to obtain a bonus of seconds to therefore prolong one's activity, just as it will be decisive in this sense to bring all the crates dangerously positioned in the back of the van to their destination. Yes, because too aggressive jumps and curves can compromise the stability of the load, perhaps causing it to be lost (partially or totally) along the way. An element, the latter, which adds a further factor to the Crazy Taxi formula, with a decidedly pleasant result within the game economy. Obviously there is no shortage of shortcuts with sensational leaps against the laws of physics; the ability to identify them and use them to your advantage becomes essential to be able to obtain the best scores. The control system, very precise and reliable, is based on the accelerometer for steering flanked by two virtual keys for accelerating and braking or engaging reverse gear. If up to this point we have only talked about the positive aspects, however, it is also necessary to mention the shadows of Parcel Panic, fundamentally linked to longevity; the progression is limited to the possibility of unlocking the 4 vans, each with increasing top speed. Once you reach the last one, the challenge is therefore reduced only to improving your scores and obtaining the gold medals; there is a lack of objectives, online rankings and elements of sharing that could have partially resolved the situation. A bit little therefore, even in the face of the only setting which among other things is particularly small in size, limiting exploration and discovery to a few game sessions. From a technical point of view, however, the Mad Processor fatigue features one of the best 3D graphics among the games currently available on the App Store; fluid, detailed and well designed, with the far from obvious ability to adapt to various devices so as to offer an extra qualitative step to those who own iPhone 3GS or one of the latest iPod Touches.
