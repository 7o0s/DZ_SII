Where the monsters that inhabit the world resulting from the brilliant mind of Robert Kirkman are however moved by a primordial instinct and, generally, do not look good, the production Skydance Interactive has taken advantage of the opportunity to redo the make-up, restore a tone and justify the wait for a sequel that had the duty to demonstrate all the potential of virtual reality. After all, we are still talking about an ex-exclusive Meta Quest 2, a platform on which the game debuted in December 2022 in an unspecified form really enviable. Crude graphics, an A.I. an all too limited opponent, bugs and glitches of various kinds, a series of problems certainly due to the limits of the chosen hardware, but also a symptom of a vaguely schizophrenic design. Now that the game has given itself an extra life, we were able to play it again on PlayStation VR 2, enjoying it in the form it should have been from the very beginning. In our review of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution, in fact, you will find out why it is a simply unmissable title if you are attracted to virtual reality and have an innate passion for zombies. Few questions, lots of action If you know the version for Meta Quest 2, a quick and superficial glance will suffice to notice the progress made in terms of graphics by this re-edition of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution As the title suggests The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution is intimately interconnected to the first chapter, a bond established since the incipit of the adventure which not surprisingly starts a second after the interruption of the original. This means that, although the plot is not and does not want to be the main focus of the experience, as a newbie you will inevitably feel lost at first. There is a sort of summary of the previous episode, directorically suggestive and perfectly blended with the epic itself, but it is undeniable that despite the welcome initial smattering some details and certain references will still remain shrouded in mystery. If, on the contrary, you are not a first-time fan, it will take you just a handful of seconds to remind you that you are in the role of the unspecified Tourist, in a New Orleans obviously invaded by zombies, but above all disputed by different factions of survivors. Compared to the prequel you will have much less possibility of influencing the course of the plot through the classic multiple choices, but more generally, unlike the original, the attention is much more focused on pure action, with the NPCs more focused on showing you the next stage of the journey, rather than enriching the game world with their charismatic and controversial presence. There is very little time to familiarize yourself with the controls in The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution, as you will have to fight for survival from the first minute of the adventure The incipit itself, moreover, leaves very little room for introspection and adaptation from the game's mechanics. Removed the above summary and the optional tutorial, you are immediately thrown into the eye of the storm, pursued by the first zombies already hungry for the protagonist's flesh. The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution, moreover, is not a game suitable for those who are not accustomed to virtual reality. From accessibility, to the ability to juggle the various controls, the level of familiarity required is high. Teleportation is not enabled, to begin with, forcing the user to move the avatar only through free movement, a feature which alone favors the onset of the much feared motion sickness in the most sensitive to the phenomenon. To limit the damage, only one ally, namely vignetting, which limits peripheral vision while on the move. For the rest it will be just you, with (or against) virtual reality in all its potential, flexing its muscles on PlayStation VR 2 thanks to the cutting-edge features of the Sony headset. Every scenario of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution teems with detail, despite the emergent narrative struggling to get off the ground The glitches, the bugs, but above all the poor definition that had mortified the version for Meta Quest 2 are a distant memory. The magnificence of Horizon Call of the Mountain is not reached, nor that of Resident Evil Village to be honest, but it is undeniable that the OLED screen of PlayStation VR 2 is exploitedbest in the rendering of blacks and in returning a very clean image. The scenarios, as well as the polygonal models, which flaunt a subtle but characteristic cel shading, are teeming with details and contribute to an absolutely satisfactory overall graphic rendering and in line with the standards required of new generation hardware. The enhancement work, from this point of view, is absolutely commendable, a sign that the developers wanted to give their best after the half misstep made with the original publication. The magic of the night Many of the settings of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution are taken from the prequel The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution, we said, however, is a game based primarily on action. Passing over the careless plot, while praising the excellent graphics sector, it is undeniable that the creature of Skydance Interactive gives its best when it comes to the merits of the gameplay. As per tradition for this kind of experience, the game makes extensive use of the commands that exploit the gyroscopes and accelerometers of the two senses. The equipment can be controlled by literally grabbing the backpack placed on your shoulders. The torch is well clinging to the torso and from time to time it must be taken and shaken to be recharged. Knives, clubs and blunt objects must be placed on the side and every gesture to split, stab, cut limbs and brains of zombies must be mimicked. The same weapons must be reloaded by performing a precise sequence of gestures. The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution is perfectly capable of scaring you, even if you're comfortable with similar experiences At first, one is almost taken aback by the enormous range of movements to be performed with arms, shoulders and hands, but as soon as one becomes familiar enough, a double magic is triggered. On the one hand we appreciate the effective intuitiveness of each command, as well as the high degree of immersion that each of them helps to create. On the other hand, we realize how much relying on gestures, rather than buttons to press, gives the experience that pinch of unpredictability and insecurity, which increases the terror that arises in the most agitated situations. Pursued by a horde, for example, under pressure and prey to uncontrolled adrenaline, everything becomes more difficult to manage and even reloading the rifle becomes a complicated operation, exactly as it would in reality. The excellent control system is counterbalanced by a derivative but functional level design. Most of the settings that you can explore, in fact, are taken from the prequel, with little news on the front of the scenarios that can be explored for the first time ever. Once again, therefore, it will be a matter of exploring some neighborhoods of New Orleans in search of resources, as well as the places to reach to complete the assigned objectives. The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution arsenal has some new features including the tasty chainsaw You will always have to move with circumspection, carefully choosing your battles, aware that retreat is often the best weapon at your disposal. However, if with zombies it is not too difficult to lose track of one's tracks, when you have to face humans the weight of stealth in the economy of the gameplay increases considerably, especially when you find yourself with few bullets in your inventory. In these phases the A.I. enemy does not particularly shine, it is true, but having to contend with opponents that are too brilliant, given the already many difficulties inherent in virtual reality, would have made the experience unnecessarily frustrating. Finally, the sections set at night give a pinch of novelty to The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution. Just like in Dying Light, going out after the sun goes down results in a higher amount of enemies, but also in richer and more precious loot. The choice is entirely up to the gamer, most of the time, but it goes without saying that when you are forced to explore at night, you will experience the most intense and terrifying moments of the entire adventure.", "date": "2023-04-12", "grade": "8.0"}
