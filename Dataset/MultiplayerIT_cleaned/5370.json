Throughout the history of the Dark Knight, born way back in 1939, we have in fact seen a myriad of versions, naturally conceived thanks to his success. An extraordinary fame, which allowed the man-bat to soon cross over from comics, to land on television, in the cinema and for a long time now in the world of video games, where Batman can boast a decent curriculum. After having therefore seen all the colors also in the videogame field, our curiosity was immediately aroused at the announcement of Batman: The Telltale Series, dictated by the intention of understanding what kind of imprint the team would have put on Bruce Wayne's story specializing in adventures. Thanks to the arrival of Realm of Shadows, the first of five episodes, the time has finally come to find out. Good impressions but a few too many technical problems for the premiere of Batman: The Telltale Series! Bruce and Batman From a narrative point of view, Batman: The Telltale Series does not fit into any of the aforementioned retellings of Batman, thus giving the writers of the San Rafael-based team a chance to express their creativity. The choice was to place the adventure at the beginning of Bruce Wayne's activity as Batman, even if not quite at the beginning as told by Christopher Nolan in his Batman Begins, which Telltale actually proves to be inspired by. We are therefore shown a Dark Knight already known in Gotham City, but still divided by a series of moral choices intended to define his identity and the vision that the population will have of him. In light of this, it shouldn't be surprising if in this first episode (and we suppose also in all the others) we find ourselves largely wearing the role of Bruce Wayne, limiting instead the moments in which we are in those of Batman. This certainly does not mean that the action elements are missing, given that Realm of Shadows starts quite excitedly, showing us the superhero busy foiling a theft attempt at the Gotham City Town Hall. Similarly, the final part is still dominated by Batman, but before reaching it you go through a long central part where the superhero armor is hung on the dead man, to tell the story of the wealthy descendant of the Wayne family and the its relationship with the city. One day we find ourselves at a party in support of Harvey Dent's candidacy for mayor, while the next we find ourselves in front of the microphones of a press conference to present the structure intended to replace the Arkham asylum for criminals. All while at night the realm of shadows that gives the title to this first episode emerges, in which Telltale introduces a large number of characters that even the most superficial Batman connoisseurs will have no trouble recognizing. It does so by keeping in part some pillars of the story, such as the killing of Bruce's parents and the centrality of this event in defining the protagonist's personality, but also by mixing the cards a bit, with the aim of making sure that unfolding of the action is not foreseeable by those who know the life, death and miracles of the man-bat. After the two hours it took to complete Realm of Shadows, for example, we can't tell you whether or not Harvey Dent will become Two-Face, just as we don't know what to expect from what will become the Penguin instead. One particularly important twist involves the Wayne family themselves, shown differently than we've always seen. For the moment we can say that we are quite satisfied with the way in which the developers have interpreted Batman's story, indeed we feel like saying that the success of Batman: The Telltale Series will largely depend on how much the series will be able to continue on this line. Between investigations and quick time events For the most part, the gameplay of Batman: The Telltale Series is what the Telltale productions have accustomed us to, especially when we play Bruce Wayne. In this case, the game mechanics in fact put us in front of the classic series of dialogues in which the other characters take note of what we say with a lot of warning present on the screen, and then subsequently react accordingly. The dialogue phases are obviously necessary to define the plot and the personality of the various members of the cast, but it must be said that in some cases the developers have perhaps lingered a little too much in pointing out particularly well-known elements of the Batman universe, making some steps redundant. Turning instead to the superhero activity, Batman: The Telltale Series offersan inevitable action phase, accompanied by an investigation. The first of the two is based on a series of quick time events, which are also now a trademark of Telltale's adventures. However, for Batman it was decided to make a different use of this mechanic, the success of which is aimed at the possibility of concluding a fight with a special move. Even if the sequences are wrong, it will therefore be difficult to see the Dark Knight being slapped by any villain. Partly for this interesting reinterpretation, partly for the fact that there aren't so many action scenes, we can say that we have never felt a sensation of abuse from quick time events on our skin, and this cannot do that well. As we said, the second type of game that we experience as Batman is the one that exploits the investigation and planning skills of the greatest detective in the world. In one scene, for example, the player is called upon to combine some clues to reconstruct the events that happened shortly before, while in another one must prepare the attack on a villain's stronghold by defining the elements necessary to neutralize the various guards. Even if the puzzles proposed in these cases cannot even be defined as such, given their simplicity, they contribute to giving rise to an excellent alternation of the mechanics proposed during Realm of Shadows. We therefore feel like promoting what we have seen, even if in fact there is no shocking invention. All together passionately New to Batman: The Telltale Series is the so-called Crowd Play, which allows for the first time to play a Telltale adventure in ~multiplayer~. In reality, it does nothing more than pair a device such as a smartphone or tablet to your game, allowing those who own it to cast their vote on the occasion of the many choices proposed by the game. It is therefore a feature that can only be exploited by being in front of the same screen, given that the developers themselves have warned of possible malfunctions in its use via Twitch, due to the delay in streaming. In technical terms, Batman: The Telltale Series presents the comic style already seen in works such as The Walking Dead, unfortunately discovering the side of some sore points. On the Xbox One version in our possession for the review, we have in fact encountered problems of various kinds, including missing audio effects, out-of-sync dubbing, interrupted animations and quite evident stuttering, with serious consequences on the stability of the frame rate. But that's not all, given that the game froze more than once, forcing us to reload everything from the last automatic save. Taking a look at the reviews of the game on Steam it doesn't seem that things are better on PC, so before purchasing Batman: The Telltale Series it is essential to ask yourself whether or not you are ready to address the problems reported. waiting for a patch. As for the language, we point out the usual absence of Italian, both in the subtitles and in the dubbing. Speaking of the latter, Bruce Wayne's voice is the recognizable one of Troy Baker, now a regular on the videogame scene, however, who appeared in better shape on other occasions.", "date": "2016-08-03", "grade": "6.0"}
