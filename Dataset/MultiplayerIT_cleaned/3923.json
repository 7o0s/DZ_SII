{"name": "Dead Space", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-space-remake-recensione.html", "text": "The USG Ishimura, giant geostationary drillship around Aegis VII, gurgles, clangs, jerks, writhes, whispers. It is a grotesque and dilapidated lifeless carapace that drags itself to an indefinite point of the universe; a helpless, putrescent corpse harboring a deadly infection; iron sepulcher that guards and cradles a horde of staggering and bloody beings torn to pieces and then rebuilt by an indefinite, demonic, perverse entity. It shines with a gloomy neon light, in the midst of many shadows, in dark areas, in the sidereal void of the space that surrounds it and desperately tries to swallow it. What Dead Space offered was and is a majestically gruesome, unnervingly fascinating, splendidly anxiety-producing spectacle. We enjoyed that trip to hell, with a one-way ticket, back in 2008 and we never thought it would strike and captivate us with equal intensity, almost fifteen years and two generations of consoles later, with a remake that not only honors the original, but takes on the enormous responsibility of (re) igniting the desire to have more, to have more. If this remake wanted to be a soft reboot, with its novelties made to the gameplay, its spectacular graphics, its pleasant variations on the classic plot, the path is certainly the right one because, on balance, we are facing an excellent return , to a transposition that, albeit with some tiny flaws, completely convinces, to an adventure that will bring back sweet (and terrifying) memories in fans of the first hour and will cheer survival horror lovers set in deep space. Sit back, because in this review of the Dead Space remake we will explain in detail why we have never been so happy to board the USG Ishimura again. Scary like never before Dead Space knows how to give ominously bewitching glimpses Hyperbole and preamble aside, one thing is certain: we didn't remember Dead Space being so creepy and scary at all. Although certain frightening passages are still well etched in our memory, Motive Studio has worked so hard and so well, that they have completely turned the source material inside out, while keeping the overall look, inspiration and atmosphere intact. aboard USG Ishimura. For those who don't know the saga at all, Dead Space is a third-person survival horror set in a space vessel now adrift, inhabited and infested by terrible creatures that just don't want to know about dying. As engineer Isaac Clarke, who was initially sent to repair the spaceship's communication systems, you will have to survive the horror and, of course, find out what happened. Looking for the elements that made the increase in the terror factor possible, the main suspect can only be the graphic aspect, certainly the area that most catches the eye when talking about this remake. From this point of view, in no uncertain terms, we witnessed an absolutely convincing and extremely amazing show. As now happens in almost all the main titles that make their debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X | S, also in this case you can opt for two graphic settings. The first sacrifices something in terms of detail and anti-aliasing management, but gives the experience an enviable fluidity. The other boasts the best possible graphics, at the cost of a very slight and almost imperceptible slowdown of the image when the camera is rotated. Both graphics settings have their dignity: the constant 60fps are pure pleasure, but giving up a few frames per second, given the general pace of the adventure, won't weigh more than it should. Whichever you choose, however, direct comparisons to the original Dead Space powerfully debunk any memory sweetened by tender, romantic nostalgia. From the polygonal model of Isaac, to the light effects, to the details that characterize each scenario, the glance is damn satisfying and well testifies to the work done practically from scratch by the developers. Especially when the areas of darkness increase and one orients oneself guided almost exclusively by the torch incorporated in Isaac's weapons, the particle effects are better appreciated and how each surface reflects the light differently. Even the animations flaunt a surprising evolution, while also respecting the original material in this case. The protagonist still moves as if crushed by the weight of his suit, the Necromorphs are horrified also and above all by their syncopated and limping gait. The story of Dead Space is not told solor through words... Speaking of the fetid creatures you'll have to fight, the algorithm that manages their dismemberment has been further enhanced and refined. If limbs and heads jump as in the past, obviously with more credible and bloody visual effects, even the epidermis that covers the rotting limbs undergoes evident alterations. Especially in the more resistant Necromorphs, using some weapons such as the flamethrower, you will witness a progressive and evident deterioration with each blow inflicted. In short, it will often happen to be enchanted by some glimpses that the USG Ishimura will be able to give you. The density of details, which clearly testify to the horror that has taken place and is being consumed on board the space vessel, will force you to linger on some element of the scenario, while animations and special effects will help make each fight as spectacular and violent as possible possible. The scenarios of this remake of Dead Space are teeming with debris, dismembered limbs, pieces of the USG Ishimura itself You don't just live on graphics, however. In fact, the sound also contributes to creating the climate of constant tension and anxiety. The songs, obviously, put their own, all excellently remastered and ready to signal imminent dangers and unwelcome presences in the area. The big credit, however, goes to the effects and the masterful sound design work. The USG Ishimura whispers, jingles, gurgles, howls, makes rumbles. Silence is only partially guaranteed in the open space sections, where everything becomes more muffled, but be prepared to jump continuously at an unforeseen noise, produced by who knows what and coming from who knows where. Especially played with a good pair of headphones, or being able to count on a home theater worthy of the name, you will struggle to control your heartbeat, constantly afraid that something might suddenly attack you from behind (even in the real world). Small and big changes Curious to discover the face of Isaac in this remake of Dead Space? Don't worry, it's practically the first thing you see in the game Dead Space respects all the canons of the genre, including scares and sudden apparitions. From this point of view, the remake has only partially made substantial changes, limiting itself to shuffling the cards a bit and introducing features that would have been appreciated only starting from the second chapter of the series. As anticipated, we are talking about a third-person survival horror with a camera placed behind the protagonist. Some puzzles are solved, each scenario is explored in search of collectibles and resources, one tries in every possible way to survive the hordes of Necromorphs that will appear in front of you with a certain frequency. The pace, a bit like in Resident Evil 4 after all, is set upwards, but without the peaks reached in action or in any shooter, if only Isaac can't even rely on a dodge or a dash to avoid enemy attacks. The QTEs with which you can free yourself from the grip of enemies also return in this remake of Dead Space In short, a pinch of strategy is needed in the clashes, especially since you can get the better of the Necromorphs especially by dismembering them, a practice that also makes them progressively less dangerous and agile in their movements. From this point of view, the various weapons you can count on are very useful. In addition to the flamethrower and the Contact Ray, which works like a sort of shotgun of the future, the other mouths of fire all aim to cut and truncate, each with different methods and timing. In short, newbies will enjoy an absolutely terrifying, satisfying, and challenging classic survival horror at the right point, thanks to the various levels of difficulty proposed and capable of adapting the experience to any need and ambition. Longtime players, for their part, will have to deal with an experience that is known after all, but not without surprises. To begin with, most of the puzzles have been changed. Again, everything remains familiar, but the resolution provides alternative mechanics and solutions to the original. You never really get used to the sight of Dead Space's Necromorphs The zero-gravity zones of the phases in which Isaac will be able to benefit from the unprecedented free movement have been increased. If in the original you could only proceed in a straight line, from platform to platform, in the remake, as happens in Dead Space 2, you can use the thrusters of the suit to move in any direction. Unfortunately, although some developer proclamations had suggested otherwise, these sections remain limited and predeterminate within well-defined areas and far from large. To be clear, no extravehicular walk to reach the various sections of the USG Ishimura in an alternative and choreographic way. Among the novelties, it is also worth mentioning the progressive unlocking of some areas, based on the access keys obtained, a feature that encourages backtracking both for obtaining new equipment and for completing some optional missions. Dead Space is certainly not a game for those with a weak stomach The plot has also been modified, while broadly respecting the story already appreciated in 2008. Isaac, for example, speaks and even shows himself without a helmet. The protagonist, with this modification, certainly comes out more characterized than in the past, but the jokes that have been entrusted to him and the reactions he shows in the face of certain events are not enough to make him a completely credible character and completely immersed in horror which he is living in spite of himself. A real shame, especially since the variations from the original contribute to making Dead Space more interesting, generous with details on the game universe and, in general, engaging. Even the alternative ending, which can only be unlocked by completing all the secondary missions before the epilogue, suggests further novelties for the saga.", "date": "2023-01-26", "grade": "8.5"}
