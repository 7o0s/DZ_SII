{"name": "FIFA 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09-recensione_a.html", "text": "Comment 9.1 FIFA 09 is truly a football simulation packaged in every smallest detail, which gives the player full control of the match, tactics and offers extensive customization in this sense. Improved response to commands and animations, with believable artificial intelligence and a truly impressive number of modes and options, both offline and online. Of course there are still some defects both from an aesthetic and gameplay point of view, but we can say without too many hesitations that currently its level of completeness and simulation is not rivaled by any other product on the market. After several years, therefore, a title belonging to the FIFA series receives a vote higher than nine, bearing in mind its sometimes extreme vocation towards realism and that it is an evolution, especially for those who played UEFA Euro 2008. In waiting (which will be short) for a response from the competition, we can do nothing but fully promote the title and recommend it to the always numerous avid football simulations. Pros Improved and simulative gameplay Exceptional online compartment High customization Cons Aesthetic representation of players to review Some imperfections in physics and perk management All against all If offline this new FIFA has a lot of meat in focus, the perfect nemesis is online, which is consecrated even more for completeness and management of online matches. In reality we would like to start from the replays, which in addition to having a previous duration of 10 minutes (and extensive management of cameras and everything) allow you to save snapshots which can then be shared online and downloaded by other users, like personalized tactics for each teams. Ranked matches with all the statistics of the case, tournaments and more are borrowed from the previous chapters and always work well, but there are two new features that will appeal to those who chew bread, online and connected communities. The first is represented by the challenge between 10 human players against 10 others, for a result that will rarely find a coordinated game development among all, but which is extremely fun and works well even in a lag key, which gave very few failures in our tests , although we will be able to fully express ourselves in this sense only after the game is available to a large number of users. Closely connected to the previous one is the one called Club, which to give the idea somewhat takes up the concept of the Clans in first person shooters. In fact, one is created, complete with name, manager and other information, and up to 50 people can register who, with a maximum of 10 people at the same time, can challenge other clubs around the network and create their own tournaments and measure one's results in the general classification and perhaps recruit other people, another piece in an online sector which today represents the flagship compared to the competition. We conclude our article by pointing out the support for the vibration of the Dual Shock 3 and the non-introduction of trophies on PlayStation 3, even if their future implementation is not excluded; as far as the Xbox 360 version is concerned, while preserving a more in-depth analysis in the near future, we can say that it is virtually indistinguishable in terms of technical and options (and leaving the preference of choice to pad and online platform), lacking only FIFA Interactive World Cup, not yet ready at the time of writing this review. Many lights and few shadows A big flaw of the previous chapters, or the poor feeling of physicality in the contacts between the players, has been definitively fixed here, with the players waving their arms, winning tackles if more physically equipped and really interfering in the race or preventing shots and passes. The pace of the game is then marked with the right speed, being neither too frenetic nor vice versa slow, with in any case the possibility of adjusting the speed on three different levels. There is also the entertainment component, thanks to the various usable tricks, impressive in number and some even useful, up to the skill of the strongest players in performing more spectacular shots, without however becoming unrealistic, such as for example when in a game we headed to the back with Messi who, pressed by his opponents, crossed with a rabona for Aguero, who headed in, unfortunately on the post. And again, the celebrations are a real mini-game in their own right, with some simple, others complex up to real ~final moves~ whose consultation is available in a special menu in the options. But there is room forfurther improvements and for some criticisms, above all for the management of the shots, which clashes a bit with the realistic vocation of the rest and sometimes sees preposterous trajectories and not perfect physics, or for the behavior of the players in conjunction with high balls or crosses, where sometimes they seem dazed for an instant, exhibiting unnatural movements or, in extreme cases, wasting precious time on counter-attacks. On the other hand, the management of the advantage rule is completely wrong, in our view, which is given only if a player of one's team touches the ball immediately after the foul. If, on the other hand, for example, he is completely alone, perhaps ready for a clear goal opportunity, the referee will see his partner's foul called, which can sometimes even become frustrating, as has happened on some occasions of game. Realism in the middle of the field The impact with the match is absolutely satisfactory, the reproduction of the fields has excellent textures, the public is starting to get interested and the stadiums are well cared for, especially in weather conditions such as sun or sunset (there is also rain) , with the title makes extensive use of HDR for the lighting effects, which certainly give an interesting and pleasant look. We are not there yet, in our view, as regards the likelihood of players with their real-life counterparts. In fact, there are few well-made footballers in this sense, and seeing some of them like Totti being a distant relative of the real pupone makes one turn up one's nose in the face of a more than valid technical sector. Also because the real strength is represented by the animations, some of which are truly exceptional and which shine in variety and number, also acting as a point of connection between the graphics and the gameplay. In fact, the evolution and improvements of FIFA 09 start from here, with lots of new animations and a more immediate response to commands that restore a different feeling with the different players, for a match simulation that definitely aims at realism, also by virtue of the fact that shots and passes can be set to completely manual mode. In this sense, playing a match is extremely satisfying, you manage to set up maneuvered actions, the coverage of the field by the players is more credible and indeed your teammates often start dictating the pass with their hands, which at the same time increases the identification and denotes improvements in the Artificial Intelligence sector. This can be further appreciated thanks to the introduction of Custom Tactics, represented by a series of parameters that can be modified and affect, for example, the percentage of short or long passes made by the team rather than the pressing frequency or more or less risky passes what your teammates will choose to do. These tactics prove to be even more useful in Be a Pro mode, where by controlling a single player it is essential that the rest of the team does as he wishes. Other strengths of the gameplay are represented by the absence of rails near animations or side lines, which give an excellent sense of freedom, as well as in the perfect balance of the players and the right difficulty of performing dry dribbling, which can also be performed by adequate practice. Coaches and young promises But this is only the pinnacle of the extreme customization of the EA title, because by accessing the various menus in the ~advanced~ configuration, everything can be modified, up to the player editor, which although not as deep as that of the competition , has been further improved compared to the past. However, those who do not have an online connection have different game modes available, starting with being able to create tournaments and championships of any kind, passing to the coach mode, which returns substantially unchanged with a rather simple management and which covers a few aspects such as salaries , fielding (and possibility to play), sponsors and improvement of players and staff, up to an unprecedented called football party, which allows up to 20 players to participate, even controlled by real people. In this case each team will start with 3 different types of bonuses, such as starting the match with a few goals or giving 7 yellow cards to the opponent, which can only be spent once throughout the tournament. However, there are 10 of them that can be conquered by completing certain conditions during the course of the game itself. Do not miss the now tested ~Be a Pro~ mode, in theto which a player is created and controlled from scratch or a famous one is chosen and accompanied throughout the course of his career, with the aim of becoming a starter, wearing the captain's armband and finally being called up for the national team. In the 09 edition there is also the possibility of being signed for another team, a pity that the whole thing lasts only 4 seasons, choking the longevity at a certain point. Completeness and customization The menus, the game interface and the arena are something that gamers know, and once again the first player with whom you can practice during the uploads is Ronaldinho, on the Milan side, to then access the plethora of options available for the game, some of which are completely new. The first strong point of Electronic Arts production is certainly represented by the licenses, which see the presence of the major European championships, some even international, not counting the national ones. Indeed, taking the example of Serie A, some teams lack an official shirt (see Naples and Bologna) but enthusiasts in this sense will find modules, players and transfers in exactly the right place, thanks to the possibility of constantly updating the squads via an Internet connection . In this sense, a further novelty is represented by the Adidas Power League, a modality made up of different championships that can be activated (the first is free, the others for a fee) to download all the information on the players, the variations in performance and physical form or the injuries, which will then also be reflected on the digital counterparts, in such a way as to create maximum realism. The stadiums, which are over 40 and include some of the most famous in existence, and the balls, of various well-known brands, are part of the excellent care taken by the developers in this sense, also because they have repeatedly stated that they have listened to all the proposals and the criticisms made by users towards the previous chapters. After trying FIFA 09 we can't help but appreciate this thing, which already appears from the menus and from all the selection of match parameters. The controllers, for example, are fully modifiable in each key (allowing therefore to associate movement also to the digital cross rather than running to the R1 backbone, who said PES?), the music can be excluded or not from the chosen playlist, the various cameras of play, in addition to a subset of those already available, are also customizable in any aspect, from the height with respect to the playing field up to the angle of the camera itself.", "date": "2008-10-03", "grade": null}
