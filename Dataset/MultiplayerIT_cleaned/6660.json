The protagonist is always Talion, engaged in an adventure that does not have a precise location in the continuum of the main campaign: we simply find ourselves alongside the already known dwarf hunter Torvin, committed to eradicating the threat of five Uruk commanders who have managed to dominate the beasts that populate Mordor, becoming even more dangerous. Will this be enough to justify a return to Middle-earth? Monsters commanding monsters Let's start by saying that Monolith didn't start off exactly on the right foot, committing what appears to be a macroscopic conceptual error. The DLC is in fact completely detached from the original campaign, and to play it you need to select the appropriate menu item that appears following the download of the content: this means that instead of being a real expansion, Lord of the Hunt is more of a short experience in its own right, with all the consequences that this entails. To begin with, the progress made by the user in the main adventure is beautifully ignored, and you find yourself with all the skills unlocked and the runes removed from your weapons; moreover, even if the setting is the same as the second part of the game (we are therefore talking about the Nrnen Sea region), the contents are not shared, so challenges, events, collectibles and even the orcs of the Nemesis system remain confined to their belonging area. All dissonances that are difficult to digest, which could have been overlooked only if Lord of the Hunt had been able to offer a truly worthy playful experience, an eventuality which unfortunately did not occur. As anticipated, Talion's goal in this new adventure is to kill five commanders, each linked in some way to the frightening fauna that populates the game scenario: in terms of gameplay, Lord of the Hunt is even excessively concerned with accompanying the user on his journey, placing him in front of a guided path that clashes with the feeling of freedom that instead represented one of the strengths of The Shadow of Mordor. In the two hours sufficient to complete the campaign, we therefore find ourselves repeating the same simple plot: we accompany Torvin on missions which in fact are little more than tutorials to learn new techniques for capturing and exploiting beasts, after which the The game automatically highlights the commander to be killed (thus also removing the pleasure of interrogating his subordinates to find out their weak points) and there is nothing left to do but eliminate him by putting what he has just learned into practice. However, all debased by a low level of challenge due to the full powers of Talion and the even excessive effectiveness of the new runes that can be applied to weapons. Lord of the Hunt is a DLC that is far too modest in structure and content Best of the beasts Too bad that Monolith got the short arm for this expansion, because the hunting area could have opened up much more complex and interesting scenarios in terms of gameplay and which instead appear only hinted at in this DLC. Hence, an excellent idea such as the presence of the five commanders linked to the beasts is substantially wasted if we consider that, once these objectives have been eliminated (moreover in battles that can give moments of great impact), the Uruk who take advantage of them place they turn out to be ~normal~ enemies without any beast at their service. Furthermore, those that on paper are passed off as new creatures to dominate actually prove to be simple variants of specimens well known to the player: the Caragors are replaced by the Caragaths, equal in all respects but capable of stealth killings, while the Graug Horneds differ from their kin in the ability to spit venom at enemies. The Ghl deserve a separate discussion, given that they have not undergone any modifications but can be actively exploited by Talion: by shooting an arrow at their nests, in fact, it is possible to recall them from the subsoil (even in broad daylight, relieving the user of the need to wait for darkness) and take control of their minds and then use them as a small personal army. Also in this case, the potential would have been considerable, but Signore della Caccia is ~content~ to exploit such an element for a couple of missions and then leave the player totally devoid of stimuli to usere that resource again. To complete the picture of an objectively rather disappointing DLC, finally, a new skin for Talion and the Proof of Nature mode intervene, or a challenge that requires you to kill all the Uruk captains and commanders in the shortest possible time.", "date": "2014-12-23", "grade": null}
