Seventeen years have passed since the events of Suikoden II, but don't ask us to tell you about them for two reasons: the first is that there would be so much to tell; the second is that we are relatively interested: Suikoden III, moreover, is set in a continent far from the one dominated by the Empire of the Scarlet Moon, but not without its problems. Problems that, once again, see a diabolical force intent on taking over the whole world, a mission that can only be implemented by exploiting the immense powers of the legendary True Runes. And while evil conspires behind the civilizations that populate this portion of the planet, Destiny begins to bring together once again a handful of individuals, the only ones capable of overturning the fate of the world. Chris Lightfellow is the Silver Lady, proud and courageous captain of the guards of the noble city of Vinay Del Zexay, torn between military duty and his human conscience. Geddoe is the mysterious leader of a team of mercenaries from the merchant city of Le Buque, a man who seeks to escape his past carrying the eternal burden. Hugo is the young son of the head of the Karaya clan, an honest peasant people who live by nature in the Grasslands, who will have to learn the meaning of honor and justice despite his proud and impetuous character. Thomas is a young man from a distant region who is suddenly given the position of Lord of a decadent castle, who will have to find within himself the confidence and courage of his actions. Kuroku is just a dog. Luc we can't tell you, or we'd spoil more than one surprise for you. All of them don't know it yet, but they will have a predominant role in the course of the events that will upset their lives and those of all those who are dear to them, because the Flame Champion, legendary hero of ancient wars and holder of the True Rune of Fire, is returning, and its advent is prophetic synonym of death and ruin...Or maybe not? Battles, Duels and Wars Suikoden III is a Japanese-RPG, this obviously implies the massive presence of fights to the death with creatures of all kinds: men, animals, monsters, etcetera. Since the first episode, however, Konami has been able to mix the old with the new in a truly intriguing way, and also in this case the old, or the classic random clashes between the player's team and that of the enemies, is mixed with heavy innovations in three precise moments of digital violence. The first, more widespread, consists of the random fights that take place while crossing particular danger zones: in this case, the player takes control of a team of six units arranged in pairs in three rows, opposed to a team of enemies. The first innovation (also for the series itself) consists of the orders that are given to the units: rather than assigning a precise command to each player, the player chooses the action by file, and while a unit carries it out, the partner acts according to to his nature. This system, initially quite complex to master, turns out to be ingenious and particularly strategic in the long run: if for example we decide to cast a spell, we will have to worry that the executor's partner is able to cover it and fight in its place; de facto, in Suikoden III the casting of a spell is always preceded by a period of time (variable according to the skill of the caster) during which, if the magician is hit, the rite can also be broken and blocked. If we consider that each unit in possession of the magical Runes has a fixed number of spells available, once reset, it will be necessary to rest in order to recharge it, then it is easy to understand the depth of this first battle system. As if that weren't enough, the aforementioned spells no longer affect only the targets, but sometimes entire areas: in that case, the AI of the autonomous characters could be a hindrance, if they decide to attack the enemy ignoring an impressive incoming spell on the area... However, a little practice and a few precautions are enough to avoid the (self)destructive consequences of the case. And again, to complete the picture, how can we fail to mention the combined attacks, which have always been a prerogative of the Suikoden saga? Insert two or more particularly similar characters into a team, and you can enjoy spectacular mass attacks with (almost) always deadly results... The second moment of war is represented by short duels, which sometimes the story imposes between two particular characters: in this case, it will seem like playing Chinese paper, as there are only three actions available, and each one influences the other in a decisive way; prevent, therefore, the opponent's attacks by instinct or calProbabilistic analysis is the key to these thrilling clashes of the titans. The third moment is the one that unfortunately in Suikoden III is less convincing, whereas in the prequels it was one of the most sensational: these are real wars between two or more rival armies. In Suikoden III this battle system has undergone heavy transformations: on a map the player will have to move units commanded by some leaders, and making the best use of some special skills and his own intelligence, he will have to accomplish some objectives, such as surviving for a certain number of rounds, defeat the enemy or conquer some areas. Among other things, these are the riskiest battles, because there is always the risk of losing one of your characters forever. Which brings us to the next paragraph of this review The Trinity Sight System and the 108 Stars of Destiny We have said that in Suikoden the characters directly involved in the story are mainly six. Initially, in fact, the game will lead us to the Trinity Sight System selection menu: it is a brilliant invention by Konami (well, not so brilliant, since Enix had already thought of it in a very similar way in his Star Ocean: The 2nd Story for PSOne) which allows us to tackle the adventure from the individual points of view of the three central characters - namely Chris, Geddoe and Hugo (Thomas, Kuroku and Luc will be ~unlocked~ by performing particular actions). This system complicates the plot of the game even more, as certain events drastically change meaning from one perspective to another, in an engaging and continuous succession of twists and turns. However, it would be wrong to consider only the six main heroes, given that in reality the beings who will change Destiny (whether for good or for evil, who can say?) are many more... to be exact, as many as 108. 108 Stars, in fact, we will be able (but we will not have to, for the sake of precision) recruit before the final battle, 108 characters who will frighteningly expand our adventure, adding sidequests, special events, hidden locations and more. Furthermore, the 108 Stars influence the evolution of Thomas's Budehuc Castle: as per tradition, even in Suikoden III it will be possible, at a certain point in the game, to obtain a sort of fortress complete with every comfort, shops, minigames to try and much more even more. In this third episode this experience is expanded by the multitude of novelties and possibilities offered by the power of the PS2, and in a certain sense the Budehuc Castle, and the related search for the 108 Stars, offer an extra challenge to the already difficult and very long progression of the game. adventure, divided into a total of eighteen chapters. There's no rose without thorns As we said at the beginning, the Suikoden saga is traditionally played on this contrast between the incomparable depth of the gameplay and the decidedly improved visual quality. Honestly, we doubt that even for this third episode Konami wanted to repeat the tradition. In reality, graphically, Suikoden III is extremely contradictory. To begin with, the polygonal models of the characters, although very accurate in detail and in the splendid texturing, appear squat and woody, roughly animated, especially in combat. On the other hand, the locations show an attention to detail and the environment that is nothing short of maniacal: to make a comparison, the quality of the interiors far exceeds that of the hitherto unbeaten Grandia 2. The exteriors, then, can be classified as visual magnificence : wide expanses that extend to the horizon; dense forests dimly lit by sunlight; vast cities teeming with life, equipped with inns, markets, shops, public squares; dark and gloomy labyrinths full of pitfalls... In short, there are all the visual clichs of the fantasy genre (including the multi-ethnicity of the characters), theoretically enhanced by the capabilities of the PlayStation2. Theoretically. In fact, this visual orgy forces the normally stable 60fps to drop monstrously in overcrowded exteriors, while some more extensive interiors (dungeons, in particular) suffer from an unbearable structural monotony, forcing the player to move from one point to another with very few deviations. Even the sound aspect suffers from ups and downs: some tracks are simply splendid (such as the opening one, which accompanies the spectacular introductory animated sequence, which dwarfs Don Bluth's productions), various, characteristic by location, never boring, sometimes exciting (as in the case of some bosses); a few others are nothing short of unbearable, annoying and monotonous; in still other cases a gloomy silence descendsor, which in particular makes the dialogue sequences devoid of bite, entrusting the player's involvement to the visual direction alone. Overall, however, there isn't much to complain about, even if the aforementioned defects appear particularly serious when contrasted with a game of such playful and conceptual perfection. Definitely.. Suikoden III is a very special JRPG. Basically, it is the godsend for any enthusiast, who will find in the game codes everything he has always looked for in the last five years, dominated by dull and shallow adventures from a gameplay point of view. Physically, it is a game whose strength is also a weakness: Konami focuses too much on the depth of the playful experience, neglecting the care for the technical aspect, which Suikoden III has in common, on certain occasions, with some first or second PS2 games generation. In fact, it is a sometimes entrancing, sometimes fluctuating visual / sound quality that prevents casual-gamers from appreciating the title for what it really has to offer. Here, Suikoden III perhaps sins precisely in this area: it must necessarily be ~lived~ for several hours, and a quick and superficial test does not allow you to grasp its many merits in the slightest. After all, the adventure itself requires about 60 hours to complete without too many problems, if you then want to engage in the discovery of every secret, enemy, mission, character and event (not to mention, then, that the multiple choices to be made during the course of the game they act directly on the unfolding of the plot, changing it heavily), then Suikoden III is able to tear you out of your social life for more than 80 hours. Ultimately, Suikoden III is a game that neither a fan of the saga nor a fan of the genre should miss. All the others, if they don't want to overcome the difficult initial impact to immerse themselves in the exquisite juice of the game, can turn to other equally valid titles, such as Wild ARMs 3 or Final Fantasy X, aware, however, of missing out on a true masterpiece of the Japanese Role Playing Game. Pros: Excellent, original and complex plot Unparalleled depth of gameplay Long, challenging, full of extras and side-quests of all kinds Cons: Technically not always up to the hardware ... sooner or later you end up ... Genso Suikoden literally means ~Empire of the Scarlet Moon~ in Japanese. And in fact, this terrible Empire has always been the focal point of two RPGs that bear the title, released between 95 and 98 for Sony PSOne. Two lightning experiences, born from the brilliant minds of Konami (mother of Silent Hill, Metal Gear, Winning Eleven, just to name a few titles), which have been able to win the hearts of thousands of players around the world. But that's not all: the two Suikoden are tangible proof that it's not the spectacular graphics that make a game a masterpiece, given that the rather antiquated aspect has always been balanced with a truly unparalleled depth of gameplay and plot. Many prefer the Suikoden saga to the much more famous Final Fantasy series. And after a few years of hiatus, Konami tries again, and this time it does it in style, on PlayStation2: but this time, will it hit the bull's eye?", "date": "2002-12-20", "grade": null}
