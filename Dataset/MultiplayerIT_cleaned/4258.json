We Westerners know how to be ruthless towards it: we generally consider them repetitive, bland, chaotic and mediocre titles. The Japanese, on the other hand, love them and think we don't understand anything about video games. The truth lies somewhere in the middle because the musou have actually made enormous strides in recent years, becoming increasingly complex and rich in many respects. The developer Omega Force is certainly the most competent in the field, having created dozens of original musou or inspired by important brands such as One Piece, Berserk and Dragon Quest. That's why Nintendo, a few years ago, entrusted The Legend of Zelda to Omega Force so that, with the contribution of Team Ninja, it would make it a musou. It was a risky experiment which, however, was very successful at home, leading to the creation of the most recent Fire Emblem Warriors. Nintendo on Hyrule Warriors took us a long way. The original 2014 release for Wii U was followed by various DLCs and an interesting conversion for Nintendo 3DS which, in the face of a miniaturized technical sector, however, has introduced quite a few changes for the better in an otherwise outdated structure and not very suitable for Western tastes. With the new edition, truly definitive, Nintendo brings to Switch a more complete experience in every aspect, especially in terms of content: Hyrule Warriors Definite Edition includes all the improvements made with Hyrule Warriors Legends, all DLC, all characters and there is also room for some tweaking that absolutely does not hurt. In short, if you like musou, the next few lines could interest you a lot. Parallel universes here too Legend mode is the heart of Hyrule Warriors and tells the story of a band of heroes from different dimensions who come together to face a threat that threatens to destroy them all: the witch Cia is in fact collecting the fragments of the Triforce to awaken the evil Ganondorf. Link, Zelda, Impa and many other characters - among which Linkle stands out, the unreleased female Link originally introduced in the Nintendo 3DS conversion - will meet and clash at the head of huge armies. In fact, the player only controls the heroes on the battlefield, making his way through ranks of very weak enemies, slightly tougher opponents and huge bosses. The combat system is simple and intuitive; in a few minutes you learn how to perform the various combos and use the special attacks or the various gadgets at the right time. Although it is enough to repeatedly press a button to take out dozens of opponents at a time, Hyrule Warriors requires a good dose of strategy even on the lowest difficulty levels, especially since the missions are quite long and complex. The player must always keep an eye on the map and carefully follow the hints and directions of allied units, running like mad left and right to capture or protect garrisons, rescue battlemates, defeat particular enemies before they reach a certain destination and so on. Hyrule Warriors is like a hard-hitting real-time strategy game with a pace that may not appeal to everyone, but is undeniably addictive. The ability to switch characters on the fly and play the ocarina to instantly reach the owl statues - features implemented in the Nintendo 3DS conversion - lighten an experience that has been further balanced: Omega Force has in fact gone to tweak not only the values of some weapons, but also certain parameters relating to the growth of the characters and the requirements necessary to unlock the various skills. The rupees and materials collected in combat, in fact, are used to buy passive combos and bonuses, but compared to the past, they are needed a little less, which significantly reduces the infamous ~grinding~. The plot of the Legend mode is a bit messy, but the constant references to the various episodes of The Legend of Zelda, and the care placed in the realization of the various characters and their abilities, will exert a great charm on the fans. The fact is that the Legend mode, despite the many collectibles to be unlocked by repeating the same missions several times, is only a small part of this complete package which is expressed at its best especially in the Adventure mode. The latter naturally proposes all the maps and missions published at launch and in the various DLCs, focusing on the various chapters of the saga following an increasing level of difficulty. This is a very original mode in which the player moves on 8-bit mosaics that resemble the primissimo The Legend of Zelda, by solving small puzzles to unlock chain missions. However, each chapter introduces themed rules that force you to change your style of play, grow certain characters and be more cautious during actual battles. All this translates into hundreds of additional hours, if you want to unlock every collectible, fairy, fighter or illustration. The Twenty Nine Faces of Hyrule In many ways, Hyrule Warriors is a bit more archaic than the recent Fire Emblem Warriors, especially when you compare the technical aspect. Intelligent Systems' strategy-inspired musou is markedly more sophisticated, especially in the modeling of the main characters, but it must always be remembered that this Hyrule Warriors is essentially a remastered version of the original released for Wii U. Thanks to a few filters and a lighting system revised and corrected, the Definitive Edition has a significantly more modern look, but the modeling of the enemies and the general poverty of the scenarios - although they are much more varied and detailed than those of Fire Emblem Warriors, it must be said - betray the generation to which the game. Fortunately, Omega Force focused above all on the frame rate, which in our test remained steadily around 60 frames even in the most chaotic situations. This, of course, applies to the TV mode in single player, since already in split screen for two players the dips occur a little more often, albeit without dramatic consequences. By disconnecting the console from the Dock, however, the game travels around 30 frames, but graphically it remains clean and pleasant, even if the map becomes difficult to consult. Those who know and appreciate the musou genre usually don't have huge expectations in technical terms, but it seems that Omega Force has found a more satisfying compromise than the one reached in Fire Emblem Warriors, which lost a lot in visual quality as soon as the option was chosen he reduced it to support the frame rate at 60 frames, an option that - it is right to point out - is not in Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition. In this sense, however, Hyrule Warriors, although an old man who may appear as soon as the Joy-Con is held, manages to return greater satisfaction than the aforementioned Fire Emblem Warriors. If in the latter there were actually a dozen different characters and many more clones, Hyrule Warriors offers a cast of twenty-nine completely different characters in terms of combos, super attacks and unique abilities. This makes for a significantly more varied and layered experience, especially as you embark on the advanced levels of Legend Mode or the Time Trials of Challenge Mode. In short, gradually unlocking the new heroes guarantees genuine satisfaction that does not end within a few hours. Therefore, those looking for a well-finished and long-lived title, to which to return several times over the course of the weeks or months, may have found what they were looking for in a truly slap-up reissue.", "date": "2018-05-16", "grade": "8.3"}
