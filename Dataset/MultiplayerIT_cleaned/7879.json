Benji Bananas HD, who we could define as an ~endless swinger~, were it not for the fact that the second term often indicates swingers and women of easy virtue, possesses all these qualities and more, and it is no coincidence that he has achieved great success among owners of Android terminals. With version 1.7 (soon 1.8) the title developed by Tribeflame also makes its debut on the App Store and is therefore preparing to compete with productions of the caliber of Jetpack Joyride, with which it shares the horizontal scrolling ~survival~ setting, albeit with some important differences. In Benji Bananas, in fact, our goal is not to reach the greatest possible distance by trying to avoid the obstacles in our path, but to do so by putting ourselves in the shoes of a nice little monkey and swinging from one liana to another without falling to the ground. And if during the ~race~ we also manage to collect a large number of bananas, all the better: the sweet yellow fruit actually represents the currency of the game, which can be downloaded for free but which requires a certain amount of bananas to allow us to buy upgrades and to unlock all five scenarios available. The locations are called ~Grand Tour~, ~Jungle~ (unlockable with 2000 bananas), ~Waterfall~ (unlockable with 5000 bananas), ~Temple Ruins~ (10 thousand bananas) and ~Planecrash~ (10 thousand bananas here too), and not they differ from each other only from an aesthetic point of view, but are equipped with characterizing elements that affect the gameplay, such as thorns on which our character ~bounces~, lions that push us down with a paw and more. You take this bitter fruit The gameplay of Benji Bananas HD, as mentioned at the beginning, is very simple and fun. Our character starts by holding his finger down on the touch screen and releasing it to make him take a big leap forward, then you have to touch the screen again to make him ~dive~ down and grab the first vine at hand. The descent gives speed to the maneuver and the subsequent swing will thus enjoy greater effectiveness, allowing us to project ourselves very far or high, depending on when we let go. In the same way, however, jumping blindly constitutes a significant risk, as the ground is always there waiting for us and it will often happen that we end up in an area where there are no holds, with game over therefore becoming inevitable. The approach adopted by the Tribeflame developers does not imply an increase in scrolling speed rather than a decrease in vines, but an alternation of scenarios in which the passage from one area to another is emphasized and the action only becomes more multifaceted, given the introduction of new elements that affect our ability to maneuver. In short, everything is really simple and fun: just what you ask of a title like this, perfect for when we have five minutes available and we want to distract ourselves a bit, perhaps trying to set a new record. The technical aspect has not been underestimated: beyond an unfortunately not incisive sound accompaniment, Benji Bananas HD makes a fine display of cartoonish graphics, very colorful and well designed, with a parallax that gives the right sense of depth to the background and a fair variety of locations.", "date": "2013-04-24", "grade": "7.5"}
