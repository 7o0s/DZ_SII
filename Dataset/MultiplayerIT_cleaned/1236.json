Agent Gabriel Logan has earned his place among high-level antagonists (Solid Snake among all), so I can't explain how they could have ~sacrificed~ him on the altar of multiplayer at all costs. In Omega Strain, in fact, the protagonist of the game will be an alter ego that you will create using a simple editor at the beginning of the game. Mission after mission, your agent will rise in rank and earn various accessories useful to face increasingly difficult situations. A role of ~supervisors~ is reserved for Logan and his collaborators in a matter that is told through animated sequences and various documentations, but which is actually quite simple: the Siphon Filter virus has somehow reappeared, and you will have to stop whoever uses it. The impact with the game is traumatic: enemies everywhere, a large number of objectives to be achieved and vocal instructions (usually distinguished by the phrase ~almost no more time left~) that blend into the din of shootings. In this chaos, the character control system certainly doesn't help: left stick to move, right stick to control the view, secondary back buttons to sidestep, L1 button to aim in first person, R1 button to activate auto aim. The pad buttons are used to shoot, roll, and perform various actions. The directional cross manages the inventory: pressing LEFT switches weapons, pressing RIGHT switches the torch (or night vision) on or off, pressing DOWN discards an object. Finally, the SELECT key activates the map (rotatable and scalable), the START key displays the objectives and everything else.

Too bad the enemies use it too...[/IMG] [IMG=2948.29.z]The animated sequences between one level and another are below current standards on PS2.[/IMG] Lots of irons in the fire The amount of elements to manage is frightening, and unfortunately the level of training present in Omega Strain certainly does not prepare us for the real action. It is absolutely normal, therefore, to repeat the first levels from scratch several times, until finally understanding how to move. The three-dimensional map shows us the position of the objectives, which would be a great thing if we were able to read it more precisely: the stages are always composed of several ~floors~, which in this case overlap, creating only confusion. And while you consult the map, any countdown continues relentlessly, hand in hand with the stress. Finding the right path, however, is the least of your worries. In Omega Strain there is the usual huge arsenal, made up of large and small, useful and useless weapons, but it cannot be used to the fullest, basically for two reasons: 1) the aiming system; 2) the fact that the enemies are almost infinite. The aiming system simply doesn't work: auto-aim prioritizes randomly instead of targeting the closest opponents, which will often lead to your premature demise. The manual aim, on the other hand, is more precise (it also allows aimed shots at the head) but extremely slow to implement, with the implications of the case. As for the enemies, it must be concluded that killing them all is not one of the priorities of the game, since sometimes it is impossible to do it: not only are they very numerous, but new ones arrive without any logical explanation. To top it all off, the ammo management is bad: the programmers could have left some lying around the levels when you restart from a checkpoint and have empty magazines. Instead you will find yourself in crucial moments without shots and without the possibility of obtaining them  well, unless you want to throw a knife at a terrorist armed with a machine gun. [IMG=2948.30.z]All objectives are clearly indicated on the map.[/IMG] [IMG=2948.31.z]Each level is widely ~documented~, but these are things you won't think about much.[/IMG] Technical aspect The first episode of Siphon Filter for PS2 does not exalt even for technical reasons: the level of detail is good, but the animations are decidedly scarce both as regards the ~good guys~ and the ~bad guys~, with the latter characterized by zero variety in appearance. Our character runs as if his legs were going about their business, to be honest which, as far as I remember, is a sort ofa trademark of the series, but on PS2 a revamp was expected at the very least. The game has been completely translated into Italian, both for the texts and for the voices, and boasts a good dubbing. Unfortunately both the music and the effects do not represent anything new or particularly effective, and not even the numerous animated sequences have anything to say. The impact with the game is traumatic: enemies everywhere, a large number of objectives to be achieved and vocal instructions (usually distinguished by the phrase ~almost no more time left~) that blend into the din of shootings. Technical aspect The online mode, the workhorse of the product, is unfortunately poorly exploited and has to deal with the flaws of the game, above all the lack of ~introductory~ levels that set goals that are easier to achieve and less emphasis on ~doing everything quickly~ . Finding suitable playmates, in this sense, is practically impossible [IMG=2948.33.z]At the beginning of the game you have to create your alter ego.[/IMG] [IMG=2948.34.z]The initial tutorial certainly doesn't prepare you to face the real levels...[/IMG ] Comment Perhaps the problem with Siphon Filter - The Omega Strain is the fact that it arrived quite late on PS2, at a stage in which there is already a lot of choice and the focus is on great quality or innovative solutions. Counting only on the popularity of Gabe Logan would have been insufficient, let alone present a game that not only does not allow you to take on the role of the famous agent, but which actually worsens the work done with the previous three episodes. In Omega Strain there is so much abundance but little substance: fans of the series will perhaps be able to turn a blind eye to the defects of the gameplay, to the chaos of the multiplayer, to the technical quality not up to the PS2. Pros: Tons of weapons Seventeen levels in total Cons: Too chaotic and imprecise Technically improvable Online mode misused Online multiplayer is still in the testing phase, at least for consoles, and Siphon Filter  The Omega Strain is one of the many titles that support this thesis. Apparently, for the advent of the ~global~ video game, Sony console owners will have to wait for the third generation of their Gaming Station, hoping that accessories such as modems and microphones will not once again be sold ~separately~. But in the meantime, what does the hardcore gamer who is ahead of his time do? Play, in fact, with Siphon Filter  The Omega Strain, one of the few products (not surprisingly Sony-branded) that places the online game mode at the top of its features. Was it true glory? No. It is not wrong to say that Omega Strain, without the possibility of network multiplayer, proves to be an inevitably incomplete gaming experience. This is because the developers have seen fit to design the levels by referring to a team (in this case made up of four people) who, with great coordination and strategic sense, are able to collaborate effectively to achieve the various objectives. Of the seventeen levels that make up the game, nine have this type of connotation: if you don't act as a group, it is practically impossible to complete the missions 100%. And if you don't completely complete the levels, you can't access new weapons and customizations, but above all you can't unlock the four single-player levels that finally put you in the shoes of Gabe Logan and his companions. Oh yeah, I didn't tell you that...", "date": "2004-07-26", "grade": null}
