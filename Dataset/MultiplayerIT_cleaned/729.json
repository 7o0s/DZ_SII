King Kong: the 8th wonder of the world is divided into two styles of play. The first is an adventure game framed by the other, which has the human characters of the story as protagonists and is focused in particular on the search for objects and very simple puzzles. The second is a scrolling beat 'em up in which the player controls King Kong, very simple in controls and frantic in action. Both sections of the game are accompanied by narrative moments in the form of dialogues between characters and animated sections that follow the story behind the film and other versions of the game. From time to time, the plot focuses on the adventures of Droscoli's research team and Kong's actions, introducing the game phases. Explore for men. Hit like Kong. The operation is no different from the beaten path of the home versions of the game, and attempts to create a game with a very foreground narrative. However, on GameBoy Advance the operation is very little immersive. In fact, the only decidedly successful element appears to be the audio sector. The music is done in a very professional way, and manages to provide moments of climax, surprise and in general a decidedly spot on atmosphere. The rest of the game, from the construction of the levels to the aesthetic realization, seems less inspired. Of the technical realization of the game certainly cannot be praised, given that it is limited to a decidedly low-level use of the GameBoy Advance hardware. If many objects and backgrounds appear pleasant, in general the game has a sixteen-bit first generation look: a not negligible defect, on hardware that starts from that generation but proves to be much more capable than a PC Engine. Explore for men. Hit like Kong. Genres that are not very evolvedThe aesthetics then suffer from excessive cartoonization, with a kind of cartoon-style conversion for very young people of the spirit of the new Kong. But even the construction of the interaction does not excite. Firstly, the two sections (exploratory / fighting) appear not only very unrelated to each other, but also not very engaging in themselves. In that view from above, which recalls certain adventure / puzzles of the sixteen-bit era, the interaction revolves entirely on the search for objects on the game map, and on the alternation between the playable characters to make the best use of them. The player has access to a team of three characters. Droscoli is armed, and must be used for offensive and defensive reasons against the few insects that act as enemies. His adventure partner specializes in moving heavy objects and throwing bombs to open passages. The female protagonist, on the other hand, has the possibility of reaching inaccessible areas with a grappling hook, and of healing the other characters. Thus, this whole style of play revolves around exploring the map, solving a few elementary puzzles and collecting objects which, when combined, generate useful tools for the adventure (for example, with sulfur and beetles it will be possible to build bombs). The action is fun enough, but without any valid kind of diversion and few enemies it becomes too quickly repetitive and unexciting. Systematically breaking boredom then intervenes, at least on paper, by the part of the game that can be played with Kong, which replaces the exploratory one once certain narrative nodes have been unlocked. But even this component of the game is not very appropriate and superficially realized. The player can in fact only run towards the enemies (first only dinosaurs, then we move to New York), move to avoid their charges and shoot down repeated shots on the attack button against them. Landing hits recharges a bar which, at maximum level, allows the player to produce the same attacks more quickly and with a higher level of damage done to enemies. It is clear that this is very little for a combat section: even the worst fighting games of the sixteen-bit era sometimes offered greater variety of action. King Kong for GameBoy Advance is a minor version compared to those for other consoles, and this is disappointing. On the ~classic~ Nintendo laptop it is evident, but only by negative comparison, the absence of what the playable version of Jackson's film wants to be on other platforms: entertainment, involvement, style On GBA the programmers have given up a priori the attempt to build a game with these features. Instead, they have focused on a cartoonish flattening of obsolete construction, once classic formulas, hoping that today they seem eccentric: the action-adventure and the scrolling beat'em up. Both styles of play, though, I knownot made a little too superficially. While letting themselves be played, they don't really say anything new. And even assuming you weren't striving for originality, activities like this game's repetitive searching and fighting stop being fun very soon, especially for attentive and responsive gamers like very young handheld console owners. Pros Lost Vikings-style quest action Great soundtrack Two gameplay styles Cons Very boring quest phases Too repetitive fighting section Very linear and guided gameplay Outdated graphics The release of Peter Jackson's King Kong in cinemas is now imminent, but the videogame versions have not waited for the filmic work: they are preceding it. Among all the conversions, the GameBoy Advance edition of the game demonstrates that, despite the continuous restyling of the Nintendo portable, this console is in fact (but wrongly) considered by many in the industry as a simple commercial base for the very young audience . King Kong: the 8th wonder of the world is a very simple and linear game, never annoying but not too exciting and, above all, it appears more in line with the plot of the film and the other versions than with the spirit that animates the Kong of two thousand. The mixture of action adventure and fighting game that it offers is modeled on that between FPS and avant-garde brawler of the other versions, but it turns out to be much less engaging and made with too little technical and design effort, as if to deliver a small version to the younger ones. Who, however, are generally the most demanding players.", "date": "2005-11-29", "grade": null}
