How do you set up a fantasy RPG without heroes? You look for them in the lower strata of the population, of course. So here is a baker's wife becoming the protagonist of epic clashes with demons and dragons, demonstrating more skills than any warrior in the art of baguette-twirling, or why not choose to play a dull scholar instead of the usual genius of spells ? Diablo++? Dawn of Magic 2 starts from the first episode (in every sense, since it recycles many elements) of which it tries to smooth out the defects by proposing its strengths. It is evident how the developers, while drawing heavily on the Diablo formula, have tried to create something more complex and articulated than the average. This translates into an initially difficult interface to use, but which offers a few more options than the competition, such as tattoos or a fairly complete crafting system. Even the magic management model is not easy to understand (we recommend playing the tutorial to understand the game mechanics, since the manual is incomplete in most fields), but it offers a good variety in terms of spells and possibilities of development. As in the past, the growth of the character has been maintained for intermediate stages, i.e. there are no clear level shots (for example from the second to the third) but you have to go through the median steps (for example level 2+ or level 2++). This translates into the fact that the different points that can be distributed between skills and characteristics are assigned in different stages of growth, making it necessary to access the character sheet more often to make choices relating to its development. You awaken Unfortunately the good premises are a bit betrayed by the realization, at times really poor. For example, if it is true that the precision of the control system has improved a lot compared to the first Dawn of Magic, it is undeniable that there is still a lot of work to be done in this sense because, especially in the most chaotic situations, it is difficult to understand what is happening and act accordingly. In other cases it is the simple movements that are problematic. For example, while wandering around cities or other inhabited settlements, it can happen that you accidentally move the cursor over a vase or other object, ending up breaking it. The problem is that in doing so the inhabitants turn against the character, forcing them to reload or get killed to appease them. The inaccuracy becomes more serious during combat, especially when allies are involved; it is very difficult to be able to distinguish enemies from friends and, above all, click on the right point. This results in constant uprisings by the allies. Even from a technical point of view, a rather mediocre job was done. The premises and stylistic expectations derived from the eccentric protagonists are immediately betrayed. Irony is rare and the audiovisual choices are marked by pure anonymity, not to mention the general ugliness of the scenarios and three-dimensional models, which smell old and standardized.", "date": "2009-11-12", "grade": "6.0"}
