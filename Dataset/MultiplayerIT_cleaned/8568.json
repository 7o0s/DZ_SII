On the other hand, when one is clearly inspired by a title that has made the fight between birds and pigs its strong point, it is clear that full compliance with the ordinary rules of nature cannot be expected. And yet, Shark Dash distances itself quite clearly from being yet another clone of a best seller by the French house; on the contrary, the fun fight between sharks and ducks contains numerous goodies, such as to give the game even elements of healthy originality. Duck in orange sauce Contrary to what is widespread in the collective imagination, in Shark Dash the part of the ~bad~ creatures is undoubtedly played by the ducks; the apparently harmless birds in fact suddenly invaded the shark tanks, until then calm and isolated in their world. In addition to the nuisance caused by the ~abusive~ occupation, the ducks also began to play pranks and teases on their guests but, despite everything, they continued to be tolerated. But when the limit is crossed, it is right to fear revenge and the so-called ~anger of the good~: the kidnapping of Sally, the girlfriend of the protagonist shark Squally, is the last and most serious act that unleashes the wrath of the meek predators. thus eager to go back to enforcing the laws of nature by literally ~gobbling up~ the mischievous birds. The game setting is therefore essentially aquatic: Squally, the protagonist above all of the first part of the adventure, has the objective of saving his partner and punishing the kidnappers/invaders; to do this, it can move around the different tanks thanks to its elastic tail, which the player uses as a slingshot. With your finger you pull the shark's fin and direct the dish in the desired direction; the goal to achieve is to eat all the ducks, collect the coins and use as few throws as possible. All three parameters contribute to the achievement of the maximum score, i.e. the three stars; as usual, just accumulate more and more stars to unlock new levels. Throughout history, sharks and ducks will face each other in increasingly imaginative and funny ways, using a myriad of contextual elements typical of tanks and aquariums: sponges, tubes, lifebuoys, soaps, balls, sticks of salt (which dissolve in contact with water) etc, all of which are essential to successfully solve the various scenarios. Particularly useful for moving quickly are the pipes, which thanks to a pneumatic system can send the sharks at high speed from one part of the tank to the other. The ducks are sometimes protected by dangerous mines, which explode with an energetic touch, or in remote underwater ravines, to be reached perhaps after overcoming various obstacles. Fortunately, there is not only one type of shark available to the player but starting from the second scheme you will meet Spady, able to cut the chains that block some sections, Marty, equipped with a double jump and finally Suby, Squaly's twin brother specialized in ~underwater fishing~. In Shark Dash there is obviously a shop for in-app purchases, from which you can buy game coins with real money or potions to be able to repeat the last wrong move; in this way, by canceling the last movement, it is not necessary to restart the entire pattern due to a single error, which could even cause a minimum of frustration, especially in advanced levels. Longevity, as in all similar titles, is guaranteed by 96 levels divided into 4 different stages, plus Gameloft's promise to provide regular expansions (it is not known whether paid or free); however it will be above all the desire to reach the three stars for each scheme the main spring that pushes for replayability, this because for each situation the ~par~, i.e. (using a golf term) the minimum number of moves to complete the scheme, can be reached only in a certain way to be discovered each time after several attempts. In keeping with the fun and joy that hovers throughout the game, the graphics are colorful and animated in a funny way, free of jamming and therefore very reliable even on a device of the past generation.", "date": "2012-04-26", "grade": "8.5"}
