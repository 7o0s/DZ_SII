{"name": "Polaroid Pete", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/polaroid-pete.html", "text": "But how many laughs! Let's get a few things straight right away. The JVC-branded title is very original and particular, but for this very reason it could make the more traditionalists who love deeper and thicker games turn up their noses. The fact is this: Polaroid Pete either you love him or you hate him. A little explanation will better clarify the meaning of this statement. Those who have spent most of their childhood playing on the legendary bar cabinets, and those who feel nostalgia for those games that do not require too much effort in which you can spend ~beautiful~ disinterested moments, will find bread for their teeth. While those who expect more from their black monolith are forced to a long paparazzo-mode game session to better understand the true essence of this product and its possible purchase. The main purpose in the game is precisely to create real photo shoots in the places designated by our editorial director. The levels are set in the most famous places in the world (and not only). In fact we will visit Tokyo, New York, Paris, but also distant planets. Suffice it to say that immortalizing Obi-One Kenobi fighting his archenemy with a lightsaber is almost obligatory. During the action, depending on the specialty of the photos taken, you will get both different points and various power-ups. These boil down to e.g. to a temporary increase in movement speed, invincibility or in other films necessary for the continuation of one's work. To pass to the next level it is necessary to obtain a predefined minimum of points, otherwise the same will have to be done again. The entire action takes place in the flat field of two dimensions, even if the environments develop in depth. The actions of our virtual alter ego are limited to walking, taking pictures, zooming in with the lens and flashing our targets. There is also the possibility of making a leap in order to avoid small obstacles such as pins that defy the laws of physics, crazed skateboards, etc. All of which makes for a bizarre experience. Japanese, I would dare to define. Hand colored? Polaroid Pete's graphic engine mixes two-dimensional elements (basically the characters) with three-dimensional ones (ie the backdrops) in a sufficiently nice way. Everything is very colorful and very directly recalls those cartoonish and humorous atmospheres so loved in the land of the rising sun. The main character, the now very famous paparazzo Pete Goldman, is characterized in a rather bland way. The same goes for all the other beings that populate the cities that our hero has in his sights. Even the resolution is certainly not of high quality and contributes to making the visual experience poor in particular attractions. But let's face it all. The game developed by Irem certainly does not want to excel in the cosmetic field. Even if it hurts to admit that the eye also wants its part... In fact, as you can guess from the photos, this PP looks more like a game that runs on PSone than on PS2. There is no doubt, therefore, that the programmers could have indulged much more to make the product more attractive in terms of graphics. Like old times The gaming experience offered by the JVC title is undoubtedly fun, even if too limited in time. In fact, in about half a day you will be able to complete the entire game in normal difficulty. A real shame especially if you consider the high degree of humor offered by the adventures immortalized by our favorite envoy(?). Another sore point, the title suffers not only on a purely visual level but also on a purely sound level. In fact, it is unfortunate to note how both the musical accompaniment and the sound effects are of low quality, so much so that they even seem absent in some situations. There isn't, how to say, that little tune that enters your brain and then stays there forever... ah! The times of Mario and co. they are far away. In conclusion, this Polaroid Pete is a game without too many pretensions on the technical apparatus (i.e. audio-visual) but which manages to entertain and capture the player's attention even if for too little time. This, together with other secondary and already illustrated ones, is the main limitation of the JVC title which, with greater care, would have been much more interesting. This is because the idea is original, but exploited in a mediocre way. A product that will especially interest those who love the Japanese spirit and old school games. Unattractive to others. Pros: Fun and hilarious. Immediate. Japanese up to obsto. Cons: Sparse and technically mediocre. Short. Not everyone likes the Japanese spirit. A special envoy Polaroid Pete is one of those games that appear suddenly, unaware of commercial lights and stuff. In fact, if it weren't for the specialized press, no one would have known of its release on the market. It often happens that titles of this kind turn out to be low-quality products, but rarely and only in some cases (as for example it happened for ~Ico~) it happens to be faced with small videogame masterpieces. With this Polaroid Pete we find ourselves, as they say, in the middle ground but with a small tendency towards the first kind of productions. The game setting absolutely follows the standards of the classic arcade-game with all the consequences of the case, i.e. simplicity and immediacy. The Japanese style, then, transpires from all the elements it contains, both on a cultural and humorous level. In the game you will impersonate a real ~paparazzo~ who, in good style and with a smile on his face, will have to immortalize on film everything bizarre that appears during the action phases. We go from softer situations like a kiss between lovers to crazier ones like the coming to town of the mythical and mammoth Godzilla! Is this your highest aspiration?", "date": "2002-02-25", "grade": null}
