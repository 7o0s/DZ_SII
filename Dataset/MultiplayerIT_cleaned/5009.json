In a rather undeserved way according to the common opinion, because if it is true that many people will remember the game released in 2005 as a flop from a commercial point of view, many of those who have had the opportunity to try it can testify in favor of the numerous qualities of Psychonauts. It is thanks to the latter that the platform has managed to carve out its own niche, conquering a hard and lasting core of fans who have then allowed Double Fine to collect over 3.3 million dollars with the Psychonauts 2 financing campaign on Fig. But the work of Tim Schafer and his team on the Psychonauts series did not stop only at this major project, given that Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin has also been included in the list of titles available for PlayStation VR for a few days. This is an exclusive PlayStation 4 obviously dedicated to virtual reality, intended to act as a bridge between the two main chapters. Since the development of Psychonauts 2 will certainly go on until 2018, we took advantage of Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin with great pleasure: here's how it went. Looking forward to Psychonauts 2, Raz and friends return to the appetizer Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin Where were we? The story told by Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin starts exactly where the first Psychonauts left us ten years ago. The protagonist Raz is a new recruit to the Psychonauts team, but his joy lasts a very short time: the organization in fact learns of the kidnapping of its commander Truman Zanotto, who ended up in a mysterious place that only a select few seem to be aware of. Together with Lili, Milla, Sasha and Coach Oleander, Raz thus sets off on his first mission as an official Psychonaut, destined to find Zanotto and try to understand who and why kidnapped him. After identifying the place where the commander is located, similar to the Bermuda Triangle, things soon turn out to be more complicated than expected: the entire group ends up being captured in turn, leaving an immobilized Raz the only chance to get away with the use of his psychic powers. As for the plot of Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin we stop here, but don't think that there is much more waiting for you. From a narrative point of view, the game does not offer particularly important ideas, limiting itself to carrying out its task of preparing the ground for what will be the second chapter of the Psychonauts saga. The few connecting details that are offered to us therefore make up a rather linear story, in which we pass from a first phase in which Raz has to free his friends to the one in which the showdown with the bad guy on duty arrives. Precisely in this phase Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin becomes more interesting, but these are a few minutes that slip away too quickly. A little more in-depth study would certainly have helped the value of Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin, whose biggest limit is constituted by a duration that does not go beyond two hours, even if the player lingers to look at the splendid places studied from Double Fine. If we consider that 18.99 euros are needed to buy the game in terms of price, therefore, more could have been done, given that apart from any trophies left on the street once the adventure is completed, there are no reasons to return as Raz. Playstation 4 trophies Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin features a total of twelve trophies, nine of which are bronze, two silver, and one gold. Most of them can be conquered in a simple way, by completing the adventure, while the remaining ones concern some actions to be performed during the search for Zanotto. A jellyfish for a friend In terms of gameplay, the cue offered by a Raz immobilized in his chair offers us the reason to go around only and exclusively through the use of the mental powers of the protagonist. In particular, we find ourselves making use of his clairvoyance ability, which allows him to see the world through the eyes of another character, provided that this is equipped with the minimum requirement represented by a brain. Starting from Raz's mind, it is therefore possible to enter the head of the enemies present in the surrounding environment, as well as that of other animals such as fish, jellyfish and others that we do not want to reveal in order not to spoil a few small surprises. The platform dynamics of the old Psychonauts completely leave room for others completely linked to the genre of graphic adventures, thus allowing those who have PlayStation VR in mind not to have to facemake quick movements. We therefore find a series of environmental puzzles, which can be solved by ping-ponging between the various controllable minds and using the psychic powers in Raz's possession. Starting with few possibilities, as the other members of the troop are freed, access to the complete set of skills is obtained, among which, in addition to the aforementioned clairvoyance, we find telekinesis, pyrokinesis, a kind of ~poke~ and a psi blast which allows hit nearby things and characters. As you may have guessed, the idea of forcibly seating Raz particularly winks at the game in virtual reality, given that with a total absence of movement the possibility of suffering from motion sickness is practically reduced to zero. In visual terms, as we have mentioned, Double Fine has undoubtedly done an excellent job, presenting a series of scenarios to be admired, designed to be enjoyed with a PlayStation VR in mind. As for the audio, many will be pleased to learn that the entire old voice cast from Psychonauts is back for Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin as well. We point out the total absence of the Italian language, also with regard to subtitles.", "date": "2017-03-09", "grade": "7.0"}
