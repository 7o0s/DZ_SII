So let's find out if under such a dazzling presentation there is also a valid product from the point of view of gameplay. Hi-res missiles At the expense of a not exactly exciting initial impact, with a modest main screen and an absolutely forgettable story narrated through comic-book-style still images to be skipped without fear, Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy takes little time to prove its worth, imposing itself as a top notch aerial combat game and probably the best in its category currently available on the App Store. Obviously it is not only thanks to the excellent technical realization, which in any case gives its great contribution in pushing the Namco Bandai product towards excellence. Made with the new iPad screen in mind, the cosmetics of the game presents excellent polygonal models for what concerns the aircraft, treated in every detail and covered with particularly defined textures; the glance of the scenarios is also excellent, which often compensate for the lack of prominent structures such as the palaces and buildings of a city with top-level rendering and lighting effects. Paradoxically - being a title based on dogfights - the explosions are perhaps the least successful part of the whole, and to be honest some sound components are not too convincing, but they are only small smudges of a work far above the average of the panorama playful iOS. As we said, however, the technique is not the only strong point of Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy which indeed amazes with the amount of content made available, especially in proportion to the modest price at which it is offered. The single player only allows you to tackle the 10 scenarios of the campaign, the 100 dogfight missions and a whole series of competitive modes against CPU-controlled bots, in the order Survival, Free for All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Defend the Base . The same ones that are part of the large section dedicated to online and local multiplayer, which stands out for the absolute ease with which it manages the clashes. Each user game is also rewarded with a certain number of experience points thanks to which it is possible to rank up and unlock new and more powerful aircraft, icing on the cake of an extremely enjoyable and fun experience. Above all thanks to a diligent gameplay in following in the footsteps of Ace Combat but without sacrificing one's personality in the process, and a perfect control system that can be adapted to all needs. Anyone familiar with Namco Bandai's background will have no trouble adapting to agile aircraft equipped with an infinite supply of machine gun shells and missiles, whose only limitation in use lies in the need to wait for a short reload time. Lock-ons and reticles make it easy to engage targets, while a small supply of chaff allows you to evade enemy attacks should conventional evasive maneuvers fail. All at your fingertips on the touchscreen, with the gyroscope of the device capable of establishing the direction of the aircraft and a virtual stick in the lower part of the screen to adjust the speed: to meet less expert users, then, there are variants available that allow to automate some aircraft functions or to use a second virtual controller for movement management.", "date": "2012-03-27", "grade": "9.0"}
