Every action astride the superbikes hurtling at over 200km/h on roads barely wider than 5m must be precise and deliberate or you'll end up tasting the virtual asphalt of the Isle of Man. Developed by the Italians of Raceward Studio, this game has a lot in common with another all-Italian simulator: Assetto Corsa. This is because before its ~Competition~ iteration, even the title of Kunos Simulazioni was all about having perfect game physics and impeccable simulation stability. Playing TT3 it is evident the work that the developers have done to create a solid product that will please the most dedicated Tourist Trophy fan. The reverse of the medal is that if the goal is also to reach the general public, there is still a long way to go. In this review of TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 we will tell you about all that has been done well in this simulator, the sometimes frustrating inaccuracies you will have to face and what is missing to make the digital experience of one of the most famous motor racing in the world truly accessible to all. A question of foundations In TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, realism comes first, especially when it comes to bike physics Raceward Studio has just inherited the TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge saga; in fact, this is the first game made by them and in common with the previous ones it only has the laser scanning of the Tourist Trophy circuit made in collaboration with the Isle of Man government. Everything else has been redone from scratch and the differences they are noticed. It takes precise inputs, a careful analysis of the road ahead of you and a non-beginner's knowledge of the behavior of a digital motorcycle just to not fall and in this game you fall a lot. You will learn to get used to it and, knowing it, the developers have inserted an incredible variety of animations in first and third person just to tell in a scenographic way when you hit a wall or a curb. That's fine, except it's a little unsettling to watch the crowd not reacting to falls, especially when the camera stops on a portion of the track where there's a cheering spectator and you've just squashed yourself. These are trivia though , because it is clear that the development priorities were different, that is to lay very solid foundations on which to build with the next iterations of the series. When we say that this game is difficult, we mean that it is also difficult to access for newcomers to the world of motorcycle racing who have been hypnotized by the adrenaline of the event and eager to try it digitally. Starting the game there is no tutorial, there is no explanation of the impact of engineering decisions and even a screen is missing that explains how the competition you are participating in works. A lot of information such as historical curiosities about the Isle of Man and the genesis of the race are locked behind the discovery of some points of interest scattered around the map, a curious choice that however has its charm. TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 is designed for those who know the series, know the race, know the circuit and want an absolutely unfiltered and hyper-realistic two-wheel driving experience. What awaits you on the Isle of Man The Isle of Man roads open up to riders who want to challenge them and Raceward have done a good job of reproducing the narrow island roads that make up the TT circuit TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 is an open road video game, not open world, where you can explore the roads of the Isle of Man on your superbike or supersport whose seasons can be carried forward simultaneously. There are qualifying events, one-on-one races and other time trials on difficult or fun sections of the historic Tourist Trophy track to add variety to the experience. By completing these challenges you will earn upgrade points with which to improve your bike by taking each of its nine components from level one to level five. After completing the qualifications it's time to compete in the big event that gives the video game its name and we can guarantee you that it is a total experience. Not only does it take time but you really need a lot of concentration because falling even once means automatically finishing last. Sure, if a pilot falls at those speeds in the real world he's lucky if he gets out alive so let's see the logic of the svdevelopers in making the fall such an impacting factor on the final result. You will need a lot of training just to complete a lap without crashing and even more to be competitive with the artificial intelligence at 40% of its power. The climb to perfectionism is long so Tourist Trophy fans will have bread for their teeth, especially if they want to jump into the asynchronous multiplayer challenges available every week. The racing line is not convinced The trajectory line of TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 needs a lot of adjustment because it fails to convey to the player the right information to avoid falling into the most difficult curves If the lack of introductory elements can be a game design choice, the single element that left us most perplexed about TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 is the racing line, that is the line on the track that indicates the trajectory and appropriate speeds to tackle a bend in the best way. In TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 the trajectory line needs to become much more precise. Even the most difficult of simulators use the racing line to teach driving, explain a section of the track or have a more relaxed experience. The problem with TT3 is that even when it's green there's no guarantee that you can tackle the corner without a crash. It often happened to us to brake the right way, to be perfect on the line, to lean and fall anyway. This is not a little frustrating while doing qualifying and time trials because you are almost never able to reach the limit and improve, you are always trying not to crash. A trajectory line that works is essential to help even the most experienced player improve, especially if a title has export ambitions such as TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3. In fact, we rarely see an item called own esports but TT3 believes in it and wants to focus on online competition. There will be weekly, monthly and seasonal events to crown the best sim drivers in the digital Tourist Trophy and even a visit to the real race 2024 is up for grabs. of the motorcycle simulation you will find bread for your teeth in this experience. Raceward Studio's other game, Rims Racing, was a simulation jewel and this title is at its height, a pity for the absence of comparable component customization (with famous brands and a lot of depth), but we understand the complications that can bring these license agreements.", "date": "2023-05-13", "grade": "7.5"}
