{"name": "Crisis Zone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crisis-zone.html", "text": "Buddha buddha buddha! Instead of the imaginative scenarios and characters dressed in dubious taste jackets of Time Crisis, Crisis Zone offers a ~realistic~ setting such as London (actually the settings were invented from scratch by the developers) and a protagonist more faithful to the classic canons of the action hero. In the role of the captain of a special anti-terrorist group, the user is sent on a mission in a commercial area occupied by the classic armed gang intent on detonating a bomb, with the obvious task of remedying the problem as a last resort. As always happens in light gun shooters, the story is a mere pretext to allow the player to empty entire magazines on hordes of enemies as stupid as they are numerous. And bullets, in Crisis Zone, fly so many, mainly due to the weapon with which the protagonist of the Namco title is equipped: no longer a simple pistol, but a devastating machine gun physically managed by the user through the classic Gun-Con 2. This is the first, inevitable difference with the original arcade version, whose cabinet was equipped with a powerful repeating rifle with an impressive recoil effect. Vibrations of the weapon aside, the home incarnation of Crisis Zone still has the same peculiar playful characteristics. In addition to the machine gun, in fact, the protagonist of the game is also equipped with a large bulletproof shield that performs the same functions as the ~natural~ shelters of Time Crisis: by releasing one of the buttons on the Gun-Con 2, therefore, you will be able to defend yourself from attacks opponents (including bombs, missiles and cannon fire) and simultaneously reload your 40-round beast. The basic elements of Crisis Zone suggest a frenetic game action, and so it is: copious bursts of machine guns and brief moments in the shelter of the shield alternate rapidly, with a large number of enemies on the screen and (finally) very rich scenarios of destructible elements. In short, even without the recoil effect, Crisis Zone gives the player a truly satisfying feeling of power. Enemies of all colors Despite presenting several original elements, however, Crisis Zone maintains many points of contact with the Time Crisis series. First of all with regard to the enemies, whose now classic coloring indicates their level of danger, and continuing with the graphic effects that indicate to the user in short advance the arrival of a critical hit capable of reducing the life points of a unit: in Crisis Zone this process is also accompanied by a clear sound effect, which makes dodging easier, while threats consisting of grenades or knives are strangely not highlighted in any way, making them quite unpleasant. Of course, the reduced time limit made available to the user to complete the various areas could not be missing, a classic element essential to avoid excessively defensive attitudes on the part of the player. Fortunately, however, Crisis Zone differs from the Time Crisis series for the style and quality of the graphics, clearly superior in the Namco product subject of this review. In addition to relying on a greater definition of the textures, on more defined polygonal models and on a better use of colors, Crisis Zone gains in spectacularity thanks to the already mentioned destructibility of the game scenarios: most of the objects present on the screen jump, explode, they probably break or fall when hit by the player's gusts, to the delight of the most avid demolishers. All accompanied by an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack that goes well with the action on the screen. Unfortunately, Crisis Zone suffers from some flaws that heavily undermine the final evaluation. Above all, longevity: despite the presence of an entire bonus scenario created specifically for the Playstation 2 version, completing the game's Story Mode really takes too little time, also thanks to a strangely low level of difficulty. The Namco title rewards the user with more substantial extra and continuous lives every time the adventure is tackled, but this expedient (successfully exploited in Time Crisis 3) adds very little replay value, considering that it is not necessary to be monsters properly of skill to finish the game even on the first try. The so-called Crisis Missions are also relatively of little use, i.e. a series of small scenarios characterized by specific objectives (such as killing all enemies without destroying elements of the scenario, hitting allies, and so on) which, in addition to not being particularly fun, are rather useless in the game economy. In short, an unsuccessful attempt to ~stretch the broth~. ccomment Crisis Zone is an absolutely decent light gun shooter, penalized however very heavily by a very poor longevity even by the modest standards of the genre. The Namco title does not last long, without furthermore offering substantial incentives to pick it up again above all due to a certain underlying repetitiveness, more marked than the various Time Crisis due to the more ~monotonous~ behavior of the machine gun compared to the pistol. Finally, considering the bland appeal of the Crisis Missions, it is evident how Crisis Zone, despite the undoubted technical and playful qualities, offers decidedly less than its more illustrious colleagues. Pros: Technically excellent Fun and frenetic Slightly different from usual Cons: Longevity in heels More repetitive than the norm Low level of difficulty Strange path that of Crisis Zone: released in an arcade version between the second and third episode of the Time Crisis series as a spin off of the famous Namco brand, it has only now been transported to Playstation2, substantially devoid of hype and almost unexpected . It may be that the Japanese softco has deliberately let so much time pass since the release of the original for precise strategic choices; or more likely, it can be thought that he preferred to dust off a ready-made game rather than create a brand new one. The fact is that Sony users who are passionate about light gun shooters can finally get their hands on something new. A machine gun and a shield, to be precise", "date": "2004-10-26", "grade": null}
