An interesting project, based on a novel by Alan Snow and characterized by the participation of actors such as Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark in ~Game of Thrones~), Simon Pegg (we all remember him in the zany ~Shaun of the Dead~) and Ben Kingsley (Oscar winner with ~Gandhi~), who lent their voices to various characters. As the title suggests, the film's protagonists are trolls who live underground and use cardboard boxes as if they were turtle shells. This peculiarity is rendered very well in the tie-in developed by RED Games and available for free on the App Store and Google Play, The Boxtrolls: Slide 'N' Sneak. It is a platform with continuous horizontal scrolling, that is, with our character who moves automatically and must jump, slide and project himself up to collect gears, avoid traps, escape from the clutches of bounty hunters and maybe try to reach the exit each level relatively quietly, without making too much noise by bumping into background objects. All maneuvers that can be performed by acting on the touch screen through simple more or less prolonged touches for jumps and slides down or up to get slips and leaps while running. The idea that the experience was designed for an exclusively very young audience, however, soon turns out to be wrong: the game requires a certain precision, an almost perfect timing and a fair degree of patience to be completed, with the frustration for a sudden game over always around the corner. The Boxtrolls: Slide 'N' Sneak is a curious and fascinating platformer, but with a few too many edges Boxes and boxes The Boxtrolls: Slide 'N' Sneak certainly does not lack atmosphere, and in the same way the technical realization of the game is excellent. Undoubtedly thanks to the starting design, as well as the use of assets, cinematic sequences and music taken from the feature film. The action itself sees the parallax scrolling of houses in the background and backlit structures to be traveled along the way, paying attention to any chasms, crates, bells and, as already mentioned, enemies who can stop our run with a single move, leaving us two possibilities: repeat the stage all over again or use a piece of cheese to be able to continue from where we left off. It goes without saying that the cheese, together with a large number of other bonuses, can be obtained via in-app purchase, but in the same way the whole experience can be enjoyed for free without problems or limitations, with the only duty represented by the advertisements that occasionally appear on the screen. All right, then? Unfortunately not: the elements we mentioned above, i.e. the need to be particularly precise in terms of distances and timing, unfortunately end up breaking up the pace of the gameplay and sometimes making it too angular, which naturally comes to the detriment of the enjoyment of the game. experience, which inevitably becomes frustrating at the umpteenth game over. It's a shame, because the idea behind this tie-in isn't bad at all and can count, as mentioned, on an undoubted load of atmosphere.", "date": "2014-10-10", "grade": "7.0"}
