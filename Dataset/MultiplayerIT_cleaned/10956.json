Let's see if it will be enough to make us forget the pleasure of sitting around a table with a couple of friends to roll the dice... Forbidden to singles Being a party game, an extremely obvious premise must be made regarding the EA product: the title should not even be taken into consideration if you are not sure you can count on friends or relatives to play it with. Although the developers have specifically inserted the figure of Mr. Potato (which many will remember as the secondary protagonist of Toy Story) in order to guide the user through the various menus and to play the part of the opponent in single games player, it must be said that Hasbro Family Games is a product that is completely adverse to this type of use. This is because a good part of the fun doesn't really come from the board games made available, but rather from the interaction with other human players. However, the package includes the beauty of five famous names of this branch of entertainment: Yahtzee, Forza 4, Sink the Fleet, Sorry! and Sorry! Sliders. Yahtzee is played with 5 dice, and the goal is to get the combinations capable of guaranteeing the highest number of points; Forza 4 is instead the famous game in which the first player to insert four chips of the same color inside a vertical chessboard wins; Sink Starfleet is Hasbro's take on the immortal sea battle, and it really needs no explanation; Sorry! instead it is a sort of game of the goose, in which one has to advance one's pawn within a path, throwing dice and using cards drawn from a deck; finally, Sorry! Sliders (probably the least known) requires you to slide your pawn down a corridor, trying to get as close as possible to the goal, in a way not too dissimilar from the Olympic discipline of Curling. However, EA has not limited itself to slavishly re-proposing similar products in videogame form, given that for each board game there is a classic version - therefore respectful of the original rules - and various variations, as well as a special option that allows you to customize some parameters. Also noteworthy is a Party mode, which adds a little spice to the action by placing players in front of various puzzles and challenges to be solved within a limited time. More could hardly have been done in quantitative terms, so we cannot deny the developers applause for their efforts in this direction: however, as we will see, similar elements are not enough to make these electronic versions better than the original ones.... It was better when it was worse One of the main limitations of Hasbro Family Party is to be found in the exaggerated spectacularization of the games, with rather unpleasant consequences in terms of gameplay: especially in games such as Sink the Fleet and Sorry!, EA has lavished excessively on graphic frills and camera movements, lengthening the waiting times that mark the passage of shifts between one user and another. Equally annoying in the long run are the transitions between the various menus, for the same reason just stated: every single selection is accompanied by strictly non-skippable sequences, undoubtedly nice but which get boring really quickly. On the other hand, the fact that, playing Sink the Fleet against a friend, one is forced to turn one's back to the screen during the opponent's turn, in order not to peek at the arrangement of his ships. Nothing serious, for heaven's sake, but one wonders why another title from the vast Hasbro catalog could not be chosen that did not force players into similar little tricks. In terms of the control system, nothing striking to report, except for the fact that the Remote is used effectively only in some situations, for example to shake the dice in Yahtzee or to throw one's pawn in Sorry! Sliders. Finally, the technical sector of the product tends to be good, from which great things could not be expected anyway: the room in which to navigate through the various menus is colored and detailed, and moreover customizable by the user using patterns and objects unlocked during the course of matches.", "date": "2008-12-22", "grade": "6.8"}
