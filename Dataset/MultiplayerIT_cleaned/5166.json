With over one hundred million copies sold and a flood of enthusiasts ready to open their wallets, the French publisher could have launched a new Assassin's Creed again this year, however, in light of the increasingly harsh criticisms of the outdated playful styles and problems never of the resolved, he wisely decided to give himself more time to develop the next chapter, namely the noisy Empire. Despite the absence of a new Assassin's Creed, replaced by the good Watch Dogs 2, 2016 will still be anything but devoid of the eternal struggle between Order of Templars and Brotherhood of Assassins; beyond the Ezio Collection, the subject of our analysis and yet another remaster of this generation, the official film will in fact arrive at the cinema on December 21st. Waiting to find out if the interpretation of the good Michael Fessbender will (finally) be able to do full justice to a film based on a video game, we are back to wearing hidden blade and hood in the flourishing Renaissance period, in the role of one of the ~assassins~ most loved of the series: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Guaranteed longevity and all DLC of the original trilogy in Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection Story of a hero Let us immediately remove the pebble from our shoe, which for some could be particularly annoying: although the Ezio Collection, made up of the second chapter, Brotherhood and Revelations, is expressly focused on the story of the noble and charismatic Florentine, remove the first, seminal episode of the series from the package we didn't think it was a very wise choice. First of all for the clean cut to the contemporary plot linked to the events of Desmond Miles, secondly because the novices could lose part of the charm and involvement of some iconic sequences of the third act, the one most intimately connected to the story of Altar. Furthermore, let's not forget the impossibility of rediscovering the splendid Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus at the time of the third crusade, considered by many to be the best settings of the entire saga, net of other problems relating to the gameplay and the repetitiveness of the original work launched in 2007. After this necessary premise, before diving into the technical analysis of the Ezio Collection, let's make a quick excursus on the three games it contains, for the occasion accompanied by all the single player DLCs released over the years by Ubisoft (remember the bitter controversies for the ~memory 12~ literally cut off from Assassin's Creed 2?). This welcome extra is contrasted by the clean cut of the multiplayer experiences of Brotherhood and Revelations, a choice that will make some turn up their noses but which in any case does not undermine the overall quality of the collection. The package also includes a couple of videos that delve into the story of Ezio Auditore, whose life, over the course of the three games, is told from the act of birth (with a leap to adolescence) up to the advanced age of the third chapter. Among the most interesting features of the plot there is precisely the growth and evolution of the character, who from a slightly arrogant and reckless young nobleman, driven by the thirst for revenge for the extermination of the family, first transforms into a skilled assassin, then mature and reach the so-called age of wisdom full of questions, to which, however, he will not always find answers, as suggested by one of his famous reflections: ~And here, finally, I discover a strange truth. I am only a channel for a message that eludes my understanding ~. The games of Ezio Auditore's trilogy are considered real pillars of the genre they belong to, also thanks to the marvelous settings reproduced in them; Florence, Venice, Forl and San Gimignano in the second chapter, Rome in Brotherhood and a magnificent Constantinople in Revelations, which also grants passages in Cappadocia and in the mythical Masyaf of the original work. To find out the details on the individual titles, we refer you to the respective reviews already indicated in the piece, here we will limit ourselves to underlining some peculiar characteristics of the gameplay. Compared to Altar, Ezio has significantly better fluidity and responsiveness in his movements (a work that Ubisoft has continued to refine until the recent Syndicate), however they are rather woody and awkward when compared to today's standards. Brotherhood,in addition to the increase in the arsenal, the possibility of riding in the city and the use of Leonardo da Vinci's war machines, it is mainly distinguished by the various options related to the brotherhood, thanks to which it is possible to grow one's followers (sending them on a mission) and call them to their aid when needed. In Revelations the main innovations concern the crafting of bombs, the hidden blade that acts as a grappling hook (hookblade) allowing the use of ziplines and greater freedom in jumping, the towers to be defended from the assaults of the Templars and the possibility of exploring the entire Constantinople since the time it lands there. The evolution between Assassin's Creed 2 and Revelations is also palpable in various ancillary components, such as puzzles related to glyphs or insights into monuments and history through the sarcastic and sharp interventions of Shaun, one of the co-protagonists of the contemporary plot. All this is set in open worlds full of charm and full of things to do, which push the longevity of the Ezio Collection well beyond one hundred hours of play, if you really want to discover and recover everything in every single chapter. The only obstacles for players accustomed to the more modern chapters of the saga are the aforementioned ~woodiness~ in the movements and a decidedly more banal and tedious combat system, linked to an artificial intelligence that is anything but clever. Despite this, they are still very valid products today and have a decidedly deeper and more articulated plot than those seen in the last five years. Playstation 4 trophies Including three chapters of the series, the trophy list of Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection is truly endless: there are in fact about 150 objectives to be achieved, of which three are platinum related to the conquest of all the bronze, silver and gold ones in each of the games . The trophies are the same as the original products, with the exception of the multiplayer ones of Brotherhood and Revelations which have been replaced with trophies related to the DLC. Eye of the Eagle If you hope to find yourself in front of a work similar to that done by Infinity Ward for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered or that of The Coalition for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, unfortunately you will be disappointed, since even though some progress has been made, above all for Assassin's Creed 2, Ubisoft's polish is not so sensitive, as well as showing the side of some unprecedented flaws. The difference with the games for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is mainly noticeable by the 1080p resolution, while the fluidity remained anchored at a solid thirty frames per second, not without some slight uncertainty in the most chaotic situations. Fortunately there's more than that, and the best refinements are especially appreciable in terms of textures, which show a greater number of details and generally more vivid colours. It is enough to stop your gaze on the tiles, decorations and fabrics (such as those of the clothes or the canvases of the shelters for escape) to notice a greater cleanliness and brilliance of the textures. This is evident on Assassin's Creed 2 even when compared with the PC version pushed to 4K and Ultra details, which shows some technical flaws fortunately cleaned up in the Ezio Collection. We are referring, for example, to the shadows, which, although fewer in number, in Ubisoft's latest effort are generally less rough, serrated and flickering: just look at the facades of the most important monuments - such as Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence - to realize this. Furthermore, in the remastered we did not notice the annoying problem of textures loaded late on the most distant buildings. These differences diminish in Brotherhood and above all in Revelations, where the distance with the PC version at high details becomes almost impalpable, net of some better lighting phenomena (this can be clearly seen in the Brotherhood sequence in which Ezio and Mario Auditore ride towards Monteriggioni after the prologue in the Vatican). There are also slight updates on special effects, particles and water rendering, but nothing particularly incisive and relevant. Instead, what surprised us in the negative is the treatment reserved for some polygonal models: the interventions, albeit very limited, have slightly deformed the faces of certain characters, which also due to the dated animations sometimes lead to grotesque results. This ~make-up~ treatment was also reflected in the expressions of the eyes, which can appear haunted especially in the filmed sequences. These are small flaws that we certainly would not have wanted to see, however we are dealing with an appreciable chisel work, whichit is mostly noted on the older chapter included in the package. For the record, we also underline an annoying flaw relating to the two videos Lineage and Embers; once started from the main menu, in fact, it is impossible to pause them and activate fast forward or rewind, forcing the viewer to always see them from the beginning.", "date": "2016-11-17", "grade": "8.0"}
