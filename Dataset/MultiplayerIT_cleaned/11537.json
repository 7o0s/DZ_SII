{"name": "God of War: Chains of Olympus - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-recensione.html", "text": "Ghost of Sparta! Chains of Olympus takes place just before the original PlayStation 2 chapter, and after Kratos had been saved by Ares, the god of war. As the suffix of the title suggests, the warrior of Sparta is at the service of the gods of Olympus in an attempt to atone for his sins and get rid of the nightmares that perennially afflict him; his adventure starts in the city of Attica, with the aim of eliminating the Persian threat. In its continuation, a decisive role will be played by Morpheus, who will try to affirm darkness and death by taking possession of Elio, god of the sun and conductor of the solar chariot, which allows the manifestation of life. The first thing that catches the eye, needless to deny it, is the extraordinary work done from a technical point of view, which places the title directly at the top of this particular ranking on PSP. Thanks also to the use of the full speed of the processor of the Sony console, Chains of Olympus is a pleasure for the eyes, especially as regards the lighting effects, really impressive for a laptop. Even the animations and the creation of the environments defend themselves well and the title, also thanks to the smaller screen, does not disfigure compared to the older brothers, although obviously not reaching such graphic beauty. The frame rate undergoes some jolts downwards in the most frantic actions, but generally remains anchored around 30 frames per second and helps to make the experience enjoyable at all times. The sound sector, another strong point of the saga, remains at high levels here too, with an alternation between rearranged and completely unpublished pieces, supported by an excellent dubbing in Italian (which obviously also concerns the texts). Ghost of Sparta! Returning to the purely ~playful~ side, there could be some concern regarding the control system, given the lack of an analog button and the two lower backbones that characterize the PS2 pad; the refurbishment work was instead almost perfect. For dodging, for example, both back buttons are used, for the various mini-games and puzzles everything is delegated to the circle button and the gaming experience is absolutely not undermined. For the rest it is the usual excellent God of War ever, a mixture of action, puzzle solving and linear development of the story, interspersed with spectacular non-interactive sequences and an excellent narration of events. Kratos has light attacks (with the square button), heavy (triangle), highly bloody grapples (circle) and the ability to jump and double jump (with X). Instead, with the L backbone, the parry is used, which is enhanced during the adventure by the solar shield (we are not talking about Daitarn III) and by the favors guaranteed by the gods, which enrich Kratos' collection of new spells, such as for example the strength of Efreet, capable of creating a fiery shockwave. All spells are activated by pressing the backbone R in conjunction with one of the front buttons and as per tradition, for each enemy killed, he will release red spheres that must be accumulated (and which are also found in special bins) and can be spent to upgrade weapons and spells, as well as access new combinations of previously unavailable moves. The experience is therefore completely comparable to the other two chapters, and also in this case the level of difficulty, available in three different variations, is perfectly balanced both for newcomers to the series and for longtime players. The setting and the issues addressed are fascinating as always, however, perhaps thanks to a development oriented towards a portable console, the duration of the adventure is only 6-8 hours, and above all the puzzles seemed rather simplistic and not very incisive , as well as the bosses, which have always been a trademark of the series and far in number compared to, for example, those present in the second chapter. To close the plate of offers there is fortunately a good replayability of the title, which completed for the first time allows you to unlock a new level of difficulty and numerous extras such as different challenge modes, videos, costumes, images and cut scenes. Comment Even if the vote may appear concise, given the caliber of the title, we immediately dissolve the doubts by stating that Chains of Olympus also on PSP manages to fully restore the experience of the previous chapters of God of War, but having to clash with the two chapters original, seems to be a somewhat ~reduced~ version, less long-lived (although replayable), deficient in terms of puzzles and with a number of bosses that could have been greater, defects which in any case appear to be such even iftaken individually. That said, the Ready at Dawn title is undoubtedly a small jewel from a technological point of view, flanked by an excellent adaptation of the control system and the usual perfect balance and fun that distinguishes the saga, factors that establish this chapter as one of the greatest exponents of the genre on PSP, the best if you consider yourself a lover of Kratos and Greek mythology. Pros Outstanding graphics Great control system Fun and balanced Cons Low longevity Few bosses and puzzles God of War: Chains of Olympus is available for PSP.", "date": "2008-03-26", "grade": null}
