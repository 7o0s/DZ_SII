{"name": "Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-twilight-pack-recensione.html", "text": "Frontier Developments returns with an expansion for Planet Zoo, now more a platform to be equipped with ever-new content than a finished title. For all intents and purposes it is managed almost like a live service, between DLC and free updates. In this case there is also a big news, because the English team has decided to return to the career mode with a new scenario, for the first time since the release of the base game. But let's go in order, because Transylvania awaits us, just in time for the advent of Halloween which, as you will read in the review of Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack, is the central theme of the package. The animals and the new objects The new animals in Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack are excellent as always As in all other expansions of Planet Zoo, even in Twilight Pack the main strength is represented by the new animals. As always, Frontier Developments has done a great job of virtually recreating them and simulating believable habitats. The five so-called twilight animals added to the game are: the raccoon, the red fox, the common wombat, the common skunk and the Egyptian redhead. They are small to medium sized animals, one of which is for show, definitely pleasant to observe. At the level of construction of the habitats, net of some new objects, the work to be done seems to have already been seen, apart from some specific value to be set. The ability to change the color of the red fox's fur is interesting, but there isn't much more in the way of gameplay additions. As with the other expansions, we are faced with something so specific, that one would say it must be liked before the purchase to justify the same. Incidentally: you have to know in advance if you want the animals included in the package in the zoo, for mere personal preferences, because in terms of gameplay they add little or nothing. The same is true for the more than two hundred new objects with which to create and decorate the zoo. As you can imagine from the theme of the expansion, they are designed to give a dark touch to the environment, or just to characterize it as such. Thus it is possible to build castles and villages that seem to come out of a Transylvanian illustrated book and fill the zoo with eerie vegetation made of bristle-cone pines, ghost objects and so on. There are also gargoyle statues, pumpkins, and other Halloween touches to top it off. It must be said that, unlike what has been experienced in other expansions, in this case the theme of the new decorations is quite polarizing. These are basically objects that have little to do with the habitats of the new animals and are designed to ride the Halloween party. As such, they are either of interest, or the risk is that they are simply ignored, also because they can contribute to making the zoo decidedly pleasant. We didn't mind them but, outside of the new career scenario, we used them very little, because they create too strong a gap with the other objects, which are much more realistic. The new career scenario The new campaign scenario is worth the expansion Finally, after many expansions that have only added timed scenarios, in Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack the developers have decided to expand the career mode with a dedicated scenario, which adds a few hours of gameplay and puts lovers of traditional challenges more to the test . The player must then help Nancy in the renovation of a ruined zoo in Transylvania, amidst escaped animals, collapsing finances and crumbling structures. To succeed he must achieve several objectives, which are assigned throughout the scenario. Most of them are standard objectives, such as increasing the happiness of visitors, constructing certain buildings or fixing certain habitats (after all, we are still talking about a management game), but there are also more imaginative objectives, such as rescuing a bear from a heiress who wants to exploit him for not exactly pleasant purposes. Bats require some care Although it does not introduce any innovations compared to the basic gameplay, the new scenario is a small breath of fresh air, especially if you were disappointed by the contents of the previous expansions, which were practically all aimed at the sandbox mode. In short, finally even those who like to face objectives and challenges have been satisfied with pleasant extra hours of play. We hope that the next expansions will also follow the same path, because such content gives the whole package a certain dignity, so much so that it stands out from all the others.", "date": "2022-10-17", "grade": null}
