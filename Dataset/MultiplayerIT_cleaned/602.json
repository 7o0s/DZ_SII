{"name": "America's Army: Rise of a Soldier", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/americas-army-rise-of-a-soldier.html", "text": "Cross-platform The Ubisoft game, developed by the U.S. Army, is identical in the two versions, Xbox and PlayStation 2, which we tested. Both provide support for online play and we only noticed some small differences in the faster uploads for the Microsoft console. Comment America's Army Rise of a Soldier was certainly born with an excellent idea behind it, recreating with absolute realism all the difficulties that a true US army recruit can encounter on his way to becoming a fighting machine. The character management system is good, very similar to that of a real RPG, which allows you to specialize it in the characteristics that we consider fundamental. Too bad for the lack of a real storyline in the offline campaign, which would have greatly enriched the product. The final technical realization, also due to the several years that have now passed since the first release in the PC world, is unfortunately insufficient and greatly ruins the appeal of the whole game, and if it is possible to overlook the poor quality of the textures, it is not possible to let it go some major AI issues and overall package curation not up to today's standards. The Ubisoft title is therefore recommended only to true fans of the genre, lovers of realism and who know how to turn a blind eye to the technical flaws of the game. Online manages to guarantee several hours of fun, provided you dedicate a lot of time to it, developing your character in depth. Pros Realism and advanced warfare tactics Online play for up to 16 players RPG-like soldier development Cons Technically a letdown A.I. to review Three years have passed... A fundamental part of today's FPS is obviously online play, America's Army also offers this possibility. The online mode is completely separate from the single player Campaign, also in this case our recruit will increase in experience and skill during the games, but unfortunately we will not be able to use the patiently developed soldier on the net in offline sessions. A rather inexplicable choice, which certainly brings some frustration to the user. The matches are reserved for sixteen players, divided into two sides of eight players each. As in the Campaign, here too we will specialize in one direction, becoming the team leader, the specialist in heavy weapons or the sniper, are just some of the possibilities. Each specialization obviously has repercussions on the game, allowing us to perform particular actions or use a certain type of paraphernalia. In the first online games we will still play the part of simple riflemen, and only little by little will we acquire the experience and points necessary to become specialists. Online matches are limited to sixteen players, divided into two sides Three years have passed... In addition to the canonical deathmatch, which in this case is particularly bloody with only one life available, without unlimited respawns, online matches are based on objective rounds, such as defending the position while the other team tries to conquer it. The possibility of continuing to play, injured after a firefight, is very realistic only if rescued by a companion, but in this case, more or less seriously injured, obtaining good results will be almost impossible. Analyzing America's Army from a technical point of view, one can only be disappointed, the game in fact shows all its age, the three years that have passed since the first release in the PC world are felt. The polygonal models of the soldiers have certainly improved, but their animations and above all the artificial intelligence are very perplexing. More than once we have run into inexplicable scenes, not so much from the men of our team as from our opponents. One scene above all, when in a firefight a ~hostile~, instead of shooting at a member of the team very close to him, preferred to direct his entire magazine at our character who was distant and with a partially covered line of fire. The textures are unfortunately completely to be reviewed, not at all defined and not very credible, both in external and internal environments. To season the insipid dish we add a dancer and often uncertain frame rate in the most intricate situations. FPS or RPG? You may wonder what a first person shooter like America's Army could be different from the others, and in reality we were wondering it too before trying it. The answer is only one, the RPG component, never so accentuated in a military shooter. We will start the game as recruits, absolutely ill suited to combat, to grow gradually as training and training progressesof field missions. The growth of the character is based on seven characteristics, fundamental for a soldier, which we will be able to increase by carrying out the training in the best possible way. After each successful exercise, for example running combined with rifle shooting, we will earn certificates that will give us skill points, to be spent precisely to develop our recruit. Among the most important characteristics to improve we have leadership, aim, stealth, or the ability to act unseen, and honor. As you can see, very different areas of character development have been chosen by the developers in order to be able to differentiate your character in a peculiar way, to better adapt it to our style of play. Our choices will heavily influence the behavior of our virtual avatar, his conduct will faithfully reflect reality, influenced precisely by the skills acquired. the RPG component has never been so accentuated in a military shooter FPS or RPG? At the beginning of the campaign our recruit will have big problems aiming, he will not have any artificial sight to help him and to make the best use of the rifle he will have to rely only on the weapon's sight, and to increase the success of his shots he will not be able to unless you use the positions suggested by the trainer, lying on the ground or leaning the weapon on a tripod. At the beginning of the game, hitting the target, without having developed your aim well, will therefore not be so easy; a somewhat frustrating situation for those looking for a purely arcade game, but America's Army aims at another kind of player, at those who love challenge and realism, in short, a lover of simulation. Another clarifying example of the influence that our skills have on the whole game is that linked to leadership, if we have another coefficient in this characteristic we will in fact be able to command our troops without problems, instilling courage even under enemy fire and allowing them to remain calm and focused, but if we haven't developed it enough it will be hard to be respected. Advancing in the Campaign, after the heavy training, the missions will be increasingly difficult as the firefights against the enemy are more frequent, cooperation with our team of soldiers will be essential. And in this we will be helped by the tactics of the American army, faithfully reproduced and used by the developers, a point on which the game published by Ubisoft insists a lot. Also during the missions we will be able to earn skill points to spend to improve our fighter, but also to unlock new ~classes~ in which to specialize, such as the sniper or the assaulter. There are seven different types of soldiers, each with their own unique characteristics, and all have five ~personal~ missions, so for a total of thirty-five war actions. As you can therefore see, there is no real Tom Clancy-esque storyline, a fairly influential lack in our opinion, everything revolves around the development of our character, like a real RPG; the missions also have a high percentage of replayability, given the possibility of earning new skill points. The latest Ubisoft proposal for the 128-bit home consoles from Microsoft and Sony is a shooter, but not just any shooter, a game that is being marketed for the first time after several years of free usability even if limited to the PC world. Yes, because America's Army Rise of a soldier peeps out on Xbox and PlayStation 2 after it was released in a free downloadable version for personal computers three years ago. Several years have passed and the game developed by the US Army has been ~polished~ and refined, follow us to discover the goodness of the final product.", "date": "2006-02-28", "grade": null}
