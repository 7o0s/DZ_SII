After churning out Sports Bar VR several months ago, it is the Cherry Pop Games team itself that gives us the opportunity to play football wearing our headset thanks to VRFC, in full Virtual Reality Football Club. We tried it on PlayStation VR, but the title has also recently been available for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift: important news for everyone, because VRFC also supports cross-play between PC and PlayStation 4, with the aim of allowing as many players as possible to compete on the rectangles virtual. For the benefit of all FIFA and PES lovers who want to feel like Cristiano Ronaldo in the first person without leaving their living room, let's see together what it is. Training question VRFC is proposed without too many frills, immediately taking us to the heart of the action. Net of possible future updates, the Cherry Pop Games effort has only one online mode, preceded by a tutorial that explains how to control your virtual footballer. Before going to find out what the sensations of taking the field are, let's therefore take a look at the way in which the developers have thought of making us run and kick when we have the viewer on our heads. The control system is based on the use of PlayStation Move in the usual pair configuration, which is therefore necessary to play VRFC. The basic movement is running, which can be performed by moving both controllers alternately up and down: the greater the speed in carrying out this movement, the greater the speed of the player who represents us on the pitch. There is also a shooting mode, which can be activated by holding down the back buttons of the two PlayStation Moves, but it should be used sparingly as it is linked to a fatigue bar. To kick with the right or left you must instead move the controller that we have in the corresponding hand forward while pressing the back button, thus mimicking the movement of the foot to hit the ball. Instead, to turn around, the keys on the front of the two controllers are used, using the typical jerky movement that other virtual reality games use. As usual, it is possible to configure all the components that facilitate the use of this technology to your liking. Playstation 4 trophies VRFC features a total of forty-one Trophies, allowing all objective hunters to indulge themselves. There is also one of the platinum type, which is not obvious given the nature of this game, accompanied by five of the gold type, five silver and thirty bronze. Obtaining them is obviously linked to the deeds performed on the pitch, in particular to the number of goals and assists made but also to feats such as scoring a goal from one's own half or with a volley. The fatigue on me Contrary to what many might believe, VRFC does not present particular problems of motion sickness, even in particularly predisposed subjects such as the writer. Standing up and moving the PlayStation Moves to run allows the brain to get used to the idea of really being in motion on the green rectangle, even if in reality our body is stationary in the home environment. A system of this kind actually presents another problem, linked to the fatigue one feels after having played a few games: the arms are especially affected, as they are kept constantly in tension to run or kick the ball. In terms of entertainment, VRFC gives its best when the player learns to deal with the woodenness of the control system, dictated by the limits imposed by virtual reality (it is still simulated football) and by some choices that maybe we would have done it differently. Movements that in reality we would perform with fluency can become a small obstacle in VRFC: it is above all the passing system that suffers, too cumbersome in its need to receive the ball often with one's back to the goal, to then correct one's position and turn around with a series of presses on the buttons before finally being able to start running towards the opponent's area. What comes out is a kind of Rocket League with footballers instead of cars rather than a reasoned game, in which we would perhaps have seen better the possibility of moving the view following the movements of the head, thus gaining dynamism. From this point of view, the Dribble Assist mode can help us, which can be activated by pressing a button to ensure that theour soccer player keeps his attention fixed on the ball. It is not possible to control the goalkeeper: even if the CPU does its job quite well, we cannot help but feel it as a lack. In graphic terms VRFC is presented in the average of PlayStation VR titles, without indulging in particular excellences or blunders. By advancing in level it is possible to give your player a touch of personalization, just as from the very first moment you can choose the gender to meet both males and females who wear the viewer. For practical reasons, the external lines of the field have an invisible wall: there are therefore no throw-ins or corner kicks.", "date": "2018-03-13", "grade": "6.5"}
