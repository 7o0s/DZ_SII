There is no fighting game lover who cannot be extremely grateful to this hardware that has allowed Capcom to establish itself as one of the queens of arcades all over the world. We are talking about a very large park of titles that has been re-proposed over the years in countless remakes and collections on more or less recent consoles. However, one of the sagas that Capcom seemed to have left by the wayside was precisely that of the folk fighting monsters Darkstalkers, if we exclude the sporadic appearances of some of its protagonists in other projects (think of the presence of the Succubus Morrigan Aensland within the roster of Marvel vs. Capcom 3). It was precisely on the occasion of the celebration of 25 years of Street Fighter that Yoshinori Ono announced the interest of the Osaka house in relaunching the Darkstalkers brand, making veiled allusions to the idea of a new and unpublished episode of the series. Before realizing this fascinating hypothesis, however, Capcom wanted to measure how much appeal the brand still has among today's audience and does so by offering us a re-edition of the two chapters most appreciated by longtime fans: Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge of 1995 and Darkstalkers 3 , released in 1997. Between history and folklore Although it may seem to be a questionable choice, that is to include ~only~ the second and third episodes of the saga, in reality this selection appears well thought out considering that Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (released in Japan under the name of Vampire Hunter: Darkstalkers' Revenge) is nothing more than a revised and corrected version of the first Darkstalkers episode. On the other hand, the choice to insert the original arcade version of the third chapter (Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire at home) appears less understandable, neglecting the subsequent re-editions which boast a slightly richer roster. A choice perhaps dictated by the desire to offer the two classics in their ~arcade perfect~ versions, i.e. identical to those of the cabinets of the time. Details aside, it is immediately clear how the Darkstalkers Resurrection offer is decidedly attractive. Although not known to the general public as the street fighters company of Ryu, Ken and associates, Darkstalkers boasts a leading importance in the history of the fighting game genre, amply deserved by the innovative character that has always distinguished the series. Elements such as the EX moves and the chain-combo system were introduced by Morrigan and his companions, together with other less widespread but equally peculiar features such as the aerial parry. We cannot then overlook the absolutely over the top roster of characters that differs from the classic wrestlers exponents of the best known martial arts disciplines, for the protagonists of Darkstalkers we drew directly from popular legends and folklore. Monsters of all shapes alternate in the two-dimensional ring: mummies, cursed samurai, werewolves, zombies and attractive succubi are just some examples. The atypical design of the fighters has always been one of the most appreciated features by fans of the saga, a visual rendering embellished by beautifully crafted atypical and ironic animations that give the sprites an unmistakable iconic character, a perfect testimony of the golden age by Capcom artists. World competition Considering the excellent starting point, Iron Galaxy Studios (the same as Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online Edition and Marvel vs. Capcom Origins) were able to focus on the ancillary aspects to make the gaming experience as complete and satisfying as possible . Obviously the gameplay mechanics have not been touched in this digital port, there is no need to rewrite this piece of fighting game history. The solidity of the gameplay of the past has not been lost at all and thanks to the long distance of the saga from the spotlight of the market some of its characteristics will appear somehow new to the novices, think for example of the choice of being able to play by setting an automatic mode of the parade at the cost to sacrifice the use of chain-combo. What characterizes this re-edition is the clear inclination towards online play: one of the most interesting features, in fact, is being able to save replays of one's games and share them on YouTube which, together with an excellent tag system, can lead to creating thanks to the community of players a great database of videos categorized by category. It's not just about satisfying the narcissism of some virtuoso of the pad (or rather, of the arcade stick), in fact the possibility of being able to study the performance of other players turns out to be an excellent way to understand their secrets and study the right countermoves. The online sector is based on the GGPO infrastructure (also used in the aforementioned previous portings of the Iron Galaxy), which allows the search for matchmaking to be extensively customized based on the geographical region or even on the opponent's ability, also meeting the needs of non-optimal bandwidth even offering the choice of sacrificing animation frames to compensate for ping problems. The organization of individual matches and tournaments is also very accurate, with up to eight participants, with the convenient spectator mode that allows you to watch other players' matches when you are waiting. Xbox 360 goals Like any fighting game, reaching the full loot of 400 points will not be an easy task. In particular the 50g goal which requires you to finish the arcade mode of both titles without dying. Other achievements are related to the challenges in the single player game, many in the training mode and your online performance such as winning 10 ranked matches. Bring it on. Hard training The developers have also thought of those who have never had the pleasure of trying their hand at a fighting game from the Darkstalkers series. For them, but also for the more savvy player, there is an exhaustive section of personalized tutorials for each character, so as to allow you to get to know the specific characteristics of each fighter in depth, all of them indeed with decidedly heterogeneous characteristics. The more advanced sections of these workouts are clearly aimed at those who already know the game well but for the most part they prove to be really effective tools for practicing the gameplay of both games, characterized by fast and frenetic action, an aspect more accentuated in the more frenetic Darkstalkers 3. For those who want to devote themselves to the single game, there are mini objectives during the match (as already seen in The King of Fighters XIII) which allow you to accumulate points to spend to unlock videos and artwork taken directly from the original versions of games. From a graphic point of view, the porting followed the same treatment as the numerous other Capcom fighting games landed on digital delivery platforms. It is possible to apply the usual questionable graphic filter that smooths out the sprites of the characters, in addition the nostalgics of the fisticuffs in the arcade will even be able to choose whether to display the scan-lines typical of the old monitors, as well as select visuals that simulate the old cabinets, including camber of cathode ray tube screens. Always to follow the path of maximum fidelity to the originals, the music remained the same composed by Takayuki Iwai and also in this case it was not really the case to put your hand to an already excellent work as it is.", "date": "2013-04-01", "grade": "8.3"}
