Standard, in short, and not even without particular flashes since, in fact, the most interesting battlefield of this DLC is a remake in Greek sauce (no, it's not a tragedy) of one of the most popular maps of Modern Warfare 2, Highrise . Have you purchased the season pass? If you have, no doubt you will be less burned by the lack of exuberance of this Supremacy. If, on the other hand, you paid 14.99 euros for a single download, you will certainly have something to complain about. Supremacy is not exactly an unforgettable DLC for CoD: Advanced Warfare and Exo Zombie is not enough Few highs, many lows Kremlin, as the name suggests, takes us to Moscow to fight inside and outside the Kremlin. Generously sized map for a good battlefield, both from a stylistic point of view (the environments are rich in detail and equipped with a striking color palette) and from that of level design, which favors close combat in the central part but don't forget the remote ones. Two tall buildings allow snipers to cover the ~caciarone~ heart of the map with good lines of fire, without however forgetting that the developers have inserted a whole series of alternative side roads to expand the tactical possibilities of Kremlin. Good map, no doubt, but not the ones we'll remember, or perhaps replay in a ~revised and corrected~ version in a few years in one of the future Call of Duty DLCs. From Moscow we fly - indeed we jump, given our Exo skills - up to London for Parliament. Medium-sized arena, it is a classic ~standard~ product with a non-trivial but not too sophisticated level design, functional but not memorable. We are on a ship anchored on the Thames: the cabins located in a raised area allow you to have a good view of the deck, to be understood as a real ~tonnara~ for the two teams. Here too there is no shortage of crossroads and alternative routes, but as with Kremlin, there is no feeling of that ~extra~ that makes Parliament vote between one match and another. Compound is instead the smallest map and also the most disappointing of the DLC. We are in Colorado, inside an Atlas training base. The small size favors the most classic of close combat, where the shotgun seems to be the weapon of choice and where there is little space to hide. Consequently, the Exo skills allow us (like the grappling hook, usable in the Supremacy playlist) to move and cut the map quickly. Precisely because of a not exactly exaggerated size it is possible to run into some respawn problems, but nothing too serious even if obviously noticeable. A decidedly chaotic map, fun if you will, but not quite the flagship of the package. As we said at the beginning, Skyrise is a remake of Highrise, one of the most played and appreciated maps of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. This time we are in Greece, for a level design which, in fact, is the carbon copy of the past one , updated only on a stylistic and ~geographical~ level. The map worked at the time and still works today, with its ability to entice the player to explore all its ravines, perhaps to avoid the central area, the hottest one, exposed to fire from both bases. Very exciting to play, now as then. And then of course there's the Exo Zombie, this time set on an Atlas aircraft carrier. It goes without saying that Carrier is the best part of the package, a custom that further highlights the average quality of Supremacy's multiplayer settings. Bruce Campbell, the never too loved and acclaimed Ash of La Casa, is now added to the Hollywood cast, and to make everything even more complex and intricate, and obviously fun, the developers have staged a particularly apt level design, where the spaces narrow and labyrinthine of an aircraft carrier alternate with other larger and more airy. Speaking of new enemies, in Carrier we have zombies capable of teleporting, while in terms of guns we can get our hands on a devastating LZ-52 Limbo rail gun, lethal, at least until the twelfth round, with a single shot. Supremacy didn't drive us crazy then. The multiplayer maps aren't badly crafted but they certainly won't become (barring the Skyrise remake) your favorites in the rotation. Carrier is a strong point, but it's a bit too little to recommend the purchase of the full-price package, outside the Season Pass.", "date": "2015-07-11", "grade": null}
