{"name": "Half-Life", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/half-life_a.html", "text": "Mouse and keyboard versus joypad The main concerns regarding first-person shooters on consoles are given by the impossibility of using the mouse and keyboard, relying instead on the simple joypad. A matter of taste but also a matter of habit because in Half-Life the problem can be easily overcome in a matter of minutes, i.e. once you have completed the ~training~ mode you will be the master of the game and your Dual Shock 2 will give you great satisfaction. thanks also to the vibration function present in the ~hottest~ moments. However, it must be emphasized that the game is fully compatible with any mouse and keyboard that can be connected via the USB port of your PS2, which I would recommend only to those who really can't give it up and to the faithful of the genre. However, using the joypad you will find yourself very comfortable thanks to the 4 basic configurations, but it is also possible to personally assign the functions to the various keys. By default, however, the left analog stick is used to move around, while the right one to look around; the four keys L and R are used instead to jump, duck and shoot. Successful conversion? Half Life on PS2 is basically the same game that appeared a few years ago on PC, obviously exploiting the full potential of the 128-bit console. The game therefore offers a decidedly greater detail, already visible in the realization of the characters, animated in a very convincing way, especially the aliens, masterfully recreated and really disgusting. However, the resolution does not touch the levels seen on PC, which allowed you to play at 1024x768, and the difference can be seen. It should be emphasized that this version of Half-Life was practically already completed for the Dreamcast, a project then canceled and turned over in favor of the PS2, and it is also for this reason that all in all the graphics are not at the highest levels for the potential of the Sony console. Nonetheless, the graphic aspect is respectable and it is precisely here that the first differences with the ~mother~ version begin to be noticed. The number of polygons used for the characters has definitely increased and this certainly helps to give an even more human aspect to the game. Thanks to the power of the Emotion Engine, the graphic effects are wasted and all those goodies such as particles, smoke and reflections, not present in the PC version, are now a pleasure for the eyes. Finally, still with regard to graphics, it should be noted that all textures are high resolution. A small flaw, on the other hand, is caused by some slowdowns, even in moments when the action is not very frenetic, which in any case annoy little since the game runs almost constantly at 60 FPS. The secret of a success The graphic aspect is not everything and the success of Half Life is in fact mainly due to the great playability and the enthralling plot, which rivals the best films, giving the player a feeling of total protagonism. And this aspect is widely visible from the beginning of our adventure which sees us take on the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman aboard a train that transports us inside the Black Mesa laboratories. During our journey, we will be able to admire the undergrounds and all that inhabits them such as objects, people and, in particular, the scene in which huge robots are visible carrying out their work on construction sites is beautiful. At the end of our train journey, we will be greeted by a guard who will give us access to the laboratories. From here on, our normal working day should begin but something shocking awaits us Black Mesa scientists have created something unthinkable over which they have completely lost any kind of control, so monstrous aliens will begin to come out of the various laboratories and once we've armed ourselves to the teeth (weapons galore!), there'll be nothing left to do but exterminate them all, down to the last one. In addition to the aforementioned training mode, Half Life offers us 2 more: the very original Decay mode and Deathmatch mode. The novelty obviously concerns the first one which is really a lot of fun, and gives the possibility to 2 players (but it can also be played alone) to overcome a series of levels using 2 women (protagonists of this mode), now one and now the other, you will then have to try to complete various missions such as protecting some scientists from aliens. Deathmatch, on the other hand, is the well-known mode in which 2 players challenge each other in split-screen in the most classic of fights. This last mode obviously offers the best of itself with a nice 16:9 TV.Instead, the 4-player multiplayer mode, initially planned, has been canceled, probably in order not to burden the frame rate. Once the game is completed, obtaining a good final evaluation, we will have the possibility to restart our adventure in the role of an alien. Better PC or Console? What has been said so far is obviously not all there is to know about Half Life but the only way to fully appreciate it, for those who have never played it on PC, is to buy it as soon as possible because Half Life is a experience so engaging that it will not leave you indifferent. I am convinced that even players who have played it on PC will do anything to try this very successful conversion. It's useless to stand here saying or judging whether the PC version or this PS2 is better because there will be those who will remain faithful to the original and will never agree to hold that blessed joypad, there will be those who will appreciate both versions and those who will rejoice for the arrival of this great success on the Sony console without ever having played it before. The important thing is that another great title has landed on our PS2. Conclusions In conclusion I can't do anything but say that Half-Life has earned the title of best first person shooter, at this point not only on PC but also on consoles! The game is recommended to everyone, to those who already know it, to those who have never played it (unmissable) and to lovers of the genre in particular. While if you have already tried Red Faction and you are bored as hell then forget about Half-Life and aim elsewhere since in this period there is only the embarrassment of choice for PS2 games. Conclusions Pros: Convincing conversion Best first-person shooter Engaging story Lots of spectacular weapons Cons: Outdated graphics Some slowdowns here and there Some might miss the mouse and keyboard A quality game Half Life, for about 4 years, has been considered the best first person shooter ever to appear on PC and, as has happened to other titles of the same genre such as Quake, Unreal Tournament and Soldier of Fortune, the time has come to be appreciated too by those who do not consider the computer as a means to play. The PlayStation 2, for its part, is now in full maturity and these months are undoubtedly marking important moments for the Sony console which seems to be getting stronger day after day, always managing to amaze us with top-level titles. After this brief preamble I simply remind you that Half Life has finally arrived on PS2 and even if this could make those who consider the shooter genre a prerogative of personal computers turn up their noses, rest assured that up to now Half-Life is also the best on console.", "date": "2001-11-07", "grade": null}
