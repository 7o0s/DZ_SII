{"name": "Command & Conquer: Renegade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-conquer-renegade-2.html", "text": "A tough guy by profession. The protagonist of this game is Captain Nick ~Havoc~ Parker, the rogue and very efficient special agent that we had already learned to appreciate in Command & Conquer. This time our good Nick will have to stop the evil plan of General Gideon Raveshaw who, by kidnapping three of the major scientists in force at the GDI, involves the use of a phantom Re-Genesis project. Already in the very first game sequences we will be able to admire our Havoc during a spy mission inside an enemy base ... and the enemies are, as expected, the notorious NODs. The introduction, like all the animated interludes, is made using the same graphics engine that drives the whole game. From the beginning we will therefore be able to understand how the engine made in Westwood will hardly be able to keep up with those used by titles such as Medal of Honor or Alien vs. Predator II, the graphics are certainly good but it seems to have lagged behind at least two or three years compared to today's standards. Not even too surprised by this sad reality (after all it was predictable) we rush towards the first game mission and, finally, we have the first welcome surprises. A commando for love. Already in the very first moments of the game, the sensation of being in one of the scenarios that we had loved so much in the RTS of the Command & Conquer series becomes very strong. The sun is repeatedly obscured by the cargo planes carrying the armored vehicles destined for the various control centres, the noise of the enemy helicopters deafens us as they release dozens of soldiers to the ground ready to kill us, in the distance we will then be able to see our Harvesters attacked by the vehicles heavy NODs and our fellow soldiers who will die under enemy fire ... in short, we are in a full conflict between NOD and GDI and we are one of the many little soldiers sent to the slaughterhouse! The style of play is very ~arcade~ and the gameplay, while losing something in realism, proves adrenaline-pumping and fun in its particular conception of ~old-style~ FPS. A commando for love. On our HUD (Head Up Display for those less accustomed to acronyms) we will have a very comfortable radar that will be able to keep us updated on the number and position of the enemy units present in our vicinity and on the locations of the various game objectives, moreover, just like playing ~Tiberian Sun~ we will be able to view the energy bar of each target under our shot. All this takes away much of the pathos due to the classic Stealth & seek & destroy that the trend of the latest FPS seems to prefer, but allows us to focus more on our game objectives and on the extermination of the opposing troopers. A choice that once again makes us understand how this Renegade was designed to favor pure action. Action and thought. Action yes ... but not mindless. Anyone who might think of a sort of Serious Sam set in the world described by the Westwood RTS is very wrong. In fact, during the 11 game missions, in addition to our primary objective, we will have to, from time to time and if we wish, complete a different number of secondary missions. The secondary missions will be communicated to us, during the course of the missions, from our command center and most of the time they can consist of rendering enemy positions harmless or freeing certain strategic positions. This, once again, makes us feel just like a pawn within a vast chessboard where our every single move is part of a much more complex plot. In fact, destroying a series of SAM anti-aircraft batteries will open the way for our air forces which, with the sound of air-to-ground missiles, will make our life easier by destroying a division of heavy tanks defending a forced passage point. Another gem is represented by the fact that we will have to give a certain priority to the enemies to be killed; this is due to the fact that a special type of command unit has been introduced which, until we manage to kill, will call for reinforcements galore, making sure that before then we will end up overwhelmed by yet another wave of enemy troops. If we want to survive as long as possible, therefore, we will have to focus on finding these ~field officers~ and eliminating them as quickly as possible. A world to live and ... die. We said before that the game engine appears obsolete from the outset, but this is only true for the cosmetic component. For the rest we will be able to appreciateand the fact that the game environments are very large (not to say huge when compared to the standard offered by most of today's FPS) and mostly outdoors. This is because, let's not forget, the purpose of the designers was precisely to make us play within the maps that we had seen several times playing Command & Conquer. The loading times are indeed quite long, but once the game level has been loaded, our disk will never need to read any more data. Not even when we enter enemy bases to ~hack~ the security system or when from the window of the warehouse we have just conquered we will try to see how many enemies are escorting the convoy that we will then have to destroy. Most of the buildings in the Command&Conquer series are also present in this Renegade and we will be able to appreciate their three-dimensional construction both from the outside and from the inside by entering each of them. The internal reconstruction will not be a mere aesthetic addition but will represent, in many cases, a further sub-scenario, many buildings are in fact built on several floors and the exploration of each of them could take us a lot of time. Every now and then we could even glimpse a timid attempt to include animated sequences that are not directly congruent with our missions but which try to make our opponents more ~alive~ (in full ~half life~ style, to be clear). Scenes which, however, leave the time they find and which certainly do not achieve their goal. The music and sound effects also appear decidedly subdued and from a certain point of view they look disfigured even in front of their counterparts used in the RTS. There is a car to move. A nice novelty compared to most of the other first person shooters is that we will be able, from time to time, to drive the motorized vehicles that we find on our way. Also in this case let's forget the ~simulation like~ approach to ~Operation Flashpoint~ but expect a somewhat arcadey control method and, precisely for this reason, immediate and fun from the very first moments. The driving view will be in third person and the only difference on the style of play that we will be able to notice when going from the command of an agile NOD buggy to a heavy GDI tank will be the speed of the vehicle, the power of the guns and the consistency of the shields of protection. The weapons that we will be able to use during our raids are a little anonymous and all know of ~already seen~: the flamethrower has been introduced (now a real ~Must Have~ for any self-respecting FSP), the ~Nuke Beacon~ (the ultimate weapon: a transmitter which directs a highly devastating nuclearization onto the selected point) and also the ~Repair Gun~ used by our engineers, plus the usual automatic rifles, sniper rifles and so on but none of these weapons gives us the emotion of a BFG or the tension of a RailGun. There is a car to move. Even the enemies do not add anything new and indeed represent in a very faithful way the units and means that we have already known in the RTS of the series: there are, for example, simple soldiers, those equipped with rocket launchers, those equipped with a cloaking device , buggies and NOD Tanks and so on. From time to time we will also be able to meet some Guest Stars (taken from guess which saga?) who will once again show us the ~made in C&C~ quality label. The difficulty level is well calibrated but it will be given more by the number of opponents and their average health level (read hit points) and not by their cunning which, on the contrary, more than once seems to be in hiding in a worrying way. To tell the truth, this defect is not often felt during the various phases of the game as the gameplay itself tends to hide this unedifying aspect, however, the fact remains that more than once the arms have fallen (not to say something else) during yet another display of artificial stupidity demonstrated by one of our enemies. The multiplayer. If the single game mode is characterized by the almost absence of tactics (our objectives will in fact always be indicated to us by the command center) the multiplayer mode called ~C&C~ is distinguished by the particular style of play that can arise by combining the characteristics of RTS to those of an FPS. Assuming that it will always be possible to play in the classic Deathmatch modes, the ~C&C~ mode is certainly the one on which the developers have paid the most attention. This game mode consistsand in opposing two factions (obviously GDI vs NOD) made up of players belonging to certain classes (each taken from the C&C universe and each with relative strengths and weaknesses). Each faction has its own starting location which will be the operational base where our troops, our newly ~bought~ vehicles and our Harvesters will leave. At the beginning of each session we will start with the ~rank~ of simple soldier however as the game progresses we will be able to buy new structures, motorized vehicles and, of course, the possibility of impersonating a new player class. Each building will have a certain role within the logic of the game and destroying it means crippling the opposing forces (for example, by destroying the power plant we will remove the energy supply from the opposing base). Each of the opposing buildings will be destructible by attacking it from the outside or, faster but less easily, by penetrating inside them and detonating the control panel. As you can find out by looking at the screenshots on this page, the possibilities of choosing during the ~upgrade~ phase of the base are really many and give a truly enviable variety of game. The multiplayer. Points are earned mainly in two ways: by killing opposing soldiers and by refining the Tiberium collected by our Harvester (which must therefore be protected from enemy attacks). The end of each game is decreated once all enemy buildings have been destroyed or when we nuke the nerve center of the opposing base using the fearsome ~Nuke Beacon~ or the equally devastating ~Ion Cannon~. If a time limit has been set, the winner will be proclaimed based on the game points earned up to that time. The matches can be organized directly using the service offered by Westwood (complete with rankings and official statistics) or by relying on the increasingly widespread network managed by GameSpy. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this game mode could be the real fortune of this title. The gameplay is a very spot on mix between the styles of play that we have come to know in titles such as ~Team Fortress Classic~, Tribes or the much acclaimed CounterStrike. The authorship of ~Command & Conquer~ has not been wasted but, on the contrary, it has been exploited in the best way, guaranteeing matches that are as adrenaline-filled as they are reasoned; even if in fact the ability to use the mouse will be necessary, a game victory will also be extremely unthinkable without an effective division of roles (Who will have to defend the base? Who will entrust the task of destroying the opposing Harvester?) and careful planning in the use of stored resources (better to immediately favor the production of armored vehicles or defense structures?). We could hardly think of a better marriage between two genres that seemingly have nothing in common, really kudos to Westwood. It's just a pity that the NetCode (the management of the code that manages communications via the network) doesn't really seem one of the best: the recent problems we had with the ~Multiplayer Demo~ are proof of this and that, once again, the graphics don't lives up to everything else. And so what? It is useless to deny it, C&C: Renegade is an extremely fun game. This despite the fact that the graphic/sound sector already feels the inexorable weight of the years on its back, even looking disfiguring in the face of much older titles such as ~Quake III Arena~, and despite it not being a game of pure atmosphere (like the ~Medal of Honor~ or to the RTCW to be clear). But if it's true that graphics aren't everything in a video game, with Renegade we've had confirmation once again. Some good ideas at the base of a SinglePlayer mode that ensures solid and well thought-out playability and a MultiPlayer that could prove to be a real ~add value~ (we still have a doubt about the Net Code) mean that, for once, we will be able to have fun playing light-hearted without making useless paranoia about the historical reproduction of the weapons or the graphic detail of the textures used. Certainly there is no shortage of defects, first of all the intelligence of the opponents which has considerable room for improvement closely followed by a longevity in single player which, with 11 missions albeit of a rather high length, risks being too narrow. A bit like it already happened in the case of ~Return To Castle Wolfenstein~ we have a game with two souls in our hands. Qu", "date": "2002-02-25", "grade": null}
