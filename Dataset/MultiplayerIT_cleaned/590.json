{"name": "Dark Age of Camelot: Darkness Rising - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-age-of-camelot-darkness-rising-recensione.html", "text": "Great package for opera lovers Darkness Rising is not configured as a real evolutionary step: the innovations are limited and marginal for gameplay purposes, while the greatest efforts have focused on the graphic aspect and on the implementation of new quests for highly experienced characters. The minimum requirements speak of the thirtieth level to unlock the missions, but we highly recommend having a much more powerful hero. Assuming right away that in order to use the game all Dark Age of Camelot evolutions are necessary, let's start with the packs that Halifax, the Italian distributor, has granted us for this test, waiting for the Epic ~all inclusive~ Edition which will soon be also available from us. The first box set, really in excellent taste, includes the 4 CDs and updates up to Catacombs, and allows you to play for free for a month; the second, in turn containing a code that unlocks the new quests, consists of a couple of discs. However, it is good to remember the possibility of downloading and activating everything directly from the Mythic online store, despite the generous size (3.7 Gbytes occupied on the hard disk once installed). To enrich the package some goodies always welcome (a booklet with some artwork of the first DAoC and a poster of DR). [C] ready for the return to Camelot, after the restoration of the programmers some glimpses of the landscape are truly suggestive [/C] The will of the king Darkness Rising sees the three empires of Albion, Midgar and Hibernia under the shadow of new threats, and this time to ask for help from the player will be none other than the rulers. Although the plots are slightly different depending on the realm, the leitmotif that binds them is similar; by completing the king's missions you will be able to acquire one of the coveted titles of Champion (there are 5, which you can aim for after passing the fiftieth level) as well as a splendid enchanted weapon unique in its kind and whose power increases with the hero experience. One of the major innovations introduced by the expansion disk is represented by mounts. For the first time the player will be allowed to have his own steed, always ready to carry him right and left in the lands of Camelot. Its use is limited to outdoor spaces (no parades in the city or charges in dungeons), but the utility is still considerable. For more advanced level players, real magical horses are made available, with which to make all the guests of the servers die of envy: just think that for a ~modest~ handful of platinum coins it will be possible to ride the mythical unicorn! It's not just the aesthetic aspect that distinguishes these fabulous beasts from the more common ones, in fact these will also be a little faster and stronger. Medieval gameplay... The style of play has remained almost unchanged: the control system is not exactly user-friendly and will create some headaches for those who approach it for the first time (however, the expansion is not aimed at them): in the default settings the key pressed right allows you to direct the character, while with the left one moves the camera 360 degrees; the single click instead allows you to select objects and NPCs with which to interact. Apart from some keyboard shortcuts, in some cases it will be necessary to type the commands you want to issue on the console. The developers have also in this case decided to reward the RvR mode (Realm vs Realm), in which players of different populations clash on the borders between empires; death for your realm will not cause the loss of experience points, nor will it be possible to plunder the unfortunate victim, but you will level up more quickly than killing monsters controlled by the always poor artificial intelligence. Even those who prefer more classic adventures are in any case driven to seek the collaboration of other users, both to complete some tasks that could hardly be within the reach of the individual, and above all to gain experience faster. ...modern technique In terms of support, the game continues to be followed by a fair number of enthusiasts (on average 15,000 contacts at the same time); remember that there are different types of servers depending on whether you prefer the PvP mode or not. The Italian one, Deira, is actually a bit uninhabited but by discussing with other users we have found that it is slowly being repopulated. Our game sessions actually suffered from too many interruptions due to occasional disconnections and, in a couple of cases, it was necessary to restart the system as the notorious blue screen of death had appeared, inexplicably (the blue screen that freezes the system): honestly we would have expected greater stability from a title that has several years of development behind it. Interaction with other users, on the other hand, did not create problems thanks to the low latency times (we used a 4 Mbit/sec ADSL line). Longevity has never been a problem in Dark Age of Camelot and the numerous possibilities offered by Darkness Rising, even if rooted in a gameplay that is no longer very original - but well tested - should make those who had decided that adventures for lands of Albion had no more interest. The mounts and the new levels made available will certainly be appreciated by those who have been able to understand the essence of the series, but it is good to underline once again that the neophyte will not find great benefits from the purchase of this expansion, if not limited. Final thoughts At the end of the fair Darkness Rising manages to achieve the goal that the programmers had set for themselves - that of reinvigorating the interest of the players in a title that had not received any updates for some months. If it had been decided to focus on slightly more radical improvements, the judgments would be more enthusiastic, but those - perhaps - are destined for the next and awaited MMORPG from Mythic, based on the world of Warhammer 40,0000 and scheduled for 2007. Final comment An expansion intended for the more expert users of Dark Age of Camelot - probably the majority, given the age of the game - which, while not presenting a large number of new features, still manages to introduce new elements that will make your account reactivate who had already reached the top levels. If the programmers had also decided to intervene on the user interface we would have found ourselves in front of a product capable of presenting itself even to newbies, but in the end it can go well even like this. Although World of WarCraft has redefined the concept of ~success~ in relation to online role-playing games, it is undeniable that Dark Age of Camelot has managed to carve out an important space in a landscape where there is no lack of competition. Released in April 2002, it has been constantly subject to revisions and upgrades: five expansions to date (excluding the one in question), two of which are free (New Frontiers and Foundations), aimed at improving its aspects from time to time until making it one of the most interesting MMORPGs in the multiplayer-only universe.", "date": "2006-03-09", "grade": null}
