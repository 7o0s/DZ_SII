But the traumatic events that occurred on the farm have left their mark, especially in Lilly's life, she is full of resentment and ready to discuss every decision to the point of exhaustion. And as tension between Lilly and Kenny nears breaking point, we as usual have to decide which side we're on. Although never as in this episode is it difficult to predict the consequences of our choices. First of all, it is necessary to verify whether Lilly's fears are founded. In fact, the young woman claims that someone is stealing the supplies. There is therefore a traitor in the group. This is the turning point that leads us to collide with the living even more than with the dead. From now on we will not only have to defend ourselves from zombies and bandits, but also from the members of our group themselves. The Walking Dead: Long Road Ahead is the episode in which the infighting reaches the most dramatic levels. And if you know the Kirkman comic from which the game is based, you know that no one is safe, not even the characters we love the most. It is not for nothing that the third chapter of this saga full of visceral emotions is the best released so far. Many were waiting for Telltale to test the central phase, the most difficult to manage in any story, but the skill of the screenwriters is such that they pass the exam with flying colors. Long Road Ahead is everything you could want from an apocalyptic story set in a world of zombies. There is violence, hope and remorse. And no one is safe. So let's step into Lee's shoes for the third time but get ready to regret our choices. In Long Road Ahead every decision leads to consequences that weigh like boulders on the heart of the protagonist. A hundred shades of horror Long Road Ahead is full of situations. There is a lot of action and the fights include some variation on the typical close-range brawls with zombies. Although obviously the psychological evolutions of the characters are the main reason of interest. Compared to the previous episodes, the third chapter is a bridge that opens new horizons to the series. In fact, for the first time Lee and his companions set off on the road, first with the camper and then on board a train. Destination Savannah, the town where Clementine's parents were at the time of the disaster. The journey is plagued by grisly events, but Lee and Clementine remain at the heart of the story. Or rather: they tell a story within the story. They are a nucleus of hope that manages to remain pure despite the increasingly severe traumas that threaten it. And in terms of horror Long Road Ahead is not spared, so as to make us fear for Clementine. After what we've seen here, what else could actually be worse than losing the little girl we're parenting? To find out, however, we will have to wait another month, so let's think about the present. Long Road Ahead offers for the first time a glimpse of the world outside Macon and alternates night scenes with long daytime journeys, at different times of day. An opportunity to admire the splendid graphic style that proves to be increasingly spot on for this series. The expressions of the characters are worthy of an artist and lay bare any emotion that stirs behind their faces. There are so many nuances to grasp and the depth that reaches the relationships between the members of the group is not found in other types of video games. On the other hand, The Walking Dead focuses entirely on the player's emotional involvement in a story that grinds the soul by dint of mourning and disappointment. That's why there are no complex puzzles or fight scenes. A prolonged interruption of the narrative rhythm would break the illusion of being there with Lee and Clementine en route to safety. It's just a pity that there is no noteworthy music. A memorable soundtrack is the only quality this series lacks. For the rest we are on levels of excellence.
