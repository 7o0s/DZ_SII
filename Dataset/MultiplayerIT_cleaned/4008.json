Among the new entries, some figures belonging to Greek mythology stand out such as Zeus, Athena, Ares and Perseus: the latter steals from the father of the gods some bracelets that have the power to recreate the world, but the objects end up in the wrong hands and give life to a new, terrible threat. To face such a great danger it will be necessary to bring together once again the strongest leaders of imperial China and feudal Japan, equipped for the occasion with divine weapons that allow them to perform unprecedented magical maneuvers, which add a further substrate of spectacularity to the musou action that we know well. A novelty sufficient to break the monotony, which is also a characteristic trait of Omega Force-branded productions? Let's find out in this review. Characters and modes As mentioned, Warriors Orochi 4 boasts an extraordinarily large roster, made up of 170 different characters. It is an absolute record, which has earned this episode the introduction in the Guinness Book of Records, and although the mechanics do not change that much from one fighter to another, the combos and special moves are reason enough to develop your own preferences. In fact, in the game we are asked to create a team with the possibility of switching from one warrior to another by simply pressing the triggers, even in the middle of an attack, and to select an additional group of characters to support us actively in battle . During our test we therefore put together Honda Tadakatsu, Sanada Yukimura and Li Naomasa, gradually developing their power and skills to transform them into unstoppable war machines. Thanks to magical weapons, Honda can in fact evoke the power of the sea and overwhelm his opponents with its waves, or create a vortex that allows him to continue to inflict damage on captains and bosses. Sanada can instead create energy disks that rout the most numerous troops, or hover in the air to literally crush hostile units with powerful wide-range energy shots. Finally, there, he launches celestial bombs on his targets or summons a power that damages anyone in the vicinity. The introduction of magic attacks actually differentiates each character, prompting us to test their skills in test battles, so as to choose the solution that best suits our style. To unlock all the components of the roster you have to complete the missions available within the four campaigns that characterize the rich single player sector of the game, which can also be tackled in local cooperative mode and supported by an Arena mode for online multiplayer challenges open to a maximum of six participants, in which the goal is to conquer outposts and score the points needed to win the match. A nice but not particularly brilliant extra. Gameplay and missions Having archived the unfortunate open world experiment of Dynasty Warriors 9, Warriors Orochi 4 returns to the traditional musou formula, made up of not very large maps that must be cleaned up from the presence of enemies. The role of the scenarios is once again purely accessory, so don't expect an improvement in terms of interaction or detail, given that in most cases we are talking about basic, spartan, rather repetitive and generic settings in the use of assets. However, as mentioned, these are functional elements to the gameplay, which is effectively reinvigorated thanks to the introduction of the new attacks, which make the fights even more spectacular and increase the variety of the experience by a minimum. Let's be clear: you will only proceed by always performing the same combos and specials, throwing the soldiers into the air as if they were skittles, but you can intersperse these maneuvers with the new ones, which with their freshness and effectiveness will not fail to excite you. In particular the choral action that can be performed by pressing both triggers when the indicators are full, and which sees the entire squad and support units charge an energy sphere which then crashes to the ground, routing the army we are facing . Guess additions but which go to the detriment of the degree of challenge, at the completely inconsistent normal level, and once again highlight the fact that this franchise suffers from obvious balancing problems. On the nature of the missioni, then, there is very little to say: it is simply a question of moving around the map according to the indications given to us and eliminating specific objectives or completing certain paths, all while the characters continue to talk to each other: the dialogues they are in Japanese and the subtitles in English, but it is difficult to follow them in the middle of the battle and at a certain point the constant shouting (especially that of some female characters) will begin to annoy you. Between one mission and another it is possible to spend the experience points and the gems collected to upgrade the characters, equip better weapons, add slots for elemental damage and sell or dismantle the tools we do not need. The same growth function is also available for the base camp, which once upgraded will give all our warriors bonuses. Playstation 4 trophies There are 44 Warriors Orochi 4 Trophies, and getting them is quite simple: most of the achievements are linked to the completion of the chapters that make up the single player campaigns, while the more specific ones are unlocked by performing actions that you will certainly resort to during the grueling battles against thousands of enemies. Graphics, sound, controls From a technical point of view Warriors Orochi 4 does not revolutionize the series in any way, presenting graphics very close to that seen in the last episode of Samurai Warriors: a modest result, if we consider that two years have passed. On PlayStation 4 Pro the frame rate is unfortunately not rocky and indeed there are some uncertainties during the most agitated situations, but nothing serious when compared to the enormous amount of enemies that are displayed simultaneously on the screen. Also in this case the old pop-up effect of the soldiers approaching the protagonist has been greatly limited, and which therefore we will not see appear out of nowhere a few meters away. On the other hand, some camera frenzy is noted when performing certain moves in confined spaces. If on the dialogue front the interpretation lives up to expectations and the soundtrack tries to interpret the crossover nature of the game in an exciting way, however ending up proposing music that is also quite trivial and ugly. Finally, the control system takes up the traditional layout of Warriors Orochi and musou in general, assigning the character change to the triggers and the activation of the magic to the right backbone, which can be activated according to the indicators with the Square, Triangle and Circle buttons . The solution of the ~magic~ recall is also excellent for the horse, which instantly appears under our legs, avoiding the hassle of having to mount the saddle while we are surrounded by hostile troops.", "date": "2018-10-16", "grade": "7.0"}
