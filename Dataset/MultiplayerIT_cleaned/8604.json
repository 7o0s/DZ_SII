It is a very simple task, at first: just move some blocks, drop them on a platform below and use them to cross an otherwise impassable point, then reach the goal. However, as you progress through the levels, things get much more complex and completing the stages requires a certain amount of trial and error. This is the philosophy behind Rinth Island, the action puzzle developed by Buzz Monkey for iOS devices which takes up the classic concept of the ~rotating~ tower (even if in reality it is the view that moves) to put it at the service of puzzles first banal, then gradually more multifaceted. The main mode of the game, called ~Adventure~, is made up of two zones (a third will be coming soon) divided in turn into six levels, each with a tower and different situations. As mentioned, the experience in the first few minutes appears simplistic to say the least and it is literally a walk to move from the starting point to the arrival point, but fortunately the level design quickly transforms into something more significant and elements such as reasoning, the glance (to see points of the tower apparently hidden from the frontal view) and above all the trial & error approach, which is essential most of the time. It towered over me The control system adopted for Rinth Island is of the traditional touch type, with a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and some buttons on the right side. The sensitivity and precision of the d-pad unfortunately leave something to be desired, but fortunately we will never be called upon to perform rapid or highly precise actions, therefore it is a defect on which we can turn a blind eye without major problems. Our character can push blocks to make them fall onto a lower platform, as if the tower were a sort of large construction site made up of various scaffoldings, but he doesn't have the ability to jump and it is precisely on this limit that he is based the basic idea of the Chillingo product: you have to make the right moves or start over, with no middle ground. In the more advanced stages, some special actions are added to our repertoire, such as the possibility of placing explosives that can also trigger cannon fire, always with the aim of clearing the path that will lead us to reach the desired object, and this contributes without 'other to make the gameplay more varied. Furthermore, once you have mastered the dynamics of the game, you can try your hand at a nice editor for creating levels to then share with your friends. Not bad for a title that costs only 79 cents, right? As far as the technical implementation is concerned, the musical accompaniment appears decidedly limited and repetitive, with the same piece repeated endlessly, while a more than discreet job has been done for the graphics, capable of characterizing the towers and the elements that surround them.", "date": "2012-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
