Simply because Tezuka's game, as it evolved, took shape and assumed its own identity distancing itself from Super Mario Bros. 3, had the world itself as its main strength: no small sections, no schematizations, just one big map that housed the (approximately) seventy levels. Although its predecessor is superior in terms of variety and fantasy, Mario World managed the difficult task of improving only sketchy aspects and introducing others that over time would prove to be of fundamental importance: not only the huge map that gave cohesion and shape to the ~world~, but also a mechanic based on exploration as much as on reaching the end of the level: if Mario 64 was what it was, it also owes it to the genius of this episode for Super Nintendo. The replayability rate was therefore very high, because once the adventure was completed it wasn't simply a matter of redoing it from the beginning to unlock some manic details, but real levels as beautiful as the main ones. World's innovations certainly didn't stop at these aspects, but also included the arrival of Yoshi, the now historic Nintendo dinosaur; according to legend, Miyamoto always wanted to include it in the plumber games, but due to the limited capabilities of the NES, he didn't get the chance until the Super Famicom. Entertaining in the main quest, that is in the main adventure, Yoshi distanced himself from the condition of a mere living power-up through the exploratory phase, where he played a fundamental role that made him a real co-protagonist of Super Mario World. 17 years later... Mario World is still a dazzling orgy of gameplay, from start to finish, seemingly impervious to the passing years. The pixel perfect interaction is still enchanting, as is the control system: in the Mario saga, and this one is of course no exception, the player never has anything to hold on to except his inability to justify his mistakes. The same longevity, a sore point of many dated games in the Virtual Console catalog, represents one of Mario World's strengths: the main adventure, although not particularly demanding, is quite long, the hidden stages are many and difficult to find, the shortcuts to try to finish the game as fast as possible there is certainly no shortage. Although Super Mario World is not set in the Mushroom Kingdom, the elements dear to fans of the saga are certainly not lacking: the mushroom, the star and the flower, timeless icons of a certain way of understanding video games, are all well rooted in the gameplay of this platformer, accompanied by Yoshi and the feather, capable of making Mario fly. If you remembered it wrong or you were simply a fan of 2D platformers, buying the game would be highly recommended, but if you've never tasted or even tried it, spending 800 Wii Points on it is a moral obligation: the ghost houses are there waiting for you , together with the historic ninety-six ~Goal~. Released in Japan in November 1990 as the spearhead of the Super Famicom line-up, also known as Super Nintendo, Super Mario World is still today one of the greatest exponents of the two-dimensional platformer. The game, initially planned under the name of Super Mario Bros. 4, was started immediately after the conclusion of the third episode of the series, without any major changes in the development team.", "date": "2007-02-26", "grade": null}
