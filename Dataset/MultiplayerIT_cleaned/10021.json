With the rights to the competition firmly in the hands of Electronic Arts, it was therefore assumed that an ad hoc version of Fifa would reach the shelves; with valid versions (Ps3 and 360) and others a little less (Wii), it was quite interesting to see to what extent this ~intermediate~ edition of the sports franchise was able on Apple platforms to improve the questionable results collected by Fifa 10. Pole... actually no, goal! As more than presumable, this Fifa World Cup is largely based on the material created for the previous episode; therefore, the team is always that of EA Mobile and the product is nothing more than an evolution of the chapters born on the N-Gage platform. Certainly not particularly exciting premises, even if only in the face of the differences in the technical capabilities that exist between the defunct Nokia and Apple platforms. That said, it would be unfair to reject the programmers' work a priori in the face of the fact that an effort in trying to improve one's own ~creature~ is perceived. Surely numbers and licenses have never been a problem within Electronic Arts productions, and in fact also in this case we are faced with 10 real South African stadiums and 105 world teams with all the related players; it is a pity that for the latter the poverty of the polygonal complexity prevents having a level of detail such as to differentiate the various protagonists in a satisfactory manner. If Fifa World Cup is therefore not a particularly beautiful game to look at, even in the face of a modest variety of fluid animations and bare side elements (terrible skits in which the fans are framed), it is at least a better game to play in the face of improvements in the interface. Fifa 10 in this sense had really been forgotten, due to a complexity that required far too many hours of practice. In this case, however, it was decided to simplify everything by basically indicating on the screen, on the same virtual keys, the function of the buttons; an unimaginative but quite effective solution, which improves the pleasure of facing the games a little. Some problems arise only in moments of change between possession and non-possession of the ball, in which the variation in the functions of the keys can disorient and weigh down the fluidity of the game. Despite these steps forward, the legacies of an outdated product that would need to be rewritten from scratch can be seen both in the development of actions that are not very varied and always similar to themselves, and in the face of artificial intelligence that is decidedly poor at every level of difficulty, both in the woodiness of the response to the commands given to the athletes. The value assigned to some teams is also questionable, such as the 3.5 stars (out of 5) in Israel and Cyprus or the 4 in Bulgaria and Belgium or even the 4.5 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reality is that while Fifa on consoles has been the undisputed qualitative reference point for a couple of years, on the iPhone it actually finds itself having to chase better quality productions, such as Gameloft's Real Football and X2 Football. The fair number of game modes and local multiplayer therefore help little if there is such a weak gameplay underneath.
