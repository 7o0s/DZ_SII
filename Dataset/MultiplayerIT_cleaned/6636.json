The island that was once owned by his family welcomes him with open arms, hoping it will prove to be up to his task, that is to restore splendor and wealth to the city and form a group of formidable heroes capable of defending and administering it. This is the incipit of the latest title developed by HandCircus, Rolando's talented authoring team, once again grappling with mobile devices after Okabu's pleasant parenthesis on PlayStation 3. Right from the start, the atmosphere of the game closely resembles those of the classic Animal Crossing, although the activities with which we will have to engage in the course of the adventure go beyond the simple management of a village. Our character will in fact have to reunite the old crew of Seabeard, as mentioned, but also deal with the reconstruction and enhancement of his island, moving within a populous archipelago full of places to explore, each heralding new missions, objects and figures to interact with. As we gain experience, we will be able to access new functions and unlock aspects of the experience that are initially precluded to us, such as fighting inside caves or the possibility of removing boulders and obstacles using dynamite. Activity that we will be able to put into practice with a little patience, if we decide to play the game completely free, coming to terms with some expectations (the usual timers that regulate, for example, the construction of a building) which however, in this specific case, can be mitigated by dedicating oneself to other activities. Seabeard's strengths lie precisely in this wealth and variety compared to many other freemium-based Farmville clones, where the so-called ~paywall~ becomes evident when you necessarily have to wait or pay to be able to do anything. There is no shortage of in-app purchases, of course, and they can make our life easier, especially during the initial stages; however, as mentioned, there are many things to do and there is no limitation in this sense: if the creation of a new shop takes time, we can distract ourselves with a fishing trip, completing some boat races to scrape together gold coins or by tackling one of the many side quests available. Seabeard is a simple yet addictive, stylistically remarkable Animal Crossing-style adventure Style to sell There are many products on the App Store that would like to be like Seabeard, but generally they lack a fundamental factor: inspiration. The setting of the new work by HandCircus is fascinating, boasts a very pleasant style and catches the attention after just a few seconds, sweeping away the feeling of being faced with the usual casual simulation thanks not only to the many activities we have mentioned previously, but also to an extremely practical and effective movement and control system; a ~touch and go~ solution that minimizes waiting times because it finds quick shortcuts and allows us to reach any point on the map in a few moments, without having to face difficult paths or come to terms with the systematic limitations of the touch screen. Playing with Seabeard is extremely simple and this makes the experience rewarding, perhaps even more than the real merits of this production. There is an interesting day-night cycle that reflects the time in which we play, giving us different situations and potential new missions, but there are also the fishing and fighting minigames, the endless run style ones when you move with the ship from one island to another and the exploration itself, especially when it comes to finding objects necessary for the realization of a restoration that will bring with it new, further playful possibilities. The freemium mechanisms become more pressing after a few hours, slowing down the progression, but we can say without fear of contradiction that the developers have managed to balance these factors in a sensible way, allowing us in any case to never stand still and wait; and to decide, with good reason, whether to possibly invest a little money to increase the capacity of the inventory or of the benches on which we will sell many of the objects collected around.", "date": "2015-01-10", "grade": "8.0"}
