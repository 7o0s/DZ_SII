Javelins reported left and right, angry comments and even an improbable petition posted on the net asking Nintendo to cancel the project from the face of the planet. A childish and frankly questionable attitude, as often happens when you push your hand with initiatives that would be better reserved for other shores. Also because, after all, you are never forced to buy a product with a gun pointed at your head. On the other hand, it should also be remembered that the communication strategy of the big N had not turned out to be exactly flawless, with the choice to show only the Blast Ball mini-game and completely omit the main experience. Those who tore their clothes before their time would have done well to be patient and gather the information with the benefit of taking stock, also out of respect for a studio like Next Level Games, which in the past had already demonstrated that it knew its stuff with titles such as Luigi's Mansion 2 - also on Nintendo 3DS - and Punch-Out on Wii. As we imagined, the reality hidden beneath the surface has brought to light a fairly well-made title which, despite having very little to do with the chapters of Metroid Prime lived on GameCube and Wii, and despite having to live with the weight of a high-sounding name , has a few arrows in its bow to have fun in cooperative. Federation Force is designed for co-op, using it alone would not make much sense This time Samus is not with us As the title suggests, Federation Force completely puts aside the adventures of Samus Aran and focuses on the military activities undertaken by the Federation. Despite the destruction of the Phazon and the planet Phaaze, space pirates still pose a threat and must be finally eradicated. To succeed in the enterprise, Operation Golem was launched, thanks to which the galactic forces aim to regain a position of control with the help of efficient armored war mechs. As we have said, the game is designed to favor co-op use alongside three other players. The association can take place locally with the wireless mode, or searching for users via the network. The twenty-two missions into which the campaign is divided, distributed on the three planets Excelcion, Talvania and Bion, provide for various types of assignment that alternate the destruction of sensitive objectives, the recovery of objects by solving puzzles or the killing of some bosses. In recent months, the producer and designer Kensuke Tanabe had highlighted the variability of the gaming experience offered by Federation Force in single-player compared to co-op. The game has obviously been calibrated to give its best when you take part in team sessions, even in balancing the difficulty. The tasks that must be completed are evidently developed to ensure the division of tasks between team members and, by participating in a group, the completion operations appear decidedly more consistent with the design of the levels. The Federation Force control system does not require a New Nintendo 3DS or the Circle Pad Pro, but it goes without saying that the second analog stick significantly improves the performance of one's movements. The aiming system also takes advantage of the gyroscope integrated into the console: by aiming at a target and tilting the device to the right or left, up or down, it is possible to change one's aim even without resorting to automatic lock-on. The tool is necessary to hit some objects or direct the rate of fire towards specific parts of the body of the enemies, such as areas without armor. The control system has given us fluctuating impressions, showing some limits especially in the most frenetic situations, even more so during solo raids, where the absence of allied support is already felt after the first six or seven missions. The most interesting mechanics concern the application of Mods, particular functions that allow you to improve the performance of your mech, influencing variables such as the amount of hits received or the percentage of damage inflicted. Some of these materials are static, while others can be applied as consumable items to be used once, but in both cases the collection of resources always takes place while exploring the maps. Various indicators are functional to forfeit medals, taking into account the enemies killed and other bonuses. During the missions it is also possible to recover a series of di supplementary items that complement the primary rate of fire, such as target homing missiles, proximity bomb and electric grenade, but also the scan tool to detect weak points of enemies. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect of Metroid Prime: Federation Force produces good sensations of depth during the main missions, while partially reducing the definition and fluidity of the game. Less advisable to use during games of Blast-Ball. Welcome to the Blast Ball It's time to dwell on the much reviled Blast Ball, the mini-game that acts as a counterpart to the main mode of Federation Force. On the basis of what happened a decade ago with Metroid Prime Pinball on Nintendo DS, the Next Level developers have tried to propose a formula that is strongly unrelated to the reference brand. Questionable? Maybe, but that's not the point. What made us turn up our noses the most was the idea of creating a full-blown clone of Rocket League, less fluid and also much less fun. Think for a moment of Psyonix Studio's frantic game released last year, get rid of the racing cars to replace them with mechs and that's it. Blast Ball offers three-on-three battles against the CPU or other users on futuristic soccer fields with the aim of scoring three goals to win the match. To put all this into practice, just get on board your trusty mech and bombard a sphere with bullets until you successfully lead it into the opponent's goal. By choosing the Versus mode, you are limited to playing a single match and leveling up based on the quality of your performance (goals, assists, saves, etc.), while by falling back on the Challenge, you have the opportunity to participate in a series of five matches of difficulty growing against CPU-managed opponents, in the company of two other players selected through matchmaking. Frankly, Blast Ball was not missed and it would have been better to concentrate resources on some secondary mode more adherent to the main experience.", "date": "2016-08-20", "grade": "7.0"}
