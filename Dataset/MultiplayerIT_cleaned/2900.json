Maybe not as dangerous as the one in Steven Spielberg's film, but a place where the cute creatures stay calm in their enclosures, even wearing funny hats if necessary to entertain visitors. The Parkasaurus review you are reading speaks to you about a management system of this type, linked to the trend of zoo tycoons with the presence of dinosaurs, but without taking itself too seriously. It was made by the guys from WashBear Studio, a name behind which only two members are hidden who, with the help of Early Access, managed to carry out their project, now available in its complete version on Steam. It was precisely the interest aroused by Parkasaurus on the Valve branded platform that made us curious to try it, starting to build parks where we could make a fortune thanks to our dinosaur friends. Want to know how it went? Read on! Mode: dinosaurs from space For a game like Parkasaurus, the main danger is that of putting too much iron on the fire for the player, leaving him lost among the many things to keep an eye on in the various management aspects. From this point of view, the work of WashBear Studio manages to put whoever is in front of the monitor perfectly at ease right from the start of its tutorial, which provides us with the basis for dealing with the two main modes of Parkasaurus: the campaign and the inevitable sandbox. The first calls us to complete a series of already defined scenarios, with the aim of helping our dinosaur friends who have come from space. The various levels are differentiated above all by the landscape on which we find ourselves operating, as in the case of Toronto where we have to find a way to build our dinosaur park in the limited space offered by the city's canals. Then there is the mission where instead we have to build a house for some creatures kept segregated, and so on, going from time to time to meet the objectives of the level we are playing. Once all this is completed, you can choose to give free rein to your imagination by launching yourself into the sandbox mode, where you can build a park from scratch without having to chase after particular objectives. At the beginning of the game, you can customize the experience by changing some parameters, and then throw yourself headlong into building the park. Considering the presence of the two modes, Parkasaurus can enjoy excellent longevity, especially if you are a fan of the genre. Seeing the park at work and the dinosaurs moving around in their enclosures is in fact a real pleasure. The only drawback, as we are about to see, is represented by a not exactly high difficulty. Gameplay: Watch out for poop! The gameplay of Parkasaurus is linked to that of Theme Park and descendants, while still offering some interesting ideas compared to the standard. The first thing we have to do to give our dinosaurs a home is to build an enclosure to house them, bearing in mind that each species requires its own habitat. By playing with the leveling of the land and the presence of rocks and vegetation within the space, it is thus possible to create a biome that satisfies the needs of the guest. Secondly, we must guarantee its food, going to see if it is a herbivorous or carnivorous dinosaur. At this point the park staff comes to our aid, to be precise the veterinarians who take care of the creatures present there. In addition to the need to give food to dinosaurs, it can in fact happen that they get sick, resulting in infectious towards others if not treated in time. The cause of the pathology can be identified by the color of their excrements, on the basis of which to administer a specific therapy. To avoid relapses, however, the signal received should not be underestimated: it could, for example, be that the amount of food is not adequate, or the enclosure is not large enough, or the dinosaur could still suffer from a lack of privacy. In fact, all of the creatures require a portion of tall grass, or in any case a shelter where they can sleep and take refuge from the view of visitors. The rest of the staff that we can hire in the park includes orderlies, security officers and scientists. The former keep everything clean and repaired, the latter avoid collateral damage inflicted by possible offenders, while the third ones give us the opportunity to accumulate science points, which can be spent in the appropriate research branch to unlock additional elements with which to populate the park. The other currencies present in Parkasaurus are the inevitable money and hearts, which we can accumulate by making our dinosaurs happy. I cEggs can be spent in another branch to supply dinosaurs with trinkets, while the combined use of the three elements allows us to buy new eggs with which to populate the park. To do this you also have to go through an excavation minigame, in which you have to find footprints and fossils. In terms of depth, in short, there is everything, and Parkasaurus cleverly manages to put it in front of us without making us get lost in the management aspects of the park. The only comment we feel we can make to the effort of WashBear Studio is the absence of a certain level of difficulty, which could have been dared thanks to a good level of clarity and cleanliness. Once the slowest start-up phase of the park has been overcome, you will hardly find yourself in difficulty especially from an economic point of view: while money and hearts will find it difficult to arrive at the beginning, the science points will be many from the beginning. Thanks to the bank present in the game, however, it is also possible to turn them into money, thus always remaining with a good amount of dough in the pockets without risking having to close. The choice to give players a relaxed experience is probably part of the design of Parkasaurus, but the ability to also select a more challenging level of challenge certainly would not have hurt. The graphics: cute and cuddly As we said in the introduction, Parkasaurus is a game that doesn't want to take its subject too seriously. It demonstrates it from the first glance with graphics lit in colors, accompanied by a deliberately low and ~playful~ number of polygons. The result is a more than pleasant design, supported by the attention to detail related to the elements with which we can decorate the park. Dinosaurs are obviously not excluded from this design choice, so despite being perfectly recognizable for their species they offer particular colors, which still fit well into the general context. As well as the possibility of making him wear special hats, with which to improve some statistics and give the whole thing an extra touch of playfulness. While the level of the animations also proves to be more than good, the only flaw in the technical field is represented by the management of polygons, which sometimes tend to interpenetrate. Those who want to see their work ~from below~ can also enjoy a first-person mode, thanks to which they can descend among the park's paths to visit them from a first-person view. In this mode we can also use a rifle to possibly go and quell the dinosaurs that need to be immobilized. The sound fulfills its task without particularities, for better or for worse. While playing Parkasaurus we hear in our headphones a background noise due to the presence of the visitors, who occasionally let out a howl of amazement in a similar way in which dinosaurs emit their cries. The soundtrack fits perfectly into the atmosphere designed by WashBear Studio for the game, even if after a while you will hardly hear it anymore.
