Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. When it came out three years ago, Flick Kick Football won over critics and audiences thanks to its terribly immediate and fun mechanics, which even earned it the approach to Angry Birds in terms of potential. The core of the experience was based on the use of the touch screen to make shots on goal, within increasingly complex situations that required timing, precision and even a certain amount of technique to give the ball the desired effect. After various alternative versions of the same game, here comes Flick Kick Football Legends on the App Store and Google Play, which attempts to take the franchise to a whole new level. Starting with a passionate homage to the football legends of the 70s, all mustaches and long hair, the new PikPok title draws heavily on the traditional black humor of the team and puts us in charge of a team coached by a ghost . The championship is about to begin and there is little time to pay attention to these details, so our goal is to reach the top of the table in each of the tournaments we will participate in, meeting stronger and more prepared opponents each time. The big news is represented by the fact that we will not compete with simple shooting challenges in ~watertight compartments~, but with real matches in which we will have to steal the ball from the other team, pass it to our teammates and finish on the net, all with a focus on team management. Flick Kick Football Legends is fun and filled with cute 70s football references The sticker collection Going from an ultra-arcade to a more complex and profound product is no joke, and in fact the developers have decided to sketch out certain aspects of the experience and not go too deep, perhaps losing some momentum with respect to the final result. However, the solutions found appear brilliant, such as the sticker packs to be purchased with virtual currency (coins) or valuable currency (banknotes), within which we will be able to randomly find more or less good and more or less rare players, to be placed in the squad to build the strongest possible team. Each character, apart from those available at the start, has unique abilities that can prove useful during the game, such as ~fiery~ shots, the ability to slow down time or even to enlarge the mirror of the goal in the conclusions. There are some simple managerial choices that we can make between one match and another and that lead to a profit or result in trouble, for example an injury, but the lack of an interface that makes us understand immediately which players are better than others based on a simple numerical attribute. Once on the pitch, the gameplay reveals itself to be a revised version of the original Flick Kick Football, to which tackles and scoring are added, as well as episodes such as free kicks, corner kicks and penalty kicks, even if it often seems to be of completely random events. On the other hand, the precision that is asked of us when we have to pass the ball to a man-marked teammate, or when we are facing the goalkeeper and need to guess the corner to score, has nothing to do with chance. The freemium aspect is quite intrusive in the sense that the game is full of advertising and there is the traditional energy to determine the number of matches we can play in a given time interval. Furthermore, at a certain point it becomes almost a must to return to an already completed tournament to do some ~grinding~, collect coins and buy a few packs of stickers. The final balance, however, is positive; thanks also to a nice, fluid cel shading graphics with very well done interludes.", "date": "2013-11-23", "grade": "7.7"}
