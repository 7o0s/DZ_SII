{"name": "FIFA 2004 PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2004-pc.html", "text": "The game menus After waiting, a menu appears not only graphically renewed, but with a background image that makes it decidedly preferable to all the past ones. The options are many. If you really can't hesitate any longer to try to play a game, all you have to do is click on play, which allows you to play a friendly by choosing one of the hundreds of teams present. The game modes instead allow you to get to the heart: you can choose the career mode, the dispute of a cup (there are all the national ones, but unfortunately the Champions Cup or UEFA Cup are not mentioned), or to play in the rediscovered mode training. However, having neglected the two international cups is an idea that makes you think: it is too obvious a detail that makes the game lose the ~points~ it had earned by entering the career mode. This is a real shame, probably it would have been better to limit the championships in favor of international competitions. Overcoming the bitterness for this forgetfulness, let's move on to playing the training mode. After choosing the teams for training, three different types of training are presented: free kicks, corner kicks (from the left and right), and free kicks (direct or indirect). This modality has been treated in a particular way; in fact, it seems to participate actively in the team's training thanks to all the details that make the game atmosphere real: training stadium with lots of staff at the edge of the field, chirping of birds humming in the background and training shirts for gamers. Everything seems perfect for a bit of running and some football. The multiplayer also deserves a small mention, also present this year. From how it is presented (possibility of a ~career~ even on the web), it seems that many people will also be attracted to this game mode, and it seems that everything is finally functional and well done. Career mode Your career will not be just a simple season, but your sporting life. Obviously the role played is not that of a simple team coach, but you can step into the shoes of the general manager himself, and you will have five seasons to prove your skills. The first thing that will be pointed out to you once the team has been chosen will be the goal to be achieved (expressed in points) and the way to accumulate and lose them. Particular attention must therefore be paid to the choice of the team, because the objectives also vary according to its strength. For the less experienced it is preferable to start with a low-level team, in case of reaching the pre-set goal the doors of the most important teams will open without problems. Once the objectives of the contract have been acknowledged, the season begins in full swing. There are many options that now present themselves in preparation for the match, and the fundamental one is always training. A great week to prepare for Sunday's challenge will allow players to be in shape, and once you hit the pitch you will notice the difference. Not to be forgotten is also the transfer market. Not only will we be able to buy players, but other teams could view ours and make us sales proposals. This point is also well developed, but the real result will be obtained on Sunday by taking the field. Before the game By choosing the friendly mode, the options that are offered to us are not very different from those of past years: only the graphics and the fact that some teams do not have the official crest change. The rest is always the same (choice of teams, choice of shirts and choice of stadium). With the career mode repeats the same story. An image of a stadium ticket as a paying spectator who wants to enjoy his match in peace is only added before the match. Long ball and pedal! After choosing the controllers to play the game you can finally start. The standing crowd begins to sing, the teams take to the field, take their positions and when everything is ready the referee (faithfully reproduced) whistles the start by raising his arm. Also this year the playability has been changed compared to the previous editions and small improvements have been made, probably also by virtue of the feedback from the fans. Unfortunately the rule is confirmed that where there are improvements there are also worsenings: once again this year the player's effort is quite useless. A player, in fact, after making his shot, will never be at the end of his strength and, if he doesn't have to run for a few seconds, the bar will start to return to the maximum levels. Conclusions: few (or practically useless) player changes. The contrasts, however, are more realistic, especially in the penalty area. As already mentioned, taking the ball away without committing a foul is more complicated, and it is even more difficult to be able to do it without sliding, as the CPU will try several times to defend itself by slightly extending its hands to keep us away. To get possession of the ball it will be necessary above all to play in advance, trying to predict the opponent's pass and intercepting it, since even the tackles that do not require the slide in most cases are whistled. Let's move on to ball control. FIFA 2003 allowed you to attempt dribbling of any kind (changes of direction, sprints and brakes, rotations and much more) exclusively with the arrow keys. This year (fortunately) things are different, as it will no longer be possible to cross half the field with the ball still between our feet. Decisive implementation for better match management. If to this we add the Freestyle Control (newly made in this edition), i.e. the control of the players without the ball through which you can make them start at the right time, sow the marker, anticipate the moves, bring them into position and fight to conquer spaces in the field, the atmosphere will warm up right from the start. Do it, Punishment! If you really fail to avoid the foul, the referee will not hesitate to whistle and raise his hand indicating the direction of whoever has to take the free kick, rather than waiting to see if the team maintains the ball advantage or not (as happened in Fifa 2003). Penalty kicks are always the same and are fought in the same way. In order not to make mistakes, don't hold down the shot button too much, otherwise the power will be much higher than necessary. Even the way in which free-kicks are taken has not changed (there is always the possibility of choosing which area of the goal to take it and how to kick the ball), but the result will be more positive than in the past year: in fact, the 15th % of shots made from standing will lead the team to celebrate the goal. Furthermore, there is the possibility (again via the Freestyle Control) of creating schemes, but they cannot be preset before the game. You have to try them at the moment and see if the choice was spot on. The corner kicks are also new. There is now the possibility to select the way in which you want to shoot (to return to the center, to the near post, to the far post, or serve). Furthermore, after the choice, it will be necessary to select the player that you want to use in the area and, again using Freestyle Control, during the execution of the corner and you can move him as you like until the ball arrives in the area, at which time it will be necessary try to score. Particular attention goes to the opponents who will try in every way to hinder (with pushes) the shot. This, in my opinion, is one of the best choices in the game. Remaining on the theme of ~small refinements~ this year too it will not be possible to call the offside, but on the other hand one cannot expect too much. Graphics The graphics of FIFA 2004 have undergone considerable improvements, both in the external aspect of the field (stadiums and spectators), and in the internal aspect (players' faces). As always, the graphics of the stadium are of secondary importance, given that the main framing will be the field, except for goal kicks or throw-ins. The audience has also improved quite a bit; not that it helps much, but it's always nice to see. In case you choose to play a friendly match, the choice of stadium is (as always) left to the player. In career mode, however, there are many differences. In fact, by choosing to play the season with a team that is not part of the ~big ones~, you have to forget about having a great equipment around the pitch. Other than San Siro or Old Trafford; it will be necessary to settle for a small stadium, perhaps partly surrounded by trees rather than stands. Even these little ~goodies~ earn a small note of merit. The faces of the players present are very similar to the real ones (obviously excluding those of the testimonials of the game - Del Piero, Ronaldinho and Henry - who are practically identical). It really seems that those of EA this year in this respect wanted to make the leap in quality. It should also be underlined that if a player were to fall to the ground (due to a foul suffered or a slip made), shorts, socks and shirt will get dirty. This aspect is also very realistic. However, the management of the cameras is not yet complete: one that can move both vertically and sideways is still missing. In fact, if someone wanted a wider view of the playing field using an ~Overview~ camera, theframe will not move in case the ball should go to the ~lower~ band of the screen. choirs The sound will make the game atmosphere even more lively: in fact, there are real team choirs. Finally this year EA has understood that it's not enough just to have good graphics and good overall management of the game to make it more exciting, but also good sound makes every challenge more and more compelling. So don't be surprised if you hear the fans cheering and shouting the team's name at the top of their voices or if you hear boos at you if you're playing an away game. As this happens in reality, it is also faithfully reproduced in the game. Conclusion The game can be satisfactory as a whole, the elimination of international competitions such as the UEFA Cup and the Champions Cup has meant that where there have been improvements, there has been some deterioration. However, it is always pleasant to play matches and with the graphic and structural innovations it will seem to be right at the stadium. Good game to all and, in case you want to experience full seasons with the career mode, good luck! Pros: Career mode Innovation in corner serving Well developed training Cons: Missing international cups Teams missing crests and official shirts Career mode initially difficult to manage. Who starts well. After the usual installation lasting about twenty minutes (every year it takes longer) you can finally launch the game. We have to wait another minute because of the usual screens that recall the companies that have granted the trademark and the presentation that showcases the three testimonials of the game (Del Piero, Ronaldinho, Henry) who juggle an action (very long even that) in perfect Nike advertising style.", "date": "2003-11-07", "grade": null}
