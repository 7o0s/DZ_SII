{"name": "Unreal Tournament 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-tournament-3-recensione.html", "text": "It's been 8 years since the first episode of Unreal Tournament inaugurated the online shooter genre, thus satisfying the desire for unbridled frag through different modes that have benefited from numerous variables over the years, thanks to an extremely large and fierce community. The next two episodes released between 2003 and 2004, introduced not only updated graphics (which have always been the flagship of the series) but also new modes and weapons, and thanks to the growing diffusion of the internet, clans and an almost excessive modification, the title is currently extremely played. The aspects that have made the fortune of the series are to be found in frenetic gameplay, excellent weapon balancing and a wide variety of choice between maps and game modes. There was therefore great expectation for Unreal Tournament 3 (initially known as Unreal Tournament 2007), finally arrived on PC and ready to impose itself on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but without challenges between users of different platforms. Proven game plan The gameplay in this chapter does not differ much from UT2004 and is frenetic and explosive as never before. The commands are few and essential; in addition to those of movement there is the action button and the one to change the fire tool, generally assigned to the mouse wheel. Each of the ten weapons available (plus the Redeemer) has a secondary mode that modifies the rate of fire or accuracy. In the case of the missile launcher, for example, up to 3 rockets are loaded which can be launched at a short distance from each other, while the sniper rifle has a zoom to snipe enemies from a sidereal distance. Scattered around the maps there are not only weapons and ammunition, but also armor, energy kits and power-ups capable of making you invulnerable, amplifying the damage or making you (almost) invisible. The larger maps involve the use of different means of combat, each characterized by different movement speed, resistance, power and rate of fire. In addition to the classic Goliaths and flying vehicles such as the Mantas or the Raptors, there are the fearsome Darkwalkers (very similar to the tripods seen in the film ~The War of the Worlds~), equipped with moderate speed and impressive firepower as well as weapons secondary capable of weakening enemies. What makes the difference in battle is the combination of different factors such as knowledge of the map to get hold of the most powerful weapons as soon as possible, knowing how to use them best and above all being able to move as fast as possible. Expert players are in fact capable, through appropriate combinations of jump and movement, of often being elusive to most enemies. Wow... a plot! Speaking of game modes, the first substantial difference in this episode consists of the presence of a story (whose plot is far from memorable) compared to the classic intergalactic tournament. The protagonist will be Reaper, a member of the Ronin, a group of mercenaries who is hired by one of the many megacorporations to fight the war. It will not be possible to choose the appearance of our avatar as it will be for online battles. The campaign is rather linear and in fact consists of a very long series of increasingly demanding challenges that will gradually introduce the player to what are the different modes. In some cases there will be very useful videos that will explain the game mechanics and the use of the elements scattered around the map. The respawn finds its reason during the campaign, where what is introduced is a new military technology that seems to be able to make a difference in war, or regenerators, capable of instantly bringing a fallen man back to life. The megacorporations obviously attentive to the costs of these machines, decide to apply them only in the most important situations, limiting their use. Although the developers have made an effort to give some variety to the objectives, certain mechanics will be natural to fans, to the point that for example during one of the first missions, after a long explanation film, you will hear from one of your teammates : ~But then it is a capture the flag with vehicles?~. Upon completion of the missions, you will come into possession of some ~game cards~ which will allow, for example, to reduce the number of opposing players or their energy. Deathmatch and Capture the Flag There are a total of 6 game modes in Unreal Tournament 3: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel, Capture the Flag, Capture the Flag with vehicles and Warfare. In Deathmatchit will be necessary to score points by defeating all the opponents who happen to be within range without distinction, while playing in a Team, you will be divided into two red and blue teams, a factor which will also allow you to see enemies even at a considerable distance. Playing matches in Duel mode, as the name suggests, you will find yourself alone against a single opponent. The Capture the Flag consists in taking possession of the opponent's flag by taking it from the base on the other side of the map (generally in this case the maps are symmetrical) and returning it to your own, making sure that our flag is not stolen in the meantime. In this case, individual actions do not pay much and moving in groups can also allow you to better protect the bearer of the flag. Playing in the variant with vehicles, the maps will be much larger and the use of land or air vehicles will allow you to quickly reach the enemy base. Once the flag is stolen, it will no longer be possible to board a vehicle, thus remaining uncovered and forcing players to cooperate as best they can. At the top of the hud there are two very useful indicators that indicate in which direction to move to reach the two flags. Warfare The new Warfare (or Strategy) mode features a series of nodes to be conquered progressively until you reach the enemy base, destroy the core of the generator and win the game. In this type of game the maps are very large and oblige as never before to coordinate in order not to disperse one's power. In fact, to acquire the nodes it is generally necessary to conquer outposts well defended by turrets and vehicles, using considerable volumes of fire to destroy the barrier of the nodes themselves. Some maps provide for the use of special spheres (one for each team) which can instantly destroy an enemy node or reinforce one already conquered. Carrying the sphere with you, however, it will not be possible to board any vehicle. By conquering nodes, you will gain access to new weapons and vehicles that were previously available to the enemy can be used. To make moving faster, it is possible to materialize once dead directly in one of the bases under our control. Furthermore, at any time, by pressing the Q key, the Hoverboard will be activated, a sort of surfboard that greatly increases the speed of movement but which prevents you from opening fire. An always active minimap at the top of the screen will still allow you to understand at a glance which direction to take. Among the modes present in Unreal Tournament 3, Warfare is certainly the one where the harmony between companions pays off a lot, given the need, depending on the situation, to attack and at the same time defend the newly conquered nodes. In short, if you want to play only for yourself, it is better to aim for Capture the Flag or Deathmatch. In total, however, the number of modes present in UT3 certainly represents a step backwards compared to UT2004, where there were also: Bombing Run, Domination, Last Man Standing and Survival. However, given the presence once again of an extremely versatile level editor, there is hope that some mod will remedy this shortcoming. UnrealEngine 3.0 The graphics engine of Unreal Tournament, known as Unreal Engine, even in this third incarnation is as spectacular as ever. Those who constantly follow the world of video games will know how all the major software houses have in fact secured the license for the Epic graphics system in their next productions. Characters, environments, weapons and vehicles are equipped with an exceptional degree of detail and although the peaks of Crysis are not reached, the result remains in a word ~very next-gen~. The battles are therefore extremely spectacular and with a constant frame-rate even in the larger maps, thanks to excellent memory management, which now loads the maps progressively instead of in one go, making the loading times on the same PC, even faster than in Unreal Tournament 2004. The implementation of physics is also excellent, both in the bodies of the characters and in the vehicles. To be able to enjoy the game's graphics to the fullest, a fairly recent PC is required, but the engine is quite scalable, and even if you have a machine one or two years old, it will therefore be possible to play the title provided you are willing to lower more than a few details. The first patch already available, and downloadable from our Files Area, then improves the overall quality of the graphics and its rendering. As for the audio, the speech appears functional to what the game is and therefore expect a languageor rather colorful and braggart. The musical themes do not appear very varied and can still be deactivated to immerse yourself more in the action and rely even more on hearing in battle. The design of the maps looks excellent as well as the variety of settings, ranging from oriental temples to abandoned factories, passing through forests, bridges and sci-fi structures galore. The style of the characters leaves a little to be desired, too similar to that already seen in Gears of War and in general with much less variety than in the previous episode. Comment Unreal Tournament 3 does not present great innovations compared to its predecessors, but it is still fun thanks to the excellent balance of weapons and vehicles, as well as adrenaline-pumping and liberating gameplay. We can say that Epic limited itself to updating and maximizing what was already seen in Unreal Tournament 2004, avoiding distorting a decidedly tested and characteristic style and gameplay. And maybe, to be honest, something got lost in the process. The many maps available (destined to increase thanks to the inevitable support of modders) playable in single player or on the internet, ensure a large number of hours of fun. The very powerful game engine and within the reach of most PCs on the market, guarantees its validity over the years. Long live the online frag.
