In turn, the Wii version immediately began to make history in itself, since it presented itself with a totally different graphic style compared to the Xbox360 and PlayStation3 incarnations, as well as with some gameplay elements that promised to take full advantage of the specific characteristics of the Nintendo consoles. Let's see how it went. Specter of my lusts Written by the same Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis who also signed the two feature films, the screenplay of Ghostbusters: the Video Game sees the Ghostbusters engaged in facing a new invasion of ectoplasm, and puts the user in the role of a recruit (male or female, of your choice) who joins the team as a sort of guinea pig for Dr. Egon Spengler. The plot is effectively unraveled through often very enjoyable cutscenes, a real boon for fans if we also consider the presence of all the key characters of the films: and if in the English version the involvement was increased thanks to the voices of the original actors , one certainly cannot complain about the conversion into Italian, which relies on the professional support of most of the actors who dubbed the films. However, the fan service does not end here, given that the graphics of the game also offer various reasons for satisfaction in this sense: the equipment of the ghostbusters is reproduced here down to the smallest detail, and the settings are teeming with visual references and references that will not escape in the eyes of connoisseurs. In more global terms, however, the work of the Red Fly Studio developers should be appreciated for having managed to keep the feeling of the characters unchanged despite the cartoonish features they assume in this Wii version: and also as regards the actual technique, Ghostbusters : the video game definitely asserts itself, showing off extensive and well-crafted scenarios, very convincingly animated polygonal models and well-made special effects. The only big drawback of the Atari production is represented by the conspicuous drops in frame rates that accompany the most agitated phases in split-screen, but it is still a secondary problem after all. In short, defining it as a real third chapter of the saga probably seems exaggerated, but there is no doubt that Ghostbusters: the Video Game will make all those who have always wanted to wear a Proton Pack and hunt down ghosts happy. Cheese ghost If Batman: Arkham Asylum was a real leader in the tie-in crusade for the recovery of their videogame dignity, it can be said that Ghostbusters: the Video Game is a valid ally in support of this cause. In terms of mechanics and level design, the game follows in the same footsteps of the Xbox360 and PlayStation3 incarnation, but there are several peculiarities that take into account the motion sensitive control system of the Wii. The adventure is in fact a third-person shooter, with an appreciable balance between action, exploration and puzzle phases. The protagonist cadet is equipped with all the standard equipment (upgradable as you continue), including detectors to capture the position of the ectoplasms, energy beams and traps necessary to capture them. When you come across a ghost, you must first tire it with your proton rifle, and then give it the coup de grace by slamming it against walls or surrounding elements: in this phase, a minigame is triggered in which the user must quickly follow movements of the Remote in the directions indicated on the screen, a nice idea but one that tends to lose its appeal quickly. Things are better when it comes to placing traps, an operation that requires you to move the Nunchuck as if you were throwing a bowling ball and which objectively integrates perfectly. In the pauses between encounters with one ghost and another, Ghostbusters: the Videogame puts a pleasant exploratory component on the plate (whether it is a matter of searching for ghosts or wanting to discover the various secrets that can be unlocked during the adventure) and some simple puzzle, mostly of an environmental nature. In all this, the user is encouraged to brutalize the scenarios that surround him, for the simple sake of burdening the city treasury, holder of the insurance against the damage causedby ghostbusters: a good justification for having fun tearing apart tables, chairs, statues and so on and appreciating the good physical routines that regulate the destruction of objects. In what is certainly a positive scenario, the play structure of Ghostbusters: the video game shows the side to a couple of criticisms which, however, do not undermine the global evaluation of the product that much. The Story Mode is in fact quite short, and the cooperative mode in split screen (moreover weighed down by the frame rate drops we have mentioned) is not accompanied by other multiplayer variants.", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": "8.0"}
