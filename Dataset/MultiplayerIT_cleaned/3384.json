{"name": "Monomals", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monomals-recensione.html", "text": "Monomals' review is just the further demonstration of how the Apple Arcade catalog continues to be enriched with noteworthy productions, in this case a particularly original project developed by Picomy, a team that recently participated in the creation of Sonic Mania. The incipit of the game is simple, with three different characters (Retro Rabbit, Funky Frog and Techno Tiger) who engage in a very particular type of fishing: their hook is an audio jack and the line appears inexhaustible, allowing the terminal to move for large stretches underwater, avoiding traps and eliminating enemies until you reach your goal, a cute little animal. The player precisely controls the hook, which presents itself as the true protagonist of the adventure and must move within twenty-one different scenarios, gradually more complex and full of variations on the theme; until you reach the boss on duty, the pet mentioned above, which must be defeated in an always different way. Succeeding in the enterprise allows you to get one of these funny little creatures as a prize, each of which represents a specific musical instrument. To do what? Here comes the fun part: the game includes a real MIDI sequencer that allows you to create songs in a very simple way, initially working only on the kick, bass and keyboards and then adding more sounds, which change in terms of style depending on the character that we use to mix them. We will be able to save our creations, share them with the community and vote on the works of other users, creating a nice ranking. Gameplay and technical realization In short, Monomals is a different game than usual, with two very interesting faces: on the one hand, a gameplay action that closely resembles the inertial systems of titles such as PixelJunk Shooter 2, colorful and full of variations on the theme that make each level different; on the other hand, the music editor, which in combination with an in-game shop allows you to use various sounds to create songs. An experience, the latter, preparatory to music production in all its forms: the most famous software use a similar interface, albeit more detailed, which means that with the Picomy title you can take your first steps in scope of editing. If this aspect does not interest you, of course, you can concentrate on the rest and enjoy an impeccably made level design, which not surprisingly recalls the classic episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog and focuses strongly on exploration, secrets to discover and hidden corners. hidden scenarios in which nothing is left to chance and every little detail appears well cared for, whether it's blocks to be destroyed or enemies to be hit with our shot, the only maneuver available to the protagonist. As mentioned, however, there are some interesting variations on the theme, such as the device that allows us to get out of the water using a vertical jet to gain height and at the same time destroy walls; or the fan that transforms us into small drills, capable of breaking through any wall. Monomals' touch control system uses a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen and a big button on the right side: everything works properly, but clearly with a Bluetooth controller the situation changes and tackling the various stages becomes less of a challenge complex, although never trivial. The technical realization, as mentioned, makes excellent use of colors and effects, involving us in a very pleasant atmosphere also thanks to the excellent design of the characters. The soundtrack is no less, and accompanies the action with music perfectly suited to the context.", "date": "2019-11-08", "grade": "8.3"}
