Free or paid updates? ~Automatic~ remasters or something more structured? Deciding how to support backwards compatibility of PS4 games on PlayStation 5 required some experimentation, a lot of concessions and some confusion. Some updates have been released for free, others have involved a disbursement even in the face of unpublished content. The case of Uncharted is therefore something new. In fact, we are talking about a package that includes two different remasters, that of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and that of the independent expansion Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, however also distributed in physical format and sold basically at the budget price at which it is possible today find the two titles in the collection, even with the possibility of saving a lot if you own at least one. These are arguments that you have to do in the review, but which frankly melt like snow in the sun when you challenge the DualSense and puts us back in the shoes of Nathan Drake or Chloe Frazer to face again, or perhaps for the first time, two experiences capable of setting new standards in the action adventure genre. We tell you everything in the review of Uncharted: Collection The Legacy of Thieves. History Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves compilation, Nathan and Elena cuddle on the couch Let's start with a premise: if you haven't played the first three episodes of Uncharted, we strongly suggest that you retrieve The Nathan Drake Collection and remedy this lack before getting your hands on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. The reason is obvious: the last chapter of the Naughty Dog series sums up the protagonist's career and life, it is literally his last adventure and the question is addressed in the context of an extraordinarily effective narrative, delicate where necessary and impactful when you have to put on a show. Amazon offer Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection - PlayStation 5 50.99 See Offer Nathan and Elena have settled down and lead a normal existence, but one day Sam, the protagonist's lost brother, shows up again and tells of having escaped from prison and having contracted a huge debt for this with a powerful drug lord : must find for him the treasure of the pirate Henry Avery. Also driven by guilt for having resigned himself to considering Sam dead, Nathan agrees to leave for this new adventure, even though he is aware that it won't be a walk in the park. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Nathan tells Sam about his adventures On the trail of the treasure there are in fact also the ruthless Rafe Adler and the group of mercenaries of the Shoreline, led by the unbeatable Nadine Ross. When they understand that the Drake brothers want to reach the place where Avery has hidden all his goods first, they start a real war that develops through various scenarios: from Italy to Scotland, from Madagascar to the legendary island of Libertalia From a narrative point of view, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a jewel: Neil Druckmann and Josh Scherr have been able to tell a story that basically lacks nothing: there is love, there is mystery, the meeting , there is of course the adventure and lots of action. The characters are outlined perfectly and everything is supported by an absolutely amazing, textbook Italian dubbing, which perfectly renders the protagonists' jokes and jokes. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Nadine and Chloe Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes place some time after the events of the fourth chapter and sees the return of one of its characters, Nadine Ross, who is hired by an old acquaintance of Nathan, Chloe Frazer, for a dangerous mission in India. The objective in this case is to recover the precious Tusk of Ganesh, an ancient and precious artifact hidden somewhere in the Western Ghats. However, the two women will have to deal with Asav, head of the rebel forces, who wants to take possession of the Tusk because the people recognize his lineage and start a bloody revolt. During the adventure Chloe and Nadine understand that they can trust each other, and it is precisely on the development of their relationship that the screenplay signed by Shaun Escayg and Josh Scherr focuses, once again capable of offering us a successful mix of emotions contrasting which is also enhanced by the Italian voices in this case. Gameplay Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Samand Nathan on a motorbike at the end of a memorable sequence Spectacular cutscenes that transform into seamless gameplay, in true Naughty Dog style; long platform sections that offer absolutely delightful climbing mechanics, probably what Assassin's Creed should have become after the very first chapter and which it has instead decided to trivialize; a few puzzles and a bit of combat to be managed through silent approaches or with drawn weapons: these are the ingredients of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. The introduction of the grappling hook has added further depth to the gameplay, giving rise to daring situations and completely unpublished, and it is in general in the interactions with the surfaces that we notice the extraordinary care in the realization and the productive value of the game, which does not skimp on anything. The ability of the characters to cling to protrusions, reach out with just the movement of the analog stick and automatically grab the next handhold, indicate a profound study of these dynamics, which turn into a sort of fun puzzle when you have to figure out how to reach certain places. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Nathan is about to sync The level design supports these elements in a big way, offering a series of master tricks in which you always find yourself making the rounds, yet you never lose sight of the road or feel the need for a map or a marker. Not even when you travel the lands of Madagascar aboard the jeep, in a sort of open and freely explorable map that becomes a playground in which to have fun looking for the right path and using the winch to tackle the most slippery and impervious climbs. they are many and not too complex: Naughty Dog's goal was to lead us by the hand in an exciting adventure, and it is perhaps for this reason that there are no substantial steps forward on the fighting front. Let's be clear: Uncharted's gunplay and the cover system work, but the types of enemies are more or less the same as always and sometimes, during the campaign, one almost gets the feeling that the clashes play a purely ancillary role. Uncharted: The Legacy of Thieves collection, the exploratory phase aboard the jeep Here, from this point of view The Lost Legacy shows a number of important differences. The fact of being structured as a stand alone expansion, therefore yes a complete product but inevitably less rich and multifaceted than the fourth chapter of the series, places this experience in the face of the need to actually exploit a single scenario as if it were an open world. Thus Chloe and Nadine, after an initial urban section, also find themselves running around aboard a jeep and identifying a series of points of interest to reach from time to time (and here the map is all right), unlocking the mechanisms to open a passage towards the inevitable lost city. At that point we return to linearity, just in time to prevent certain solutions from becoming redundant: this too is a prudent and effective choice. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Chloe and Nadine aboard the jeep The climbing phases are equally predominant, but thanks to a shorter duration of the campaign (less than eight hours against the sixteen of Uncharted 4) one gets the clear feeling that the fights are much more frequent, enriched by some extra weapons and the possibility of recovering in the coffers of Asav's troops (to be cracked through a simple minigame) some important resources. Since this is an expansion, we find the same characteristics seen in the fourth chapter of the series, but also some new features, see for example the areas in which one launches from one hold to another with the grappling hook. Needless to say, the introduction of 2x or even 4x the frame-rate graphics modes for both Uncharted games: The Legacy of Thieves Collection dramatically improves the accuracy and responsiveness of gameplay, particularly when shooting. Graphics and sound Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, a shot in Performance mode at 60 fps Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collected, the same shot in Loyalty mode at 4K Uncharted 4: A Thief's End was a real technical miracle on PS4 and that's why the graphics of the game look good on PS5. We are talking about a production with attention to every minimum detail, in every single animation and in every single interaction, tested and refined with great attention in order to eliminate any smudging. The Lost Legacy is not at the same level, but it lacks very little: both experiences are able to giveabsolutely majestic arch scenarios, suggestive panoramas to say the least, assets of extraordinary quality, cinematic cutscenes with great visual impact, an enormous amount of different animations and a lighting system capable of enhancing everything we see on the screen. To be really picky, some water-related effects appear less brilliant than the rest, but these are really trivialities. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Nathan shows Sully something interesting This extraordinary technical sector takes advantage of three different graphic modes on the new Sony console: Fidelity, which brings the resolution to real 4K and 30 fps; Performance, with effective resolution at 1440p and 60 fps; and finally Performance +, available only where the screen supports 120 Hz, with effective resolution at 1080p and 120 fps. In the case of the 60 fps mode, an upscaling reconstruction technique is used which actually makes it difficult to find differences in definition compared to 2160p. That's not all, because Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves compilation also supports 3D Audio, for an even more enveloping sound and a phenomenal rendering of effects and beautiful music, and the adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller in order to give each press of the triggers a different resistance depending on the case. Finally, the very fast SSD of the Sony console guarantees almost instantaneous loading.", "date": "2022-01-26", "grade": "9.0"}
