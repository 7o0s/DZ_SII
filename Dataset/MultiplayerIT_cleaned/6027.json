If, therefore, it is more than probable that a large part of Disney Infinity 3.0's buyers come from the enormous pool of fans of George Lucas' work, with an inevitably more adult and male target than in the past, the American giant has well thought of offering also something for the younger audience, taking advantage of the roughly contemporary release of the latest Pixar film entitled Inside Out. So here is our review of the Play Set dedicated to it. The Inside Out Play Set is a step down from the Disney Infinity 3.0 Starter Pack Inside the head For the uninitiated, the Play Sets are in fact real expansions of the Starter Pack that allow you to access brand new adventures and add further elements to the Toy Box. All this through the purchase of a package that includes the miniature of the World, which acts as a sort of key to unlock the new game, and two statuettes from which to choose your favorite character destined to be the protagonist of the action. In the specific case, the bundle includes Joy and Anger, to which Disgust, Fear and Sadness can also be added by purchasing them separately. Speaking of money, the gap therefore goes from around 35 for the Play Set alone to roughly 80 to bring home all the characters as well: a considerable outlay, which obviously adds up to that of the Starter Pack which is the point of essential departure. On the other hand, however, the genre of Toys to Life has never been based on savings, far from it, so this is certainly not a surprise. On the other hand, it must be emphasized once again how the quality of the Disney Infinity figurines is truly extraordinary, to the point that there is a large audience of enthusiasts who choose to buy them out of a collecting spirit without caring at all about the game itself. However, leaving out the aforementioned particular cases, it is worth focusing on how much this Play Set actually has to offer from a playful point of view. Let's start immediately by saying that the distance from the Star Wars adventures is truly sidereal: with Inside Out the developers wanted to demonstrate the elasticity and ductility of the product framework, essentially giving life to a rather classic platform, therefore a very distant relative of the gameplay focused on the combat of Republic Twilight. Perhaps due to the inability to choose a single direction, or perhaps still to guarantee variety to the package, in Inside Out it is possible to face both levels as 3D and 2D mechanics: in both cases it is the exploratory aspect that dominates, with the collection of balloons which constitutes an element of continuity intended to contribute to the final evaluation of one's performance. Then there are simple and basic puzzles, which basically always revolve around the need to collect objects and transport them to the relative machinery to activate mechanisms or unlock passages in such a way as to allow progression. On the other hand, the specific abilities of the individual characters are more interesting, which allow for example Anger to overcome the lava, or Sadness to ride the clouds, or Joy to make larger leaps and so on. To avoid having to impose the purchase of all the statuettes on the user, the developers had the good sense to insert a system of costumes which, through special stations, actually allows any character you are controlling to briefly take on the appearance of another. It is a bit of a pity that all in all valid ideas appear partially compromised by limits on which it is difficult to turn a blind eye: even considering, as already stated, the desire to address a young audience, it is evident in fact that even in this Play Set there are confirmed some of the historical defects of Disney Infinity, such as the modest quality of the level design and the poor refinement of the control system. If then in The Twilight of the Republic we had had the opportunity to praise the combat system perfected by Ninja Theory, in this case we have to make the opposite speech: the few and equally few various enemies present are eliminated through boring and repetitive clashes, which mortify and make character development through the skill tree rather pointlessty. On the other hand, the technical component is good, which demonstrates a remarkable fidelity to the film and offers levels with different and always very colorful settings, not particularly complex on a polygonal level but appreciable and pleasant from an artistic point of view. Ultimately therefore, this Inside Out Play Set reaches a narrow enough, but the purchase must be well evaluated: those who bought the Starter Pack attracted by the Star Wars universe will hardly find great interest in this offer, while Pixar fans however, they could be disappointed by simple, repetitive and not particularly refined gameplay. Therefore, the children remain, to whom the product is obviously aimed: if you have children or siblings to give this Play Set to, thus sharing the Disney Infinity 3.0 experience, the choice could be sensible. If not, you'd probably be better off keeping your money in your pocket and possibly spending it on future Star Wars or Marvel superhero Play Sets.", "date": "2015-09-23", "grade": null}
