In the case of Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions we have a product hinged precisely on these foundations: a gameplay that is easy to learn but difficult to master, a structure that rewards effort and replayability, a degree of challenge that is anything but trivial and a quantity of content that has become particularly rich with the transition to the Evolved edition. Released as a free update on consoles and PC (in fact the new game title, on all stores, is now precisely ~Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved~), the definitive version of the Lucid Games shooter made its debut on PlayStation Vita a few days ago, closing the circle of supported platforms and taking advantage of PlayStation Plus to enjoy a further promotional boost, which will undoubtedly bring many new users to deal with this engaging experience. Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved is a challenging, immersive and full-bodied twin analog shooter Size matters The package, which you can download for free from PlayStation Store (or pay 14.99 euros if you are not a subscriber), includes all the original levels and modes plus forty completely new stages, four new mission types, an extra drone and a online consisting of cooperative and competitive modes. Let's cut the bull's head right away: evidently the bulk of users jumped into the single player campaign even before seeing what multiplayer consists of, and that is why during our tests we were not very lucky in finding companions or opponents to play some games. However, we trust that the matter will change within a few days, after all the downloads will certainly be numerous. So let's go back to the single player, which at this point counts the beauty of a hundred levels, with a view to two main paths (~Adventure~ and ~Definitive~), as well as a couple of interesting alternatives, in this case the ~Classic game~ mode with its own unique set of missions, the ~Extreme~ one for an even greater challenge (let's say impossible) and a few other bonus levels. The fulcrum of the game naturally lies in the first two options, which after a very quick tutorial will throw us into the fray asking us to complete different objectives: reach a certain score within the time limit, being able to count on infinite lives; destroy all enemies with a single life; go through portals without being able to open fire; constantly reload weapons by collecting ammo around the level; move from one ~dome~ to another to be able to use weapons, while remaining temporarily protected once you reach the ~free zone~; and finally face dangerous bosses with increasingly elaborate offensive patterns. PSVita trophies The thirty-one unlockable Trophies in Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved almost all revolve around performance. To get them, you need to complete tasks such as maxing out a drone, earning three stars in all cooperative levels, exceeding the developers' score and defeating the various bosses. Matter of feeling Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions was an excellent twin analog shooter, and the Evolved version only makes the experience more substantial and long-lasting. We are talking about a title that puts into practice the principles we mentioned at the beginning in the best possible way, and which focuses strongly on enhancing performance to distribute stars which will then allow access to further modes or unlock drones. The latter allow you to change your style of play, favoring offensive action or the collection of multiplier crystals, absolutely essential to reach the scores which on more than one occasion represent the minimum limit for completing a stage. In short, everything perfect this time too? Sadly not, as there are two issues preventing the PlayStation Vita version from doing Lucid Games' shooter full justice. The first is a minor defect, which we assume will be fixed through an update, and consists of slight drops in the frame rate which, however, become massive in one of the first levels of the ~Definitive~ campaign, with noticeable slowdowns (which reminded us a bit Thunderforce IV). The second defect instead concerns the fulcrum of the gameplay, specifically the rendering of the small analog sticks of the Sony portable console. Unfortunately the difference with the accuracy and reliability gguaranteed by the Xbox controllers and the DualShock is huge and you can feel it a lot during the games, making situations even more complex that are not simple at all, when dodging enemies becomes vital and in the same way it is important to score the own strokes. The rotation of the sticks has no ~support~ and there are several dead zones, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the gunplay.", "date": "2015-07-12", "grade": "8.0"}
