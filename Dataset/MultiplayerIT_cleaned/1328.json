{"name": "Hitman: Contracts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-contracts.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Natural Born Killer IO Interactive in these months of 'incubation' of Hitman: Contracts has never made a secret of the desire to keep all the cornerstones of the franchise firm, without daring or, much less, looking for alternative solutions. Abandoning all innovative intentions, they have thus proposed a sort of chronicles of their killer. We will therefore find our Agent 47 in a foul hotel room, injured and probably under the influence of some narcotic. The latent lucidity will lead our hero, if he can be defined as such, to recall the missions of the past. Missions that we will logically have to complete ourselves. Thus, between a full motion and a goal to be achieved, we will be able to reassemble the pieces of a narrative puzzle which, right from the first frames, will be able to intrigue every player eager to discover the fate of the agent. Once you pass the cutscene you get into the action. Each mission will be presented in broad terms by an employee of the logistics section, who will illustrate the objectives to be achieved without going into too much detail. Agent 47 will have at his disposal a meticulous map, from which he will be able to obtain valuable information and follow every step of the victim of the case and his acolytes. Analyzing the map properly is one of the main keys to completing any 'dirty' job, obviously if you prefer stealth action. Yes, because just like the previous episodes, this too Contracts will leave the player with the power to decide how to deal with each situation. A stealth approach to the game will be the most rewarding, but at the same time challenging, while pursuing the bloody path of carnage will bring satisfactions strictly linked to a certain type of playful sadism. In other words, the total freedom to be the hitman you want. At the end of each mission, one's nature will be displayed in the form of bars, with all the statistics of the case and an indicative comment by the coders on the behavior held at the scene of the crime. Differences? Everyone in the ring Having been able to test both the Xbox and Ps2 versions, we can say with certainty that the differences between the two creations are reduced to a minimum. Almost imperceptible, but present, a greater presence of aliasing on the Sony console, which for its part offers a slight sharpness of the image more than the Xbox counterpart. On the quality of the textures, which in general is quite good, let's give a few more points to the creation of the Microsoft house. Imperceptible differences for a game that in any case, regardless of the console used, offers a respectable visual impact. Teo 77 ready for action Fast, invisible and accurate. These are basically the requirements for anyone who wants to become a perfect assassin. During the game sessions our Agent 47 will be able to change his appearance like a chameleon, wearing the clothes of the victims. This factor will soon prove to be key to being able to act undisturbed in some situations, provided you have enough composure not to arouse suspicion in the henchman on duty. In fact, in a bar specially placed next to the energy of our alter ego, we will find an indicator of nervous tension. In situations of particular embarrassment it will be necessary, for example, not to dwell too much on the watchful looks of the sentinels, otherwise the cover will blow. Hence a whole series of stratagems to evade surveillance and to be able to complete the various objectives that carve each mission. The AI proves to be good on most occasions, even if some problems remain unresolved, above all of conceptual origin. One example above all: trying to enter an 'armored' place unarmed will lead the guards to react with fire rather than attempting to leave. Do plans to operate in the dark go awry? No problem, we move on to armed confrontation. With an arsenal that will grow larger as the mission progresses, our alter ego will be able to strike with the most appropriate weapons. The firefighting sessions know a lot about PC matrix shooters, especially for a perfect control system both in excited situations and in the more ordinary ones. The cohesion between style and design of the game environments is also perfect which, let's face it, finally present the right variety of landscapes. In fact, our deeds will pass through a mental hospital, a sadomasochistic disco, a port and clubs of all kinds. Ranging from locations scattered all over the world. Even the technical sector, for its part, does justice to a game that offers more lights than shadows. The polygonal modeling of the enemies and the protagonist is good, like thislike the animations. The physics implemented on the corpses is magnificent which, dragged by our Agent 47, will block themselves against obstacles by suitably changing their trajectory and behaving in a very realistic way. With a stable graphics engine in all circumstances, Hitman: Contracts also amazes for the light sources. We remind you that it is still a multiplatform title, and in fact, as we wanted to demonstrate, the physics implemented in fluid masses barely works. Nothing compromising, for heaven's sake, especially if a sound sector that is always punctual and appropriate to the circumstances takes care of increasing consensus. Final comment Hitman: Contracts is to IO Interactive what a greatest hits is to a singer. This third episode of the Hitman saga is a mister upgrade, with all the pros and cons of the case: in fact, for those who have played at least one previous episode, the lack of some innovative ideas is definitely felt. However, it is regretted only minimally, since there is a game of thickness at the base. And if on the one hand more could and should have been done for the AI of the enemies, on the other we appreciate the effort made by the developers to vary the game settings as much as possible. Recommended to all fans of the series and anyone looking for a good title. Those who did not appreciate the predecessors will hardly change their minds with this Contracts. Pros: Technically well done. Good variety of environments. Almost flawless control system. Cons: AI can be improved. No innovations made. Tickle the imagination neuron for a second and keep it awake at least for the next few lines. Now imagine a cheerful and happy little family - made up of parents and a small boy - immersed in the greenery of their country house. Imagine a cool but sunny morning, an outdoor table full of every culinary good. Then the canonical parent-child talks, and after the basic questions asked by an apprehensive dad comes THE question: ~What would you like to be when you grow up?~ Now think again about the atmosphere of that wonderful place and make a further effort to imagine the consequences of an answer like: ~Dad, when I grow up I'll be a hit man~. If you've used your imagination properly, now you'll be able to see the proud and dazed smile of the boy, as well as the stunned expressions of the poor parents. It won't exactly have gone like this for Agent 47, but that doesn't matter. What matters instead is finally having in your hands the new work of IO Interactive, the third chapter of the saga linked to the most ingrugnated killer in the history of video games: Hitman: Contracts.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
