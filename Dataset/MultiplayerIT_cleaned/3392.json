{"name": "Pride Run", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pride-run-recensione.html", "text": "Pride Run could only be a rhythm game. The elective affinities between the musical videogame genre par excellence and the very nature of the Pride parades is so strong that any other choice would have created a strong dissonance, also because the objective of the game by Steam Factory, Hard Ton and IV Productions, as we will see in the course of the review, it is precisely to stage the spirit of these events, through a very colorful pixel art and a series of evocative songs of committed joy, pass us the oxymoron, which characterizes them. Rhythm game gameplay Describing Pride Run is quite simple: the player must press the controller keys at the right time, following the rhythm of the notes of the song that accompanies the procession. If you've played any Guitar Hero emulator you know what we're talking about. The difficulty is determined by the frequency of the inputs, by the presence of longer notes, to be faced with a prolonged pressure, and by double notes, which require you to act on two keys at a time. The mechanical part of Pride Run fits perfectly with the all-political message that the game wants to send: the more you manage to follow the rhythm, the more the inhabitants of the cities where the parades are held let themselves get involved, making the cheering crowd following the floats placed at the head of the group. All of this is well represented on the screen by a cloud of pixelated little men who create an engaging and satisfying choreography of lights and colors. Getting the notes wrong, on the other hand, you get the opposite effect: the procession turns gray and someone sees fit to abandon it, reducing its scope. At the end of each march the leader of the procession must face a boss in a one-on-one fight. The battles, one of the great ideas of Pride Run, are represented as a kind of turn-based fighting game in which the attack phase is conducted by executing different combinations of keys, all related to different techniques, to then overcome a minigame (usually requiring pressing of all or some keys, but there are also tests of precision) and finally delivering the blow, while the defense phase consists in pressing a sequence of keys followed by rapid pressing of two keys. Whoever fills the bar at the top of the screen first wins. The bosses of them are one of the biggest attractions of Pride Run. They are all 'enemies' of the LGBTQ+ community, in the sense of characters who, either because of their political position or because of their cultural nature, are against the rights of the minorities represented by this acronym. Therefore, the presence of Trump and Putin is not surprising, while the inclusion of a creature like the Wendigo, or that of a toreador, is more subtle. Be that as it may, the choices are very direct and aim not to create misunderstandings about who the developers' targets are. At the end of each fight you are called to press one last keystroke to perform a prideality, with which the boss will be definitively transformed into a Pride supporter. In case of the first victory, the next city will also be unlocked to continue towards one of the eight available endings, some of which are linked to the second mode which we will discuss in the next paragraph. RTS gameplay The second great idea of Pride Run is to turn into a real real-time strategy by selecting the Play Hard mode. Initially we thought it was just a customizable version of the standard mode, but in fact it's like a game within a game. Our goal in this case becomes that of managing the procession by choosing who to involve and how to arrange the forces on the field, starting with the leader. As the procession proceeds it is possible to perform performances to attract people and we must protect ourselves from the hatred that surrounds the Pride, whose energy tries to inhibit us, making us lose followers. Obviously the more people you manage to attract, the more your score grows. Proceeding you can also collect objects that help us curb the haters or to embellish the parade. Also in Play Hard mode there are boss fights that conclude the levels: they are identical to those of the standard mode, with no specifics to report. Uncertainties Pride Run is unfortunately not a perfect game and has some non-negligible problems, although they are not shared between the two game modes. Let's say that the standard component gives its best when you start playing with the ears, rather than with the eyes, due to a certain imprecision of the note bar. Furthermore, as long as you look at the icons to press, you miss a good part of the game's choreography and the experience is a bit neutered. But when you start to 'feel' a song and you no longer need itor to watch for keystrokes, the involvement increases and replay becomes a pleasure. The Play Hard mode, on the other hand, has a different problem: the customization choices are quite superfluous, given that you can go on without worries with the default parade configurations which, indeed, are highly recommended, especially the first time you play. For the rest Pride Run is a very solid title that manages to do well in all its ways and with some really over the top found that give it an extra touch. It can also get really addictive and each city can be replayed several times to try higher difficulty levels or simply get a better score. What more could you ask for in such a title?", "date": "2019-11-04", "grade": "7.5"}
