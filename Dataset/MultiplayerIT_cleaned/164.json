{"name": "Gottlieb Pinball Classics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gottlieb-pinball-classics-2.html", "text": "If grandpa had three Gottlieb Pinball is a company that has been producing pinball machines since the 1930s, and in this game, as the title also suggests, you will find a collection of the greatest, most famous, or most important pinball machines of the company's last 70 years. Honestly, not all of them are as fun or complicated (or advanced if you prefer) as the ones we were generally used to seeing in arcades around the nineties, but by playing you will be able to grasp the challenges that these classics also offer, and if there is any that you just won't be able to bear you can always choose between ten different tables. The main game mode is called ~Gottlieb's Challenge~, and sees you committed to passing a minimum score for each of the pinball machines, proposed in sequence, with a maximum of three attempts per table. Each score obtained will be converted into points (according to a table shown in the manual), and at game over all these points will be added up to establish your value as a pinball player. At the end of the game, in addition to the glory, you will also have extra credits left to spend on pinball machines in the practice mode. In fact, each table requires some credits to be played (outside the first mode), at least until you beat the record and thus get the chance to try it for free. You will need the credits to also unlock some options, such as the ability to disable tilt. In addition to this, and the ability to play a tournament for up to four players, the title also offers a mode called ~Table Objectives~ where you have to complete a specific task in each pinball machine. Some you will happen to complete by playing quietly, for others you will have to sweat a little more. You work too much on your wrist and use your forearm badly Gottlieb Pinball Classics is a small encyclopedia of pinball machines on offer. For each table, the game contains a description of the game, the year of production, the reason that made it famous and for which it is in the collection, and above all explains how to play and score more points. (verbal description in English, subtitled in Italian, like the whole game). All this would not justify the release of a pinball game if the realization of the physics was not satisfactory. The title in question boasts a convincing and accurate realization of the physics engine, able to make the player perceive the difference in slope of each table, as well as the different power of the buffers. A note must be made however, to the weight chosen for the ball which seems a little too light, once you have completely entered the game, however, you forget completely about the defect and are able to appreciate every other aspect. We also mention an annoying bug that sometimes allows the ball to pass in the middle of our paddle, and which fortunately, at least in our tests, only occurred in one table. If the realization of the physics is appreciable, we can also be pleased with the graphic realization. The tables are faithfully reproduced, with such care and cleanliness that sometimes we forget we are dealing with a polygonal model and it seems to move the ball over a photo of the pinball machine. Some troubles can come from some targets hidden behind the structures of the table, or too high to be seen clearly, but in this regard the programmers, in addition to providing us with six different views to be able to control the table from any distance, could not do much else . The sound effects closely mirror those of the pinball machine you are playing, as well as those you would imagine hearing in an arcade, and can cause some boredom for older tables. It is not the wrist that should push the ball, but the belly! If you are wondering how to play a pinball machine with a new generation controller, the answer is ~almost like with an old one~. First of all, the game requires the use of the nunchak, and if at first the choice seems unhappy, we must recognize that the decision has a certain logic. With the Z key of the nunchak we control the left paddle, with the B key of the wiimote the right paddle and with the stick we can throw the ball. Shaking the nunchak will move the table to the left, while shaking the wiimote will move it to the right. This configuration turns out to be quite comfortable and functional even if it forces you to take up the bulk of the wire, and given the position of the hands it will almost seem to be gripping the edges of a real table. While we are talking, we would like to say a few words about the reaction of the table to the shaking. Frankly, the ball seemed too stressed by these movements, facilitating the player's task more than necessary (however, the Tilt is always lurking). A jolt to the table always leads to a change in direction of the ball towards the push, obviously in relation to its movement, and after a while you will find yourself playing not only with the paddles but also with the shaking of the table. The unique properties of the wiimote are not used in any other way. Even the menus are controlled in a classic way, also a sign of the game's conversion from previous systems. We conclude by saying that in addition to the classic tables (some of which are almost distant relatives of pinball machines as we know them), there are some additional games from Gottllieb that also allow you to earn some credits if you're lucky. For an overview of the game tables, we refer you to the boxes on the side of the page. Comment Gottlieb Pinbal Classics is an honest collection of pinball machines, also sold at the budget price of around 35. Not all tables are as elaborate as one might expect, and the older ones are real slot machines, with even several traps in which to lose the ball, but the convincing realization of the physics and the care placed in every aspect of the tables make them a simulation to consider if you are passionate about pinball and miss it. It is also true that all the other players can direct their savings elsewhere, without regretting this first System 3 release. Pros: As many as 10 of the most famous Gottlieb tables, very different from each other Appreciable technical realization and physics engine Different game modes Cons: Some tables are too old-fashioned Other than pinball machines, rightly so, there is no other challenge or attraction All competitor's pinball machines Genie Considered among the best of the time, this table is simple but no less fun. The two tablets in the upper left make up a miniflipper in the pinball machine. Victory A very fast table, with more elaborate objectives, and early features of more advanced pinball machines, such as raised ramps. Eldolrado A rather difficult table with few objectives, the aim is to hit the targets in sequence to increase the multipliers. Goin' Nuts A table that never went into production because it was considered too bulky. Unlike classic pinball machines, you always play multiball and you have to gain more seconds to delay the countdown. Big Shot A table based on billiards, clean and elegant. The objectives are very simple, as is the table, but despite everything it manages to have a certain appeal, thanks to its retro spirit. Teed Off It is the most modern table among those proposed, with many advanced and difficult to achieve objectives. The closest pinball machine to those we found in the arcade (among which we also mention this one). Black Hole A rather simple pinball machine in structure, but difficult to play. The table contains a second plane tilted the other way with a smaller pinball machine to score points on. Strike N' Spares Not a real pinball machine, with the two paddles we can launch the ball that has to hit the shapes of some pins, and like in a bowling game we have to strike. Ace High In this table as well as having more than the classic three balls, you have to hit the ~bumpers~ to increase your points. The way in which the ball is lost also counts for scoring purposes. Hard. Central Park A table that is simple in goals but where it is impossible to keep the ball in play. To gamble the salary. Pinball simulations are one of the oldest genres in the video game scene. The market has never followed them with too much interest, yet these electronic tables manage to fascinate anyone. Over time, the genre disappeared and it became increasingly difficult to get hold of a good and fun pinball simulation. System 3 allows us to sink into memories until the rooms were full of tilted tables that emitted lights, electric sounds and impetuous pops at the gift of a credit, and it does so by offering us this Gottlieb Pinball Classics as a launch title for Wii. We remind you that the game in question is not new but is a conversion of a collection already released for PSP and PS2 with the name of ~Pinball Hall of Fame~.", "date": "2007-01-15", "grade": null}
