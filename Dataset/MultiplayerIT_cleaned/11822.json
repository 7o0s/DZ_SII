At first sight it seems a reduction to the minimum terms of a rally simulation, a sort of minimalist and stylish racing game more inclined to aesthetics than to substance, but it is not quite like this: under the fascinating aspect, which undoubtedly remains an element characterizing the title, there is also a solid driving model, based on a certain realism and which requires considerable application to be mastered, even before entering the more properly competitive phase of the online rankings and the more advanced stages of the Career, where Art of Rally reveals its true face as a challenging and damn addictive. On the other hand, the developers are the same as Absolute Drift, which already demonstrated a prototype of Funselektor's particular vision of the racing game with a game all drifting and low-poly graphics, but with Art of Rally the evolution is substantial and we are faced with a much more complete and profound title, although still devoted to the artistic interpretation of the racing genre. The idea of mixing rarefied and ~zen~ atmospheres in rallying may seem crazy, but its logic is revealed right in the depths of the gameplay, when you realize that the secret of this game is all about controlling the driving model and at the same time getting caught up in the flow, mastering the art of rallying as suggested to us in the first screenshots by the Buddha himself, just to give an idea of the strangeness that pervades this experience. Driving model for everyone Art of Rally stages this discipline in a decidedly romantic and fascinating version Don't be fooled by the relaxing and romantic aspect, because Art of Rally is almost a sim-cade that allows you to set the driving model on different levels of realism, going from a more simplified driving with active assistance and automatic gearbox to the more complex one and deep, leaving the player in complete control of the car with the most realistic behaviors. We are absolutely not dealing with a real simulation, the arcade is the fundamental basis and the fact that the shot always remains in the third person from outside the car is already a declaration of intent in this sense, but it soon becomes clear that the graphic style of the game is misleading and its true nature is much closer to a racing game for enthusiasts than a casual digression into the world of rallying. The various environments in Art of Rally are all very relaxing to behold So it happens that, even at the basic level, if you don't learn how to dose the accelerator, brake and handbrake and don't become familiar with drifting and countersteering, you can easily end up badly already at the first corner, because the car and the track are not forgiving, despite the their graceful appearance. The gameplay is all about finding the right sensitivity between accelerator and brake, between steering and counter-steering, with the most fluid and dynamic driving possible, adapting on the spot to every curve and road surface, rather than memorizing every single section of the tracks. In particular, the Group B and Group S cars are racing cars that devour the road: to dominate them you need to act decisively but also delicately. In this total immersion in the flow of the guide, we find the particular idea of Zen applied to the art of rallying, highlighted by the rarefied and pleasant atmospheres of the various classic settings in which we find ourselves racing, from the deserts of Kenya to sunny Sardinia, from the snow and Scandinavian forests to Japan's cherry blossoms. A historical reenactment Art of Rally shows itself in all its beauty especially in replays A game so deeply linked to the passion for rallying could only stage the golden age of this discipline, i.e. racing from the 60s to the 80s with particular insistence on the Group B racing cars, universally considered the maximum expression of these racing. There are no official licenses and the graphic style is clearly approximate but the cars are easily recognizable and the tracks reflect some of the most classic scenarios of real rallies. The game modes include Career, Time Attack and free racing, with the presence of special online events dedicated to the community, all however focused on refining the driving style to file the best times. Free roam allows you to run freely in a large map in search of various collectibles, the various time challenges are used to compete with other players for the best times, while the Career is the connective tissue that allows you to get to know the various tracks and unlock the cars, advancing year after year in the golden age of the rally. The bird's-eye view allows you to always have a broad view of the track Based on the placements achieved in the Career, new cars are obtained and the following championships are unlocked, introduced by a brief historical description on the progress of the rally and the innovations proposed from year to year, giving an almost documentary note to advancing through the levels. even if everything is always filtered through the particular stylized perspective of the game, also given the impossibility of using real names. The contents and modalities are not very many to tell the truth, it will be a question of evaluating the support through online events to keep the community active in the long term. The graphics Art of Rally cars have no official licenses but are easily recognizable The graphic style adopted is clearly a characterizing element of all Art of Rally, which makes minimalism a real foundation of its strange concept. The decision to focus exclusively on the external view, while offering different angles to choose from, is blatantly arcade in itself, but the driving system seems precisely calibrated to still be able to offer good feedback even with this shot, not very popular with racing enthusiasts more simulative. Also in this case, it is a question of not being deceived by appearances, because the system seems well designed to work using this type of camera, which manages to allow good control of the car and being quite large, also to see large portions of track without the need for a navigator. There are some technical inconsistencies: the game was tested on Xbox Series X where one would expect a 120 FPS mode for a low polygonal complexity game like this, which is not the case. Even the 60 fps, to tell the truth, are not granite, which is rather incomprehensible although the question does not pose major problems during gameplay. Occasionally it is also possible to see some slight graphical glitches that demonstrate that there may still be some optimization needed. Snowy landscapes clearly cannot be missing in Art of Rally For the rest, the scenarios only underline the low poly graces that the whole game wants to inspire with its style: the soft colors, the sketched figures and also the excellent light effects especially at sunset and twilight determine very particular and inspire. Similarly, the audio accompaniment is perfectly designed to contribute to this goal: the 80s synth music is perfectly in line with the general aesthetics of the game, while the sound effects of the car, tending more towards realism, contribute to that particular contrast between dreamlike reinterpretation and simulation that characterizes practically all of Art of Rally.", "date": "2021-08-14", "grade": "8.4"}
