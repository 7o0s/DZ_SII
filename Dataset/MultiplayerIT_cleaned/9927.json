We really should thank those who invented digital distribution, and those who thought of applying it to the videogame field. Collector fetishists will probably strongly disagree, deprived of packaging and manuals to admire and jealously keep, yet being able to entrust the distribution of a product to the network brings with it numerous advantages ranging from the purely ecological and ecological factor to the more practical one of allowing survival of genres, software houses and concepts otherwise incompatible with the economic needs and requirements of classic retail. Which publisher enlightened by the purest patronage would have accepted to invest and risk distributing pearls such as Braid, Trials HD, Shatter, Castle Crashers and so on through ~historical~ channels? To this ever-expanding list we are now happy to add Joe Danger, one of the best ever titles available on the Playstation 3 PSN. It's me, Joe! The writer has had the opportunity to read a review of a foreign site with a sentence that probably best summarizes the quality of Joe Danger or: ~it looks like a Nintendo game~. And actually the association is very spot on, and capable of immediately clarifying the quality and depth of the gameplay offered by the Hello Games team. And, just to stay on the subject, at first glance the game seems to remember that Excitebike that has remained in the hearts of many since the days of the NES. Obviously the points of contact are not lacking, as well as a splash of the beautiful Trials HD, but Joe Danger is much more than a tribute to the aforementioned motocross title of the big N; it is a complete, deep and well-structured experience, suitable for both long-time players and those with less experience with the pad in hand. In a nutshell, the very long main mode is nothing more than a succession of tracks always and in any case with a straight path from start to finish; the track design is therefore not based on twists and turns, but rather on all the obstacles that poor stuntman Joe will be destined to encounter on his way. And from this point of view, the repertoire is truly enormous with ramps, jumps, walkways, loops, pools with sharks, palisades, treadmills, springs, bridges and so on. Possibly on the occasion of specific signals, Joe can change lanes within the course, thus going to face totally different situations and elements. But the most interesting thing about Joe Danger is the fact that he is extremely flexible and ready to offer different levels of challenge within each single race; and so for example the requests, in order to obtain all the ~stars~ available in a course necessary to unlock the subsequent races, can be so many and varied as to ~force~ to remain on the same stage for several sessions, without this but you carry the slightest breath of the wind of repetitiveness or boredom. Any examples? Collect all the blue stars, or all the yellow tokens, or locate the hidden super stars, or recover the letters of the word DANGER, or reach a certain number of points. And each time the experience is different enough to keep the interest high. To survive then, the good Joe can count on various skills, starting from the natural one at the wheel (or rather at the handlebars) of his motorcycle which allows him to perform spectacular evolutions in flight; the latter are not ends in themselves, but allow you to recharge the precious boost bar which is absolutely essential for overcoming certain passages or reaching objects and bonuses. Lastly, the ability to take a heavy leap or lower your head, also to be mastered as soon as possible to obtain successes. Research, discovery and experimentation are therefore aspects strongly advocated in Hello Games' product, since the error is never excessively punished; just start from one of the generous checkpoints and try it again hoping to have better luck. And as we said a few lines above, the challenge level is perfectly calibrated so as to be able to offer ~something~ for everyone; the sympathy of the colorful graphics and the discreet accessibility of the control system are sufficient to support a casual approach, but at the same time the more demanding objectives, the scoring system and the online rankings guarantee more than one reason for stimulation and insight to the more experienced. The description is closed by a two-player multiplayer mode and a path editor, capable of further extending the overall longevity. A complete success therefore for the first work of Hello Games, a ggroup of only 4 members, however, most likely destined to be talked about in the future.", "date": "2010-07-05", "grade": "9.0"}
