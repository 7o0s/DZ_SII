{"name": "CSI: New York", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-new-york_a.html", "text": "There is no doubt that ~CSI~ is one of the most successful series of recent years, which started quietly in Italy (it was broadcast in the late evening or worse) and promoted after a very short time to the flagship program of the television schedule. The popularity of the show and its protagonists prompted the producers to create two spin-offs with a profoundly different character, the first set in Miami and the second in New York. And it is precisely from CSI: New York that Gameloft has returned to work to complete its set of tie-ins based on the series. As per tradition, in the game we will find almost all the characters seen on TV: the weapons expert Mac Taylor, the clever Stella Bonasera, the ~rebel~ Danny Messer, the skilled coroner Sheldon Hawkes, etc. The developers have used the same structure of the previous episodes, further enriching it with alternative sections and adding depth to the gameplay, which now sees us perform a really large number of different actions. The story is divided into chapters, in each of which we will take a few steps forward in our search for the truth. If we are already familiar with the CSI games for mobile phones, we will be able to choose to immediately deactivate the interface aids, which will suggest the tools to use during the first stages. Otherwise we will be led by the hand until we are able to manage on our own with regard to the analysis of crime scenes, the collection of evidence, the medical consultation on the bodies found and the interaction with witnesses or key characters. The control system is based on the movement of a pointer on the screen via the d-pad, a pointer that changes shape according to the sensitive areas it comes into contact with. While we're at the crime scene, for example, the interface will show us the evidence once we've hovered the pointer over it, so we'll have to select the best tool to collect it. Once the work has been completed in this situation (a numerical indicator will indicate how many objects we will have to find from time to time), we will move to the police laboratories for the analysis of the case. At this point we will have to try our hand at a series of minigames to compare the footprints (recognizing the same or different images), extract the DNA (in a sort of essential ~Puzzle Bubble~), decipher codes, etc. In the end we will have new clues and new leads to follow, with the map of New York which will gradually be enriched with places where it is possible to go. The graphic style is what Gameloft has accustomed us to with the reductions of CSI and CSI: Miami, or digitized characters contrasted with drawn and detailed locations. The gameplay is based on the collection of evidence on different scenarios, so it is clear that these must be rich enough to make the operation less trivial as possible. Compared to previous episodes, the graphics are better, with crime scenes enhanced by parallax scrolling that adds a good sense of depth and a number of ~special effects~ that somehow bring to mind the way the movie is shot. TV show. The map has perhaps been simplified, but navigation is immediate and the reading of objects is always clear. PRO Enriched game structure Pretty neat graphics Quite long and challenging AGAINST Still a bit cumbersome The minigames could have been better Subdued sound, but at least it's not annoying", "date": "2009-01-15", "grade": "S.V."}
