After all, if aubergines are already the protagonists of a video game saga, why shouldn't the tubers most loved by young and old not have their own? In this episode we will help our friends Ren and Rexa in their new investigative activity, in a conceptually simple and apparently light-hearted, but at the same time immediate and exciting management game. A simple and ironic management The game begins with a rather limited map, so as to suggest that it is a title developed for the small screens of mobile devices (but it is not). Some buildings are already present and others can be added; however, the main ones are the barracks and the operations centre. In the first, spies are hired and in the second, they are trained to send them on missions. Some of these are optional, and completing them provides money to upgrade the rest of the structures or other useful upgrades; others are mandatory and must be completed within the established time, otherwise the game will end prematurely. The fact that the contracts are expiring is one of the most stimulating aspects of A Spy Story, because it keeps the attention alive even during periods that would otherwise have been dead. Only the batpatata is missing In all likelihood, the tasks will not be immediately within the spies' reach, so they will have to be trained in special structures (such as gyms, bookstores, fashion shops) to improve their statistics. Each is characterized by four abilities: strength, charisma, intelligence and stealth, but we will hardly be able to find the perfect potato (please avoid double meanings), so we will prefer to have specialists with a couple of very strong characteristics and the remaining ones more weak. These can be modified with the help of gadgets to be researched by first decrypting the very precious floppy disks and then developing them in the appropriate laboratories. Tools such as the shirt with the fake abs or the stuffed cat paws can make the difference and are therefore very important in the economy of the missions; however they can get damaged during the course and will therefore need to be rebuilt. Undercover missions Once you are ready to go into action, a special screen opens, in which you have to select the warning light that is most suitable for the purpose and then indicate its behavior during the obstacles that will be found on the road, which can be of a ~technical~ type ( closed doors, walls to climb, etc.) or ~physical~ (ordinary people or guards who might become suspicious of the presence of the agent, pets and so on). Usually for each assignment there may be two or three selectable paths, which may be more suitable for one spy than another. The hindrances have a level of resistance to the four abilities that is not always known, so in some cases one is forced to rely on the statistic with the highest value, with the risk of compromising the mission: however, depending on the combinations chosen, the game warns us of the failure rate, which ranges from low to extremely high through medium to high. The killer potato is ready for action Once the start button has been pressed, a banner displays the progress of the contract: if the chosen tactics are not adequate, the police siren lights up and, if the maximum level is reached, the mission is aborted (in some cases, the mission is permanently lost). contract, in others, such as in the main quests, it is possible to attempt it again). The judgement, which is all the higher the more anonymous the spy's behavior was, is evaluated just like in Metal Gear Solid (even Ren has a mechanical arm like Snake!), with votes ranging from S (the highest, to which correspond to better rewards) to D. An immediate but not trivial title Explained this way, A Spy Story might appear rather simple, but the designers have come up with a series of tricks that make it more challenging than it might appear. For example, some tasks require certain types of gadgets which at that moment may not even be researchable by the player: it will therefore be necessary to equip oneself to build the appropriate buildings and develop the related technologies while the countdown that expires the contract continues inexorably. Note Ren's thoughtful expression But even placing the buildings is not entirely obvious because, as mentioned, the maps are limited and ~prepackaged~ and therefore bisEveryone will have to redesign the street furniture as new structures become available, demolishing existing ones and making sure they are accessible from the street. Graphically, the title of Daylight reflects the previous stylistic features of the house, with a very inspired character design both as regards the story, written along the lines of an episode of the Big Bang Theory (countless references to films and other video games), and for the ~ potato-spies~ that refer to famous characters such as Ronald Duck and his unmistakable blond tuft, or Maruto, with his orange onesie and mustache. Equally pleasant is the musical accompaniment complete with a Batman jingle (here renamed to Madman) when a mission is successfully completed and numerous snacks always at the right point; however, the speech is missing and the texts are only in English. In general, the ironic and light-hearted tone that permeates the entire production is a considerable added value. Longevity is good, both in relation to the genre and in comparison to the previous episodes. Of course, don't expect Bible sessions, but it took us at an average level about eight hours to get to the fourth stage. Even Spy Story suffers from the same weaknesses of its predecessors: after having taken the measures in the income/expenses item during the first rounds, the continuation has become easier because the economic factor, which is basically the one from which the highest rate of challenge, it has become less challenging. However, credit must be given to the programmers for having been able to introduce numerous variables even as the story progresses, so that the degree of happiness of the spies (which makes them more or less effective on missions) only appeared towards the end of the second stage, when by now we were convinced that the title no longer had much to offer.", "date": "2018-11-06", "grade": "7.5"}
