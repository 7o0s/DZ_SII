{"name": "Halo in salsa noir", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70608-halo-3-odst-halo-in-salsa-noir.html", "text": "Playing a game that should never have existed is always something special, the realization of a sort of ~what if~ bearing in mind that the canceled product was Peter Jackson's vision of the Halo universe, developer Bungie and producer Microsoft , people accustomed, perhaps with some delay, to complete the planned projects. The Halo: Chronicles construction site was instead closed and those who would have taken part were left with nothing to plan, considering that the other part of the team was already working hard on Reach and that, in theory, Bungie had already honored all the commitments made with Microsoft - at this point we are at the beginning of spring 2008, just six months after hard-earned independence - being able, perhaps with a sigh of relief, to start thinking about something again. This did not happen and the boys led by Curtis Creamer finally decided to try something new without abandoning the solid foundations, including commercial ones, that had brought them so much luck, embracing what at that point had become a challenge against time to create a episode of the series in a year and a half, perhaps leaving one of the most iconic characters in the history of video games for a walk and heavily varying the narrative structure. Halo 3: ODST was not born on the same tracks as its predecessors but the result is still one that leaves you impressed. Curiosity The definitive confirmation comes from the postcard inside the collection: the Halo: Reach beta will begin next spring and all ODST owners will be invited to it. Only in the night The narrative premise is now known: in the role of the Novellino, the latest arrival of the Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, you will find yourself alone inside the New Mombasa under siege, with the Covenant engaged in patrolling the night streets of a now deserted city and the unnamed alter ego of the user to find out what happened to the five teammates. The events are then told with the famous played flashbacks which are activated upon the discovery, within the New Mombasa meta-level, of the objects linked to one's fellow soldiers, a choice which from the point of view of the atmosphere allowed, to see writes, a step forward compared to what was done in the previous Halo: the urgency expressed by the newcomer to find his points of reference, lost in even a metaphorical night, contrasts with that of his companions during the day, when the mission could still be accomplished and the war won; two different objectives, with long segments of gameplay that intersperse the sandbox-style action that is decidedly more linear, frenetic even if it diminishes in what seems more and more an inevitable fall, while the exploratory part, with the enemy raids that break navigation through the large open level, unable in and of itself to give a perspective of what happened and for this reason excellent, especially at the beginning, in giving the idea of solitude, in emphasizing the need to know more, up to the final syncopation that somehow changes the cards on the table and gives the freshman his moment of linear action, of importance for the entire history of the Earth in the twenty-sixth century. Conserve vs innovate The story, the way it is told and the atmospheres remain the greatest novelties of a title which in the substance of the gameplay is inextricably linked to Halo 3. And this is not a bad thing. Commanding the Newbie or one of his companions is therefore child's play for any player in the series, with a few seconds needed only for the awareness of a life bar which, once the light shield equipped with self-recharge is consumed, will have to be replenished using the special medkits and a interface always very elegant in reproducing the curvature of the helmet and now enriched by the presence of the Visr, the useful tool for identifying both the hotspots with which to interact and the characters on the screen, whether enemies or friends. For the rest, the feeling is unchanged, as mentioned, with the controls perfectly calibrated and the action designed to be enjoyed right from the pad: the weapons respond perfectly, the high jump, albeit less than when commanded by the Master Chief, makes this mechanic more than a mere means to overcome obstacles and the excellent variety of different enemies, capable of imposing the continuous alternation of simple strategies, offers the usual enormous amount of fun divided into many small gratifications. All this is especially true when playing on Heroic difficulty alone - it remains the best choice, to see who writes, to enjoy the title, even better than in coop - or Legendary in company, always the best in terms ofor to enhance the balancing work. The video review Xbox 360 goals The thousand points up for grabs from Halo 3: ODST and unrelated to those of competitive multiplayer, cover the resolution of individual flashbacks, completing the game at various difficulty levels and obtaining a given number of points in Firefight, in addition to other small tasks. The level design is very good, always dominated by the perfect distribution on the ground of both groups of enemies and supplies, with some reason for regret only for the management of some internal areas, with enemies who do not come out from inside and vice versa. The flashbacks are quite long, about thirty minutes for the shortest on the first pass, and each offers one or two specific dynamics, going from the classic foot combat, now in the streets of the city, to the siege inside a palace and to the ascent along the floors of another, from traveling through a long environment in the style of an ~adventure park-safari~ with the constant use of light vehicles, up to traveling through the streets of New Mombasa aboard a tank, always resulting perfectly blended and with the above solid foundations. Particular, of course, the speech for the night exploratory part in the city, which behaves very well in the clashes - but in fact, it is the game structure that makes it possible - however resulting a bit discontinuous as a whole. The beginning is fantastic, the sense of bewilderment is great and the impact is great, so much so that at the end of the first flashback the always excellent soundtrack by O'Donnell, now dominated by the saxophone as well as the inevitable percussion, favors a few moments of total immersion as the series has rarely achieved, while going forward, just before the long epilogue, one has the feeling of being of trains forced to go from one point to another, without excessive content in between. Of course we are talking about less exciting moments than others and the discovery of the audio files placed in the double role of collectibles and fil rouge with the life of the inhabitants of the city help, but perhaps a few more jolts could have been placed. The two completely new weapons are the silenced rifle and the pistol: the first will have to be evaluated at its best in multiplayer, tending to lose some of it in the pile during the campaign, while the second is the weapon you will love in this Halo 3: ODST , a headshot-perfect, one-hit-at-a-time little bitch that will instantly become the nightmare of grunts and jackals alike. To complete the campaign, on the first pass to normal, about four and a half hours are needed, a little more by playing it again in Heroic and the cooperative is still missing from the count; for fun and replayability, the 49.90 euros requested are already largely justified. All multiplayer As expected and expected, the multiplayer component of Halo 3: ODST is of enormous weight in the whole offer. The big news is the Firefight mode, which by now should be out of the ears of practically everyone: it is the super trendy cooperative survival mode for four people revised in the Bungie style. Ten maps in total, all taken from the campaign and some in double guise, day and night, within which to block the waves of Covenant coming from everywhere, sharing lives with your companions and trying to get the highest score. The use of skulls to change the rules of engagement is excellent in guaranteeing variety to what, having overcome for some the shock of not having an end and therefore an objective other than that of scoring, is easily the best exponent of its kind, with the arenas always full and never a moment of pause, but at the same time the various levels of difficulty calibrated in such a way as to allow anyone to approach them without fear of being eaten, as could happen in the competitive guise of multiplayer . The copy provided to us by Microsoft didn't allow online play, so having only tested the split screen it's likely that we missed some details and the spirit obtainable online, thus enjoying an even better experience. Similar speech for the three new maps added to the twenty-one previously created for Halo 3 and collected here on one disc. The judgments in this sense will be given after several games but as seen locally, the three new environments are the usual excellent mixture of symmetrical areas and others less so, for small teams or large pitched matches. As a first indication, however, if Porto Industriale will drive the lovers of pitched battles crazy - in addition to those of the Forge - and Citadel on the contrary the teams composed of few elements, Heretic should become the favorite of the players, a Covenant environment with a volume I don't mastodontic but fantastic as it is intricate and full of different ideas. Kill the boss Technically the discourse is varied and must necessarily embrace several elements. Graphically, the engine is that of Halo 3, no more, no less, with some additions regarding lights and particle effects, thirty stable images per second and excellent cleaning that rebalances a non-stratospheric polygonal count by looking at the individual elements. The New Mombasa at night is very suggestive and the flashback levels do not suffer from the bass that Halo 3 suffered in some settings. The menu system obviously remains unchanged and this is a good thing, once again proving to be one of the best in living memory, with all the options manageable with just a few pressures and the group of players who can move comfortably from one mode without ever logging off to the other. The artificial intelligence is good which, being the enemies practically the same as in the past, behaves in the same way when in larger environments, then adapting to the often narrow spaces, between walls and stairs, of the city: the groups of brutes and grunts detach when the former are killed and the latter are the usual helpless little colored creatures, unless they're holding a needle gun or a couple of sticky-bombs, or are perched on some turret that covers their head, while the jackals watch - and shoot - from afar and hunters are big beasts less dangerous than they may seem. As already mentioned, the music fits perfectly, best emphasizing the noir atmospheres of one half of the game and returning to the epic in the other. The dubbing is not bad, which remains preferable in English but does not look bad in Italian either.", "date": "2009-09-20", "grade": "9.2"}
