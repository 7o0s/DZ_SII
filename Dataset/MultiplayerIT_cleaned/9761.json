Created by Merle Robbins in 1971 with a deck of special non-collectible cards, this product has then been adapted since its inception in a thousand variations and versions, including the latest ones already appreciated on home consoles. From Playstation 2 to Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, from iPod and iPhone OS to Nintendo Wii (and even DSi), this game has seen the light of day on practically all existing platforms or almost. The appeal could certainly not miss the appropriate edition for PlayStation 3, in this case as downloadable content from the PlayStation Network. Let's make it clear right away that this is not a port, for example of the Xbox 360 or Wii version, but a game in its own right, even if it obviously maintains the structural basis of the original. The real difference between this edition and the others is, if anything, to be found in the possibility offered here to users to challenge as many as six opponents both offline and online, compared to the canonical four and in being able to operate more on different aspects of the game, thanks to a series of setting options. Avatars Given the nature of the title and the numerous variations that it offers through the modification of the parameters that determine the various challenges through game options, we believe it is not appropriate to explain here every single detail that distinguishes Uno, also because it would be impossible to do it otherwise in a few lines. Therefore, leaving the burden and the pleasure of discovering the rules of each mode to the gamer by playing, we will limit ourselves to analyzing the basic gameplay. Broadly speaking, the primary objective of the title is to ensure that the first player to score a certain score wins the game. The user who has no more cards in hand triumphs and earns a certain number of points calculated on the basis of the remaining cards of the other players. But let's go into detail. Once your avatar has been created using the appropriate editor, the user can try his hand at a series of modes chosen from among those present and which are Free Play, Tournament, Multiplayer (locally and online). At the beginning of the game, after having drawn the dealer, from the group of one hundred and eight cards divided by color (red, blue, yellow and green) and characteristics (Draw, Reverse or Change Spin, Skip or Stop, Joker or Color Change cards, etc.) seven are distributed to the players each. After that the remaining ones form the main deck placed on the ~table~ with their backs covered, except for the first one which is turned over, thus forming the so-called ~discard deck~. At this point the character ~seated~ on the dealer's left starts the game by proceeding the round clockwise by discarding a card from those he has available, provided that it is compatible with the one at the top of the discard pile by color or by number. Multiplayer challenge Let's give an example: if you have a green card with the number eight in your hand, you can discard it only if the one on the bench is any numbered green card or is a number eight of any other color. If the player has no cards to discard then he must draw one from the pile on the virtual table. If also in this case the draw cannot be played, the turn will pass to the next user. And so on. As we said before, by playing the video gamer will be able to better understand how the challenges work. The match can be decided by many factors, from the skill of the opponents to luck without forgetting that pinch of strategy that never hurts. Even if the AI of the opponents is all in all quite advanced, Uno is a product that lends itself and is best enjoyed by nature for use in multiplayer. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, this mode, available with both local and online play options, is quite rich considering the product genre. It is divided into several subsections related to some specific types of games: ranging from Non-ranked to Game-Ranked, etc., all designed for challenges against human opponents up to a maximum of six including the main user. We conclude this review by taking a look at the technical component that characterizes the product. Being a title based on a card game, graphics obviously cannot be its strong point. So apart from the very bright colors, cute and funny avatars with their funny expressions and animations when you win or lose, there's little to report. On balance, however, from a general aesthetic point of view, the game is pleasant. And it is also from the sound point of view, with jingles rirepetitive but adapted to the situations and sampled phrases for the characters representing the gamers on the screen that adapt well to the context.", "date": "2010-10-05", "grade": "7.0"}
