{"name": "Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-2-recensione.html", "text": "Back to root If in the first episode almost all of the missions were set in Mexico City, now the locations are of a slightly wider scope and include the suburbs of Juarez, mountain outposts, bridges, dams and so on. Moving on to action, you immediately notice a certain ~return to origins~. The game mechanics are actually quite similar to the previous one: the player plays only the captain of the Ghost team and is followed by up to three soldiers who respond to his commands, given as usual by the central mouse button. So what brings Advanced Warfighter 2 closer to the progenitor of the series? Basically the design of the maps, which are now less ~confusing~ despite their size. The objectives to be pursued are very clear and immediate, which did not always happen in the previous title, and also the unit management screen has been revised keeping the first Ghost Recon as a touchstone, and this can only please aficionados of the first minute. Not to mention the briefing menu that allows you to better follow the plot. Back to root The natural evolution of the game has led programmers to perfect the system of controlling fellow soldiers. Now, when commands are given to other team members, helpful icons also appear on the screen to help you understand what they will do. In fact, the biggest weakness of the first GRAW consisted in the difficulty of understanding where our helpers would move, while now the feeling of having everything under control is much stronger, even if the suicidal attitudes have not completely disappeared. From time to time it is also possible to remote control other means, such as mortars, tanks or bionic sentinels. In these cases (and, in our humble opinion, a few others) it is preferable to use the top view, in a strategic style, given that aiming the viewfinder where a hornet's nest of terrorists is hiding (almost) mathematically equivalent to the passage to the best life. The PhysX board The single player campaign missions are well structured and consistent with the story; set as mentioned on the border between the USA and Mexico, where ocher and metal are the masters, they often have different targets, and the choice of the most suitable arsenal can make the difference. The PC version provides the possibility to choose between two insertion points; usually one is more isolated and distant, while the other immediately leads into the hot area. The care in the creation of the paraphernalia has always been one of the flagships of Tom Clancy's games, and here it establishes new standards of comparison, both in terms of quality and quantity. The important possibility of recovering weapons from the bodies of corpses has been introduced: a really good choice, given that often ~twists~ will occur during a mission, making the initial equipment unsuitable. The PhysX board Physics management is truly remarkable and reaches the highest levels with the help of the Ageia PhysX card which, as some know, houses a processor dedicated exclusively to the management of the Havok engine. The designers have made an effort to use so much power not for purely aesthetic reasons as happened with the previous episode, but also trying to influence the gameplay. The objective was only partially achieved: if it is true that some elements of the landscape such as fences, nets or cars can be blown up by eliminating some ~protection~ areas (the spectacular effect of the trucks that collapse when it is a tyre), it is equally true that not everything can be razed to the ground (sometimes in a paradoxical way, like the walls of the wooden house which remain standing despite the explosion of a nearby tank), and that the occasions in which the player is pushed to make a clean slate to flush out the bad guys are not that numerous. In fact, most of the time a more silent and ~cerebral~ tactic is preferable: those who think they can make a merry carnage relying only on the promptness of their reflexes will find the name of their alter ego appear numerous times in the list of those killed for their country . Terrorists in fact hide very well and little else. Unfortunately, in fact, their AI has not been the subject of the necessary care of neurons that the first GRAW needed. There are too many times when enemies do not take advantage of the defenses at their disposal, or remain absolutely indifferent in front of a companion who falls hit by a bullet in the forehead. Certain situations border on the absurd: more than once it has happened that entire squads of rebel militants remained intent on shooting in the direction of the last remaining Mexican loyaliststanding up without in the least bothering to look over his shoulder, thus falling under our blows which seemed to have exploded against a red cross. The biggest challenge in matches against the computer is to find the bad guys before they have time to take us out: this means that the pace of the action tends to be slow and that there is also time to admire the extremely detailed level design work . The downside is that the rebels occupy the same positions with each new game, and this means that the fear that one's head could be blown up by a sniper is dampened by the third quick load, when inevitably one will have understood which side is that shot coming from. Perhaps an inevitable solution in order not to further weigh down a game that requires several efforts to the system at maximum detail, but which ends up decreasing the freedom of action that such vast levels could guarantee. As a result, longevity is also undermined, already in itself reduced by the introduction of the quick save: the check points continue to exist, but the PC version allows you to save ~almost~ at any time (this is impossible during battles on fire). This means that it takes about fifteen hours to complete the main campaign in normal mode. The multiplayer The internet should help to prolong the life of the game. The multiplayer aspect is by far the most delicate, since GRAW hadn't shown itself in the least worthy of inheriting an imposing community like that of the first Ghost Recon: only with the help of increasingly consistent patches was the game given shape on the net, initially ~non-existent~, but not yet sufficient for Italian players. In this production GRiN proves that he has listened to the complaints of the fans. Of course there are the classic modes we've all come to know: Single and Team Deathmatches, Domination (here called Hamburger Hill), and Assault. Then there are two further variants: the cooperative and the one called Recon vs Assault. The multiplayer The first, which can also be played with the help of cross-com, the futuristic multifunctional helmet, offers the possibility of tackling the campaign single-handedly together with other human players: a nice way to relive the same missions (however, in this case the sequences are missing introductory films) along the lines of what has already been seen in the first title and in Rainbow Six: Vegas. As already reported in the Xbox 360 review, the difficulty level rises considerably for the PC counterpart as well; the enemies are a little more numerous and above all lethal - with one blow you almost always end up being knocked down. The maps are obviously those already seen in the single player. Unfortunately, this mode is limited by the repetitiveness of the actions of the enemies, controlled by the CPU, and can only be interesting immediately after completing the single player. The multiplayer Recon vs Assault probably contains the greatest potential, as it compares two teams of players: the Ghosts and the Mexicans. In essence, the former must try to detonate three anti-aircraft, the latter must eliminate all American soldiers. The peculiarity is that the ghost killed (unlike the terrorist who is ~immortal~), can only come back into play when an anti-missile battery is destroyed. When dead, he can still contribute to his cause thanks to the cross-com helmet, identifying the position of enemies. A common feature of multiplayer modes is the acquisition of experience that allows you to unlock new and more powerful weapons. However, to tell if the GRAW2 seed will take root under the Internet front, it takes a long time and continuous support from the programmers. The premises are undoubtedly better than the original title, considered by many to be embryonic at the time of release. For our part, we can only point out that the servers are currently not very populated, but this is also due to the low penetration of the game, released in the United States and Europe in early July. Finally, the incompatibility between the PC version and the Xbox 360 version should be underlined. The technique Analyzing Advanced Warfighter 2 from a technical point of view, we are dealing with an evolution of the original. The engine used is still the Diesel engine, now in its seventh edition, which knows how to offer highly spectacular moments, succeeding in the difficult task of immersing the player in the fiery atmosphere of a Mexico devastated by civil war. Walking through the narrow streets of Juarez and seeing in the distance the flashes of a bomb testifying to the ongoing guerrilla warfare is very evocative, as is the intProvidential event of an allied Black Hawk sweeping through the last rebel holdouts. Among the best-performed effects, the explosions deserve mention, made even more spectacular by the physical consequences we discussed above. The polygonal models have in turn undergone a small restorative facelift and are characterized by a good fluidity of movement and a discreet characterization. In order to push all the options to the maximum, however, a video card equipped with a lot of RAM is needed to speed up the loading of the textures (moreover ~recycled~ abundantly from the first GRAW). For those who are not yet equipped with a GeForce 8800 (this is the card needed to set everything to the limit), the scalability of the engine allows you to obtain a decent frame rate even on systems that are not exactly avant-garde. The technique We really liked the audio sector: the explosions are made excellently as well as the dialogues in Italian, revised and corrected. Now the interpreters seem to have fallen into the role with greater conviction and make the actions of war more ~alive~. Special mention for the soundtrack, in perfect Black Hawk Down style, in the opinion of the writer the best aspect of the entire game. It's just a pity that the dedicated audio CD has yet to come out. Bugs Unfortunately, the network experience (both local and international) is limited due to annoying bugs that lead to the game being released during particularly crowded sessions. In still other games it happened that the system froze after a ~resurrection~ forcing us to restart the program. GRIN has already run for cover by releasing a 30 Mbyte patch (1.02) a few days after the release of the game, but this is still not enough. Finally, the incompatibility of Advanced Warfighter 2 with the latest version of nVidia video drivers, 162.18, should be noted. We advise against installing it for those who want to continue playing the Ubisoft title, at least until a new patch is released. Comment The more mischievous could consider Advanced Warfighter 2 what should have been the first title, and actually the feeling is that of having a more complete game in your hands. The improvements are seen almost everywhere: from the leaner engine to the less confusing game structure and a much more consistent multiplayer than the past. The game can give an experience as pleasant as it is volatile in single player mode; the plot is usually well thought out and intriguing, the maps detailed and spectacular. To find out if GRAW2 will be able to keep up even on the internet front, it is necessary to wait for the next few months, so as to be able to evaluate the support that Ubisoft will be able to give to this new episode of Ghost Recon.
