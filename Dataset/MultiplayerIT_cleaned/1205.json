{"name": "Animal Crossing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/animal-crossing_a.html", "text": "The (not) animal farm From its first settings, Animal Crossing has the power to enchant the player by dragging him into a world with an enchanting atmosphere where everything appears natural and spontaneous, thanks to a design (and programming) aimed at the maximum effort in eliminating any reference that could to break the suspension of disbelief, in a game that never misses an opportunity to laugh mockingly at its limits. Because, as a masterpiece, Animal Crossing has what some would call limits, as we will see later. We said a little above that the names of the village and of our alter ego are asked of us during a romantic train journey enlivened by the presence of the cat Girolamo, whose gab will also allow us to decide our appearance and to adjust the clock of the GameCube for the better, if by chance it doesn't mark the exact time at that moment; It has been repeated many times, in this and other venues, that the central point that distinguishes the Animal Crossing experience from many others is this perfect correspondence between real time and playful time, whereby the time marked by all clocks in the the charming village where we go to live is the same one that the trusty wristwatch shows us when we go to check it, and equally ~faithful~ to the real world is its scrolling speed. After an agile tutorial that does everything not to be called such, perfectly integrated as it is in the intentions and in the story of the game, our guide (played as much by the mellifluous raccoon Tom Nook as by all the little animals that live in the charming town) kindly gives up he takes it and leaves us alone to explore all the potential of our new life, perhaps still slightly disoriented but certainly not as much as we could have been if freedom had been slammed in our faces without any warning. And there are many things to do right from the start, so many that they cannot simply be listed, both because the surprise of discovering them by oneself would be ruined, and because a sterile list of all the skills inherent in our character would be very poor thing, for the review of a title so unique and so reluctant to be caged in classifications of any kind. Animal Crossing has the power to enchant the player by dragging him into a world with an enchanting atmosphere where everything appears natural and spontaneous The (not) animal farm During the day, just to name a few, you fish and catch objects according to the season, you chat with your friendly fellow villagers also through correspondence, you participate in many events and above all you buy new pieces of furniture to personalize your own home: ~personalization~ is also the keyword to better understand the world of Animal Crossing, a world not made up of records to break or enemies to oppose, and in which the truest essence of the game is realized as an activity completely an end in itself, with no competition whatsoever that requires you to win against someone else, be it a human player or a CPU-controlled opponent. Sure, the (strictly alternating) multiplayer of Animal Crossing allows a maximum of four people (even completely ignorant of videogame culture, such as brother/sister, father or grandfather) to live in the same village, and therefore to compare the results obtained in their own collections and in socializing with the other inhabitants. It is very probable that in the first months of the game you will let your daily schedules be pleasantly guided by the events that regularly occur in the virtual town, and this makes this experience something memorable. It is obvious, however, that over time (and in any case a whole year to discover all the events and objects of the game is always more than respectable) the enthusiasm for one's pretty town will slowly fade, even if it does not reach probably to shut down completely given the attraction exercised by the game, which requires constant visits, but not too much, to always keep one's village in order. The first limitation of Animal Crossing is that, despite wanting to pass it off as a practically eternal title, sooner or later it ends, and the interest decreases below the guard levels, probably attracted by fresh titles and other emotions. Fortunately this process is much slower than in other games with a defined conclusion (or not), and there is still a pleasant feeling of attachment and affection, even after the passage of the climax. Hair in the egg? This can be considered a defect of the game structure as it may not be, the fact is that qSome stretch marks, even in an apparently perfect fabric such as the gameplay of Animal Crossing, are inevitable. Starting with the difficulty shown by fellow villagers in trying to understand our letters, a fact due to an artificial intelligence all in all quite modest, which among other things often makes the characters fall into contradiction or makes them repeat the same sentences several times in a row ; venial sin, after all, however, given the enormous work done in differentiating the personalities and appearances of the colored animals and in the creation of a multitude of dialogues all different from each other, and above all considering that, although attributed to this title simulator ambitions (but is a communication game), Animal Crossing strongly rebels against this definition, itself pointing the finger at the ~not very simulator~ characteristics of the entire experience. Starting with the graphics, cartoony and perhaps a little dated, but absolutely perfect for what they want to represent, as well as the music, simple and calm yet appropriate for this very reason. The European version, of course, brings back everything that many have already seen with the American edition of the game (minus the E-Reader - see Box), plus a translation into the main languages of the Old Continent, obviously including the Italian. The localization in Dante's idiom is surprisingly good, despite presenting some name changes as usual arbitrary, but in most cases quite justified, and overall manages to restore the original and delicate atmosphere of the game (albeit with the due distinctions to the different sound of the language and of the animals' speech), being able to elicit even a few smiles in some cases. Too bad, however, that a job so well done (even the textures of all the in-game writings have been modified) is partially marred by the obligation to view the game at 50Hz, with an absolutely mediocre conversion which, among other things, ~supports~ rather visible updates of the video (with consequent discomfort in the eyes) and an exasperating slowness, both in the game menus and in the actual movement, so much so that at times it seems to move in a liquid element rather than in the air. Fortunately you get used to it soon, but the annoyance remains. Good Bye, E-Readers Someone was wondering how the support that Animal Crossing provides for the GBA e-card reader that was so successful in America and Japan would be treated in the European version: it is now known to all that this delight of optional instrumentation for Game Boy has never officially crossed the ocean to reach the Old Continent. Perhaps someone hoped that the release of Animal Crossing would provide an excellent excuse to sell some E-Readers even in our land, but the sad truth is there for all to see: Animal Crossing PAL does not support E-Reader in any way. Readers. We can understand that in general this option was not so essential for the full enjoyment of the game, but note the redesign of the post office, where there was a device that allowed card reading via a GBA connected to the GC now replaced with a simple counter of no practical use, it certainly makes one lose hope in an official importation of the product. There is little to say that has not already been mentioned in the review: with this European version, Animal Crossing reconfirms that small (or large?) pearl that the supporters of the import market have already been able to appreciate in all its aspects. For the rest, thinking of liquidating in a few lines all the sensations with which AC is impregnated is truly madness. We limit ourselves to recommending their purchase to everyone without distinction, and to point out that in any case the rating (which should have been, in the intentions of the writer, a round 9) is lowered by half a point due to the absence of a 60Hz mode which would have made up for the slowness that one is instead forced to bear by choosing the PAL version of the game. In any case, an obligatory choice for those who don't want to buy a Freeloader or a USA/JP Cube or for those who hate English texts in games. Pros: Sky-high gameplay Tons of things to do and items to find It's an encyclopedia of Nintendo love Cons: Pretty but not great graphics Only supports 50Hz mode It's over sooner or later The complete guide ready for you! To celebrate the arrival of the highly anticipated Animal Crossing on our continent, Multiplayer.it wanted to do things big, not only by offering you a comprehensive review, but also by publishing a complete guide to unravel every secret present. And so the village most loved by GC users will have no mystery! Link: The complete guide to Animal Crossing All of us fans of mother Nintendo love Shigeru Miyamoto, one of the most legendary men, in Japan and beyond, of the gaming industry. Yet in this case the master Shigeru has little to do with the title that, for two years now, has been raging among the ~hardcore~ users of the Cube, those who turn to the import market: the funny inhabitants of Animal Crossing and the world in which they move have in fact been born from the imagination of one of Miyamoto's right-hand men (even if we are not talking about the Goddess Kali), Takashi Tezuka, who has only recently risen under the limelight, above all for being the main proponent of Super Mario Sunshine. After two years of intense work, Nintendo of Europe has finally made up its mind and has made available to players a localized version of this new world to be explored and which we are preparing to place in the spotlight. His name? It's up to us to decide.", "date": "2004-09-30", "grade": null}
