{"name": "D4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137871-d4-dark-dreams-dont-die-un-oscuro-sognare.html", "text": "The announcement of the release date the day before the launch on Xbox Live was a more unique than rare event, in the world of hype and marketing of next-gen videogame productions, but it is a business card in perfect harmony with the character of D4: Dark Dream Don't Die, the new production of Hidetaka ~Swery~ Suehiro and Access Games, or the same authors of the ~cult~ Deadly Premonition. A surprise launch, which could be both a sin and a message of challenge: it certainly deserved more visibility and I'm sorry that this general negligence could lead to an underestimation, if not total ignorance, of this game. Microsoft may have been short-sighted in allocating so little space to a title with that Japanese spark that the Xbox One line-up badly needs. On the other hand, the very fact of relying on the quality of the substance on the shiny and often empty form of marketing and hype represents a great way for Access Games to present itself to the public. Trait detectable as distinctive, on the other hand, also in Deadly Premonition, which convinced exclusively thanks to its own qualities, also fighting with the handicap of a technical aspect undoubtedly below the standards of the time. In short, the generation changes but the spirit of Swery and Access Games seems to remain intact and this is evident already in the first minutes of the game, right from the prologue that introduces the main characters and shows us a detective in crisis, a gigantic partner drowning in gargantuan breakfasts problems with his wife and a cat-woman, among other things. D4 is structured as a sort of television series, divided into episodes complete with an initial summary of the ~previous episodes~, giving a further scenographic cut to the game, which borrows various stylistic and narrative choices from cinema and TV. Within the initial package, available these days on Xbox Live, we therefore find the prologue and the first two chapters, which do not conclude the main story but can already provide an excellent impression on this particular title for Xbox One, albeit still rather limited (the package can easily be concluded by staying within the 5 hours of play, excluding various secondary cases). Recurring dreams and memories David Young was an up-and-coming detective on the Boston Police Narcotics Squad before his wife's murder shattered his life with a gunshot, taking away what he held most dear and leaving him with, in ironic retribution, the particular ability to relive moments of the past and modify their developments. ~Look for D~ are the last words that his dying wife whispers to him and from that day the new season of the protagonist starts, who retires from the police to become a private investigator and dedicate his life to the search for ~D~, in an attempt to understand the mystery behind his misfortune and, perhaps, avoid it altogether thanks to his new abilities. The problem is that David doesn't have complete control of his time travels, which can only be activated in contact with certain objects full of meaning called ~mementos~, which throw him into past situations not apparently related to his history but which carry behind them some hidden characteristics, such as the persistence of the letter ~D~, characters that recur in various episodes of David's life, the meeting with female figures who closely resemble the protagonist's wife and, in the background, a plot of events on a complicated police case linked to a powerful and mysterious drug. Put like this, it could seem like an adventure with an interesting story but also quite typical in the videogame field, which is also confirmed by a solid and structured adventure scaffolding on the canons of the genre. Except for the fact that Swery is essentially a madman. Thanks to this underlying madness, the story opens in a thousand bizarre rivulets, projecting David in the presence of abstruse situations and characters, always making the development of events unpredictable and pushing us to delve into each of the many folds of the story with genuine curiosity. In addition to the main case, in fact, numerous optional secondary cases are also opened through dialogues or objects. On the other hand, the typically Japanese affectation, as well as the strangeness driven to paroxysm in various situations, are counterbalanced by a constant self-irony that makes everything even more enjoyable, also underlined by an extremely eclectic soundtrack that goes from the imitation of acronyms from 80s TV series to metal, or from Japanese pop to the dreamlike and rarefied atmospheres of the aforementioned Lynch, thewhose influence also seems evident in D4, after the homages contained in Deadly Premonitions. Among cat-women, partners with formidable appetites, crazy stylists who converse with mannequins and gigantic omniscient men dressed as surgeons and armed with a knife and fork, the fauna of D4 ensures that interest in the story is kept high, should the oddities not be enough related to the events between time travel, paradoxes and psychotic hallucinations, and this only with regard to the three chapters contained in the first package, waiting to know the developments of the story with the next episodes. Swery is back on Xbox One, and since Deadly Premonitions he hasn't lost his touch An atypical adventure Access Games has also opted for various original solutions with regard to gameplay, inserting innovative elements into a canonical structure such as that of adventures and graphics and playing with the conventions of the genre to create a hybrid whose strangeness joins the bizarreness of the story. As in a typical adventure, we therefore find ourselves exploring environments by moving on guided paths and with the possibility of looking around us from various angles, interacting with various objects. By hovering the cursor over these sensitive objects and keeping it above it, it is possible to obtain synthetic descriptions of them or the protagonist's reflections on the matter, with an interesting solution that is well integrated into the game rhythm, appearing in some cases even during the cutscenes and opening the possibility of discovering additional information and fragments of history by discovering the most hidden sensitive points. Interactions with objects usually require some movements to be performed in the right way and at the right time, such as sorts of continuous ~micro-games~ which obviously take on particular relevance using Kinect, i.e. the control system originally conceived as the fulcrum of the game before inclusion of the controller as an alternative interface. Speaking of oddities, the developers' choice to introduce various vital parameters to keep under control for the protagonist, connected to a scoring system that allows you to buy in-game items and even compare yourself with other players in online leaderboards, may be questionable . Although this too could represent a sort of Swerya meta-game, almost a parody that inscribes the graphic adventure in a context of selection and competition that doesn't seem to make much sense, this has important consequences in the progression of the game. There is an energy bar that underlies every action performed: every single interaction with objects or characters determines a consumption of this vitality bar, thus requiring you to keep its level under control because once you reach zero you run into game over . To recharge it, it becomes necessary to find food or drink around the scenarios with a solution that, if on the one hand perhaps recalls the dawn of a certain vision of adventure as a constant vital challenge (some old Sierra productions come to mind in this regard), from The other contrasts with the desire to thoroughly explore a varied and multifaceted world like that of D4, even if on the other hand it favors the replayability of the various chapters by focusing each time on different aspects (main story or side quests). Conversely, each in-depth observation of sensitive objects, which (speaking of oddities) can be highlighted using a special vision power by the protagonist, or the conclusion of various secondary cases within the chapters, determines the earning of some credits which can be spent on the purchase of items capable of recharging vitality and vision, or even to be able to continue after a game over. For an adventure that has among its greatest merits the fact of capturing the player in its world and leading him to get lost among the digressions and hidden corners of the story, the continuous need to deal with an energy bar that scans the amount of shares available can only lead one to think of a contradiction. Xbox One goals D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die contains a large number of unlockable objectives (about eighty), on average of small size. Given the adventure-style structure they are mainly located throughout the story, therefore continuing in the game it is inevitable to run into a large number of achievements, both in the progression of the main case and in the solution of the secondary ones. Given the particular system of scores and parameters present, however, various objectives can also be reached by carrying out particular performances, and from this point of view the possibility of rigging becomes of particular interestPlay the episodes multiple times. Gestures and glance The control system upon which D4 was initially built is the Kinect, and this is visible in many aspects of the game. The motion control requires you to use your hands to move the cursor on the screen and interact with objects and characters, but also to make the character move along the pre-established path and move the camera, but it is in the mini-game style sections that it becomes clear the influence that the peripheral has had in the development, with constant requests for actions to perform the various movements that can seem strange using the controller. We therefore find ourselves simulating the opening of doors, leafing through notebooks and activating switches, but also taking part in ~stunt~ sections in full quick time event style in the most agitated situations, with even rather long action scenes that require various movements to be carried out correctly within short periods of time, with an increasing degree of synchronization based on how reactive we have been to face the proposed situations. What appear to be simple and redundant QTEs using the controller take on a decidedly more fun and playful aspect using Kinect, and this is where the major difference between the two systems emerges. However, even in this case it must be noted that the use of the Xbox One peripheral does not actually lead to that significant leap in quality in the playful experience which is now increasingly difficult to find in the use of the Microsoft motion controller, with the positive aspect given by the fact that D4 is perfectly enjoyable even by those who bought the console without Kinect. There's a remarkable consistency to Access Games' graphical style, however, which closely resembles the strange mix of live footage and CG in Linklater's 'A Scanner Darkly'. The use of cel-shading has made it possible to build characteristic characters and settings which, while essentially based on a basic realism, can still deviate from it thanks to the abstract graphic novel veil that covers everything, avoiding the possible awkwardness of photo-realism and favoring the visionary and dreamlike transitions with which D4 is stuffed. In this way, even the search for typically cinematographic or television serial forms and styles does not result in a mere imitation, but rather in a borrowing of languages from other media to create a particular hybrid. Technically it doesn't have any proper ~next-gen~ features, but Access Games' maturation is evident in the choice of the new style.", "date": "2014-09-23", "grade": "8.0"}
