{"name": "Block Runner", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/block-runner.html", "text": "The puzzle game genre is generally ~static~, with the player having to solve the stages by fitting bricks or matching colored spheres. However, there are variants that introduce a little action, as Zed demonstrates with his latest production: Block Runner. Also available in a 3D version for handhelds and smartphones, this particular title sees us control a sentient robot as it wanders around levels made up exclusively of colored blocks: the character runs on these blocks, changing their structure and position ~on the fly~ ~ to always have something under your feet and not fall into the void. The goal, as in all puzzle games, is to ~solve~ each stage to move on to the next one, and in Block Runner this means reaching the space gates that delimit the level's exit and open the doors to the next one. challenge. All this is repeated for four rather large areas, each divided into a variable number of routes. From the start screen it is possible to select the desired game mode among those available (~arcade~, ~survival~ and ~challenge~), then launch directly into the action. During the first stages we will be able to activate a tutorial that will explain to us almost at every step what to do to move the blocks and build the path, what value the various objects have, which traps we must avoid and how we must behave if we need to make a jump. The control system is simple, even if the isometric view requires a little practice to gain confidence: by acting on the d-pad in the four main directions, we will be able to move the block we are running on until it connects with another adjacent block . Our robot will continue to run undaunted, so we will have to move very quickly to avoid dropping it into the abyss. Let's also say that the depth and difficulty of Block Runner are based precisely on these elements: as we progress through the stages, we will find ourselves facing increasingly intricate and complex scenarios, with various devices to make things more difficult for us, but we will still have to succeed to put together a route in a few moments. During each ~race~ we will be able to set records based on the number of coins that we will be able to collect, as well as the ~multipliers~ that we will activate along the way. At a certain point, then, we will even be able to rotate the entire level by taking advantage of certain devices, going through it in reverse until we manage to reach its exit. The technical implementation of the game is decent, but lacks style and fluidity. The character has a rather jerky animation and an anonymous appearance, while the stages are well colored but decidedly bare and repetitive. The rotation effect of the blocks is not beautiful to see, and unfortunately there is a general feeling of ~heaviness~ that ends up afflicting the gameplay as well: the response to inputs is not as fast as it should be, and for such a game this is quite an inconvenience. Finally, the sound is mediocre. PRO Interesting basic idea Good number of internships Quite challenging... AGAINST ...but for the wrong reasons Technically not exciting Delay in response to commands", "date": "2009-02-19", "grade": "S.V."}
