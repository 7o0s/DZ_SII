We started with Star Wars, moved on to Indiana Jones and Batman, now even Harry Potter is on the way: a pure edition was just missing, a spin-off based on the infamous LEGO wars, the brick sets that we all loved as children, focused on the deeds of characteristic factions such as pirates, knights, soldiers. Unlike other games dedicated to LEGO, however, this LEGO Battles is not multiplatform: developed solely for Nintendo DS, it also differs in form and concept from the LEGO-games we are used to, proposing itself as a new attempt to push the franchise into our playrooms, starting with a younger audience. Strategy and bricks LEGO Battles is a real-time strategy game (or RTS) and needless to say the player controls a small army of LEGOs in the abundant seventy or so missions that make up the story mode: we start with the medieval series of LEGO and proceed gradually through the series of pirates, space and more. The first approach with LEGO Battles is no longer happy since the first missions are nothing more than long tutorials that explain exactly every possible operation in the game: if already at that point LEGO Battles seems like a simple, almost guided title, this is confirmed suspicion arrives already completing the first ten missions. The structure is typical of the genre, but extremely simplified: the player associates LEGO bricks to create little beings who will work to build buildings, which are in turn essential for obtaining the resources necessary to produce weapons and war utensils. Once you have expanded your army, you proceed to carry out the mission on duty, often focused on a clash between our forces and those of the enemy, on the recovery of some object or on the construction of something. It is a tested system that has always characterized the RTS and that LEGO Battles offers in a simple and clear way, thanks also to the intuitive touch-screen controls and quick-to-navigate menus: the result is therefore a game suitable above all for the little ones, a sort of a decidedly simple and childish starting point for getting to know this genre, as demonstrated by the repetitiveness of the objectives of each mission. Variety and sympathy It is a pity that the irresistible charm of LEGO hides a product so aimed at children: the video games of the LEGO series have never shone for difficulty or complexity but in this case the challenge proposed is truly laughable, also thanks to an Artificial Intelligence rather incomplete, both as regards the enemies and ours same units (which often tend to interrupt their tasks, requiring new orders, or to get stuck in the elements of the map while proceeding towards the indicated objective). Fortunately, the sympathy of the brand has remained intact and this game also offers a mix of hilarious cutscenes that carry on the bizarre plot from mission to mission; the sprites, while not shining for detail or animations, accurately reproduce the miniatures with which most of us will have played years ago, and for a nostalgic the various stages are small dives into the past, accompanied by a strange sound accompaniment to say the least, of high quality, at times decidedly triumphal and epic. As usual, a ton of extras balances the simplicity of the product, also expanding the variety of a local multiplayer mode that allows you to challenge another player by mixing the LEGO creatures of the various sets in the same army: in this case, the intelligence of a human opponent, much more competitive than virtual opponents.", "date": "2009-07-28", "grade": "6.0"}
