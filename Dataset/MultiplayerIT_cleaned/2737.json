In fact, we are faced with a collage of scenes designed for virtual reality that connect to mark the six long missions of a full-bodied campaign, a real kaleidoscope of sequences set in the Second World War whose existence was surprisingly revealed shortly before the launch of a title that we thought was focused on the multiplayer component. This is present, with five modes alongside a survival mode, and represents a sensible part of the package, but it is the classic old-fashioned first-person shooter appendage, faithful to the typical Medal of Honor offering of the past. A colossal VR In the first minutes of the game, a small dramatic preamble follows one another, a medical examination which is used to calibrate the controls and a tutorial, complete with a shooting range, which allows us to take measures with a gameplay inevitably declined to the mechanics of virtual reality, although to the bone faithful to the canons of first person shooters. You shoot, go into cover and reload, but in this case you kneel, load the shot into the barrel, dodge the shots and physically lean out of the corners, without going through the appropriate buttons. In addition, there are countless scenes that aim to exploit virtual reality to the bone between cannons, climbing, puzzles and clues to find. What comes first, however, is the graphics of a title that immediately makes it clear how even in virtual reality the weight of the money of a publisher like EA and the skill of a developer like Respawn are felt. The glance is certainly not that of a Battlefield, despite the use of the Frostbite Engine 2, but once the viewer is worn, the quality is much higher than that of the screenshots and must be weighed from the point of view of virtual reality, where every the object is a stone's throw from the nose and where the attention to materials and furnishings become vital, often offering interiors and city views created with surprising care. However, not everything is at the same level. As anticipated, the campaign is a set of segments that are often characterized by different dynamics, which is positive, and by a decidedly fluctuating technical quality, which is negative, despite the recommended requirements that even require a GeForce RTX 2080. Furthermore, the pace sometimes suffers from the countless filler skits, often too short and not always adequately connected to each other. But there are also long shootings, exploration and moments of pure 360-degree enjoyment including perfectly recreated fragments of France in the 40s and choral dialogues that project us into the middle of That Dirty Dozen thanks also to the excellent soundtrack and the valid dubbing in English. But the bare backdrops and some sparing textures also stand out, more evident in the scenes in which the horizon is particularly wide. Luckily, there are also more spectacular scenarios, albeit always marked by more or less obvious compromises. During a battle between tanks, for example, the detail gives way to vehicles, smoke and explosions while in the middle of Omaha Beach, homage to the memorable Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, the savings concern the number of soldiers nearby and the effective area of game. But on the other hand the show is remarkable among huge explosions, columns of smoke, bloodied bodies, MG42 spewing lead on the beach and reflections on the puddles of water that frame one of the most iconic and dramatic moments of the entire Second World War. Also exciting is the sequence on the train which alone is already worth part of the ticket despite the interpenetrations, the objects flying through the windows and the low-resolution mountains flowing in the background. But we didn't pay too much attention as we crossed a series of perfectly furnished carriages full of Germans intent on resting or distracting themselves, some eliminated by opening the sliding door a few centimeters, inserting the barrel of a machine gun into the small space and unleashing hell. Going along the kitchen car, we ran out of shots, but we grabbed a cleaver and annoyed the cook before he grabbed the rifle. Instead, we took it along with a helmet that we put on our heads while enjoying one of the moments in the game that best combines the involvement and interaction of virtual reality with fluid first-person shooter gameplay. All seasoned with a good yield of materials and furnishings that include collectibles, high-resolution photos, modelsdetailed and particular in quantity. And it is something that also characterizes ships, enemy bases, offices, libraries and so on. But there are always trade-offs. Compromises Everything we've talked about is just a portion of a title that includes ship trips at night, sequences aboard planes, the famous Nazi rail cannon and fights in vineyards with enemies sprouting from all sides. There really is everything, from the Normandy landing to the heart of the Nazi war industry, complete with 4D cinema moments with planes flying overhead, accidents, motorcycle sequences and so on. Right here, where interactivity shines, the technical component often slips towards qualitative levels that are anything but excellent, with notable downward peaks that include animations, both facial and corporal, and the models themselves. From perfect choral scenes and engaging dialogues, where even the faces and facial expressions improve drastically, we move on to plastered movements and approximate animations, undoubtedly also due to the need to speed up the work in the face of a perhaps too onerous commitment, even for a massive and experienced team. In any case, however justifiable, the flaws are seen and include imaginative physics, sometimes funny but far from realistic, as well as side effects such as our body ending up in the middle of the view in scenes where we are immobilized, with lots of of decapitated bust on display. Also worth mentioning is the curious artificial intelligence of the companions who, important in giving a choral dimension to the action, go from being very useful to becoming puppets often not even effective in distracting enemies. This is without mentioning the slowdowns, partly linked to presumably fixable glitches, and the collapses of definition linked to dynamic resolution. The problems have decreased with the latest patches, but they are still there as well as some scenes made approximately, among other things largely concentrated during the fourth mission which between stealth, climbing and particular situations challenges several times, without winning , the limits of VR. And it's a shame given that the mission itself includes some of the most dramatic and engaging moments, leaving us dumbfounded in the face of qualitative ups and downs that in some situations become difficult to digest. Yet there is always something that surprises positively and intervenes to save a title that would still need a lot of refinement but still has a lot to say, from the top of the over 170 GB weight. In fact, when everything works, well-dubbed dialogues, entr'actes and graphic effects, all effective with the exception of the blood, give us an intense experience, among other things enriched by unlockables that include costumes for multiplayer and, very interestingly, interviews, photos with 360-degree effect and video panoramas that form, mission after mission, an interesting documentary on the Second World War. Gameplay With Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond we preferred to start from the staging that has enormous weight in virtual reality. But in the Respawn title you shoot a lot and shoot pretty well. The aiming works, the arsenal includes practically all WWII weapons, there are three types of grenades and even sniper rifles, although looking at the lens in a virtual title is akin to torture. Everything, however, enjoys good feedback, both visual and auditory, magnified by the vibration of the controllers and by fanciful details such as the fact that enemy grenades can be caught on the fly and the speed of movement is reduced when we crouch, obviously in the mode of normal game and not in that from a position. Then there are cannons, turrets and emplacement machine guns which in some cases allow us to aim simply by moving the view, which is quite functional, but are all too easy to maneuver. The difficulty, however, is not particularly high. Enemies have decent aim, becoming lethal when high ranked, but are vulnerable when reloading and can be fooled quite easily. Furthermore, the treatments are generally abundant, at least in normal mode, and the opponents almost always appear in the same points, making things much easier on the second attempt. Let's be clear, a little practice is needed, but the difficulty curve of the campaign is calibrated very well and leads us by the hand to improve in the coordination between movement via stick and excited action. For the rest it's a matter of luck and tolerance of glitches and the system of interaction with objects and equipment, deliberately coarseor. The possibility of picking up objects at a great distance facilitates the change of weapon, making the action more spectacular, but produces irritating side effects such as grabbing a grenade instead of a cure, finding it in your hand with the tab already torn off. Laughable, at least at first. Less fun in the middle of a frantic fight, perhaps in multiplayer. But if nothing else in all this we have almost never suffered from dizziness or fatigue, at least in single player mode. Multiplayer, on the other hand, is more challenging, even when seated. The games, however, are fast. No complicated options but the classic first person shooter setting with five matches including deathmatches, team deathmatches, a mode where everyone can defuse and defuse bombs in a continuous explosive chase, the classic domination and a King of the Hill enriched by explosions extras that make everything more exciting. All multiplayer modes are designed for short and intense games for a sector that does not represent the bulk of the experience, contrary to what was imagined. But it does not lack a certain care, from the quality of the maps, which use some of the best single player assets by making us play in suggestive places such as a French village and a train accident, up to the implementation of bots that allow you to play even solo. But perhaps for this reason the survival mode is more suitable, yet another content of a complete package, although largely supported by the shaky but sumptuous campaign, capable of condensing a large part of the war imagery of the Second World War and of the possible implementations of virtual reality in one long ride through the conflict that changed the world. All topped off obviously by the classic options to reduce fatigue, including the choice of the dominant hand and the tunneling effect to mitigate any vertigo, and by a visual interface which, however, we recommend deactivating, even in the case of subtitles unless have no understanding of English, to enjoy full immersion in the scene.", "date": "2020-12-11", "grade": "7.5"}
