{"name": "Guitar Hero: Aerosmith - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-aerosmith-recensione.html", "text": "Never change a winning team The game structure is almost unchanged compared to Guitar Hero III: whether you play it via the guitar-shaped controller (highly recommended option) or with the simple pad, you will be required to have great dexterity and a strong sense of rhythm, above all at higher difficulty levels. The game is in fact made up of 4 skill levels: Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert. By increasing the difficulty, not only the notes will increase, but also the usable keys. In fact, if in Easy you will be called upon to press only 3 keys, in Hard you will have to practice with all 5 keys available, while in Expert the notes on the screen will rise exponentially, effectively leading the player to play every single note of the song. No innovation even on the modality front: the workhorse of the single player will be the Career, which will make you relive the over thirty years of the band, from the beginnings in a squalid high school in Kansas, to the triumphant tours around the world. Each stage will be interspersed with original interviews with the members of the group, who will tell curious anecdotes that can be used thanks to accurate subtitling in Italian. As per tradition, there will be a Store full of new guitars, clothes and, above all, songs, among which the wonderful ~Walk this Way~ stands out. However, the heart of the game will be, as always, in the constant search for one's record, obtainable in ~Quick Game~ mode only thanks to a lot of training, and absolute dedication; in fact, although a certain permissiveness is present serious; given the fairly dilated times for the execution of the notes, mastering the songs at the highest difficulty levels will prove to be an extremely challenging mission even for the most expert players. Helping every experienced Jimi Hendrix is the Tutorial, which in addition to teaching you the tricks of the trade, allows you to perform the most complicated passages in slow motion, favoring the correct memorization of the movement on the pad. As far as multiplayer is concerned, it will be possible to undertake the Career together with a friend, both locally and online, taking turns playing the role of bassist or first guitar, or challenge guitarists scattered around the world with solos and distortions. What is disappointing is Neversoft's decision not to offer additional tracks in the future: given the full price of the title, at least compatibility with songs downloadable via Guitar Hero III would have been desirable. Rag Doll livin' in a movie... In this genre of games, the difference is obviously made by the tracklist. That of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is undoubtedly very good, especially if you are a fan of the Boston band, but it is also true that it has some rather inexplicable anomalies. The first is represented by the absence of ~I Don't Want To Miss A Thing~, perhaps the most commercial Aerosmith song, made famous by the film Armageddon. Even more serious, in our opinion, the presence in the Career mode of the version of ~Walk This Way~ in collaboration with the rapper RUN DMC. The original version would have been immensely more appreciated, relegated instead to the simple role of bonus track to be purchased in the Store. The 25 Aerosmith songs are joined by a dozen songs by artists who have more or less openly been influenced by their Hard Rock (among these we mention the Kinks, the Clash, up to the contemporary Lenny Kravit), and 4 pieces by Joe Perry solo, for a total of 41 tracks.

In fact, all the a's could turn up their noses in front of a good, but not excellent tracklist, and the impossibility of downloading new songs despite the full price with which the game was presented on the shelves. Anyone approaching the saga for the first time is therefore invited to grab Guitar Hero III, immensely more varied and complete, or to wait for the next World Tour, in which you can form a real group as already happens in Rock Band. Pros Interesting video documents Proven playability Aerosmith fans will love it... Cons ...others might get bored Tracklist not expandable with new downloads Full price may not be a bargain", "date": "2008-07-10", "grade": null}
