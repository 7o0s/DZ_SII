This is precisely the underlying principle of Mind Your Language: Learn Japanese!, where learning is made more enjoyable thanks to a series of simple and intuitive mini-games. Several traditional pastimes will be able to accompany the player through the various components of the Japanese language: to add a series of adjectives to the personal lyricist it will therefore be necessary to try his hand at the ~hopscotch~, a classic game played by anyone in his youth, while to learn the conjunctions the character will have to catch some companions in a sort of ~cops and robbers~. In this path the player is always accompanied by his friends from the studio, with whom he can interact and get great advice on how to live his experience or even just some instructions to move around in the mini-games offered. However, not all lessons are learned at school. Often it is necessary to carefully explore the different environments present in the game: the classrooms, the library, the courtyard, the garden. By searching in the most unthinkable places, it is thus possible to find secret words, which only the most curious will be worthy of finding! A little help: by shaking some wastebaskets scattered here and there, the player could bring to light the numbers from 1 to 10... It's time for exams There is no school without exams and this one is no exception! To check your progress and advance in your study, there are a series of barrier tests between the various courses. Adhering to reality, they present a passing threshold and a mixed mode of questions (for example, a quiz part and a sentence completion part). To access it, it is also necessary to have collected a minimum number of words in your lyricist, which is indicated during the individual mini-games. But be careful, it is forbidden to get caught up in the classic pre-exam panic: in case of failure, in fact, the player loses nothing, while if he is successful, the reward is greedy, a password with which to unlock a new area of the school, a new course and new mini-games! Not everything is entrusted to the player's memory, but rather many tools are provided to help the student during the lessons. A personal lyricist records all the vocabulary collected, allowing it to be viewed at any time. Consultation is simple (a small directory, where each bookmark indicates the page of names, adjectives, etc.) and allows you to view the words in different forms: Japanese language, ideograms, translation and speaker, to hear their correct pronunciation. Another indispensable tool is undoubtedly the dictionary, which allows searching through a truly vast database and the possibility of annotating information by writing on the notebook. The era of loose leaflets is truly over. Mind Your Language: Japanese is an excellent tool for approaching the new language, but it certainly can't be the only one, especially for such a complex language such as Japanese. The main objective of the game is to approach the language starting from the principle of enriching one's own dictionary: therefore, a large part of the path is based on the collection of different categories of words; in this framework, the grammar rules are left in the background. This is why it would seem that the game is more suitable for those who already have a knowledge, even a basic one, of the language presented, almost as a sort of review, or for those who encounter it for the first time but intend to use it as a springboard for studies more detailed individual.", "date": "2009-07-24", "grade": null}
