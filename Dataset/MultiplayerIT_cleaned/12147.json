{"name": "Ankh: Il Cuore di Osiride - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ankh-il-cuore-di-osiride-recensione.html", "text": "A few too many problems Ankh  The Heart of Osiris, sports an entirely 3D game engine both as regards the scenarios (some of which are recycled from the first chapter) and for the characters. On the test PC, the game runs at maximum detail and the right configuration for your computer is automatically set from the first start. Outside of this, the graphics system is quite scalable, as well as much more fluid than the previous episode. The management of the camera is good even if in some situations it happens that you are not able to immediately perform the desired action, but it is a detail. The characters, as well as being well modeled, show a remarkable personality, highlighted by well-made dialogues, capable on more than one occasion of eliciting a few smiles due to the large number of quotes and references present. On the other hand, the quality of the speech fluctuates, all in English, but perfectly subtitled in our language. A few small notes must be made for some dialogues, where the characters look from a completely different direction than Assil. The final version used for the test - v1.01 ITA - has several bugs related to StarForce protection and others due to the game configuration. One above all and rather serious, concerns the inventory, given that, on some PCs, saving the game, exiting the game and re-entering it again, as if by magic, any object collected up to that moment disappears, making it virtually impossible to continue the adventure . In this regard, some gamers have kept the PC on even at night to be able to complete the title anyway. Let's at least hope for a fix patch that puts an end to this kind of problem.

Some innovation on the game scheme would not be amiss, but the formula works and that's what matters. The technical sector is also excellent, without forgetting the too many bugs still present in the version already in the shops and which to date the developers seem unwilling (or unable) to remedy. Pros Great plot and setting Well-defined characters Classic game structure Cons No summary of the previous episode Maybe a little too short (8 hours) Too many bugs Innovations? The gameplay is that of classic adventures, with the mouse used to examine, collect and interact with the elements of the scenario. In addition, by pressing the X key, asterisks will appear on the screen that will indicate all the elements present in the game world, which is very useful in the less illuminated sections or with many objects. There is no shortage of classic puzzles and riddles to solve, some of which are of rather high difficulty. Also noteworthy is the presence of the Disc of the Code, a cardboard accessory essential for preparing cocktails throughout history and which also proves to be an effective anti-piracy tool, in memories of the first LucasArts titles that exploited a similar system. Those who expect innovations related to the game scheme will perhaps be a little disappointed, given that we are facing a sequel from all points of view. The gameplay is in fact exactly the same as the first chapter, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, given that the story is fun and exciting anyway. The first episode of Ankh, released over a year ago, was not only a well-crafted adventure, but also a clear reference to the Monkey Island series, which has been lost for some time now. The title offered as a setting an ancient Egypt overflowing with humor, where mad architects, curses of ancient pharaohs and the inevitable modern technologies were the masters, with an end result much appreciated by adventurers. This second chapter entitled The Heart of Osiris created once again by Deck 13, picks up the threads of history exactly where they left off, that is with Assil - the protagonist - who after saving himself and the inhabitants of Cairo from a powerful curse , becomes the guardian of the Ankh, a very powerful artifact. Unfortunately, the party is destined to be short-lived, given that Assil wakes up the day after the celebrations without theAnkh on me. The game lacks a summary of the first episode, which would not have displeased those unfamiliar with the story, even if it takes a few minutes to understand the situation the protagonist is in. The characters with whom Assil will have to interact are really many and each of these is really well characterized, also thanks to stereotypes that are extreme to the max, such as for example the slaver who, no matter how hard he tries, cannot conceive of an honest job.", "date": "2007-07-04", "grade": null}
