{"name": "Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/makai-kingdom-chronicles-of-the-sacred-tome.html", "text": "Super Combos Makai Kingdom seems to be a bit of a summary of Nippon Ichi's experience: in fact, it draws inspiration from the previous SRPGs of the saga in almost every aspect, amalgamating its main features into solid and in some ways even more accessible gameplay. However, there is a substantial difference which, in a certain sense, separates Makai Kingdom from other Nippon Ichi productions: a feature of the latter has always been the possibility of increasing the level and statistics of the various units even excessively, repeating dungeon after dungeon to reach levels of experience never seen before, as well as the amount of damage that our heroes could inflict with a single blow (having a character at level 9999 that with one swing of the sword produces 400000 damage is definitely satisfying) ; in Makai Kingdom it is certainly possible to focus on the level-up and evolution of your characters, but it is much more difficult: the dungeons in which it is possible to ~grind~ must be created by spending the appropriate points and their difficulty will be balanced according to the character highest level in the party. This choice, although not very shared by fans of the series who might have objected to the limit imposed on their career as little Ashuras, is rather weighted: in Disgaea or Phantom Brave it was possible to forge incredibly powerful weapons (weapons in Makai Kingdom are not upgradeable) and entrust them to the deadliest warriors, to complete the game in a few hours, completing each story-driven mission with just a few attacks; imposing the aforementioned limits, however, in Makai Kingdom it is necessary to face the various battles with more strategy and reflection, often focusing on their design more than on the damage that our characters can do in the shortest possible time. Makai Kingdom seems to be a bit of a summary of Nippon Ichi's experience: in fact, it draws inspiration from the previous SRPGs of the saga in almost every aspect. Super Combos This takes us directly to the new Invite system, an evolution of the Confine System seen in Phantom Brave, which allows you to create new units from inanimate objects. However, the most interesting aspect is the fact that in Makai Kingdom it is also possible to build vehicles, expanding not only the offensive possibilities of the various units that drive them, but also of action and movement: you move more, you do more damage and, with good reasoning, it is even possible to attack multiple times in the same turn. The huge variety of machines - which mostly resemble Japanese ~mechs~ - that can be built and brought into battle greatly increases the strategic depth of Makai Kingdom, also considering that through them it is possible to raze the ~factories~ of opposing units , eliminating the enemy's resources and completing an equally grueling battle faster. However, Phantom Brave also inherited the absence of the ~grid~ which graphically illustrated the movement possibilities of a unit: greater freedom, therefore, but also imprecision in the positioning of a character or in aiming at an opponent, especially when it is necessary to select an area rather than a specific target. A not indifferent flaw, given that sometimes it can compromise the outcome of a fight, but which can still be overlooked, considering the overall care placed in the design of a gameplay that is certainly not innovative, compared to the aforementioned Disgaea and Phantom Brave, but of sure more considered and studied. What there is to improve We're just not there: the low-resolution 2D graphics in La Pucelle were understandable, in Disgaea acceptable, in Phantom Brave bearable, but now you just can't turn a blind eye. However cute, nice, ~kawaii~ etc etc, it still remains a solution of fairly animated pixelated two-dimensional sprites that move in spartan and not very detailed, even a little rough, three-dimensional environments. Okay, it's not the graphics that primarily interest us in a title like this, and Makai Kingdom may not have the graphical pretensions of a Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance map, but after three games that share the same graphical characteristics, perhaps it would be time for Nippon Ichi to perhaps increase the resolution of the sprites, which however sacrifices a character design that is once again sparkling, well-finished and very pleasant. Not to mention that the various graphic effects of the most devastating attacks, however exaggeratedly spectacular and cared for, clash with the pixelated characters who perform them. However, the sound side does not disappoint: once again it is possible to select the dubbing between Japanese and English, aware that the Yankee version is even superior to the Japanese one, thanks to a hilarious actingto and a perfectly fitting choice of voices. The music is pleasant, always spot on and never intrusive, but once again they maintain that style to which Nippon Ichi has already accustomed us starting from Disgaea and which, to tell the truth, is starting to tire a bit. Summary of the best features of the other episodes of the ideal saga created by Nippon Ichi, Makai Kingdom also shares with its predecessors those that we could now consider real defects: graphics that are now all too spartan and poor and a now recycled soundtrack. These are not elements that affect the overall thickness of the gameplay, as always at high levels, but in a 2005 that is now drawing to a close, considering what the PS2 can move, we can't overlook it anymore. Luckily, Makai Kingdom also delivers the same craziness and inspired humor as the series, thanks to a hilarious and entertaining storyline, and wacky characters full of personality. The ingenious Invite System, the presence of vehicles and the limit imposed on unbridled ~grinding~, aimed at guaranteeing a more balanced progression, make Makai Kingdom the best strategy created so far by Nippon Ichi, waiting for Disgaea 2 which, we hope , can also lift the technical sector from mediocrity. Pros Increasingly absurd and entertaining story and characters Polished and varied gameplay Excellent voice acting Cons Technically mediocre Inaccurate movement system Forget about six-figure damage Strategists rejoice: the new chapter of the Makai saga designed by Nippon Ichi has finally hit the shelves. The series, born years ago on PSX with the funny RPG Rhapsody, continued on PlayStation 2 with La Pucelle Tactics, Disgaea and Phantom Brave: it's not a real ~saga~ since the various games share only a few quotes, but it is so that it is preferred to define it, given the similarities between them, from both the audiovisual and gameplay point of view. Being part of that group of RPG-strategics where the fundamental level-up and a complex and not immediately masterable mechanics are the salient ingredients, the Nippon Ichi productions have always stood out not only for the somewhat spartan realization and the ~excessive~ numbers , but also for the crazy and humorous plots. Anyone remembers with pleasure the absurd plot of Disgaea, the musical that often became Rhapsody, the wacky protagonists of La Pucelle, and also in Phantom Brave, with a more dramatic and serious plot, there were dense strokes of comedy; in Makai Kingdom, Nippon Ichi instead preferred the humor that was more hidden in Phantom Brave, churning out a bizarre story populated by funny characters, starting with the protagonist, Lord Zetta, lord of the universe, who finds himself facing the prediction of the oracle Pram: his reign will end because of an ancient magical book. To prevent the collapse of his empire, Zetta sets out in search of the book, but once he finds it, things don't go as planned and the universe ends up seriously destroyed: to survive, Zetta seals his soul in the book and at this point it will begin the adventure.", "date": "2005-12-27", "grade": null}
