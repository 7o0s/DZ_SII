Environmental struggles have existed for some time, with a constant growth value from the second post-war period to the present day. Such an important topic often leads to some sort of commercial exploitation by the world of communication, especially in the entertainment subset, but there are (fortunately) many examples in which the desire to underline problems and crises far outweighs the economic return . This is the case of the debut title of Herobeat Studios, strongly involved in the fight against the intensive exploitation of the natural environment by man. Let's see if they have hit the mark in this review of Endling: Extinction is Forever. The hand of man Endling: A story that begins in flames Endling is a narrative-driven adventure starring a fox. The game opens with a daring escape through a burning forest due to some shady figures armed with flamethrowers. Having escaped from danger, the fox finds shelter and gives birth to four puppies. These (individually customizable by the player) will be the fulcrum of the game, given that our task will be, at first, to procure food and then teach them to get by on their own within this incredibly hostile world. In fact, the world is populated by predators of all kinds, from owls to the most fearsome and dangerous men. These, including hunters, vagabonds, jackals and desperate people, are unscrupulous and obstinate in exploiting everything they have available, so much so that part of the game revolves around the search for a kidnapped puppy, taken from our lair. The most striking thing about this narrative is that there seems to be no redemption, much less hope. We don't want to anticipate anything, but the story, while deeply striking for its genuineness and sweetness, presents a desolate and gloomy soul, black as pitch, where the hand of man is the one that lowers the ax with a mechanical, pounding rhythm , tirelessly. Being a fox Endling: life as a fox If the narration is the main fulcrum of the game, functional to the achievement of the ultimate goal (to sensitize the sleepwalking public with a loud slap), the gameplay proves to be even more amazing, in its small way. The game is not linear, but not too ~open~ either. Basically, we have the ability to move horizontally within a very layered three-dimensional map, full of crossroads, raised floors and so on. However, the time available to us is limited. Indeed, it is necessary to find food for the litter and, at the same time, explore the environment before the sun rises, since foxes in the wild are mostly active during the night hours. Every night, the landscape around us changes, often drastically . Lush forests quickly become endless expanses of stumps; where once there was fresh food, soon there is only rubbish to rummage through (at the risk of getting caught in some filthy bag). In short, we are witnessing the destruction of an ecosystem at an unthinkable, but perhaps not improbable, pace. Endling: The world is full of dangers Interactions with the environment are limited to overcoming more or less high obstacles (including traps), pampering one's own young (perhaps to calm them down after an attack by some nocturnal birds of prey), collecting food (which can vary from hunted prey to man-made products and related waste) and sniffing odors (some related to one's missing puppy, others leading in the direction of possible meals). All these actions seem simple in themselves, but have some subtleties that make them intriguing enough. For example, you have to crouch down and proceed slowly before hunting a possible prey, otherwise it will escape, as it is also possible to quickly steal food from under the eyes of possible criminals and then slip away and deliver it to the young only once it is safe. Endling: our nose is able to lead us to different goals Just the puppies prove to be fundamental both on a narrative and a playful level. Given their veiled protagonism, their experiences with the world around them are fundamental, so much so that it is the latter who develop the skills and not the character controlled by the player. In fact, everyone has the possibility of acquiring specific characteristics, such as knowing how to climb or being able to hunt some small prey or, again, having the possibility of slipping into narrow spaces. In short, the game has much more depth than it shows to a fastlook, considering that it is completed in a couple of hours abundant. Visual quintessence Endling: In its simplicity, it's a visually spectacular game Endling, in addition to having an excellent storytelling and a gameplay that knows how to surprise, is also visually appealing. Of all of them, probably, the technical sector is the one that convinces the most, given that the game is told mainly on an audiovisual level, with well-calibrated shots and highly suggestive glimpses. The graphic style, despite being extremely simple and basic, manages to give an amazing glance, very layered, clean and detailed. Some animations are a bit woody, but overall it is still a fulminant experience, both for the eyes as for the ears, given that the sound sector also contributes largely to building the melancholic atmosphere that cloaks the entire work of HeroBeat Studio.", "date": "2022-07-23", "grade": "9.0"}
