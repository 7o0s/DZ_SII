{"name": "The Moon Project", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-moon-project.html", "text": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war A real-time strategy game without wars and conflicts is hardly conceivable, and in fact, even on this occasion, the indispensable dose of destruction is not missing. It is the year 2150; the main nucleuses of power are made up of the Eurasian Dynasty, the United States of Civilization (SCU) and the Lunar Corporation, which have long been involved in a conflict of planetary proportions. As usual, it will be our concern to take the side of one of these three factions, making our fundamental contribution to the successful completion of the campaign. The interesting thing is to observe how the approach itself to the war is different for each of the three races, and in particular we will have a Lunar Corporation fighting for its survival which suffers the invasion by the SCU exploiters, while the Eurasian Dynasty has a whole aria on the militaristic andante, with the obsession of conquering the world and resolutions of this kind. This is also reflected in the game itself, as in the briefing of each mission you can be addressed (in Italian, the game is entirely localized) by a rigid commander who leaves you the only options to win or die, rather than a loving mother, concerned for the heroic son embroiled in such a conflict. In short, from the point of view of the atmosphere, a good job has been done, although the setting is not exactly the maximum of originality. Let's talk about gameplay From the first game it is impossible to ignore a certain feeling of deja-vu... and the impression of being in front of a C&C clone grows alarmingly as you progress through the tutorial. Fortunately, the final picture is not that flat, but in any case it certainly cannot be said that The Moon Project is a very innovative RTS. It is essentially a hybrid that collects peculiar characteristics from the ~classic~ RTS strands (Westwood and Blizzard) and amalgamates them with some slightly more recent intuitions, serving them together with a fairly conventional 3D engine. We will therefore have to support the classic phase of exploring the map, searching for mineral resources and proceeding to build the buildings necessary for the expansion of our base, without forgetting the production of troops and defensive structures, in order to be prepared for a possible attack by the enemy. Bored? Let's see what else TMP has to offer beyond this proven plot. First of all, a decent scientific research system has been implemented, which will yield a large number of technological advances, as you invest the proceeds obtained from the extraction activity in it. Furthermore, every single unit in the game can be re-designed and customized, modifying its armament, defensive capacity and equipment, in order to always have the most efficient combinations available under the circumstances. The artificial intelligence of the units themselves also pleasantly surprised me, since, if at first glance they appear indistinguishable from the brain-damaged troops that drove us crazy in past titles, you will realize that deep down they are not so stupid. For example, if a group of tanks will be engaged in a battle that it is unable to win (for example due to overwhelming numerical superiority) instead of sacrificing itself in vain it will beat a retreat, seeking shelter from natural obstacles, or heading towards the well-defended walls of our base. It is true that these are small details, but it is precisely the details that make the difference. Another interesting detail is the possibility of playing on two different levels at the same time, i.e. the surface (where the bases are also located), and the tunnels that wind underground, which in many missions will play a significant strategic role instead of infiltration of troops or to the rapid movement of the same. And speaking of missions, the originality of some of them deserves applause, which deviate from the now sterile formula ~build the base-launch the rush-destroy the enemy~. For example, in one of the first missions of the Lunar Corporation, we will have to make a clean sweep of the enemy excavator vehicles, which infest one of our sectors, and to do this we will only have a few dropships, which when properly maneuvered, will be able to grab and lift the vehicles into the air. At this point, instead of landing and letting them go, we will be able to drop them from above, perhaps onto a similar one of them, in order to kill two birds with one stone, in a riot of explosions and colored lights. The somewhat retro setting of the game still allows a serene approach even to those who have not had RTS for a few years. For example the management of the camera is very simplified, devoid ofll complicated evolutions and zooms that were indispensable in Ground Control, since the possibility of zooming is so reduced as to be almost useless and in addition only the rotation of the view has been implemented, by virtue of the 3D engine. The hard law of the polygon The graphics of The Moon Project certainly don't make you cry out for a miracle, and more than once I've turned up my nose at some overly stylized texture, but all in all I have to admit that it does its job well, being quite effective even in situations of overcrowding of the screen. To be picky, I wasn't fully satisfied with the architecture of the buildings, which are all too similar and uniformly coloured, which prevents us from identifying a structure at first glance, especially if we didn't build it, but it was already present on the map. The latter are well made, with very suggestive depressions and canyons, especially on lunar landscapes. Another detail that pleasantly impressed me are the explosions, definitely satisfying, also thanks to the almost cinematic effect obtained by making them expand in slow motion, with flaming fragments flying all around. By the way, the wreckage of the downed vehicles and the same rubble of the destroyed bases remain realistically visible on the ground for the rest of the mission. The summary screens that appear at the end of the missions deserve an earful. It's not like they're similar to Starcraft, they're absolutely identical. The same graphic solutions, the same organization of the drop-down menus, in short, the same everything. Oh well I give up understanding. On the contrary, the interface of the actual game is decidedly more original, even if not exactly a joy for the eyes, since they are bare solid-colored menus. More than anything I found them terribly cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. Probably a matter of habit, or maybe you went too far in looking for something new, in a sea of interfaces that are all the same. Summing up The Moon Project remains an excellent strategy, despite being completely devoid of originality, and I recommend it to those who are hungry for this kind of game and perhaps, after years of Starcraft, want to switch to 3D in a non-traumatic way. However, the competition in this sector is ruthless, and to be honest, if I really had to choose between TMP and some other recent productions, such as Z2 - Steel Soldiers, I would definitely opt for the latter, by virtue of a very simple observation: it's more fun . The mother of strategists is always pregnant... Sometimes, when I'm immersed in my thoughts (thinking? me??), I find myself wondering which is the most followed (exploited) trend of the videogame panorama in recent years. I think it would be impossible to elect an absolute champion, but I believe that the real-time strategy category (or RTS, if you prefer), could be a good candidate, even though it is a genre born on PC that has never landed on consoles, a some timid exit from the ranks (C&C on Playstation). A lot of water has passed under the bridge since the days of Dune2 and the first Westwood masterpieces, and in the last two years we have witnessed the definitive consolidation of the 3D trend also for this genre, which together with RPGs has represented for years one of the bulwarks of the old duedd , tirelessly resisting the charm of the polygon. In any case, let's focus on The Moon Project, a really nice strategic one, which, as you will see, has more to do with the ~old school~ RTS, than with those of the new trends that belong to Ground Control, Homeworld and companions.", "date": "2001-07-17", "grade": null}
