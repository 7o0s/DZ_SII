Worms Revolution - which had absolutely nothing revolutionary about it - had been half a disappointment, and for a while made us think that the British developer had exhausted the verve that had distinguished him for almost twenty years. Worms Clan Wars, on the other hand, pleasantly surprised us, while not proposing anything really new but at the same time refreshing our memory of the best that the franchise can offer. Nonetheless, even Team 17 must have felt this moment of tiredness, and decided to take a break from Worms  but not before making its debut on next-gen consoles with Worms Battlegrounds. Are we happy with this decision or not? Worms Battlegrounds is a nice port but for the next gen debut of Team 17 we expected something more Playstation 4 trophies Worms: Battlegrounds offers about thirty Trophies that will not be very difficult to unlock. For some it will be enough to complete the story missions and Worms Ops, while for others it will be necessary to try a little harder, defeat many worms and fulfill special conditions in battle. The title misleading However, it must be premised that Worms Battlegrounds is not exactly anything new: it is in fact a simple port of Worms Clan Wars which was mysteriously changed its name at the launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The contents are the same, identical discussed in our previous review, which for convenience we will quickly review in the next few lines. The single player mode consists mainly of two sets of missions: twenty-five for the Story mode and ten for the Worms Ops mode. The latter practically serves as a tutorial and explains how to use the various weapons and abilities of the worms in timed stages. The story, on the other hand, is set entirely in a museum which is the backdrop to the various missions and is narrated by Katherine Parkinson, the Jen Barber of the television series IT Crowd: the actress lends her voice to an archaeologist, Tara Tinkle, who comments the various missions and narrates the development of the plot, a bizarre and specious fight against the bad guy of the moment, Crowley-Mesmer. The story missions are not particularly complex but at the same time offer a good variety of situations that explore all the dynamics, old and new, of this Worms Battlegrounds, and in particular the renewed physics of liquids that become de facto environmental weapons to use against enemies and from which to defend. The circle of the single player experience is closed by the canonical level editor, which needs no introduction. Online, on the other hand, you can face other players and form clans, a social component of Worms that we have not been able to fully explore but which, as in the PC counterpart, is certainly full of possibilities. It must be said, however, that the best Worms Battlegrounds gives it locally, with the possibility of playing up to four with the same joypad: simply swap the controller from turn to turn and elbow friends who, sitting next to us on the sofa in the living room, they just blew up our worms. Among other things, the DualShock 4 is an added value in itself, given that Team 17 has exploited its features: the little voices of the worms come out directly from the speaker, the Light Bar changes color depending on the health of the worm we are checking and you can swipe the touch pad to navigate the menus. In short, nothing transcendental, but they are certainly nice additions. That said, the news is over and Worms is played well or badly in the same way as always, not counting the features introduced by the latest iterations of the franchise, such as the classes of worms: they are four and each offer advantages and disadvantages. Soldiers are the balanced and handyman worms, the brutes are slow but very powerful, the explorers are agile and can see the contents of the boxes before opening them, the scientists can heal their companions. The player must therefore learn to master their abilities to understand how to make the most of them when facing enemies. The latter, in truth, have left us quite perplexed due to an even lower artificial intelligence, if possible, than the already discreet one seen in the PC version of a few months ago: apart from the fact that they take forever to decide what do, unequivocally breaking the rhythm of the game, often they manage to self-destruct by making a mistake ... or, absurdly, to hit us with millimeter precision from one end of the map to the other. This problem therefore prevents the planning of effective strategiesskills and to predict the enemy's moves, and we hope it can be fixed in the future, perhaps with a small patch.", "date": "2014-06-09", "grade": "8.0"}
