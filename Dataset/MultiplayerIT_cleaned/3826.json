{"name": "Etrian Odyssey Nexus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/etrian-odyssey-nexus-recensione.html", "text": "Etrian Odyssey Nexus is officially the latest iteration of the Atlus franchise to release for Nintendo 3DS. We still don't know how the new generation of Etrian Odyssey will continue the traditional feature that made the game so popular on the Nintendo handheld - also generating the two Persona-inspired spin-offs - and that is the ability to draw the map on the lower screen, considering that no other console currently offers this kind of hardware-level opportunity. In the meantime, however, we can enjoy a final chapter that mixes the best features that have followed one another in the series over the years, a kind of ~greatest hits~ that wants to greet fans with a love letter full of challenges and nostalgia. A story of adventurers The plot has never played a leading role in Etrian Odyssey - except for the Etrian Odyssey Untold spin-offs, developed also and above all on the narrative front - and Etrian Odyssey Nexus is no exception, using it only as a pretext to project ourselves into the heart of adventure. This time we find ourselves on the floating island of Lemuria, in the presence of Queen Persephone of the city of Maginia, who will instruct us to explore the surrounding ruins in search of a great treasure. Fans who have played previous episodes will recognize some characters such as Napier from Etrian Odyssey III, who runs the shop here, and other extras that serve the nostalgia factor. Everything in Etrian Odyssey Nexus is designed to evoke the memory of this or that episode, starting with the dungeons that we will have to explore and which recall the puzzles and peculiar mechanics seen in the past. In this sense, Etrian Odyssey Nexus is not exactly the most original title in the series, but its purpose is certainly not to innovate, but rather to continuously pay homage to the past in a more modern and complete package. The structure has in fact remained the same: the player, first of all, will have to form a first group of heroes by choosing their appearance from the various predefined illustrations and their classes. In Etrian Odyssey Nexus there are nineteen classes and all but one - the brand new Hero, capable of generating residual images of himself that guarantee various benefits to the group - have already appeared in previous episodes. Atlus has re-balanced stats and skills to ensure even veterans have a certain freshness in the composition of the team, but those who have already played the previous Etrian Odyssey will immediately feel at home and will appreciate the enormous variety of combinations granted especially once the possibility of unlocking assign a second class to each character. This new episode lacks the racial diversity introduced in Etrian Odyssey V, but Atlus has well thought of re-implementing Etrian Odyssey Untold 2's Force Boost, a mechanic that boosts characters after a certain number of fights - again random, but predictable thanks to a special indicator - and allows you to use a powerful special attack that changes from class to class. This means that some classes have been modernized with skills that they did not have in the past, so even those who have already spent hours and hours experimenting with strategies in previous Etrian Odyssey will find new synergies and combinations to try. The latest maps The world map of Etrian Odyssey Nexus is divided into nodes that identify the different mazes to explore, since the objective has remained the same: the player must scour the mazes in search of the stairs that lead to the next floor, overcoming more and more elaborate puzzles and defeating increasingly stronger enemies. The exploration takes place in first person on a map ideally divided into boxes. Stylus in hand, it is ideal to draw the map on the lower screen of the Nintendo 3DS, recording notes and notes thanks to a wide variety of icons to better detail the road traveled. Accuracy at this stage of the game can determine the success of the mission. The difficulty is already high at the default Basic level, although it is possible to set a really low one, called Picnic precisely, or two even more difficult ones, Expert and Heroic. Head down, you're going nowhere. It is essential to build a functional team, made up of synergistic classes, with dedicated healers and defenders. Etrian Odyssey Nexus, like its predecessors, is an RPG in which skills that inflict abnormal conditions on enemies have great importance, especially when facing FoE, an acronym that stands for Field on Enemy and identifies the strongest enemies and profitable. It is not easy to learn to consume resources sparingly or to choose the battles to fight, but every vittoria guarantees unique satisfaction, especially when taking down the most powerful bosses. Therefore, we often find ourselves exploring a bit of the map, solving the secondary missions - unfortunately quite trivial - that have been assigned to us in the city, to then return to the base, earn experience points and spend the accumulated money on new weapons and armor. On a technical level, there isn't much to say. Etrian Odyssey Nexus is a very colorful title that gives its best in dungeons, full of details and well designed, but it must be specified that the player will never see his characters in action. The clashes take place in the first person, in the old fashioned way, and even the effects of the skills and spells used can appear quite spartan. The enemies, on the other hand, are cared for and animated more than discreetly, although there is not a huge variety: most of them come directly from the previous chapters. On the musical front, the historical composer of the series, Yuzo Koshiro, returns with a rich repertoire of arrangements and remixes of the songs already heard in the old Etrian Odyssey.", "date": "2019-02-07", "grade": "8.0"}
