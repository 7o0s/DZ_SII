{"name": "Conarium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conarium-recensione.html", "text": "Video games and Lovecraftian themes have met countless times in recent years, now leading to the creation of very interesting works, now to the birth of much more forgettable titles; and even in this cold February 2019, a few months after the discreet Call of Cthulhu, we thus return once again to Howard Philips Lovecraft and his horror stories. Never as in this case is the reference to the cold useful: Conarium, the game of which we propose the review below, is set in Antarctica, the region of the Earth perpetually surrounded by ice. The title takes its inspiration from Lovecraft's novel In the Mountains of Madness, which in turn is set in the South Pole. And finally, we too felt a little cold in our bones, because the convincing aspects of the production (as you will soon read) are very few. Plot: the expedition among the ice Frank Gilman wakes up in the research base set up in Upuaut, Antarctica, with absolutely no memory of what has happened in the last few days. A snowstorm is raging outside, a strange device called a Conarium is connected to his wrist and above all, an even more distressing detail, there is not a soul around. After recovering and having made up his mind as much as possible, he then sets out in search of the other three members of the expedition, trying to understand what happened in the base while he was passed out. What we have just described to you are the initial minutes of Conarium, and we will carefully avoid going into detail or analyzing subsequent events, because otherwise you would perhaps miss the only truly valid element that pushes you to continue the adventure for about three hours of duration: of course we speak of the plot of the game. If one aspect of Conarium deserves to be mentioned as positive it is the narration: not so much for the few twists and turns it presents and not even for any relevant crossroads (except for the multiple endings), but for its ability to transport the atmospheres and climate of perpetual suspension of Lovecraft's novel; a task that is anything but easy, given the complexity, evanescence and visionary nature of the author. Because Conarium is nothing but a great tribute to one of the author's most famous works, To the Mountains of Madness: it is admittedly so, because the three Zoetrope Interactive developers who alone made the game have affirmed it, and it is so manifesto for all those who have read the long story of the Providence writer. From a certain point of view, this can be a double-edged sword: those who have never read Lovecraft, depending on their predisposition, could be enraptured by the atmosphere and context of Conarium. Those who, on the other hand, know the writer well and above all have read Alle Montagne della Follia, for better or worse already know where the title is headed. In the Antarctic base of Upuaut the four explorers have found much more than a little millennial ice: in the caves below the surface waiting for them there are revelations that date back to the origins of the universe, many of which are intolerable to the human mind. If you enjoyed Call of Cthulhu you will hardly skip Conarium without looking back at least once. Gameplay: First person horror adventure Let's move on to examine the game itself, namely the gameplay: Conarium is a first-person adventure, suspended between reality and nightmare/vision. The player takes on the role of the aforementioned Frank Gilman, wears the Conarium, holds a trusty torch that the title makes available to him from the first minutes of the game, and begins to explore. Explore the arctic base first, then briefly move outside, and then back to the various sub-levels of the base itself. All of this of course always looking for the missing comrades, and above all trying to reconstruct the facts: what the heck is Gilman doing there? What was the expedition doing? What did he find in Antarctica? Why did everyone disappear? What is it that triggers his frequent visions? All these questions will have their answers in the hours of the game immediately following, and (fortunately) to complete Conarium you don't need many. However, what at first glance may seem like an excellent first-person narrative adventure on Lovecraftian themes soon discovers its side to more defects, and also quite evident ones. Let's start from an apparently trivial consideration, which however is not trivial: the adventure in question is not a horror. Perhaps the game poster can pass the same as a horror, perhaps the description of the developers wants to catch some curious passerby, but if anything we can talkthriller, not horror. There is nothing about Conarium that scares you, or that is even remotely designed to make the player nervous. No enemies, no creepy tunes, no out of place and disturbing details. It's not horror, that's all. If anything it is a distressing thriller. Also distressing because it risks quickly boring both the casual player and the one ~specialized in Lovecraft's themes~. All right, exploration is fine, discovering new details in small steps by reading newspaper articles, diaries, literary quotations scattered almost everywhere is fine. But the situation soon becomes that of a walking simulator occasionally interrupted by extremely trivial puzzles: in the first hour of the game, room after room of the arctic base is explored, most of which is closed, while the rest is empty. The game leads to interacting with an important element, reveals some details and then opens access to the next area (always interspersed with loading that is even too long). New area to explore, new puzzle to solve, and on and on. There is an inventory, but maybe it's used a couple of times, so that when you really need the only tool you can interact with (a hatchet) you even forget that two hours ago we had placed it in the inventory. The puzzles are so simple that you just need to interact with all the few on-screen elements in the room to solve them. Even the technical realization is not particularly exciting: the commands, especially in the environmental puzzles, are clearly a poorly done port of their initial version, designed for mouse and keyboard. The graphic sector of the closed environments of the arctic base are excellent, then in the new environments they gradually become more neglected. The sound accompaniment is a hammering repetition of the same motifs, and after two or three cyclical repetitions anyone would notice it. Even Lovecraft would probably get bored after a while.", "date": "2019-02-24", "grade": "6.5"}
