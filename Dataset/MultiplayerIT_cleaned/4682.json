However, to be able to compete on an equal footing with the rival that surpassed it, FIFA, something is still missing. If you have already sifted through the review of the PlayStation 4 edition, which we invite you to read together with this one to get a complete picture of the game, you will already know if Konami has managed to insert ~that something~. But we, specifically in this review for the PC edition, are primarily concerned with understanding whether the use of the FOX Engine on this platform has finally brought benefits or not compared to 2017, and if in general certain perplexities we had while playing the demos were wiped out. Stories of champions Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 comes with menus that are substantially similar to those of the last edition, the same as regards the game modes, apart from a couple, and some extra options. Therefore, as always, friendlies, the two European club competitions of UEFA, namely the Champions League and Europa League, as well as the Asian Champions can be played. And yet, some European leagues, of which only a couple are completely licensed, and use a handful of international clubs scattered here and there. Virtually all the big English and German teams are missing, and in Italy even Juventus. In short, nothing new in this sense, even if this licensing issue is starting to tire after all these years. Then present all the classic tournaments typical of the series and the Become a Legend mode, now outdated from certain points of view, which is paired with the Master League. The latter as an important novelty offers pre-season tournaments and a slightly more refined market management. Dulcis in fundo, the ~real~ news: online cooperative games with up to three players per team even on the same console, and the random game. What about MyClub mode? Unfortunately due to the unavailability of the servers, at the time of our test it was not possible for us to evaluate it together with the rest of the online sector. In any case, having discovered the modes present in the game, let's focus on what should be the beating heart of Pro Evolution Soccer 2018: the gameplay. From this point of view there are some steps forward compared to last season: we are not talking about a total revolution, mind you, or a radical change, but about improvements. Once on the field, in fact, the user finds the usual feeling with the controls and a playability similar to that of the previous chapter, but a little more refined in its various facets. Team play The pace of play is slow and reasoned, the teams tend to build the action rather than looking for the individual's personal one, except in cases where the phase of the match allows it and the player is called Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, just to make some examples. In other words, people who have inspiration and a certain type of solitary play in their hearts. Therefore thanks to a slightly more advanced artificial intelligence, the virtual athletes behave in a more logical way in managing the ball and show a greater predisposition to respect the tactics and strategies chosen by the coach. In this way we have more intelligent movements, which follow the natural evolution of the action. Too bad for the persistence of some tracks and certain sometimes cumbersome movements, even if in general, the excessively cumbersome ones of last season and which we had glimpsed in one of our previous trials have disappeared. In fact, now it is possible to build an action and perform the simplest gestures without always having to make too many unnatural ~steps~ in micro movements due to too rigid animations. This also translates into greater ball control, a sign that Real Touch+ works, which together with a more credible ~physicality~ of the players in managing the ball, with the more powerful athletes capable of making their weight felt more, especially in tackles , lead to a freer and more open approach to the various situations of the match than in the recent past. Also because the referees don't seem to shine too brightly, and sometimes they don't boo rather harsh interventions. In any case, improvements also in the conclusions on the net, where, however, there is a certain discrepancy in the realism of the tense shots, compared to the softer ones. In the first case, one really has the sensation of perceiving a certain power in the punch and an underlying heaviness of the ball, while in the second, sometimes not. On the other hand, the problems related to certain movements of the goalkeepers are still unsolved, which in half-height flights, for example, always seem to lack some connecting animation, especially during the leap and the verge fallout.know earth, and to their artificial intelligence, sometimes deficient in the face of conclusions certainly not learnable. Finally beautiful on PC too! As for the technological part, the PC version of the game can finally enjoy the same technical treatment as the counterpart on the new generation console. And the results are there for all to see: Pro Evolution Soccer 18 boasts excellent graphics, clearly superior to that of the past edition on the computer which was similar to that of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 editions. The title takes full advantage of the FOX Engine and it works at 1080p and at sixty frames per second without the slightest uncertainty with all the filters active, thanks to which the title is very beautiful to look at. The faces of the most famous athletes in some cases border on photorealism, the same goes for their physical proportions thanks to a correct polygonal modeling, while the animations are partially disappointing: if it is true that new ones have been implemented to make certain movements more credible, it should be also said that for some they still seem to lack connection points, such as during the race, where the players do not seem to show a real change of pace. On the other hand, the shirts and even the surrounding elements are beautiful, embellished by the presence of well-made textures. Perhaps only the colors are a little too saturated, but there is also a matter of taste. On the other hand, ups and downs for stadiums, which in the case of generic ones are mostly average, while those covered by official licenses appear absolutely spectacular. At least the new ones like the Camp Nou. In any case, to corroborate everything there is a direction worthy of a television broadcast, with ad hoc shots of the players' faces in the warm-up phase or after a decidedly dangerous action, in the stands and on the sidelines which, especially during official competitions such as the Champions League, gives back to users all the atmosphere of the competition and the feeling of really participating with their favorite team. The picture is completed by a sound sector capable of restoring all the atmosphere that reigns inside a real stadium during a football match. Finally, the commentary in Italian by the usual Fabio Caressa is good, who this year offers the public a series of new phrases that add to and enrich the old commentary of the last editions that saw him protagonist together with Marchegiani.", "date": "2017-09-12", "grade": "8.4"}
