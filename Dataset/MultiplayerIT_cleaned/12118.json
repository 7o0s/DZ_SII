{"name": "Friday the 13th", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/friday-the-13th.html", "text": "As you will recall, the events of the entire saga took place at Camp Crystal Lake, a campsite that had recently reopened after an accident that occurred a few years earlier, the drowning of a child, a certain Jason Voorehees. Shortly thereafter, the bloody murders that made the saga famous began. The game is set up as a graphic adventure, with a background that changes based on the area we're visiting but which essentially remains fixed, only the descriptions of what we see and therefore what we can do change. After entering the campus we will begin to investigate, getting to know the first characters who populate it, and exploring the structures in the area. We purposely don't tell you anything about the excellent plot around which Friday the 13th revolves, the pace and the very cinematic setting that the developers have managed to give to the entire game is certainly to be commended. The story will unfold through puzzles to be solved, we will have to understand how to use the objects and remember where it is possible to find the materials scattered throughout the campus. Through the inventory, located at the bottom of our mobile screen, we will analyze and use all the accessories that we can collect in the various areas. We will only advance in the adventure by solving the various puzzles in the right order, don't forget that. Technically Friday the 13th is only discreet, the sprites that describe the various settings, in fact, are not always detailed to the right point. We could say that more than a graphic adventure it is a text adventure with some descriptive images. Unfortunately for us the game has not been adapted, and therefore you will need to know English to appreciate its true value, it should also be emphasized that the ~balloons~ that enclose the descriptions are far too large, occupying an excessive portion of the screen. We have not missed another shortcoming that is quite serious for the entire title and that is the fact that the NPCs, the non-player characters managed by the AI, have been developed very little, they have no characterization at all. PRO Great texture Good cinematic cut AGAINST Certainly not short matches Not adapted to Italian Technically modest", "date": "2007-07-18", "grade": "S.V."}
