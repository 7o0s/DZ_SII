{"name": "Stress Attack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stress-attack.html", "text": "The brief introduction of Stress Attack is clear, with an employee who ends up going crazy due to excessive work stress and goes to a very particular place to ~cure~ his illness. In this truly unique theme park, our character will have to deal with urban and non-urban settings, populated by robots that simulate the behavior of human beings. In this case, however, you can bludgeon them at will, tear them to pieces and spread their circuits on the asphalt. After all, we're taking care of ourselves, aren't we? And so what apparently seemed to be a ~brain~ video game turns out to be nothing less than a scrolling fighting game... Once the game has started, we will find ourselves familiarizing ourselves with a really simple and immediate control system, with the joystick that moves our nice employee, the 5 key to attack and a series of combinations that can produce particular shots. By pressing in the same direction twice or by acting on the 7 and 9 keys, we will in fact be able to start sliding and sweep the enemies that are nearby. By pressing the joystick up twice or using the 1 and 3 keys, however, the character will perform a flying kick. Moving towards the opponents vertically, we will be able to grab them and then activate some rather spectacular combos, such as the one in which the enemy's electronic ~heart~ is torn out. There are two indicators to pay attention to: one in the upper part of the screen, which indicates the level of stress or the number of hits suffered (when it fills up, the game over is triggered), and one at the bottom for the execution of the super-move. The latter is activated with the asterisk key: once pressed, a screen starts in which we have to stop some indicators like in a slot machine, and depending on the result a devastating and insane maneuver can start (a super infective fart rather than a rabbit ninjas, to name just a few). In case three identical symbols do not stop, everything can also be translated into a lean figure, testified by the desperate expression of the character. In the game we will find ourselves facing a really large number of enemies: they are always robots, which imitate certain human behaviors (there is one who behaves like an old lady, one who imitates a bully, etc.), but each one is equipped with a different modus operandi as well as different types of attack. Furthermore, at the end of each stage there will be the classic boss fight. Stress Attack's graphics are truly amazing, both in quantity and quality. The design of the characters and environments is very ~Lucasarts~ in style, with the weird geometries typical of certain ~point and click~ adventures as well as an exceptional use of colors. The result is a cartoonish and nice look, which conquers after just a few moments. Both the protagonist and his opponents are equipped with a large number of animations, certainly above the average for mobile gaming. And there is no shortage of touches of class, represented by special moves and grappling combos. In short, the developers have really done an excellent job, which is accompanied by a not astonishing but adequate sound commentary: a catchy musical theme, which does not disturb at all and is very appropriate in the context. We have already spoken of the control system: simple and immediate, only with some uncertainty in the response to the commands.
