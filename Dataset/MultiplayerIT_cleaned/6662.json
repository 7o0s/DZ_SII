It is an event of great importance for all fans of the series created by Hideo Kojima, as well as a way to put an end to the (understandable) controversies relating to the sale price of this peculiar prologue given that, thanks to the Steam balances, it is It is possible to buy Ground Zeroes at launch for 16 euros and broken, with an official price of 19.99; therefore half compared to what was practiced on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One last March. I probably deserve more of the time factor than of a sudden come to his senses by the publisher, but at this point it doesn't matter: what matters is finally being able to taste the experience that will be offered by The Phantom Pain, in a technical framework that has never been so advanced and impactful . Between old and new A few months after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, we find Big Boss again grappling with a high-risk mission in Cuba, where there is a military complex in which are held prisoners, among others, Paz and Chico . The first is a girl that Snake met during the Peace Walker storyline, and who turned out to be a spy in the service of Cipher, while the second is a boy that the Sandinista National Liberation Front had forced to become a soldier. Both possessed information that the creepy Skull Face deemed useful, so they were horribly tortured into revealing it. Will Big Boss be able to find them still alive and bring them back to the Mother Base of his private army, the Militaires Sans Frontires? We will find out precisely during the mission that constitutes the fulcrum of the Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes offer, which will see us silently explore Camp Omega in search of our targets, pick them up and finally call a helicopter to leave the area. The philosophy behind the game always puts the stealth element first, with some innovations in terms of interface but certain aspects that inevitably remain unchanged: the guard who does not notice the colleague who up to five minutes before was patrolling the area in front to his own or who is not curious about a noise that we have caused (shots aside), for example. However, there is a greater degree of realism in the moment in which you are discovered and the alarms go off, in the sense that other units are summoned and you have to wait a while for the situation to return to normal. In short, the timer of the first chapters is now a thing of the past, even if the setting remains anchored to a ~trial & error~ system from which it is difficult to escape, and which is evidenced by the presence of a quick recall at the last checkpoint in the options screen. Deep and multifaceted as long as we move in the shadows and in silence, Ground Zeroes proves not exactly at ease during open-faced clashes, even if the open world approach also provides this option. The fault a, in our opinion, must be attributed to a certain woodiness of the gameplay and a layout of the controls that distances itself a bit from the current standards of action games, and with which one must inevitably become familiar. Returning to stealth, some mechanisms have been further elaborated, to the full advantage of the strategic value of the gameplay: the binoculars to ~mark~ the guards and check their position, the possibility of extorting information from the enemies taken from behind and, last but not least, the spectacular bullet time that activates the instant a hostile soldier sees us, and that provides a few seconds to quickly silence him (usually with an aimed shot to the head) before he raises the alarm. Finally, inventory management combines traditional elements and some innovation, with the iDroid providing a tactical map as well as additional information on targets, while the weapon slots allow you to carry a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and four extra (in this case we start by default with a night vision goggle, but grenades are also placed in the same slot), to be activated by using the d-pad of the controller. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes brings the usual ~superior version~ to PC, this time at a fair price Ok, the price is right If it is true that for the original 39.99 euros the offer of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, however intriguing, was extremely expensive, as mentioned the game arrived on PC with an officially halved price (19.99 euros) and further reduced through Steam balances. Considering the production quality, which shines especially on the Windows platformare, the placement appears more than adequate. However, the speech is above all about the content, since we are basically talking about a single level, precisely the Omega Camp scenario, which however is re-proposed within six extra missions in addition to the main one, at different times of the day in order to make appreciate the capabilities of the FOX Engine in terms of day/night cycle performance. We have already spoken of ~Ground Zeroes~, it is the core of the experience and offers a couple of hours of entertainment where a patient and meticulous approach is chosen, trying to neutralize all the guards that come within range, in one way or in the 'other, and to let us tell you where the targets are. An important variant is obtained by deactivating the lights of the complex and proceeding with the night vision goggles, but in fact the possibilities are many and the ~speed run~ option is not missing. The secondary missions are inevitably shorter, albeit fairly varied and with some nice surprises: ~Eliminate the threat of the executioners~ asks you to identify and eliminate two agents who have distinguished themselves in the past for their cruelty; ~Secret Agent Rescue~ involves retrieving a VIP held captive within the base; ~Confidential information acquisition~ will see us search for a particular tape within the scenario and then proceed with the extraction; ~Destroy AA Emplacements~, as the name implies, requires the destruction of all turrets in the area. Then there are the XOF patches to collect on the map and two other extra missions, specifically those that the developers had included as exclusive on PlayStation and Xbox, namely ~Dj-Vu~ and ~Jamais Vu~. The PC version On the technical front, the new version of this prologue can be played up to a resolution of 4K (obviously having an adequate configuration), but even at 1080p it is substantially higher than what was seen on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Thanks to the advanced effects , in particular the lighting and refraction system of the lights, the increased visual distance, the introduction of a more complex rendering of the depth of field (which, however, in some situations, is questionable and may not be liked) and of greater richness in terms of items, especially from a distance, which appears particularly visible during side missions that take place during the day. On PC there are rocks, tufts of grass and, in general, details that on consoles have been stripped away to keep the frame-rate stable. And, speaking of frame rates, we can safely say that the work done by Kojima Studios in terms of optimization exceeds that of many other development teams, even noble ones. While inevitably influenced by the CPU, with AMD processors once again struggling to keep up with their Intel counterparts, the game manages to offer exceptional fluidity with all effects maxed out, returning an average frame rate of 45- 50 frames per second, which rises to 55-60 frames per second simply by lowering the quality of the shadows, without therefore sacrificing the visual impact. With the same GPU and an Intel i5 CPU, you stick to 60 frames per second instead. However, there is an abundance of advanced options, useful for scaling the experience on less powerful systems: a possible lock at 30 frames per second, v-sync (even if you deactivate it, you don't notice any particular tearing, it must be said), the quality of models, textures, texture filter, shadows, lighting, screen filter and effects. Unfortunately, the specific features of NVIDIA are missing, such as HBAO + (there is only SSAO) in terms of ambient occlusion, TXAA antialiasing and hair and fur rendering technology: let's hope they find a place in The Phantom Pain.", "date": "2014-12-23", "grade": "8.0"}
