{"name": "Guilty Gear Xrd", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/151187-guilty-gear-xrd-sign-la-nuova-frontiera-dei-picchiaduro.html", "text": "The Guilty Gear series began in 1998 with the very first title developed by Arc System Works for the PlayStation, a fighting game that immediately stood out from the competition from Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and The King of Fighters due to its technicality and emphasis on combos , but also and above all for the care taken by the developer in the creation and animation of the two-dimensional sprites. Over time, Arc System Works has remained one of the few software houses that has never tried the easy way of 3D, rolling out a series of franchises that have entered the hearts of its fans when Guilty Gear, after some unfortunate porting, seemed to disappear from the radar around 2007. Since then, the Japanese software house has let us play BlazBlue, Arcana Heart and the Persona Arenas inspired by the jRPG of the same name by Atlus, occasionally encroaching on some licenses, such as Ken the Warrior and Dragon Ball Z. Ironically , its best products are all a bit alike: they are apparently simple, surprisingly complex fighting games. It is no coincidence that many fans of the genre prefer them in tournaments, enrapturing spectators with very long combos, spectacular shots and victories worthy of the best cinematic twists. And at the root of each mechanic is that '98 experiment, Guilty Gear, which is back just in time to usher in the advent of Arc System Works on next-generation consoles. How did it go? Guilty Gear Xrd is probably the best fighting game for PlayStation 4, but something is still missing Put down the joypad Well, it went as usual, in the sense that Guilty Gear Xrd arrives in Europe months and months after the Japanese and American releases, moreover in digital format only and at full price. An inexplicable and unjustified choice, also because no localization work was done and the game texts remained completely in English. And just to stay on the subject of mockery, the same day Guilty Gear Xrd arrived in our PlayStation Store, Arc System Works announced its expansion, subtitled Revelator, which will be released in Japanese territory by the end of the year, implementing new characters and more balances. Those who have been following the panorama of fighting games for years will by now be accustomed to the game of revisions, but in this case the mark has gone a bit, albeit involuntarily, with a real own goal: we would not be surprised, therefore, if many European players they will prefer to wait for the next release or fall back on this one once the price drops. It must be said that the revisions of Arc System Works more than simple expansions or mere DLCs are real sequels, which expand the story of the saga from time to time, often told through endless dialogues and cutscenes. In the case of Guilty Gear Xrd, however, the developer has attempted a courageous experiment but, unfortunately, only half succeeded. The Story Mode in question, in fact ... is not played. Instead of being told between one fight and another, perhaps with the multiple choices and crossroads that BlazBlue and Persona Arena had accustomed us to, the story of Guilty Gear Xrd develops like a real animated feature film, divided into chapters, to follow as mere spectators for a couple of hours. It is a solution that has left us a bit dumbfounded, also because the Story Mode is inspired by the short and incomprehensible individual endings of the Arcade mode, and gave us the impression of having been conceived in a hurry in the arcade cabinet conversion to PlayStation consoles. On the other hand, the quality of the proposal this time is not discussed: instead of forcing us to read dialogue after dialogue as if it were a visual novel, each sequence is fully animated using the game's graphics engine, based in turn on Unreal Engine 3 with the addition of cel shading. In this respect, Guilty Gear Xrd is simply amazing. Once again, Arc System Works has preferred two-dimensionality, but this is a deception, because the characters and scenarios are completely three-dimensional, and the shot, usually fixed, rotates around them only during the victory poses or some special moves, offering a sudden and spectacular dynamism. The cel shading solution allowed the graphics to stage a technical picture almost indistinguishable from a cartoon, thanks also to a clever use of anti-aliasing and the frame rate constantly anchored to 60 frames per second. In short, every fight of Guilty Gear Xrd is a real feast for the eyes, between particle effects in profusion, special pyrotechnic shots and dizzying shots, while firmly maintaining the cclarity of the image and framing it in the usual rocking soundtrack that made the franchise famous and that pumps blood in every match. Playstation 4 trophies The collection, made up of 36 bronze, 8 silver, 3 gold and 1 platinum trophies, requires typical fighting game solutions: you will have to perform certain moves, complete the various game modes, unlock each collectible and interact with other players in multiplayer mode. Powder fire When it comes to playing, Guilty Gear Xrd finally gives its best, and summarizes in a few moments the philosophy that Arc System Works has developed in terms of fighting games in recent years. Apparently, you just hit keys at random to perform different kinds of combos. The disposition is always the same, with a button for the punch, one for the kick, one for the hard hit and one for the medium power one. Their combination produces different effects, allowing us to throw the opponent or throw him into the air, starting a spectacular aerial combo. Anyone who has played BlazBlue or Persona Arena, however, knows very well that those four keys hide a much more complex and profound game system, capable of satisfying even the most experienced fighting game fan. Those who are not very familiar with the genre, on the other hand, fear not: Guilty Gear Xrd offers one of the most complete training modes we've ever played. It takes us by the hand and gradually introduces us to each command, gradually explaining the most complex strategies: aerial shots, ground shots, ~on the ground~ attacks, Psych Burst, R.I.S.C. and more. Obviously, the iconic Roman Cancels of the series are back, which allow you to translate practically every animation into another, consuming the Tension bar to prolong our combos. Considering that practically every special action consumes Tension, as well as super moves called Overdrives, it is clear that the game soon becomes more strategic than chaotic, although the frenzy of the action suggests otherwise. In this sense, the usefulness of the Challenge mode is evident, which represents an additional level of training and an additional challenge for more experienced players. In short, in terms of single player content, Guilty Gear Xrd does not disappoint, but the variety is quite narrow and, in the end, each mode serves more than anything else to scrape together the currency with which to unlock illustrations, secondary characters and other bonuses. Variety is a problem that we have experienced a lot in Guilty Gear Xrd. Although sufficiently different from each other, the scarce twenty characters in the roster draw almost entirely from the first chapters of the series, offering us the traditional mix of fighters who hurl projectiles of some kind, who sacrifice speed for power or vice versa or who base their fighting techniques on some absurd power. We are far from the peculiarities offered by the BlazBlue wrestlers, who each had a different special power, but if it is true that characters like Sol Badguy or Ky Kiske can appear almost banal, there are others, especially the unpublished Bedman and Ramlethal, which definitely refresh the roster. It's a fairly successful mix of old and new, even if we would have expected to see a few more characters. Those available, however, are quite diversified, and the good balancing act has meant that the same fighters do not always meet online. Sadly though, the online portion of Guilty Gear Xrd leaves a lot to be desired. Don't get us wrong, the netcode is more than discreet and rarely shows its side, perhaps settling down after only a few seconds of uncertainty at the start of the game... but, first, that game should be started. The solution devised by the developer is crazy: cumbersome and unnecessarily complicated, it forces us to go through an infinite series of menus just to look for a lobby where there could be challengers. On the one hand, it's an interesting idea that promotes a form of social interaction between players (as if we didn't know what happens when the immature ones lose...) but on the other hand, it greatly weighs down a mode that is often chosen to play some quick game against unknown, imagining them chewing on the joypad after having dealt them yet another beating. Provided that the gnawed joypad isn't ours.", "date": "2015-06-11", "grade": "8.0"}
