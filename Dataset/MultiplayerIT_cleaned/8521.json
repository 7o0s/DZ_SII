Two armies, the German and the Russian, determined to go all out along an immense front involving thousands of tanks and millions of men. A setting treated by a few titles but which today returns in an overbearing way also thanks to the European teams. On the other hand, on this side of the ocean, the perception of the Second World War has always included the terrible clash between Germany and Russia and the more than 20 million deaths it caused. But Stalin's reaction, who in a frenzy threw all his men against enemy lines, was probably one of the main factors in Hitler's downfall. Playing as a handyman soldier The single player mode of the ambitious X1 Software title places us in specific situations which, however, are set in immense battlefields full of possibilities. We are located between Poland and the Ukraine in a largely flat area that sees the few hills as fundamental strategic points. Equally relevant are the few towns that often turn out to be dangerous traps. Made with historical accuracy, urban centers can hide, inside the buildings, several enemy soldiers waiting to see our skull sprout. Even the green countryside is however a harbinger of possibilities and dangers. Iron Front: Liberation 1944 includes trenches, outposts, crucial roads, bridges and hills to conquer. In short, enough to recreate all the typical situations of the skirmishes and battles that devastated Eastern Europe during the Second World War. The whole is then enriched by the possibility of using aircraft, by the numerous emplacement weapons and by the tanks that challenge each other in a decidedly free context. Of course, the fact that a soldier knows how to do absolutely everything is not a simulative element, but it is a more than understandable playful need. The variety of situations of the two campaigns, one dedicated to the Russians and one to the Germans, is undoubtedly one of the strengths and places us in actions of all kinds between infantry ambushes against tanks, reconnaissance with tactical binoculars and strenuous defense of objectives sensitive. The developers have also implemented two distinct workouts to also give us a measure of the difference between the weapons of the two armies. Compulsory and varied workouts including emplacement weapons, tank attack and grenade throwing. All fundamental elements and, as we will see in the next paragraph, far from trivial in the Iron Front ecosystem. The physics engine is in fact extremely complex and the control system decidedly articulated between action menus to interact on several levels with military instruments, cartographic system, third-person and free view, role-playing style inventory and various other goodies. such as the ability to retrieve items from corpse equipment. A real battlefield The gameplay, like the game structure, aims to simulate credible military situations. The walk is realistic, although the bobbing of the head can be reduced and the weapons set to allow us to aim without forcing our soldier to rotate his whole body. A fundamental option when lying down but which requires a minimum of practice for those used to less simulated shooters. The same goes for the ballistic system which has been modified compared to ArmA II and calibrated for the 1944 weapons. There are also appreciable details such as the drift of the barrel of the emplacement machine guns during a barrage or the explosion of the debris of the grenades that splash in all directions and can also damage our soldier if he is without shelter. But it doesn't end there. The emplacement SMG, for example, can be refocused using the action menu and this allows you to change the firing window without having to get up from firing position. The walk is then accompanied by the classic run but the title also allows us to run at double speed with the aim which obviously suffers. The aiming system and weapon ballistics aren't the only differences between Iron Front and ArmA II. In fact, the title implements a decidedly complex armor system with various parameters related to distance, bullet speed, impact angle and the thickness of the armor itself. Shooting down a Panzerkampfwagen VI with the weak Russian rocket launcher isn't easy if you don't set up a tactic first, and each vehicle has different weaknesses that need to be taken into consideration. In fact, the engine takes into account any ammunition loaded on a vehicle, the weakness of the armor inproximity of the cannon, the position of the engine and above all that of the fuel which, if hit, can save us precious bullets. It is also possible to coordinate a grenade launch, with your team, in case you don't have an anti-tank rocket launcher. Even on the driving front, the title aims in some way to simulate reality. However, we are not talking about the rather basic and intuitive controls, but about the behavior of the tyres, the slowness on dirt roads and the difficulty of driving at high speed. The same setting was chosen for the aircraft, even if in this case Iron Front introduces the need to use flaps and makes setting a trajectory more complex than in ArmA II. In this way, landing and bombing becomes more complex and less arcadey, but it is still maneuvers that are within the reach of all players, especially using a joystick. In short, Iron Front: Liberation 1944 offers the player a lot of possibilities that prove to be very useful between vehicle races, cannon transport, rescue missions, outposts to defend and bombings. All with an almost simulative movement speed that lets you enjoy the battle even in command of an aircraft. The communication system then, which allows us to ask for help and give orders, becomes increasingly useful as we rise in rank and also allows us to directly command several men by setting up complex tactics and defensive strategies. The commands are in fact numerous and also allow you to place men in vehicles or positions. Furthermore, in the messages and orders received there is no shortage of coordinates that allow the AI to indicate the exact position of the enemies within the battlefield. Despite the relaxed pace, the challenge is generally high given that a couple of shots, on normal difficulty, send us to the other world without too many compliments and from a great distance. Unfortunately the enemy AI, like that of our companions who often place themselves in the least appropriate positions, enchants itself too often and getting around enemies, or waiting for them to get distracted by looking at a companion, makes everything rather simple. The simulation campaign is obviously the fulcrum of the title but there are also the classic multiplayer modes, the front-to-front clash between two large contingents and a novelty, at least as regards the ArmA series. Let's talk about the Blitzkrieg mode which asks a side to conquer the opponent's spawn points. Basically something very similar to the main Battlefield but declined according to the structure of Iron Front and with an even wider battlefield full of possibilities. Finally, let's not forget the coop missions and the editor which are undoubtedly fundamental elements in a title of this kind. On the other hand, these two factors will allow modders to create potentially memorable cooperative campaigns. Too bad, unfortunately, that the main campaign does not already allow you to play cooperatively. The glance and the raw truth We are faced with a title with a complex concept, but in the making the finishing touches got lost along the way. The visuals are good, with soldiers patrolling in the distance, planes plowing through the sky, and grass waving as far as the eye can see. The number of units is often rich and the battles between tanks are nothing short of spectacular. All enhanced by dynamic shadows, blurs and blurring, by burning and falling trees and by the smoke that can be seen at a great distance and puffing believably even from the sides of the explosions. Unfortunately the overall effect is undermined by a long series of rather visible defects. The most sensational, which also affect the gameplay, are the anti-tank rocket launcher that is placed in front of our soldier's view when he lies down, the camera too moved when using a weapon with a protective screen and several bugs that see us stuck between our comrades while the enemy riddles us with bullets. Then there are bodies that disappear and various anomalies capable of blocking the mission and forcing us to start again from the last save. Fortunately, the title often saves automatically and perhaps it is no coincidence given the amount of bugs. Texture streaming is often visible, objectives appear laggy, indicators often appear too close to the target, and soldier animations are nothing short of spartan and often downright ridiculous. The question does not change either with the lip, which recalls that of puppets, or with the animations of our soldier who, when trying to climb over an obstacle, is so embalmed that he makes the Dragonborn of Skyrim look like an acrobat. This takes away a lot of charm from the complex structureto the title, to the interlude scenes, to the group assaults and to the complex workouts that could have given a cinematic cut to everything. Cutting also absent in the interlude scenes which have incorrect timing, decidedly not very dynamic tracking shots and an amateurish rhythm to say the least. Things are much better with the sound sector which comes with well-chosen symphonies and plenty of dialogue. Unfortunately, these fluctuate both in sound and authorial quality, but if nothing else, the English dubbing is declined with a German or Russian accent and the result is appreciable for the purposes of the atmosphere. Finally, the sound effects are brilliant with deafening tanks, credible explosions, samplings faithful to reality, quantity of voice commands and excellent quality environmental sounds. Unfortunately the graphics engine, in addition to being imperfect, is very heavy, and it is even more so than it was in ArmA II. Furthermore, the fluctuating textures and graphic imperfections do not allow you to fully enjoy the detail implemented by the developers. Might as well, therefore, play it at medium resolution, lowering the detail just enough to prevent the frame drops from falling below 15 fps, making everything unplayable. Even on our configuration, holding detail at medium-high at 1280x720, the framerate fluctuates between 50 and 20 frames per second. But the slowdowns don't always coincide with an increase in action or on-screen objects. There is therefore ample room to refine and fix everything and we hope that in the coming months there will be patches capable of making a potentially excellent title fully usable.", "date": "2012-05-23", "grade": "7.7"}
