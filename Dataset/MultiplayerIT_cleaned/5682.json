{"name": "Nel DOOM dipinto di DOOM", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164244-devil-daggers-nel-doom-dipinto-di-doom.html", "text": "There was a time, a few years ago, when the first-person shooter genre desperately tried to regain its dignity by looking to the past. At a certain point of the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation (and consequently also on PC) the simplifications, limits and false promises of evolution of a rather cumbersome slice of triple A production seriously risked representing a dead end for FPS, until someone recovered from the torpor and tried to give a jolt of vitality, recovering the spirit of the origins, thanks to which to attempt an inversion with which to escape a future marked by linearity, scripts and the little thickness in the firefights that seemed written by now. We have thus witnessed the emergence of an opposition, represented in the first instance by Hard Reset, Serious Sam 3, Duke Nukem Forever, Shadow Warrior, Rise of Triad and other titles which, either out of real vocation or out of opportunism, proudly boasted to be inspired by the old school. Today the situation seems much more balanced and diversified, even within high-profile productions (think of Wolfenstein or the new DOOM, which with its uncompromising return to action once again represents a symbol of the times), for keep silent about independent projects, where you can find every one. Being ~old school~ is no longer a publicity call, something to shout with so much ardor on the cover, yet this does not mean that the declared recovery of tradition has run out of interesting things to say, on the contrary. Our review of Devil Daggers, old school shooter with a lot of character Endless abyss Devil Daggers might look like a vile DOOM clone, but it's actually much, much more. Because it is indeed a game that refers to the putative father of the genre and other neighboring classics (Heretic) with a reverence bordering on the calligraphic, but it is also a game that would not have been possible if it were not for the post-Super Meat Boy, Hotline Miami and also wanting audiovisual and sensory trips like Dyad. In short, titles that offer extremely difficult formulas at first glance, in which you last a spit of seconds, but which hide a respectable care and depth of the game mechanics, happy to open up and be discovered death after death (after death, after death...), avoiding frustration thanks to the possibility of trying again instantly. The debut title Siloth works based on the same principle, however applying it to an even more minimalist and extreme structure. Because in the game there is no level to overcome in view of the next one, which you can eventually return to improve your score, but a single arena where you can face waves of abominations of all kinds, which seem to come out of a night's nightmare Midsummer of '93 from Adrian Carmack. It's like taking the best ten seconds of DOOM in open space and proposing them in a chain of increasingly extreme loops, in which you are slammed with a hard nose, smashing it, against the essence of first person shooting: aiming, sharpening the ability of prediction, choose the most appropriate weapon at the most appropriate moment and move. In other words, continually redefining the balance of power between us and an overwhelming evil. Except that the evil in these parts is really overwhelming, given that there is no exit to reach, a boss to defeat or a limit to the hordes that assault us with no escape, from every direction. Destiny is already written: in the end he will always have the upper hand. The difference is how long you will have to wait to get our skin. A success whose unit of measurement is that of seconds, ten thousandths included, and which often, very often, will not exceed two-digit orders of magnitude. On the other hand we are talking about a title that comes with a single Steam achievement that sounds like a rather explanatory declaration of intent: survive for at least 500 seconds. A goal, among other things, which at the time of writing has only been achieved by 5 of the 16,800 active players (Steamspy data). Superb simplicity Devil Daggers might appear to be a simplistic exercise in sadism by some nostalgic hipsters, but while it undoubtedly remains one of the most ruthless and brutal experiences mouse and keyboard in hand can be experienced, it is far from an example of experimentation for its own sake or a product withdrawn. There are reasons why like many around the Net, between Steam forums and reviews and, last but not least, this writer, you find yourself compulsively pressing R to try again following a few seconds of trying, over and over again, only to discover that you are grinding an indecent quantity on itnumber of hours. The control system is of exemplary precision and reactivity, also providing for a set of advanced movements implemented in a workmanlike manner. Bunny hopping, through which you can furrow the arena floor with more momentum, enjoying extra precious mobility both in defensive and offensive terms, is calibrated in an admirable way: it can be performed at different degrees of rhythmicity, which correspond to different accelerations, without make movements lose continuity, offering a feeling of control over one's steps and changes of direction, even in flight, which is characterized by an almost ~tactile~ pleasantness. The same goes for the rocket jump (or rather: dagger jump) which, with the right amount of practice, also opens the door to performing a double jump. Then there is the weapons chapter, about which a similar discussion can be made, which ends up being intertwined with the enemy and the sound design. The evil daggers that give the game its name can be used in bursts, like a machine gun, or single-shot, like a shotgun. By collecting the red gems released by certain types of enemies, however, they can be enhanced, gradually increasing their effectiveness, giving access to a sort of ~berserk mode~ with which to take a breather very briefly or acquire a devastating search mode. The point is that in the delirium that is created on the screen it is not always easy to recover a gem and after a few moments they disappear or can be swallowed by certain types of creatures. The beauty is that in reality the gems are automatically attracted to the player, within certain distances, but only if you are not shooting. A very small pivot, of a disconcerting banality, but which in the whirlwind of the action ends up taking on the value of a really insightful risk/reward factor. The audio itself is full of meticulously studied effects to help better interpret what is happening, if due attention is paid, allowing you to evaluate certain variables on the fly that act as the basis for that swarm of small but decisive tactical choices that continuously influence the conduct of the match. Well, in the case of the gems a dull buzz warns that you are orbiting in an area where there are some on the ground, suggesting that you could release the left mouse button for a few moments and attract the bonus to you, if there are any circumstances, or to at least try to carve them out. Another type of sound warns instead that an enemy has changed state and is aiming at us in a dangerously aggressive way and it would be advisable to disengage from other threats as soon as possible to dedicate absolute priority to them. These are just a couple of examples of the level of attention placed in a formula capable of staging one of the most shocking representations of chaos ever in which, however, nothing seems to have been left to chance. Little or nothing, on the other hand, is explained, so much so that mechanics like these must be discovered with experience and in many communities a supportive and collaborative spirit has been established in some ways similar to what is seen for Souls, increasing the hermetic appeal and obscure that cloaks the entire production, starting from the identity of its authors, wrapped in a mystery that smells of sulphur. Nothing is known about them, except that they are undoubtedly gifted, even in implementing a function which in various independent titles (but not infrequently also in multimillion-dollar productions ...) can prove to be a bitch, especially at launch, such as the charts. Devil Daggers implements them in an agile and efficient way, also integrating them in-game, allowing to have immediate feedback on the fruits of all the blood that is being poured on his altar, adequately fueling the ardor to surpass himself also due to the effect of this comparative spring. Not only that: they are associated with a convenient replay system, thanks to which you can view the game of any user, including the first, apparently inhuman classified, through which you can eagerly try to understand every secret of this small but significant exploit from the beginning of 2016.", "date": "2016-02-28", "grade": "8.8"}
