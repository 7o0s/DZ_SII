{"name": "Etrian Odissey - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/etrian-odissey-recensione.html", "text": "For the casual observer, the genre of Japanese role-playing game can be exemplified by a game like Final Fantasy, practically an interactive novel in which exploration, combat and management of characters are all aspects, however deep, subordinated to the story, the design and the characterization of the protagonists. In reality, the JRPG galaxy is endless and can count on infinite variations and declinations; and often it was Atlus who, with courage, also introduced Western players to the most unique and niche aspects of the genre. Etrian Odyssey is now being published in the Old Continent, over a year after the American release, in the belief, perhaps, that the European public is finally ripe for this further step forward. Video game notes The EO music composer is none other than Yuzo Koshiro: the forty-year-old Japanese musician began his career at Falcom in 1986, writing the soundtrack for the first episodes of Ys, but as a freelancer his name is linked to Masterpieces such as Enix's ActRaiser, and to the most beautiful soundtracks made in Sega. Any names? How about Shinobi, Streets of Rage, Sonic and her majesty Shenmue? Koshiro is currently considered, and could not be otherwise, one of the major video game music composers, along with people like Nobuo Uematsu and Koji Kondo. Solid roots A step forward which in reality, from a ~philological~ point of view, represents several steps backwards. With the passage of time and the increasing market penetration, JRPGs have become increasingly easy and accessible games, but originally, and as can also be seen from the various re-editions of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, they were extremely demanding products and not immediate. Etrian Odyssey is just that: there is no story in the traditional sense of the term, there are no predetermined PGs, the player is completely free to tackle the adventure as he sees fit - and if he does something wrong, it's his business!  and the fights are beyond difficult. The narrative premise is soon resolved, with the quintessentially medieval-fantasy city of Etrian encouraging exploration of a huge, multi-story forest-labyrinth that suddenly appeared at its gates, and with you leading a guild that takes on this task. Etrian, navigable via menu, is your base. First of all, you can organize and manage the guild: all the characters are created entirely by the player, choosing from the different classes that the game offers (more or less the traditional ones of each RPG), and in theory there is no limit to the number of PCs that you can set up, even if concretely in the party there can't be more than five. In the city there is also the emporium for trading, the apothecary's shop that resurrects party members and sells healing items, the inn where you can rest and save, the Government Palace where you accept quests and the Tavern where you find side tasks, as well as, finally, the entrance to the labyrinth. Once you enter the dungeon, the view switches to a first-person 3D view, with the forest divided into boxes: with each movement on the directional cross, you advance one box, or turn around, and in the meantime the game's internal clock goes on making a random encounter closer. The nice thing is that[...] you have to draw the map yourself Solid roots The nice thing is that you don't have a map of the labyrinth but, just like in the purest spirit of Role Playing, from the paper one to the first electronic examples, you have to draw the map yourself, obviously using the stylus and touch screen. It is one of the best features of the game: drawing the dungeon box by box, affixing various signals as well as memos to remember what is on that box, first of all it dramatically increases the sense of immersion and that of really exploring an unknown forest. and moreover it also eliminates that feeling of being lost typical of every RPG when facing particularly large and convoluted dungeons. It is also possible to take advantage of an automatic mapmaking function, but it would mean depriving yourself of a pleasure: it is enough to know that, according to some American critics, Etrian Odyssey rightfully falls into the unrecognized Cartography RPG category, a sub-genre that has practically disappeared since the Personal Computers had enough memory and computing capacity to handle an automatic map. Evil hurts a lot! As we said, the fights take place randomly: even the most harmless creatures can, in the early stages, cause you some headaches. Nothing a couple of level ups can't fix but, one, leveling up takes a while, and, two, on to the next floor.or there are still stronger and more bloodthirsty monsters. Not to mention the FOE (Fiere Orride ed Impie), practically the bosses of the game, terrifyingly strong creatures capable of blowing you away with a couple of hits the first time you face them. Fortunately, their constantly moving presence is marked on the map, at least on that part of the map that you have managed to draw, and it is possible to avoid them with a little cunning and strategy. Don't forget that you manage the entire party, including level advancements: a wrong choice, although it rarely leads to Game Over, can make you waste a lot of time to recover. Furthermore, the money available to buy objects, equipment, rest and resurrect party members fallen in battle is very limited: you do not earn it directly with a victory in combat, but only by selling the objects thus obtained in the city; and since it is not possible to return to Etrian instantly, you have to go all the way back! even the most innocuous creatures can, in the early stages, cause you some headaches Evil hurts a lot! Are we forgetting something? Ah, yes: you can't save in the dungeon, which is also why returning to the city from time to time is mandatory. In short, Etrian Odyssey does not forgive, and there is a lot of patience needed to move forward: on the other hand, there is also a lot of satisfaction when your party becomes strong enough to defeat that monster that seemed completely impossible at the beginning. Old school through and through, and that's why you can forgive Etrian if technically it doesn't do much to stand out: the style and designs are good, but traditional and not too distinctive; the 3D of the dungeon is scarce and low in detail (but fluid), and the textures have a very low resolution. The music is by Yuzo Koshiro (if you don't know who it is, take a look at the box on the previous page), who however evidently wasn't too inspired, his compositions being nothing more than the average of the genre. As we said at the beginning, we waited more than a year compared to the American release of the game (among other things, the sequel has just been released in the USA), but the wait is repaid by an Italian translation that enjoys the usual care and respect for the language of Nintendo localizations. Vote Nintendo and Atlus' bet paid off: of course, Etrian Odyssey isn't for everyone, and maybe it's even for a few, more than brave, very patient. The writer is fortunate to be precisely that type of player to whom EO is aimed, and has managed to appreciate all the goodness, the sense of immersion, the exploration, the management of the party, the satisfaction that comes from a patient and painstaking level up and being able to make use of the few available resources. Really hardcore players who may have experienced the first age of electronic RPG will be happy to enter the Etrian Forest, all the others will gladly stay away. Pros The map is drawn! Gives huge satisfaction Hard and old school Versus Hard and old school Technically only good enough", "date": "2008-06-26", "grade": null}
