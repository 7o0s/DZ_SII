{"name": "Lara Croft GO", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155223-lara-croft-go-go-lara-go.html", "text": "Last year, Square Enix Montral had definitely hit the target with Hitman GO, a mobile title that placed agent 47 as the protagonist of a strategic game with appearances and dynamics that took inspiration from board games. Evidently eager to apply a similar restyling process to another leading figure in the Square Enix stable such as Lara Croft, the development team has taken certain elements of their previous work and reworked them to make them more consistent with the universe of Tomb Raider: the result is the present here Lara Croft GO, a decidedly interesting title capable of conveying the typical exploratory feeling of the series in a completely different way than usual. Isometric tombs Without worrying about giving a real story that justifies the actions on the screen (our heroine is looking for a precious relic and the player must help her in the enterprise), Lara Croft GO can allow herself the luxury of not even using any type of tutorial, partly for the immediacy of its basic play mechanics, partly to leave the user the pleasure of discovering small details. The game is framed from an isometric view and the explorable environments are represented by platforms crossed by lines and points that identify the path that Lara and any other characters on the screen can follow. A swipe with your finger in the desired direction allows the beautiful archaeologist to advance one square, in a formula similar to that of Hitman GO not only from a stylistic point of view but also for what concerns the action on the screen: with every movement of Lara in fact, the movement of the other mobile elements that populate the scenario corresponds, whether these enemies (snakes, spiders, giant lizards and so on) or traps such as the inevitable and fearsome rotating blades. Playing Lara Croft GO thus becomes a matter of strategy, with the player having to study the layout of the level and make the right moves to reach the exit. However, while the predecessor starring agent 47 was based almost completely on stealth mechanics - in line with the character's story - here the focus is all on solving puzzles concerning the elimination of enemies or overcoming certain obstacles using levers and various switches. Lara Croft GO is a delightful puzzle game that shows Tomb Raider from a new perspective The title can boast an enviable level design, with the developers of Square Enix Montral who have evidently worked hard to create an adventure capable of offering ever new and stimulating challenges and puzzles. Sometimes, however, the marked propensity that the game demonstrates for trial and error mechanics can be annoying: we are often faced with situations that can be understood only and exclusively after dying a couple of times, since the consequences of activating some mechanisms are in no way predictable. And even if sometimes it can be frustrating having to repeat entire portions of a level (especially considering the almost chess-like control system that distinguishes the product), it must be said that the more extensive and complex stages are duly equipped with intermediate checkpoints that avoid having to always start over all over again. However, playing Lara Croft GO proves to be a very pleasant experience, and this is demonstrated by the fact that the end credits seem to arrive all too soon: a difficulty curve with the right growth leads to having to seriously rack your brains in the advanced levels, but it's never about insurmountable difficulties and when you reach the end you're left with the desire to have something more. Theoretically, the application will be updated in the future with free internship packages, while at present Lara Croft GO can count on a moderate replayability factor guaranteed by the three hidden treasures within each setting, by collecting which alternative costumes are unlocked for the protagonist. Finally, even if it does not share the ingenious diorama-inspired graphic style of Hitman GO, the latest addition to Square Enix Montral is still a great sight: the scenarios are clean and detailed, and the overall look of the game is a very successful mix between the appearances of the old Tomb Raiders and an almost cartoonish design.", "date": "2015-08-28", "grade": "8.5"}
