Grow Home is a perfect example of what we mean: released in 2015, the game used a procedural animation system and prompted us to visit a rather large scenario in search of terminals, collectibles and branches to ~sprout~ in order to arrive as high as possible and thus carry out the tasks of the protagonist, the ~botanist~ robot B.U.D. An unripe experience but full of potential that was then expressed in many ways in Grow Up, released a year and a half ago, which went precisely to emphasize certain mechanics and enrich the starting concept with a whole series of elements. Well, let's imagine that Ode is also preparing to embark on such a path: currently available only on PC via Uplay, at a price of just 4.99 euros, the game presents itself as ~a joyful and pleasant gaming experience~. ~a lighthearted and delightful title~. Will it be true? Little ball without sky There are no tutorials, instructions or animated sequences to introduce Ode, which with its only four levels (plus one bonus) certainly doesn't aim to keep us busy for more than a couple of hours. The point under discussion, however, is the quality of the experience, its ability to surprise and indicate new horizons towards which, perhaps, to build something more consistent and ambitious. An objective achieved, we can say it without problems, but net of some complications that clash a bit with the descriptions of the game given above. At the controls of a cute little creature enclosed in a bubble, our task within each scenario will be to collect a series of orbs, which once touched will begin to gravitate around us like Katamari, and use them to activate ~switches gelatinous~ of variable number. The focus of the gameplay lies in exploration, in the ability to find hidden orbs and to dramatically increase the amount of spheres we carry around, but in reality, just a few of these objects are enough to carry out the operations necessary to open a door to the Next Level. The character we control can initially perform only a handful of actions: move, jump, attract orbs magnetically (right trigger) and throw them forward (left trigger) so that, with their touch, they activate further fragments. The latter is a mechanic that is gradually explored during the campaign, and which goes hand in hand with the unlocking of some special powers when we come into contact with sources of different colors. The golden one, for example, allows the protagonist to make much larger leaps and thus reach previously unattainable platforms, while the green one makes sure that the orbs can be transformed into a sort of ~folding stilt~ to walk from one column to another and move with ease within fairly vertiginous areas. The last power is activated with the red springs and transforms our spheres into a wheel, increasing the speed of movement and also allowing us to glide after a jump to cover greater distances. At the same time, even the activation of the switches becomes more complex, with ~retractable~ jellies that must be hit with the aid of updrafts or devices that must first be moved and then ~turned on~. Pleasant but difficult As mentioned above, the Ode experience is pleasant, colorful and original, but also complicated in some aspects, first of all the slipperiness of the platform component. It is an element that the new Ubisoft Reflections project has in common with Grow Home, at this point a sort of ~signature~ of the authors which makes it difficult to reach certain points and leads to inevitable episodes of frustration when we have perhaps reached the top of a rocky structure but for a trivial mistake we slide down, in fact. Unfortunately, this interpretation lends itself to chaotic and difficult to read situations, which highlight the outlines of a production that is at times sketchy, perhaps once again entrusted to procedural mechanisms which certainly have the merit of being interesting and original, but which on the other hand dangerously away from the concept of ~good game design~. The same connection between what happens on the screen and the musical accompaniment could perhaps be more emphasized, given that the premises suggest a more central and dynamic role for the soundtrack. Sure, visually the developershave very little to reproach themselves with: Ode's aesthetic is peculiar and successful, the scenarios are well characterized and the game moves fluidly even at real 4K in the presence of an adequate configuration, with a few hiccups only during the final stages, when actually the physics of the many moving orbs becomes complicated to calculate. Too bad for the visual adjustments, which are limited to the aforementioned resolution and a series of quality presets; but after all, one shouldn't expect technical virtuosity from a production of this kind.", "date": "2017-12-05", "grade": "7.0"}
