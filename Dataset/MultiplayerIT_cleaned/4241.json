This is, in short, the story that forms the backdrop to the new adventure of Inti Creates (Igarashi only collaborated by supervising the scenario). It is not Shakespeare but it is functional to the action and, above all, it is a not too veiled reference to the plots of the Castlevania series, whose legacy is the final objective of the entire Bloodstained operation. Curse of the Moon is in fact the 8-bit-like spin-off promised during the Ritual of the Night Kickstarter campaign. In our opinion the easiest boss of all The game consists of a series of maps full of crossroads, in which monsters of all shapes and secrets are hidden at will. The first moments of the adventure are a very strong reference to the first Castlevania, of which Inti Creates enjoyed tracing part of the level design, to then take other paths after a few screens. Each level is populated by different creatures, both in appearance and in attack patterns. Here too, the Castlevania references are not lacking, but fortunately there are also original enemies, as much as they can be in a genre populated by hundreds of titles (considering the entire history). Let's do the roll call: the ghost armors are there, the archers too, the annoying jellyfish, which here are flying eyes with their tails, couldn't be missing and the little dragons that come out of the walls aren't even going to report them. Old style From the description given so far, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon may have seemed like a metroidvania to you. Don't be fooled, because although exploration is encouraged, the maps are built in a very classic way, even though they have crossroads within them, some of which become accessible only by unlocking the three additional characters, linked to the bosses of the first three levels. Some levels offer classic traps These are demons with peculiar powers, which make the action much more varied and help Zangetsu a lot in his mission. Let's get to know them: we have a demoness armed with a whip and capable of performing long slides, useful for passing through some narrow crevices; then there is a slow and weak alchemist, but with great magical powers (for example, he can create a circle of fire that protects him from enemies and their blows, or he can generate his own double); finally you unlock a vampire capable of transforming into a bat, which can fly beyond any abyss. Now it is urgent to discuss the apparently low level of difficulty of the game. Let's face it: apart from the last level, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon is not difficult at all. Especially when you have all the characters you can advance without major hitches. The reason is simple: not only do their abilities allow them to deal efficiently with any situation, but the fact that they can be exchanged in real time during the action gives the player at least four attempts for each life (to run out of a life all the players must die personages). It's too easy even playing on Veteran level (the other difficulty level that can be selected initially is casual, which is in fact a health walk), so? Quite, unless you go the more hardcore route, let's say, designed precisely for those who want a higher level challenge. By activating it (we don't explain how) Zangetsu obtains special powers (a more effective attack, a double jump and a shot), but remains essentially alone together with his single energy bar. Furthermore, not having the powers of demons, he cannot reach the most precious bonuses, such as extra lives, health extensions and others. In short, in doing so the difficulty grows a lot and, while not becoming impossible, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon begins to give great satisfaction even to the most experienced players. Back to the origins All these tricks, and others we'll talk about shortly, make Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon longer than it seems, despite only being made up of eight levels. Overall, ten hours of gameplay are easily exceeded, obviously really trying everything. For example, once all the characters have been unlocked, it is possible to replay the levels to go in search of bonuses and secrets. One of the more impressive bosses, but don't let that scare you Additionally, killing the last boss unlocks a supplementary mode, with yet another requiring you to finish the latter to activate. Not bad, considering it's a secondary title, so to speak. Speaking of bosses, the developers of Inti Create deserve credit for having themthe facts big and bad, in the sense that they are spectacular, despite the retro graphics, and have some interesting attack patterns. They are not impossible but, apart from a couple, they offer a good challenge. In particular, the final boss is really difficult (especially if you have killed the demons). From a technical point of view there is little to say: visually it is a Castlevania for the NES, obviously with a few more tricks. If you like the feel that Konami's series had on Nintendo's old console, then you'll love Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon. The same can be said of the soundtrack, really well done and which would not have disfigured in any Castlevania. If we want, one of the feasible notes to what we can still consider a minor work, is precisely its excessive resemblance to what it has already done in the past. After all, those who invested money in the Bloodstained Kickstarter campaign wanted this, and this they got. In short, the ~something new~ that is usually invoked in similar circumstances would have ended up ruining the party for many, rather than being appreciated.", "date": "2018-05-25", "grade": "8.5"}
