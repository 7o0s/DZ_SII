{"name": "Age of Empires 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-3-recensione.html", "text": "From El Dorado to the Far West We had abandoned the Spanish conquistadors a few years ago with the expansion for AoE2, few at the time could imagine that that expansion would provide the pretext for laying the foundations for the third chapter of the saga. Anyone who had imagined being able to play a title focused on the era immediately following the events narrated in the second chapter was certainly not wrong, but few could have imagined that the choice of scenario would have fallen precisely on that new world that had already been visited by the last expansion pack. After all, for the historical period (which goes from the end of the Middle Ages to the industrial revolution) which continent, more than the New World, could lend itself better to the narration of warlike events and clashes in the open field? In this varied and vast scenario, capable of embracing territories of all kinds, the player is called to control one of the European powers engaged in those times in the conquest of the new continent (except for the Russians, who apparently never set foot in the Americas in the guise of conquerors, but who, for reasons that can only be explained by the desire to introduce a power of equal importance to the others, have also been included in the game). A robust campaign One of the strengths of the title is undoubtedly the complex campaign divided into 24 missions, which leads the player to take part in events related to the conquest of the continent, without touching the epic and epochal clashes that made that particular historical period famous . The script that binds the missions is well structured in a subtle and intelligent way, proposing unusual and amusing plots that allow you to go back along the spirals of history and go through eras of profound political and technological changes. The missions appear heterogeneous and present a good climax in terms of complexity and gradual introduction of novelties at the level of the game, even if each mission has clear primary objectives there are a long series of very entertaining and not always obvious submissions such as the recovery of treasures , scattered across the maps and always kept at bay by fierce guards who can vary from ferocious bloodthirsty beasts to handfuls of men put in charge of some important object. The missions appear heterogeneous and present a good climax in terms of complexity and the gradual introduction of novelties at the game level A robust campaign The traditional array of modes for the single player has been retained; we will therefore find the skirmish mode, the favorite of all those players who do not want to follow a structured story, preferring a faster and more immediate approach with which to confront in free battles crossing, in a single game session, the various historical periods. As for the multiplayer front, AoE3 offers the possibility of playing games on the LAN or through ESO, which stands for Ensemble Studios Ondine, or proprietary servers on which to play on a large-scale network. Gameplay: tradition and innovation The gameplay of Age of Empires remains almost unchanged, while presenting some improvements that make the title capable of keeping up with the times. The game structure is based on the by now outdated system of collecting the resources necessary to build buildings, recruit units and develop the search for upgrades. Having abandoned the numerous types of resources known in the past, AoE now focuses on only three: food for population maintenance, timber for the construction of buildings, ships and war machines, gold for the purchase of specific goods and advanced development of units and buildings. Resource-gathering workers are no longer compelled to commute to transport materials, but are able to grow reserves by staying on the job. The combat-trained units have armaments based above all on ranged attacks, slowly adapting to the abandonment of white weapons in favor of more modern and deadly firearms. For this reason, right from the start, it will be easier to find crossbowmen in the ranks of your men instead of warriors armed with saber and sword. One of the absolute novelties of AoE3, which absolutely cannot be overlooked, is without a doubt the introduction of mother cities. Let's try to grasp the concept that underlies this innovation: given that the plot of the game unfolds in the lands of the New World, Old Europe could not be overlooked, in fact we must remember that the armies, located in that particular historical period on the new territories Americans, were stationed there to give honor and glory to the European powers. For Diving the idea of the distant but omnipresent relationship of the great empires, the developers have thought of introducing the concept of the mother city. At the beginning of each game, in fact, the player is called to go through a screen that represents, in fact, the mother city. In this preliminary phase of the game, the player has the possibility of interacting with a passive element capable of acting in parallel with the actual game. Gameplay: tradition and innovation The mother city has the appearance of a large European city of the time, some of the buildings present represent particular aspects of the management of their domains. Each player has a series of upgrades and bonuses available, called ~cards~, all of which form the ~deck~. The player can buy new cards according to the progress made in the game. In the game the player has collection points in which to receive the bonuses sent from the mother city, at any time it is possible to go to the capital screen and activate the request to send such bonuses or reinforcements; once the time relating to the shipment has ended, the requested aid will appear near the collection point. This kind of aid sent by the mother city represents real trump cards on which the player can draw to change the fate of the game. From a strategic and gameplay point of view, this aspect adds an element of unpredictability to your moves, capable of making the game even more interesting. From a strategic and gameplay point of view, the ~Mother City~ adds an element of unpredictability to its moves, capable of making the game even more interesting. Gameplay: tradition and innovation The presence of Native Americans is a further surprise in the general economy of the game. The natives, grouped by nation, while not taking part in the main events of the game, can interact with the factions by providing their services or sharing upgrades and new technologies. In certain phases of the game, this element is the key to achieving victory. New strategies The title introduces new strategic approaches that touch on various management aspects. AoE3 gains a deeper nuance with the management of alliances and related commercial relationships. The ally can in fact request military and economic help by sending messages. To maintain trade relations it is necessary to gain control points on the trade routes scattered on the map. Once a control point has been built, it is possible to send aid or sell one's own resources through a real market which also provides for the fluctuation of the value of raw materials according to demand. To make the title more interesting and attractive, Ensemble has well thought of enhancing the war aspect, providing a large number of units and upgrades. Unfortunately, however, we do not find tools for advanced management of deployments, or rather, it is not possible to choose the type of formation, but the troops are able to organize themselves by choosing the best one for each occasion, a choice that winks at the average player, but which could make strategy purists turn up their noses. Although AoE3 appears as a mature product and the signs of a production that spares little expense are evident, the wonder remains for some sensational gaps. One of the first glitches we noticed is the inability to occupy buildings with units. To make the title more interesting and attractive, Ensemble has well thought of enhancing the war aspect, providing a large number of units and upgrades. New strategies In the first mission of the proposed campaign, the player is called upon to defend the city walls from enemy attacks; having a platoon of crossbowmen available, and noticing some ladders leaning against the walls, one would think that the best way to repel an attack with units capable of effective ranged shots is to have the units climb the walls and try the defense as in any self-respecting siege. The disappointment comes when one realizes that ladders and watchtowers, as well as walls equipped with parapets, have only a choreographic function and are not usable in any way. Which is strange and disheartening if you think that similar implementations have been present for years in the modern concept of RTS. Nonetheless, AoE3 is capable of combining similar shortcomings with a massive use of the Havoc physics engine (which made Max Payne 2 great) giving the game an aggressive appeal, with breathtaking graphic effects. A mortar round deals unimaginable damage to units, literally blowing them apart and shattering enemy lines. The same fate awaits the elements of the landscape and the buildings, capable of cashing inthe blows in an ever different way, thus creating ever new situations. Once again we collide with perhaps too high expectations, and we remain a little disappointed to note that explosions of buildings and assorted structural failures have no effect on the units located nearby which seem to be able to survive the implosion of a stronghold without suffering just one scratch. Technical apparatus The artificial intelligence front opens a breach in the heart of the game, because if you marvel at the intelligent response of the units to certain stimuli, you end up speechless in the face of inappropriate behavior of the units left alone. The management of the ~fog of war~ then may not exalt the purists of the strategy given that the units seem to have a sort of ~common sight~. In practice, the management of the view is not related to the individual units, but to the player's total view, so that it is possible to find oneself in front of units that attack targets covered by barriers or hidden behind trees. The management of the shadows is really well done and in the missions set in wooded locations it is possible to grasp its maximum expression. Technical apparatus The graphic design appears to be of a high level, even if we want to maintain a certain link with the past, proposing an enhanced and revised version of the models known in the previous chapter. The proposed settings are heterogeneous and very rich, the maps well made and cared for; it ranges from the South American jungle to the desolate prairies of the west touching very suggestive scenarios with natural elements of all relief, such as canyons and large waterways. Water which, moreover, constitutes one of the strengths of the title having been created with extreme care in its effects of transparency and in the play of light. The management of the shadows is really well done and in the missions set in wooded locations it is possible to grasp its maximum expression. A note of merit also goes to the attempt to make the mother city a totally personalized and gratifying environment also from an aesthetic point of view, in fact it is possible to position scenic elements to your liking to create a player-friendly city: a really pleasant feature, even if absolutely devoid of feedback on the game plan. The total translation into Italian completes the aesthetic picture by providing a good sound system totally doubled in thickness, capable of easily supporting the compelling plot of the single player campaign. As far as hardware requests are concerned, AoE3 demonstrates a certain flexibility by adapting to machines that are not particularly demanding; the game, which occupies about 3 Gb when installed, was tested on a medium-low level configuration (1.4 GHz, 512 MB Ram, with ATI Radeon 9700 video card), but no slowdown was found, although having had to give up some graphic frills. Final comment Overall Age of Empires 3 looks like a solid title that can easily lay the foundations on one of the most popular RTS sagas of recent times. Made with care, it presents some interesting innovative aspects, such as the introduction of the Mother Cities, but suffers from some structural deficiencies that undermine its primacy in the RTS field. However, we would like to recommend this title to all those players who have followed the series since its inception, as overall AoE3 proves to be a good RTS. Only a bitter taste remains in the mouth for not having been able to cry out for a miracle, but you know, these are not things that happen every day. Pros Consolidated gameplay but not without surprises Enthralling single player campaign full of ideas Completely in Italian Cons Use of the physics engine almost exclusively relegated to scenographic effects Little freedom in the use of cameras Artificial intelligence not always brilliant Microsoft once again rides Ensemble bringing to the public a new chapter in the strategic saga, flagship of PC videogame productions of the monolithic Redmond software house. After having bewitched the crowd for years with strategic games focused on the history of ancient peoples, creating a sort of continuity between one title and the next, Microsoft seemed to have abandoned the original idea when, with the release of Age of Mythology, it hijacked the bandwagon towards mythological shores that allowed the title to take advantage, without many compliments, of fantasy elements that would otherwise be unthinkable in a purely historical RTS. Spin-off aside, the wait for the already announced sequel had become heavy in recent times and so Microsoft was able to quell the riotous popular uprisings by providing the maniacs of the saga with a new piece of this gigantic puzzle.", "date": "2005-11-18", "grade": null}
