There was a lot of pizza, and there was no shortage of drinks, but those who were ready to beat Hadoken left and right turned pale as soon as the Wii Party logo appeared on the TV. It took a while before I was able to calm down the tipsy cronies and finally regain control of the situation. A brief introduction that gives an idea of how party games on Wii have slowly lost their original polish, and how much this new Nintendo game has been received with sufficiency since its announcement at E3 2009. Even many of the players loyal to Mario Party turned up their noses as the mustachioed plumber and his friends were replaced by hordes of hobbling Miis. In short, Nintendo has re-proposed a new salad of casual games after the half-mess made with Wii Play and shortly after the release of Wii Sports Resort: was there really a need? Judging by the reactions of the three guests, by the cries of joy probably stimulated by the alcohol, and by having invited themselves the following evening as well, it would seem so. It's a Mii! The very first challenge for Nintendo was therefore to create a game that had much more charisma and appeal than the previous Wii Play, but that didn't miss those colorful characters and that unique atmosphere that has always characterized the Mario gang Party. Not that this was a big deal for the casual user Wii Party is aimed at. After all, the Kyoto-based company has clearly decided to target that audience which, with the various family games released from the birthplace of the Wii to today, is used to impersonating an awkward caricature of itself. Or Chuck Norris. In any case, it seems that the goal has been successful: surprisingly, although there have been no obvious graphic upheavals and although the game is stylistically identical to the previous ones, this time the Miis no longer look like puppets with big heads, but characters with their own personalities. The work done by the developers from this point of view is subtle, yet quite evident: leaving out the slightly more particular clothes, what really struck was the amount of new expressions and animations, nicer and much less flat than in the past. Small steps forward have also been made in the creation of the various scenarios, but the evolution should be framed not on a technical level, but on a stylistic one: clearly there are exceptions, but many of the mini-games present are pleasant to look at and much more detailed if you it compares to the visual death of certain scenarios present in Wii Play. However, do not make the mistake of understanding Wii Party simply as an updated version of the latter. With more than eighty mini-games, the often ingenious way in which the Wiimote is used and the amount of options available, the new Nintendo title is exactly what Wii Play would have been in a perfect world. This one, however, is simply a different game altogether. A riot of minigames Based on a fun progression system in the style of classic board games, certainly familiar to those who have played the various Mario Parties, the title offers an immense amount of mini-games divided into three macro-areas: the first, that of Group Games , predictably includes all those challenges designed for four players. Of course, in the absence of friends, the possibility of being able to play alone is also given, but it is obvious that in this case the experience is nothing short of castrated. Some of the minigames are really hilarious, like the one where you have to balance on a boat until one of the players falls; or the extremely frenetic one in which you get stuck in a cemetery and have to escape from zombies; or, again, a game on rails reminiscent of Luigi's Mansion, in which you get rid of the ghosts that haunt a villa using the torch as a weapon. As mentioned, out of such a large number of challenges it was foreseeable to meet some less original and fun than the others, but fortunately all the games are unlocked from the start, thus giving the possibility to avoid the more boring ones. The Pair Games mode is dedicated specifically to sessions between two players, and here too there are welcome surprises, but some of the most interesting ideas from the developers are found in Games at Home. The mini-games in this section invite participants to interact with the room they are in in more or less original ways: one of these, for example, asks whoever is on duty to hide the Wiimote in one place while the others wait outside , after which, helpi by the sound that the controller makes from time to time, they will have to find it again. Do you want dispassionate advice? Don't hide it out the window. Note of demerit instead goes to the lack of a large online component: if challenging other players was asking too much, at least a ranking system would not have hurt.", "date": "2010-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
