Interactive's Batman: Arkham Knight. The new package, the first of a series of three that will arrive during this month (there are no official dates yet) is the classic extra content which, from the point of view of interest, ideally positions itself halfway between a discreet add- on is nonessential content, as we'll see later. In fact, not even this expands the stories of Arkham through the events of some supporting character of the Dark Knight or of the superhero himself, nor does it offer who knows what wonders or experiences, but only serves to expand the offer relating to the ~races~ outside the main campaign. Crime Fighter Challenge #1 contains six new AR challenges for the Dark Knight and his allies, focused on training for non-stop fighting and stealthy raids as a predator. The DLC is available from September 1st on PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE, free for season ticket holders and 1.99 for everyone else. Six new AR Challenges in Batman: Arkham Knight September DLC. Will they be enough to make it palatable? Action and stealth Going into the details of the offer, in the first challenge entitled ~Assault on the Gotham Police~, Batman and Robin have to contend with a large group of Arkham Knight men. It's the classic battle where the opponents arrive in waves that are increasingly better equipped and resistant to blows, and where the combination of attacks, gadgets and duo combos become the best ~medicine~ to get rid of enemies. In the ~Newton's Pendulum~ simulation, Nightwing is found alone in Newton's amusement park. This training is also focused on freeflow combat, and the ~traditional~ shots must also be alternated with the weapons available to the character to resist the attacks of the opponents, until time runs out. Once the test is completed, a certain score is obtained which also takes into account the eliminated enemies. The third challenge stars Catwoman against the Riddler's robots. There are two types: the red ones that are normally destroyed with combos while the blue ones, charged with electricity and therefore lethal if hit with punches and kicks, must first be transformed into red with a whip and only subsequently destroyed. ~Teen Titan~ puts Robin back on the scene, this time alone. The objective of this challenge is to resist as long as possible the horde of enemies that will follow one another on the screen and who will gradually become more and more difficult to eliminate, thanks to the presence of mid-bosses and soldiers armed with knives, rifles and so on. With ~Destructions~ the scenario finally changes and the battle becomes slightly more tactical, at least on paper. The action takes place in the Metrovision construction site, an area which for compliance almost pushes action from above: the mission consists in eliminating the enemies on guard in the shortest possible time, trying not to be discovered and preventing them from placing turrets. However, to get a good score and complete the level in a few seconds (the mission is timed from the moment the first enemy is eliminated), you can also opt for a more direct action, using smoke bombs on sentinel groups to attack them in the open so that, by satisfying the three conditions imposed by the challenge, you can get the maximum score. Better in this sense the last AR challenge, namely ~Financial Bankruptcy~, which takes up the theme of the bank robberies of Two-Face's henchmen from the main campaign. Here too, therefore, Batman's goal is to stop thirteen criminals in the shortest possible time to get the best score and earn the coveted stars, focusing on quick and painless stealth action. At this point, as you will have understood by reading the article, the ~Crime Fighter Challenge n.1~ package can be considered quite interesting, but only by those who like to spend some time (half an hour if you have some practice ) to try to break every record and overcome certain competitions. The price, then, for those of the latter who do not have the season pass is also inviting, just 1.99 euros. However six AR challenges, which among other things reproduce situations already seen and played such as bank robberies, are really too few and too little variety to recommend their indiscriminate purchase to all users. Thus, as in the review of the previous DLC, our advice is to buy the package only if you really want to collect everything in the world of Batman: Arkham Knight. If not, you can just leave it alone.", "date": "2015-09-04", "grade": null}
