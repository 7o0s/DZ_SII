So let's find out if carRage will have been able to establish itself as a new reference for the genre... Despite some flaws, carRage proves to be a valid and well packaged arcade Carstreets of carrage In the post-apocalyptic scenario imagined by Velcro Games, the few survivors of the human race have wisely decided to kill each other in deadly races aboard fully armed vehicles, and the user plays just one of these distinguished gentlemen. After typing your name and taking a quick look at the tutorial that illustrates the various functions of the main menu, you immediately jump into the fray and can immediately appreciate the main strengths and weaknesses of caRRage. The remarkable graphics of the product must certainly be ascribed to the first category, which combines impeccable fluidity with a very pleasant attention to detail: the cars are defined down to the smallest details, the settings appear convincing even if they don't shine for variety (the classic side effects of 'atomic apocalypse) and the lighting effects and explosions duly punctuate the skirmishes between the six cars in the race. As happened in Death Rally and other similar titles, the player must try not only to cross the finish line before the opponents, but also to use the supplied weapons (rockets, mines and turbos) to get the better of the opponents, an activity that at the same time a sadistic satisfaction and materials and experience points useful for improving your own four-wheeled instrument of death. Velcro Games certainly didn't invent anything new, but the carRage gameplay works properly, even if you have to come to terms with a control system that can certainly be improved: the default setting forces you to use a virtual steering wheel that is genuinely very uncomfortable, but even switching to the more classic two on-screen buttons to manage the steering, the feeling is that of having an all too ~slippery~ car in your hands. The accuracy of the other on-screen keys is also not flawless, especially as regards the three icons delegated to launch weapons, which often end up being activated inadvertently. A little free, a lot of play In terms of the amount of content, carRage proves to have the credentials absolutely in order: the game can count on 11 tracks, eight vehicles, nine types of weapons and over 70 modifications that can be made to the car that affect aesthetics or performance. In addition to the classic races, the game offers two alternative modes, the first which puts the user at the controls of an armored vehicle that must reach the finish line while avoiding the attacks of the opponents and the second in which six participants in an arena must fight to win the largest number of crystals: the latter is the weakest of the package because it is particularly affected by the aforementioned imprecision of the control system, but the attempt by the developers to focus something also on variety is undoubtedly appreciable. The single player campaign counts on the beauty of 54 events, but the potential longevity of carRage inevitably depends on the user's aptitude to spend something on in-app purchases or to undergo intense grind sessions to recover money and materials: it doesn't take in fact, a lot to notice that the level of the opponents tends to rise much faster than the natural enhancement of one's vehicles, making it simply impossible to win races without the proverbial little help at a certain point. At least the game does not exaggerate in advertising the offers of its online store, nor does it deny those who do not want to spend anything to scrape together resources with single races or local multiplayer games.", "date": "2015-12-21", "grade": "7.9"}
