{"name": "Marcus come Solid Snake?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69234-gears-of-war-2-dark-corners-marcus-come-solid-snake.html", "text": "The novelty of this Dark Corners, already important and unpublished in itself, is that for the first time Epic Games has decided to release an exclusive and playable content of one of its games through the Live Marketplace, for Microsoft's Xbox 360. It's not just about additional maps, but also about a juicy, unpublished and pleasant chapter of the main campaign. Playable in single player or co-op, just like the others. It is Cliffy B himself, the main creative mind behind the Gears of War project, who introduces us with a video the ~cut scene~ from the main story: Bleszinski explains that sometimes, during the production of such a complex and multifaceted game, some parts of it can be edited, cut and deleted regardless of their quality. Sometimes it's a matter of time, others of narration, often it's a question of game design: the fact is that an unpublished piece of Gears of War 2 will soon be available on the Marketplace, the plot of which fits exactly into the Locust collection as we are directed at the heart of their base of operations. In the locust den In the company of our trusted friend Dom we thus enter the den of the fearsome Locusts, full of Theron Guards, Soldiers, Snipers, and even a gigantic Brumak to guard the main bridge. Our mission is to infiltrate the headquarters through the main underground highway. As soon as the chapter starts, we can make the first, important choice: advance with guns blazing by immersing ourselves in a bloodbath, or face the enemy lines stealthily, almost as if we were playing Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell. after all as we prefer. By opting for stealth mode, our two heroes put on Theron armor, momentarily ~borrowed~ from two newly killed guards, and infiltrate their enemies trying not to attract attention. Or rather, in the nose, since if we get too close to the Locusts we can be discovered by our smell. For half the chapter we advance crawling and starting again, hiding, looking for covers to distract the guards and slipping away from the corners: a certainly new approach for the series that will intrigue many. In the end, without wanting to mention any spoilers, there will be an old acquaintance 'finding' and the cover will be skipped in favor of the more frenetic action, right up to the very end. By choosing the assault mode instead, you proceed exclusively by shooting and covering yourself, as Gears of War has always accustomed us, with many particularly crowded and demanding moments. The wonders of Unreal Engine 3 show themselves all, showing on the screen tons of enemies of all kinds, effects, polygons galore and zero slowdowns even in the most chaotic situations. The artistic direction is masterful: the commitment to recreate the glories of an alien civilization is evident in the structures, in the architecture of the Locusts and in the style very similar to that invented by H.R. Giger for Alien. The level design of this part of the game is not excellent: in essence, it is a question of following a ~highway~ in a straight line up to the base of the Locusts. Of course, the road is not smooth and smooth, but bristling with enemies who stand guard at special checkpoints. The level is divided into sequential blocks to be tackled one after the other, divided by armored doors that separate one area from the other. It almost feels like playing the ~Horde~ mode, but advancing from time to time, facing enemy flurries and frontal attacks. Every now and then the action is broken up by some diversion: opening doors, raising passages, distracting the Locusts. All very simple actions, in perfect harmony with the action approach of the game, but which sometimes turn out to be a little superficial in the approach. Apart from some hidden weapons, the level does not offer many possibilities for exploration, research for collectibles, surprises, and so we limit ourselves to proceeding in a fairly linear way. In total, completing the ~cut scene~ will keep us busy for about an hour and a half (one for the assault mode, about half in stealth), slightly less than a ~classic~ chapter like those on disc. Xbox 360 goals After downloading the update, the maximum score obtainable by Gears of War 2 will be increased by 250 points, to be unlocked through 13 new achievements. Of these, only 3 (for 75 points) are linked to the cut scene, while the rest can be obtained by playing multiplayer on each of the seven unpublished maps, gaining experience, winning matches in particular conditions. One more reason to fully enjoy this little expansion. War on all fronts By downloading the package called ~All Fronts~, you getall the maps previously released in the first downloads of the Marketplace (Flashback, Combustible and Snowblind), plus seven other unpublished ones, for a total of 19 maps. For those who have already obtained them previously, the Dark Corners package provides only the new ones (in addition of course to the new single player chapter. The seven maps in the package are called Allfathers Garden, Memorial, Sanctuary, War Machine, Highway, Way Station, Nowhere; The latter is certainly one of the most curious because it takes us to fight in the middle of a desert area, a small village lost in the American countryside and now reduced to a ~ghost town~ at the mercy of the sun, sandstorms and locusts. The decadent suggestions continue in ~Memorial~, a map dedicated to the heroes of the great war, where you can admire statues and buildings named after the brave ones who fought for humanity. There is not only a head-on collision in the new locations but also a certain dose of stealth, just like in the cut chapter of the story: in ~Way Station~, for example, we have to be very careful not to step on the explosive mines with which the battlefield is completely strewn, adding to the game a tactical component in more. Also beautiful is ~Allfathers Garder~, dedicated to the COG forces, which thanks to its countless shelters, stairways, walls and rooms offers even more ~close~ and faster gameplay than usual. The ~All Fronts Collection~ package, which includes all the additional maps of Gears of War 2 and the ~Dark Corners~ package with only seven unreleased maps and the cut chapter of the story will be available starting July 28th at a cost of 1600 Microsoft Points and 1200 Microsoft Points.", "date": "2009-07-24", "grade": "8.8"}
