{"name": "Rainbow Six Siege: Para Bellum", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-siege-para-bellum-recensione-200640.html", "text": "We were anxiously awaiting the new season of Rainbow Six and the reason is obvious: this time Italy would have been the protagonist in all respects. That's right, after having put up with operators from countries all over the world for two years, the third year brings as a gift two Italian soldiers, two carabinieri ready to wreak havoc in the meta with new gadgets and weapons, but also a brand new map set in Tuscany. The launch on the servers did not go very smoothly, with some matchmaking problems, but the situation quickly returned to normal and as we write the piece the latest hotfixes should have put an end to the initial jolt. So let's go and evaluate the new introductions and take a closer look at the novelties of the gameplay. The best defense is defense After Leon and Finka it was reasonable to expect some sort of balance between attackers and defenders and therefore the two new operators Maestro and Alibi go to flesh out the defensive slots left uncovered. The idea of this new season is to add positioning gadgets, a sensible choice and one that we are very curious to understand if it will be able to move the goal. At the moment it is in fact impossible to understand if the penetration of Maestro and Alibi in the initial choice of the roster of the teams will be massive, given that, as always happens in these cases, the desire to try out the new characters ensures that they are substantially always present in all matches, ranked and unranked. Before setting off to evaluate the balance of the two carabinieri, however, let's seize the opportunity to talk about the new pick and ban system introduced in custom games. In fact, you will now have the possibility to decide four operators, two for the attack and two for the defence, which cannot be used during the match: a complex choice to make given that when the sides change and you find yourself with reversed roles, the agents they will continue to remain unavailable, forcing you to make strategic choices judiciously. This new mechanism is also being introduced in the main tournaments, leaving ranked games excluded for the moment. A ban system was to be expected and is very welcome given the growing number of operators and is the most practical and fastest way for Ubisoft to avoid abuse of the strongest characters, while simultaneously providing the game with a revolution in the meta and better balance. A due and indispensable act at this point. Let's put it this way, probably if this ban system were already active, to date the first two operators to be eliminated from the game would be Maestro and Alibi, not because of their extreme effectiveness, mind you, but because of the players' stupid habit of taking two characters with whom you are impractical and jump into ranked just to try the new game, a choice that often spells a foregone conclusion in advance. But Ubisoft has also intervened on dropshots by modifying their mechanics and making them more difficult to execute while not completely removing them from the game. Being a Master is not an Alibi Maestro is the first Italian operator of this new update and is the second operator after Tachanka to be able to use fixed turrets as a defensive gadget. However, the Evil Eyes are not limited to damage alone and, above all, they do not require the Maestro to remain motionless in an open point to fire. In fact, they can be controlled remotely like any camera and, although the damage is not particularly high, they are able to annoy attackers for a prolonged period of time. Maestro has two interesting choices for weapons: the shotgun allows him to become a very dangerous defender in tight spaces and to garrison areas well, with a map vision superior to any other operator, and the ALDA 5.56 with ACOG becomes monstrous at medium distances. As far as the secondary ones are concerned, however, we find ourselves for the first time in front of a shotgun pistol with some interesting mechanics. The damage up close is high, as is the rate of fire, but the spread of the bullets prevents you from making effective headshots, even during CQC. Going back to talking about the cameras, know that these are indestructible until they open the hermetic doors to fire but they can be destroyed by the use of explosives or weapons with a devastating impact such as Sledge's hammer, or still deactivated with grenades EMP or stolen by Dokkaebi's hacking technology, even if he can't use them to shoot. The brightest idea, and one of the most effective tactics seen so far, is to place the turrets outside the buildings, so as to be able to destroy any breach charges on the buildings.walls or prevent Operators from entering through windows by taking large percentages of their hit points. Alibi for his part has both an excellent submachine gun and an ACS12 for close quarters combat and the same Baliff 410 also supplied by Maestro. A pity they weren't outfitted with Italian weaponry, a failing that might disappoint those who hoped the setting would bring even more elements of our armed forces into play. It is the Alibi gadgets that make it unique, as often happens in these cases, gadgets that we defined as particularly interesting during our first test but which showed various weaknesses after more intensive use by the operator. In fact, the copies produced by the holographic viewers do not exactly reflect Alibi in all respects, quickly becoming recognizable to the expert eye of the most experienced players. Let's start with the skin, therefore, which is less detailed and refined than that of the Italian operator, but the biggest problems arise when analyzing the weapon, which does not acquire the accessories, remaining essentially always and only with the iron sight. If the recognisability of the copies is therefore lower than expected, the usefulness of Alibi remains undisputed. However, fighting against her wastes precious time and the best players will be able to quickly swap positions with the copies to completely disorient the opponent. The initial tactics, which consisted of remaining essentially motionless in the same room with the copies, quickly vanished, now leaving room for much more dynamic and interesting strategies, showing a surprising operator for those who love playing with the opponents' minds. This time, no extra modes to accompany the launch of the new season, but a new free map for all players, even for those who have never spent a single extra penny beyond the basic version of the game. Villa is set in the Tuscan hills and carries all the clichs of our country. We have a splendid sunset location surrounded by greenery with an abnormal amount of entrances and also a good verticality given by the three levels of play, but above all a very high destructibility given the quantity of wooden walls present. Villa is undoubtedly one of the most geometrically complex maps in Rainbow Six Siege, resulting extremely intense and beautiful to play, a component of competitive matches that will give life to some of the most exciting matches of the season.", "date": "2018-06-10", "grade": "S.V."}
