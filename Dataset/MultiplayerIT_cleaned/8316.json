Founded seven years ago in Vancouver, the independent software house made itself more than noticed with N+ and the two Shanks, but this Mark Of The Ninja is certainly one of their most interesting projects and another winning collaboration with Microsoft. In the role of a fearsome ninja we find ourselves going through a long series of levels trying to complete the various objectives, but above all move and strike without attracting attention. Unlike the various Ninja Gaiden, the title goes against the trend by shunning the head-on collision and glorifying the healthy and old stealth dynamics at the highest levels. Let's see how. Look mom, I walk on walls! Mark Of The Ninja is what we could define as a side scroller game, the action is represented in a two-dimensional style just like Shank, in the same way the title offers an exceptional characterization, very similar to a comic, with splendid animations and characters full of details . Unlike Shank, however, here we do not cut everything that moves into slices, although our ninja is armed with the trusty sword and knows very well how to use it, but a tactical and elusive approach is continually facilitated to complete the various tasks that they are awarded during the adventure. The levels culminate in the spectacular killing of our target, the ideal final boss, usually protected by guards and security systems so exaggerated as to make even Tom Cruise shiver. The charismatic protagonist never utters a word and sports an infinite series of not very reassuring tattoos, the narrative elements are rather provided by one of our colleagues, who accompanies us on the raids commenting on the various situations that are proposed to us. The story is purely ancillary and orbits around the clash between the ninja clan and a ferocious criminal organization armed to the teeth, we will discover firsthand that things are not always as they seem. The various stages offer challenges of increasing difficulty and are full of secrets, ancient artifacts to recover and special rooms that have sections focused on puzzle elements. All this brings the total duration up to eight hours and beyond, a fantastic goal for a Live Arcade title and further enriched by the high replayability, as there is almost never a single solution to overcome the various levels and curiosity leads to experimenting methods alternative. Xbox 360 goals Mark Of The Ninja features 400 player points, spread across 30 objectives. To get half of it, it is enough to complete the adventure, while for the others it is necessary to carry out a precise series of actions that will take away a considerable amount of time. Good luck! Cross borders We can say without a doubt that the game does justice to the myth of the ninja by restoring him to the role of an astute and invisible figure, rather than an honorable warrior, ready to kill unscrupulously from behind or lure enemies into deadly traps. To achieve this Mark Of The Ninja embraces a radical style that may not appeal to everyone, the entire game is characterized by limited visibility, forcing us to interpret the scenario through a focused and admirable series of visuals. Just to give an example, by leaning against a door or looking out from a grate we can enjoy a limited viewing area without the risk of being identified by the guards, or we can summarily guess their position through the sound of footsteps and voices. The experience becomes almost mental, with long periods of seeing us totally immobile in the darkness, studying the best way to continue. Being identified leads to almost certain death (although not mathematical), in fact, a few rifle shots are enough to throw us lifeless to the ground, a characteristic that certainly will not please those looking for daring action. Such a structure inevitably leads to a trial & error type system, however any danger to the usability of the product has been brilliantly solved by the developers through an efficient system of check points, which does not force you to repeat long passages, and the very high quality of the level design, which as mentioned turns out to be so elastic that it can be interpreted by the player, with often surprising results. Such a high quality level overshadows the negligible defects, such as the control system which does not always facilitate the player. Technically, as already mentioned, we are dealing with a small aesthetic jewel, a noir comic that alternates high quality animated sequences with a visual style that bizarrely mixes East and West. Frankly, it goes onmore to see the newfangled next level rather than discovering the background of a story that is not particularly engaging. The game is spoken in English with Italian subtitles, while online support is limited to scoreboards.", "date": "2012-09-19", "grade": "9.0"}
