{"name": "Velocity Ultra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121638-velocity-ultra-un-ritorno-fulmineo.html", "text": "If it is now clear how heavily the indie scene has influenced Sony's strategy to enrich the software park of its platforms (and to keep a certain portable console alive), this marriage has seen a series of uncertainties in the past. The minis initiative is an example of this: what on paper would have allowed even the smallest developers to publish their games on PSP, PlayStation 3 and Vita without major barriers to entry has instead proved to be too little visible a showcase and with a large number of limitations. The result is that, despite rivers of positive reviews, even a pearl like Velocity has ended up going unnoticed. And all in all, with over one hundred thousand copies sold, FuturLab's shoot'em up fared better than many others. With the possibility of publishing on PSN without the limits of the Minis program, the Brighton team thus wanted to re-propose its acclaimed shooter in a native version for Vita, completely revised from a graphic point of view and with some small innovations in terms of content and controls. Little new features other than a nice facelift, but Velocity Ultra is still one of the best shoot'em ups on the Vita Playstation 3 trophies Trophies that are unlocked simply by continuing in the campaign represent a small part. In fact, the vast majority of the challenges concern the performance of a certain level, the number of enemies killed and the ships saved following certain criteria. Obviously among the toughest Trophies they require you to get the best mark in every single level and score the perfect score in each area. Instead of proposing a real sequel, the team led by James Marsden preferred to embellish that Velocity released just a year ago, abandoning the pixel art graphics and preferring a more elegant and clean high resolution vector. This means that the levels, mechanics and game modes are exactly the same as seen in the original game. Even in its Ultra version, Velocity remains one of the most fun and fast-paced scrolling shooters of recent times, implementing just a couple of original ideas and putting them to good use thanks to an excellent level design. The player is in control of the Quarp Jet, a small spaceship capable of teleporting from one part of the screen to another. The ability can be used to escape rivers of bullets or to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the map, perhaps because they are protected by a shield or blocked by a wall. However, it is often necessary to deactivate the deflector shields before being able to continue, and this is where the fifty levels available come to the fore. Shield generators are not only scattered around the level, but often also need to be destroyed in the correct order, and so the player must place portals at strategic points to teleport back and forth across the stage. What would otherwise be a traditional shoot'em up, with aliens to exterminate, bullets to zigzag through and power-ups to collect, thus turns into a sort of puzzle game, in which you use the map to find hidden points and figure out the correct path within increasingly articulated levels. It is an elegant and simple formula, improved and made even more intuitive thanks to the characteristics of Vita. For example, it is now possible to touch the touch screen in the exact point where you want to teleport, a solution that forces you to move your thumb away from the front buttons for an instant, but which after a few minutes of practice proves to be much faster and more immediate. The same goes for the bombs, which this time can also be launched by tilting the second stick in the preferred direction. Again, it's a subtle difference, but the feel has improved so much that we now prefer to use bombs even in those cases where, in the original Velocity, we would never have interrupted the primary fire. In this case, much of the credit goes to the fan community and the pressure on the development team, who initially didn't think these additions were a good idea. For the rest, the control system has remained almost intact, and in fact the need for major changes was not felt: Velocity Ultra is pleasant, fast and above all fun, allowing you to finish a level in a few seconds or several minutes depending on the goals you want to achieve. Receiving the most valuable medal requires you to save every single ship hidden in the scenario, taking the shortest time possible, totaling the highest score and reaching the end without losing a single life. If the limitations imposed on PlayStation minis did not allowto FuturLab to insert online leaderboard and support for Trophies in the first Velocity, this remake makes up for it in a big way: on the one hand there are online rankings, divided between the global ones and the friends list, on the other a whole series of objectives have been added that try to add a few more small challenges once the campaign is completed. There was also some tweaking in terms of interface and sounds, but the most obvious novelty is still the one mentioned at the beginning: not that the pixel art of Velocity wasn't up to par, mind you, but when you move at high speed along the level, throwing bombs in the midst of chain explosions, the final effect is undoubtedly more successful and fluid.", "date": "2013-07-30", "grade": "8.8"}
