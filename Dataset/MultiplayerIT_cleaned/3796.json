{"name": "Linn: Path of the Orchards", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/linn-path-of-the-orchards-recensione.html", "text": "Linn: Path of the Orchards presents itself as a curious and suggestive mix, inevitably contaminated from an aesthetic point of view by titles such as Monument Valley, but at the same time strong in action platform mechanics very close to the tradition of Crescent Moon Games. The plot of the game, which puts us in the role of a guardian of nature engaged in the collection of a certain number of mysterious fragments, serves only as a pretext for presenting a traditional type structure, which is based on the completion of the levels and on the score obtained unlocking of new scenarios, in the context of a campaign consisting of four different worlds for a total of fifty-six levels. What changes from one area to another is not only the delightful pastel shades of the background, but also the complexity of the puzzles, the presence of new devices and situations that are difficult to solve at the first attempt, especially where the aim is to collect all the objects , including extra ones. The gameplay is presented in the form of a two-dimensional action platform with all the trappings: the protagonist can jump, double jump and dash in mid-air, but also quickly return to the ground if needed. The platforms on which we move are in fact subject to continuous movements, mainly rotations that change the structure of each stage, revealing the concrete risk of falling after having taken the wrong measurements or wrong timing of the leaps. Puzzles and aesthetics Our goal in Linn: Path of the Orchards is to collect as many fragments as possible in each level and reach the exit. Succeeding in the enterprise gradually becomes more difficult, given that the platforms increase the speed of rotation, change the direction of the same, build new structures for a few moments only to then disassemble them and return to the starting configuration, all while perhaps we are in the middle 'air. There is therefore a lot of platform action, but also a clearly ~trial & error~ system that encourages us to experiment with each stage in search of the perfect strategy: it is no coincidence that, at the end of the level, the game not only counts the fragments collected but also the number of movements we made to get to the exit. In short, there is a perfect solution to every problem, the point is to identify it and put it into practice by dealing with a touch control system which in some situations proves to be a little less reactive than one might expect, especially when activating shots. and which therefore can create further difficulties and undeserved deaths, fortunately from the point of view of an approach that is anything but punitive. However, it is also true that once you become familiar with the philosophy of the Crescent Moon Games title, you can play that is a pleasure, trying to overcome your limits and become protagonists of seemingly impossible manoeuvres, suspended in the void waiting for our feet to return to reveal a walkable surface. The only problem is that once established this very flow produces a very rapid progression, which ends up leading us to complete all the levels in a row, in a very short time, stopping only where further fragments are needed to be able to unlock new scenarios and there is therefore the need to go back to retry certain missions. Convincing but imperfect aspects, ultimately, which however can count on a technical sector of great value, artistically very valid, which uses soft colors and stylized solutions to represent a wonderful world, in a very similar way to what was seen in the aforementioned Monument Valley. To accompany our evolutions we also find an excellent soundtrack, engaging and able to create a certain atmosphere.", "date": "2019-02-23", "grade": "7.5"}
