{"name": "Santa Claus: Saves the Earth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/santa-claus-saves-the-earth.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Santa vs E.T. It must immediately be said that Santa Claus is a game that seems to aim at a younger audience, you can understand it from the simplicity with which you enter the game and also from the simplicity of the game itself, so looking at it from this point of view, the title would not be entirely open to criticism , but we are here to talk about the game also from a technical point of view and we assure you that in this respect things are different. SC is a simple, linear, often trivial and unoriginal game; a platformer that takes a bit here and a bit there without standing out in any sector. The general graphics are just enough and too little characterized, the music ranges from cute-repetitive to boring-stupid, not at all inspired and honestly has very little Christmas; the game also does not stand out even on the gameplay front, with a Santa Claus who in the early stages will go around smacking the little monsters in the face, which will also make children very angry as the ~little monsters~ are very reminiscent of E.T. and therefore they are more tenderness than anything else. However, we want to clarify that going forward with the game (if you feel like it) our SC will switch to much more sophisticated snowballs... so for poor E.T. there will be trouble! [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Too bad all the chest!!!~ No, the Santa Claus of the well-known pre-cooked food commercial based on chicken and potatoes is decidedly more sympathetic (although between one who fools a child by pretending to share food with him and one who kills E.T. I don't know who is more bastard inside! ) and yes, because this Telegames game doesn't have much fun, nor does it make you want to be played since it's as exciting as an episode of Sottovoce with guest in the studio Rosy Bindi!!! Seriously, Santa Claus as you may have understood is not that great and we feel we can recommend it only to those who want to give it to a child, who will certainly not pay much attention to the gameplay and the not excellent technical realization, perhaps becoming fascinated by the Christmas atmosphere, an inevitable value of a game starring Santa Claus. Santa Claus saves the Earth is not a great game, and has the biggest flaw of being anonymous and without bite; coins to collect, keys that open doors and enemies to be punched in the face. Only the very young will find it fun thanks to the inevitable Christmas fairy tale atmosphere that has a game in which Santa Claus is the protagonist. Recommended only for the little ones or for those who have to give a gift to an unpleasant relative! Pros: Santa's here Owner's manual can help you light the fireplace Cons: More boring than Marzullo Poor across the board [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Oh well, there's no particular reason why you shouldn't make a game featuring Santa Claus since it's Christmas, even if we didn't miss him so much. However, Telegames has decided to fill this gap with ~Santa Claus Saves the Earth~, a platform-game whose protagonist is obviously Santa Claus (or Santa Claus, if you prefer) and which should make us spend Christmas in a cheerful and carefree way .
