In fact, when we talk about ~dungeon crawlers~ the experience that comes to mind is very precise, yet the title developed by Tree Men Games for iOS and Android deconstructs it, minimizing it from the point of view of a gameplay designed for use in strictly portrait, on a smartphone, with a single finger on the screen. The scenario in this case is not made up of dungeons and does not develop as we explore it, but consists of ~blocks~ that are continuously repositioned, replacing each other dynamically , with randomly generated elements that make the progression always different. Considering the previous projects of the same team, in this case the shooter HELI 100 and the arcade driving game PAKO 2, we are certainly faced with their most essential and ~pure~ game, practically reduced to a concept that is hinged on a classic-style prize structure, in which thanks to the coins obtained with each game it is possible to unlock new characters from a shortlist of ten different warriors (distinguished by attack capacity, maneuver timing and more or less marked automatic movement), while with with the stars collected, all five scenarios are gradually accessed. The two modes are available immediately: in addition to the classic one, Adventure, in which we choose a fighter and make our way through increasingly complex levels up to the inevitable game over (which occurs at the slightest mistake and with a single successful enemy attack, a bit like in the classic Bushido Blade), there is an endless survival that takes place within a single, slightly more extensive setting of normal squares. Gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, the experience offered by ASTALO is characterized by essential mechanics, which allow you to play by holding a single finger on the screen. Attack and movement are in fact connected and work by tracing trajectories on the touch screen, more or less long depending on the character we control, which once released give life to a lightning lunge. If an opponent is inside the path, which is drawn by taking advantage of a very short bullet time, he is automatically eliminated by one of our blows. The time to think about the moves to be made, however, is very little; hence a rather consistent degree of challenge. This type of setting makes the use of a smartphone rather than a tablet practically mandatory, but in reality the touch controls unfortunately prove to be less precise than what is required to survive in the most agitated phases. In fact, at a certain point, you find yourself literally surrounded by enemies that move very quickly, as well as big bad bosses that flood the small stage with bullets, and in this situation a badly interpreted or belated input results in an undeserved game over. At that point it is possible to choose whether to start over or continue the game, in this case by spending some of the coins collected or by agreeing to watch a short advertising trailer. From a technical point of view, ASTALO takes up the low poly style typical of Tree Men Games productions, which however inevitably loses its charm when it comes to representing characters and not vehicles on the screen. We are therefore faced with geometries that are often not very beautiful to look at, but above all with very reduced animations and solutions that are in some cases approximate. However, the beautiful color tones put a patch on us, while we expected something more from the sound sector: the music they are limited to being functional to the action and fail to stand out.", "date": "2020-06-04", "grade": "7.0"}
