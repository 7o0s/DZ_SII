{"name": ".hack//OUTBREAK Vol.3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hackoutbreak-vol3.html", "text": "The Story So Far... The previous chapter, Mutation, brought to light new information on the account of the virtual entity that is threatening the players of The World: Kite, Blackrose and their companions managed to track down and destroy its manifestations, deadly viruses of the same type as Skeith , the creature that had sent Orca into a coma, the unfortunate schoolmate for whom Kite decided to brave the dangers of the world's least video game. And now the manufacturer of The World itself also enters the scene, which through its Administrators, the mustachioed Leos, will find itself forced to collaborate with Kite to exploit the power of the Sunset Bracelet. And while our hero and the legendary Balmung finally join forces in an attempt to uncover the truth about Aura, the Bracelet and the mysteries of The World, even in the real world increasingly strange things begin to occur, which will lead the ever more ambiguous hacker Helba to warn Kite against Altimit itself... Outbreaks As in the case of Mutation, Outbreak also does not present substantial changes or innovations in relation to the game mechanics presented since the first chapter. The introduction of new Grunties to breed and horseback riding of the nice Mucconi can be considered major additions compared to the dozens of new pieces of equipment included in the DVD, which obviously imply the presence of new spells and special abilities: in Outbreak you maintains the mechanism that allows characters to exploit the characteristics of their equipment to launch attacks of various kinds and defensive, healing and offensive spells. From the beginning, however, an increase in the level of difficulty is immediately noticeable, already linked to these elements: the exchange of objects with the players who populate the cities of The World becomes increasingly complex due to the high quality of the items in their possession, and in dungeons the recovery of the best pieces of equipment is almost always linked to the Data Leak, which by abusing it risks killing Kite and causing Game Over. In the same way, the Data Leakage in Outbreak must be used with an impressive frequency in order to get the Virus Cores necessary for the hacking of the Portals: the main defect of Outbreak turns out to be this, the massive presence of areas to be unlocked using numerous Viruses Cores and forcing the player, reflexively, to go hunting for Cores most of the time. For the rest, once these problems have been contained by reaching adequate levels of experience, Outbreak certainly proves to be the best episode of the saga, balanced and fun, although undermined by the usual problems of the series among which, without a doubt, the monotonous linearity of the random dungeons stands out . Visual and Audio There are no particular audiovisual differences between Outbreak and the prequels: there is a slight improvement in the textures, also due to the reworking of many of them for the addition of the virtual ~gaps~ caused by the virus. On the other hand, .hack// is designed as one big game divided into four parts. Unfortunately, the discreet technical realization dating back to more than two years ago is starting to feel the weight of time, especially when compared to more recent titles. The sound sector, on the other hand, performs very well, with the addition of new well-made musical themes and, as usual, fantastic dubbing, both American and Japanese. The graphic characterization of the new characters (Wiseman above all) is also excellent, curated as always by the very good Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (character designer already of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Nadia). Furthermore, the OAV attached to the video game also proves to be the best of those viewed, both from a narrative and technical point of view. The third episode of .hack// is undoubtedly the best of those released so far and represents a good prologue for the final chapter that will see the light in two months, .hack//QUARANTINE. The plot takes full flight presenting quite a few twists, both in the video game and in the OAV, and a few but very welcome novelties are added to the game system. Without a doubt, Outbreak also has some structural problems, caused by the sudden increase in the level of difficulty and by the sometimes annoying spread of Gate Hacking, which dampens the pace of the game almost to only lengthen its duration. In any case, Outbreak guarantees yet another twenty pleasant hours of gameplay within The World, with all its secrets and bonuses to unlock: fans will not be disappointed at all. Here we are again at our bimonthly appointment with .hack//, the Bandai quadrilogy that is revolutionizing the way of conceiving RPGs. For those who don't know what shey talking, we refer you to the exhaustive review of Volume 1 (.hack//INFECTION), here it will suffice to say that the .hack project unravels through various media (comics, cartoons, videogames) based on a very original concept: in 2009 the The world's most popular video game will be The World, an MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) that involves millions of players and which, at a certain point, will become an unsuspected threat, putting the players who ~die~ inside it into a coma. Some players will be tasked with investigating and putting things right. The videogame series, divided into four episodes (each sold with an additional DVD containing an episode of the OAV .hack//LIMINALITY series), has now passed the halfway point and while the DVDs with the animated series are preparing to appear on the shelves (the introspective .hack//SIGN based on the adventures of new characters who intertwine with the events of the video game) the success of .hack// begins to infect Italy too...", "date": "2004-09-14", "grade": null}
