{"name": "Yakuza Kiwami 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-kiwami-2-recensione-xbox-one.html", "text": "With the review of Yakuza Kiwami 2 for Xbox One we can immerse ourselves again in the extraordinary atmospheres of the SEGA series, in the light of the consolidated relationship between the Japanese company and Microsoft, which will result in the launch of the next chapter, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, exclusive next-gen timeline on Xbox Series X. Before arriving at the events of the seventh episode, however, we will also have to recover the remaining adventures of Kazuma Kiryu, so let's imagine the release on Xbox One of the remasters of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza soon 5, as well as Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, which concludes the long saga of the Dragon of Dojima in a worthy way. But let's go back to Yakuza Kiwami 2, which in addition to the classic fictitious district of Kamurocho, in Tokyo, also introduces the splendid setting of Sotenbori (inspired by Dotonbori) in Osaka, where we will find not only suggestive panoramas and numerous activities with which to interact, but also various references to the late 80s scenario of Yakuza 0. All in the context of an extremely full-bodied and long-lasting package, which can be purchased on the Xbox Games Store at a price of just 19.99 euros but which can be downloaded free of charge by Xbox Game Pass subscribers. History The story of Yakuza Kiwami 2 takes place exactly one year after the events of the previous chapter: Kazuma and little Haruka have started a new life together, but the issues concerning the Tojo clan do not stop haunting his former rising star. In fact, a real war is underway on the streets of Tokyo, with the formidable Omi Alliance intent on conquering this territory too: someone needs to go to Osaka and go to discuss with the leaders of the enemy organization to establish the terms of a truce. Aware that he is the only hope for his former family and eager to put an end to the bloodshed, Kazuma accepts the assignment and together with Daigo Dojima goes to Kanto to complete the mission. Once he arrives in the colorful and charming district of Sotenbori, however, he discovers that there is another dragon in the city: Ryuji Goda, son of the president of the Omi Alliance and convinced that violence is the only way forward for his clan. Two such strong personalities can only collide, but Yakuza Kiwami 2 obviously doesn't stop at the comparison between Kazuma and Ryuji, also introducing several other characters and facing a time span of tens of years, as per tradition for the franchise. As usual, a wide-ranging plot, the one written by Masayoshi Yokoyama, which does not skimp on twists and explosive situations, relying in all cases on a cinematic level narration. The story involves and conquers, net of a few blatant exaggeration (see the scenario of Osaka Castle, or at least its introduction), but localization is also limited to English subtitles in this case. The texts are abundant, so reading can become a bit heavy for those who don't know the language perfectly, but it is a historical problem for the series, which apparently will only be solved starting with Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Goro Majima's campaign In addition to the sixteen chapters of the main story, Yakuza Kiwami 2 also includes a three-part mini-campaign entirely dedicated to Goro Majima, who therefore returns to being a playable character after stealing the show in Yakuza 0. By the way, the storyline being told at this juncture it connects precisely to the prequel set in the late 80s: make sure you have completed it before proceeding! Gameplay The formula of Yakuza Kiwami 2 does not deviate from the tradition of the series, proposing a very simple gameplay in which you have to go from point A to point B, according to the indications that appear from time to time on the screen, and in between face a certain number of fighting, be it street thugs or mangy bosses. The cutscenes therefore act as a narrative glue, unraveling the story of the game and helping to create an excellent emotional ~build up~ which we will then be able to vent with punches and kicks, in the context of extremely solid action mechanics. Unfortunately, the styles have been eliminated of combat present in Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami, therefore we will have to stick to a linear progression of the protagonist's skills and characteristics, which can be unlocked and upgraded by obtaining experience points. However, Kazuma is once again equipped with a fairly rich repertoire of moves, in particular as regards the very painful finishers that allow you to interact in various ways with the environment, crushing opponents against a wall, throwing them from a balcony or smashing various objects on him . ANDIt is possible to complete Yakuza Kiwami 2 in about twenty hours by going straight and leaving most of the quests and side activities behind, but this is not the best approach for the SEGA franchise, which has made an abundance of its content outline a trademark. By dedicating himself precisely to the optional missions, which go deeper into Japanese culture in many more or less absurd situations, and spending some time with the extra activities present in Kamurocho and Sotenbori, the duration of the experience well exceeds thirty hours. Technical realization Tested on Xbox One S, Yakuza Kiwami 2 actually struggles a bit to maintain 30fps, despite an effective 900p resolution. The reason is easy to say: unlike the previous remake, this episode uses the latest technologies as regards the rendering of the scenarios, the amount of characters on the screen and the level of detail, also allowing us to access the various activities without having to wait for any loading . In any case, the experience remains enjoyable and the quality of the assets cannot be questioned, not to mention the kinematics. The behavior of the game on Xbox One X is more disappointing than anything else, evidently the result of a not too convinced conversion: in this case the resolution does not go beyond 1080p and the frame rate, however stable, remains anchored here too at 30 frames per second. Too bad: we would have expected something more, considering the power of the console. For the rest nothing to say: the soundtrack is excellent and the Japanese dialogues are interpreted with great intensity.", "date": "2020-08-04", "grade": "8.5"}
