{"name": "Pikmin 1 + 2 HD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin-1-2-hd-recensione.html", "text": "Between 2001 and 2004, the years in which they were published for the first time, on Game Cube, Pikmin and its sequel, the concept of Nintendo Difference was more popular than ever. On the one hand, it served the marketing department of the Japanese company to underline the different culture that guided the creation and development of internal productions compared to those of the competition. On the other hand, it was useful for diehard fans of the Grande N to counter the scarcity of third-party titles that enriched the beloved 128-bit console's soft library. In that era full of experiments and bizarre titles, historical period anticipating the Wii and Nintendo DS generation in which the heralded ~difference~ would have translated into an authentic revolution with the consequent breaking of everything Sony and Microsoft proposed, Shigeru Miyamoto and companions gave (yet another) proof of all their creative flair. Between pinball simulators with voice commands, Odama, and training games whose sole purpose was to pay off an accumulated stratospheric debt, GiFTPiA, Super Mario's father also found time and a way to translate his born fantasies into polygons and textures observing the animal and plant life of his garden. An almost dreamlike vision, which took on the dimensions of a pair of apparently sweetened strategic games, which in reality hid a deep gameplay, as well as a marked taste for the macabre. After twenty years later and a Wii adaptation, are the first Pikmin still able to charm and entertain? Do they represent a tasty appetizer in view of Pikmin 4? All the answers you are looking for are contained in the Pikmin 1 + 2 HD review. Aging in style The first, unforgettable, encounter with the first of Olimar's aides returns unchanged in Pikmin 1 + 2 HD Finding yourself after so long again in the role of Captain Olimar can give thrills of emotion to the most elderly gamers who, for one reason or another, have never had the opportunity to play Pikmin 1 and 2 after their original publication. Since the start of the first game, one has almost inexplicably been driven to perform actions, to carry out tasks in sequence, to worry about specific factors following instinct, relying on a dormant muscle memory, but far from extinct. The smile, even the tear full of nostalgia is almost inevitable for those who were little more than a kid at the time of the Game Cube. Those musics, certain animations, re-exploring some scenarios, having to deal with specimens of a fauna that are not very friendly with the Pikmin and Olimar, gives shivers on the skin, all the more intense the more the couple loved each other at the time of games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto. For those who have no idea what Pikmin 1 and 2 are, we are basically talking about two real-time strategy games in which, in the role of Captain Olimar, you will have to get the help of funny half-animal, half-vegetable creatures to recover, in scenarios inhabited by creatures unfriendly, some objects useful to his cause. Even in Pikmin 1 + 2 HD Olimar is not completely helpless, but his life bar is really ridiculous As in any RTS you will therefore have to guide the troops in combat, exploration, the recovery of enemy carcasses and pills needed to swell the ranks. But if in other congeners you do it starting from a comfortable isometric view, completely detached from the actual action, here you will be thrown into the field, directly controlling Olimar, giving orders and making sure that nobody gets into trouble or ends up among the jaws of a predator. The very first chapter, even by force of circumstances, is the one that passes the test of time less brilliantly. The adaptation, exactly as for the sequel, has not brought any news in terms of content, nor has a profound graphic review been envisaged. The low definition of the textures is especially evident on the large TV screen, while the update of the screen ratio, which goes from the original 4:3 to today's 16:9, has produced some small aspect ratio problems in the game interface. As in the original, also in Pikmin 1 + 2 HD it is essential to collect the pills scattered throughout the scenario to create new Pikmin Nothing so serious, nor so impactful, of course. Thanks to a granite frame rate, well-packed polygonal models and the artistic style adopted by the game, Pikmin does not look bad even today, especially in portable mode, where the elements on the low definition screen are less noticeable. Where the tempo starts to kick in is in the controls. Using buttons and levers, a certain underlying woodiness is noticed, in addition to the almost total ungovernability of the cameraa, really difficult to manage especially regarding the zoom. Using the Joy-Con accelerometers, thus inheriting the configuration already seen at work on the Wii, the launch of the Pikmin takes place much more naturally and precisely, but you will complain today as then about the difficulty with which you will direct the troop of little helpers to the shoulders, especially in the narrowest and most dangerous passages, where there is always the risk of some painful loss due to the impossibility of managing the crowd better. Push, lift, build, break down walls, carry. In Pikmin 1 + 2 HD every action requires the right number of helpers at work The obligation to complete the mission within thirty virtual days still causes the same anxiety as always and imposes a truly asphyxiating level of perfection on the completionist gamer. You have to have clear ideas, think quickly about the next move, lose as few Pikmin as possible when the clash becomes inevitable. As in the past, the division of troops into red, strong in combat, yellow, the only ones capable of carrying bombs, and blue, with gills, encourages the user to make the most of the units at his disposal. What hasn't aged a day, if anything, is the effectiveness of the gameplay that works in combination with a level design and a bestiary of enemies that is still surprising today. The genius with which Nintendo has managed to pack half a dozen scenarios, filling them with paths more or less hidden from view and with ravenous little animals greedy for our Pikminm, is as clear today as it was yesterday. Beyond the prevailing and oppressive time limit imposed by the adventure, the first chapter of the series proves to be a highly enjoyable, brilliant, challenging RTS while still being within the reach of even newcomers to the genre. Pikmin 2, a sequel with still a lot to give More levels, more enemies, more Pikmin. The second chapter of Pikmin 1 + 2 HD really takes the form of a very pleasant more of the same Pikmin 2, for its part, proves to be all the more a game in step with the times. Freed as it is from any time limit within which to complete the adventure, it introduces three novelties< in terms of gameplay that make the game formula even more profound, surprising and exciting. The first is the possibility of changing the character at any time checked. Loulie, in fact, in this sequel will accompany the good Olimar in his mission to collect treasures on the planet of the Pikmin, an expedition necessary to pay off the debt accumulated by the company for which the two work. The level design is obviously declined in the presence of two controllable heroes and, with the complicity of the gamer's strategic skills, expands the range of possible and often necessary coordinated actions and operations to pave the way in the various settings. The sequel included in Pikmin 1 + 2 also featured a 1 vs 1 multiplayer mode Secondly, two new types of units have been added. On the one hand we have the stocky and well-placed purple Pikmin, strong and heavy, ideal in combat or for easily transporting treasures found on the field. On the other hand, however, the exile white Pikmin, immune to poison and even harmful if swallowed by hostile creatures, a characteristic at the basis of strategies that are as grotesque as they are effective. The presence of these two new types of helpers, which add up to the three of the previous episode, brings with it a whole series of new obstacles and problems that the duo of protagonists will have to face, to the full advantage of the level design which, never before now, it opens up to innovative solutions thanks also to the presence of dungeons. Untied from the more classic scenarios, these settings, which represent the third major novelty of Pikmin 2, wind through rather large and intricate areas and tunnels, naturally inhabited by particularly difficult bosses to defeat. Thanks to the further dilated time, exploration is never a source of stress, although the rule remains to return to the surface before nightfall. Even in these areas, in fact, you will have to be very careful to return to the base before sunset, if you don't want to lose every Pikmin left on the street, a feature that was already the basis of the gameplay of the predecessor. Pikmin 1 + 2 abounds in grotesque and often gruesome scenes Even the sequel, in terms of adaptation, has not undergone significant improvements, either in terms of content or purely graphic. High resolution plays its role, undoubtedly, but beyond an impeccable frame rate, grainy textures and not always convincing animations make a fine show of them, too. The camera was more responsive, but recoverede the slight woodenness of the commands already reported in the original chapter remains unchanged. Despite some small flaws, despite the modernization work could have been much more impactful, the speech made for the prequel also applies to Pikmin 2. We are faced with an enjoyable RTS , original, ingenious, perfectly capable of entertaining and thrilling any fan of the genre or newbies looking for a different production than usual.", "date": "2023-06-30", "grade": "8.0"}
