When it comes to Gameloft, the question must be seriously asked, since by now it has elevated the imitation of illustrious examples to its own stylistic hallmark, one could almost say, also because the French publisher makes no secret of this trend, indeed reiterates it publicly as an excellent modus operandi. On the other hand, it is not simply a question of copying other people's ideas, it is often a question of filling important gaps which, in the mobile sector where the label is largely involved, are evident in the playful offer. It is therefore almost funny at first to find yourself in front of Starfront: Collision since it is clear from the title where the developers wanted to go with this. However, it makes getting really serious to really enter the dynamics of the game, when we realize that the lack of originality is not the only feature of the game and the merits and talent of the developers are clear. In the small Gameloft game we find the perfect mechanisms of the Blizzard RTS well replicated, making the necessary proportions, with three campaigns dedicated to the three playable races (exceeding in this sense the contents of StarCraft II itself, moreover) of Consortium, or the human marines, the technological Wardens (practically the Protoss) and the insectoid Myriad, corresponding to the Zerg. In short, what is clear after the cinematic CG presentation (yes, there's that too) is that Starfront is Starcraft in a portable scale, and such a thing can hardly be a defect, particularly in the absence of direct competitors. A boon for fans of the genre iPhone owners, albeit with some weaknesses. Among other things, there is an excellent multiplayer option that allows direct confrontation 1v1, 2v2 or Deathmatch for a truly complete gaming experience. The war between the fingers The game mechanic is the traditional one that enthusiasts know perfectly, based on resource collection, base and army construction and battle against enemies within more or less extensive maps covered by the fog of war and to be discovered gradually, almost always concealing one or more threats to their base and objectives to be completed. The essential element around which the whole mechanism revolves is Xenodium, a mineral that must be collected and refined to provide economic support to the entire military apparatus, while the other element to keep under control is the energy supply to be managed through special centres. The construction of buildings and units, as well as their subsequent evolutions, requires a different contribution of these two elements in order to be carried out, therefore it is essential to start with the construction of structures for the collection of Xenodium and energy nodes to support everything, in order to have the resources to build the classic barracks and purely military structures, all modifiable in terms of efficiency, intended for the formation of infantry and means of attack and defense. Units and structures differ among the three races, while remaining within standard categories that make balanced comparisons possible. The missions, while not proposing anything particularly new, are well structured and interesting, and above all the restrained pace of play, the balanced balance and the excellent depth given by the vast number of construction possibilities and management variables make this probably the best example of RTS present on iOS, not that on the other hand there are many other contenders. The entirely tactile interface is intuitive and well structured but often suffers from some uncertainties in touch recognition, therefore it represents on the one hand a strength but on the other also a potential element of irritation, while the other obvious defect, not attributable directly to the game, it turns out to be the size of the iPhone screen, which often makes the action difficult to understand and difficult to manage in the excited phases. However, this last feature does not invalidate the judgment on the graphics sector, which is really well done, even if this too is decidedly derivative.
