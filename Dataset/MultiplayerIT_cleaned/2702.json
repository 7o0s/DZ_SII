The title created by Chaosmonger Studio and Nicola Piovesan, who had already worked on the animated short ~Robot Will Protect You~, is truly a beautiful tribute to the graphic adventures of the past capable of not remaining only and exclusively that. His character, his personality blend with elements that approach Studio Ghibli, Blade Runner and Monkey Island. Encodya isn't perfect, but it's the most beautiful declaration of love for this genre of titles that you will find on the market. Plot Writing the plot of a graphic adventure to be published in 2021 is not an easy task. The genre has granite cornerstones that have remained untouchable for decades, and at the same time the descent into the shadows that graphic adventures have experienced in recent years has sharpened the sense of obsolescence that today's audience often feels in front of these products. Encodya has the great merit of balancing these sensations with elements capable of eliciting an emotion from the player, be it hilarity or melancholy, empathy or pity. The proposed events follow the very young Tina, a nine-year-old girl, accompanied by her robot nurse S.A.M.-53. The setting is a futuristic and cyberpunk Neo-Berlin where multiculturalism has depersonified the German capital (beyond the Brandenburg Gate) making it really similar to a mix of all the biggest cities in the world. All this is accentuated by the large use of Japanese-style architecture within what appears to be a reinterpretation of Neo-Tokyo rather than a new futuristic Berlin. The events presented will lead you towards some dark events that lurk in Tina's past, in her being an orphan, in the nature of S.A.M and in the use of cyberspace as a cure for all ills. In short, a journey through emotions between easter eggs and heartbreaking moments. We are certainly not dealing with a shocking product in terms of plot and themes, but Encodya is a perfectly balanced product, able to make the most of the ~already seen~ effect while not filling the player. Encodya is to all intents and purposes a reflection of our society, a warning to understand where this continuous search for an ephemeral pleasure that leaves aside the simplest, but not trivial, little joys of life could lead us. Gameplay Encodya is a retro point and click adventure. Everything you have come to know in this genre of titles is present: mouse movement, double-click running, dialogues with characters to deepen the lore, a large amount of puzzles, infinite inventory and finally the interaction between objects. Encodya does not make any changes to the genre, in fact it tries to make the basic characteristics perfectly functional, focusing everything on the writing elements such as a sense of humor and the surreality of certain actions. Precisely in these cases, or when the title does not take itself seriously, the strong inspiration to the cornerstones of the genre comes out. The humor is that seen in the greatest graphic adventures and the references abound: from Monkey Island to Broken Sword, from Tony Tough to Day of the Tentacle. However, what makes the adventure more lively is the presence of 10 secrets scattered throughout all the approximately 8-10 hours that the game will need to be completed 100%. During our journey we stopped several times to think about the puzzles that proved to be surprisingly stimulating. What is striking is the excellent organization of the same according to a crescendo of difficulty (although there is an initial and irreversible selection between easy and difficult) that accompanies the player. The user is therefore obliged to know the explorable areas of the map, to have a good memory and only in very rare cases have we been faced with puzzles that are far too intuitive. The dialogue, the deepening of the lore from the NPCs, everything revolves around the will of the development team to increase the player's knowledge of the narrative of the work. Technical aspect Clearly Encodya is not a title that aims to amaze the user with its technical level. However, what we are faced with is a title that is once again very well characterized. The cartoon style is not invasive and indeed does a lot of justice to the moments in which the tones move over the top. Certainly in some excited phases, especially in the final, the game opens up a bit to the reduced value of the budget, but they are trifles that leave the time they find in a title like this. The audio and the excellent localization are certainly strikingAnd. Encodya does not forget the importance of sound and accompanies the player in the right way during his journey, properly supporting the scenes that need it without overdoing it. The localization (supported by the results of the Kickstarter campaign) is also of excellent workmanship and deserves praise together with the English interpretation. The latter, although not of absolute value, is certainly above the average compared to the production examined.", "date": "2021-01-24", "grade": "8.0"}
