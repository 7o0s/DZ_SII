{"name": "Asterix - Il Gioco Ufficiale del Film", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asterix-il-gioco-ufficiale-del-film.html", "text": "The Italian public knows the character of Asterix mostly thanks to the animated films that have been based on the comic since the end of the sixties. The original work, created in 1959 by the writer Ren Goscinny and the designer Albert Uderzo, is in fact very popular in France but has enjoyed mixed editorial fortunes in other countries. The story is that of a very particular Gallic village, whose inhabitants can drink a potion capable of making them invincible. It goes without saying that this characteristic made the Roman conquest impossible, making the village a sort of independent colony. Video games featuring Asterix and Obelix as protagonists abound, even in the mobile sector, and this Official Game of the Film aims to translate the events told in ~Asterix at the Olympics~ onto the screen of our mobile phone in the best possible way. We will be dealing with a structure basically divided into two parts. At the beginning, our objective will be to find the pieces of a stone that allows us to participate in the Games, and to do this we will have to solve a series of different situations, helping this or that character and possibly trying our hand at short fishing sessions. This phase is characterized by the predominance of platforms, with Asterix who can jump using the joystick and can hit Roman soldiers by pressing the 5 key. The locations to explore are divided by doors or passages, and you have to check them in their entirety to collect all the necessary items, as well as to interact with all the characters. Once this phase is over, we move on to the actual Olympic Games, divided between menhir and discus throwing, long jump, foot and chariot races. In these contexts, the control system changes according to the situation and often brings to mind the commands of the various rhythm games: for the character to gain speed, you have to press the 5 key when indicated on the screen, in sequence, while you have to act quickly and accurately when determining the angle of the launch. As for the running sessions, however, the controls are more those of an action game, in which, however, you must pay close attention to the vigor bar, recharging it with the power-ups found along the way and resorting to sprinting only when possible. The technical realization of the game is average. On the one hand we have a modest sound, made up of MIDI music that can be largely deactivated, on the other we have well-designed graphics, with characters faithful to the original counterparts and equipped with discreet animation. The scenarios do most of the work, with a good use of colors and a scrolling that develops in parallax on three levels. On the front of interactable elements we are at historic lows, unfortunately. The control system performs well in every situation, promptly responding to inputs without ever giving any problems. This applies to both the action and ~sport~ sections. PRO Well done graphics There are Asterix and Obelix Structure divided into two phases... AGAINST ...both too short Mediocre sound Very short lived", "date": "2008-06-05", "grade": "S.V."}
