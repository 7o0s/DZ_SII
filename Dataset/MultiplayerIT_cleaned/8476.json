We won't dwell too much on the card game created almost 20 years ago by Richard Garfield and immediately became the backbone of the Wizards of the Coast business. To discover all the features of this wonderful pastime that has delighted generations of never too grown up teenagers and adults with its incredible mix of immediacy, strategy and tactics, there is this handy Wikipedia link. We will therefore assume that whoever reads this review has at least a basic knowledge of Magic and perhaps has even played one of the previous chapters of Duels of the Planeswalker, so that we can immediately focus on the main novelties and strengths of the sequel. For the solitary player... The 2013 edition strongly follows the single and multiplayer system set up with the previous two chapters of Duels of the Planeswalker. In fact, it is not a title dedicated to the hardcore Magic super player: for him there is the traditional card game or the appreciated but certainly niche Magic Online; Duels 2013 in fact tries to stimulate the occasional player or even the absolute neophyte who may have heard of the Wizards of the Coast creature but has never experienced it firsthand. In fact, the title comes with a valuable tutorial, particularly rich and detailed and also offers a sort of animated introduction and some small interlude clips to almost simulate a narrative element or in any case a minimum of plot. Getting to the heart of the single player component we find four different sections. We start with the actual campaign that offers the clash with different planeswalkers (Magic wizards) of increasing difficulty, each linked to a specific deck. There are ten in total and there are also many decks that can be unlocked in the game, ranging from single-color to more exotic and daring solutions. Between one fight and the next we also find the events in the campaign. These are particular games where the opponent always uses a precise sequence of cards that perfectly follows a famous tactic used in Magic tournaments. In this way the player can learn to recognize particular patterns and adopt the appropriate countermeasures not to be surprised and massacred in future multiplayer games. Once the campaign is completed, it is possible to access Revenge, or repeat the same battles but with much stronger enemy planeswalkers and with the entire deck available. The single player offer is completed by the Challenges, which are available immediately and the new Planechase mode, which is unlocked as soon as you defeat the two wizards of the first tier of the campaign. The former, already seen in the 2012 edition of Duels, represent pre-set and well-understood clashes where the player usually has a single turn available to achieve a specific objective, usually the defeat of the opponent or resistance to one of his attacks . And finally, let's talk about Planechase, the most incisive novelty of this year's edition of Duels. This is a brand new game mode, which sees the use of some special cards of increased size, called piano cards, to heavily influence free-for-all matches for up to four players. In practice, these cards possess some type of effect that is always valid or that can be activated by rolling a 6-sided planar die which costs an increasing point of mana with each roll and which can precisely determine the activation of the special effect or the so-called change of plan, or the draft of a new giant card with its consequences and new functions. We must immediately say that this new mode is as fun and engaging when challenging human opponents as it is frustrating and absolutely inconclusive in matches against the computer. In fact, the latter tends to follow absolutely inconclusive patterns, perhaps attacking the opponent with multiple creatures on the ground or repeatedly hurling spells against the player and effectively making any strategic hypothesis of match management useless. At the same time it should be noted that Planechase games tend to last longer than classic games and very often victory is determined almost only by the luck of seeing an unbalanced special card enter the field at the right time. From this point of view we would have perhaps expected a greater cleaning and balancing work by Wizards of the Coast. ...and for the company lover But it's obviously in the multiplayer thatwe find the beating heart of the Duels video game offer. Alongside the inevitable and classic Free for All we find the just mentioned Planechase and there is also the Two-Headed Giant, the particular cooperative-competitive two-on-two mode that is present in single player only in the Custom Duel, a separate menu which allows you to create quick matches against the computer. All modes can also be tackled by up to four simultaneous players and there is also the possibility, limited to Two-Headed Giant only, to play in two on the same PC against two remote opponents. We therefore appreciate Wizards of the Coast's decision to give variety to the multiplayer offer even if we are well aware that all true Magic players know well how 90% of the matches played are simple one-on-one matches with the classic rules.Once once you enter the game, you immediately notice some tricks made by Wizards on the interface. First of all, a new intermediate zoom level of the cards has been implemented which is activated automatically in each summoning and allows you to read them briefly without having to switch to the maximum available zoom level each time or risk losing your sight in the attempt to read the writings from the game table as it happened in the past. The management of the timers was then retouched so as to be clearer and more efficient but above all two extremely important mechanics were implemented in the game and which until now had been deliberately left out because they were too hardcore. First we find a true end phase that follows the second post-combat main phase, ideal for end-of-turn instants or for the use of certain skills. And above all, it is now finally possible to plug lands manually. In reality it is not yet a real tap at the discretion of the player but a trick since in the summoning phase it is possible to choose which combinations of lands to use among the possible ones, so as to perhaps safeguard a specific source of mana. From memory, the inclusion of the possibility of mulliganing at the beginning of the round also seems unprecedented. But what makes Duels of the Planeswalker really attractive and fun, even in this year's edition, is the excellent quality of the digital transposition of the card game and in its ability to facilitate all the most boring and mnemonic mechanics of Magic : from the management of the spell resolution stacks, to the various counters, counters and abilities that activate automatically. The interface is perfect from this point of view with cards that light up when usable or elements on the screen that highlight the actions to be performed, all without demeaning the tactical phase of choosing the summons to play. However, there are still some strange design choices especially in the windows that appear during some selections, often oversized or even completely free since it would have been done much earlier to allow the choice by cursor. The deck, however, is always the same Those who have already played the previous editions of Duels of the Planeswalker know well what the greatest loved, hated element of the series is: the highly plastered management of the game deck. Even the 2013 chapter, following the precise design choice of Wizards of the Coast, does not offer news from this point of view. The ten unlockable decks are all made up of 60 cards plus another 30 side decks that are unlocked individually and automatically after each battle won. However, it is possible at any time to make a 0.79 micro-transaction to unlock the entire deck. The manufacturer therefore confirms his decision to make Duels a starting point for the new Magic player who can thus understand the mechanics, start structuring his deck in a strongly guided way and perhaps be captivated by the depth of the game and then make the leap of quality towards the printed version or, at most, towards Magic Online on PC. The management of the deck, although redesigned in this sequel, is once again based on the same system: the lands are automatically inserted based on the number of cards in the deck and the latter can only be modified by adding others from the side. Among other things, it is never possible to go below 60 cards even in the deck composition phase and this makes any substantial modification to the deck strategy rather cumbersome given that it is necessary to work on the ~complete~ deck each time to then start removing the useless cards. Technically the game is extremely clean in the interfaces, with beautiful stylistic choices and with a whole series of animations that make the game board more aliveco. Everything is very configurable and scalable to meet the tastes of those players who perhaps do not want too many frills on the screen. The background music and the sparse sound effects are absolutely not worthy of note, while we appreciated the few but well-designed interlude sequences that anticipate the most important clashes. The iPad version We are in no danger of being proven wrong by saying that the iPad version of Duels of the Planeswalker 2013 is the best yet. The touch interface is certainly an accomplice, which, as never before in this game, lends itself perfectly to allowing the player to quickly master and manage the various phases of the round. However, there are some limitations. First of all, also in this case there are imperfections in the design with some windows that sometimes overlap the cards on the board making it impossible to consult them perhaps before choosing a target. At the same time the limitation to two players for the various multiplayer modes and the absence of the pass and play or the possibility of playing in two on the same iPad made us turn up our noses. However, it must also be highlighted that the iPad version is the only one that also acts as a demo, being downloadable for free from the App Store and allowing you to play several matches before having to be unlocked. An operation which, among other things, costs one euro less than its PC and console counterparts: 7.99 instead of 8.99 or 800 Microsoft Points. And this is certainly an element to be rewarded.", "date": "2012-06-26", "grade": "8.0"}
