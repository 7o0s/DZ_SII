The successor Fallout: New Vegas seems destined to follow the same cycle, Dead Money is in fact the first expansion released for this diligent sequel, and while not without its flaws it proves to be a decidedly tantalizing experience, let's see how. Welcome to Sierra Madre The incipit of this downloadable content is clearly derivative, but certainly not out of place in the Fallout universe. Taking up the typical atmospheres of the Saw saga, or the vein of sadistic-splatter-cerebral horror, we see our character attracted by the typical radio signal to a mysterious location, to be precise the disturbing Sierra Madre casino, to experience a new, terrifying adventure. We soon find ourselves deprived of our weapons, imprisoned by an uncomfortable collar that Fallout 3 lovers will remember without too much effort. Well yes, these are the notorious explosive devices of the slavers of Paradise Falls, modified for this special, cruel occasion. That's not all, in addition to not being able to leave the place, we are forced to collaborate with three unfortunate companions in misfortune, obviously equipped with the same ~necklace~, and avoid the loss of the precious braincase. In addition to the pleasant self-quotations, reminiscences of an original science fiction film come to mind, Under Maximum Surveillance by Lewis Teague, where the prisoners wore special explosive collars. But let's go back to our cute little group, where we find a rather moody super mutant named Dog (read a bit backwards...), a ghoul and a completely mute woman. The reasons why we are forced to collaborate with this pleasant company are well explained during the campaign that distinguishes this dlc, it is enough to know as an advance that we will be dealing with an emulator of the well-known Gigsaw / Riddler, and we will not be able to return to freedom before have performed certain tasks. Not a bad start, right? Xbox 360 goals Dead Money offers 6 brand new objectives compared to the main game, for a total of 140 points. Most are obtainable by completing the main quest, but there are some reserved for those who want to spend more time than necessary in the dangerous casino of Sierra Madre, such as collecting 500 play coins. It is certainly not an unlikely feat to conquer them all. Good fun! Fantastic Four Those who have already explored New Vegas properly will surely have appreciated the excellent narrative and the brilliance of the quests proposed by Obsidian, Dead Money is no less, remaining on a rather high level. The pathos of the proposed story, the depth of the characters and the rather sick atmosphere that characterizes Sierra Madre are good. What was supposed to be a lush casino is actually an area devastated by nuclear holocaust, tainted by lethal gases that the player must take into serious consideration, in addition to the perennial threat of collars. If the obligation to preserve the safety of the group were not enough, we must also avert the threat of numerous radio devices, scattered throughout the map, capable of sending the sensors of the collars into a tailspin, with a consequent and unhealthy explosion. The scenario is essentially anything but idyllic, and here come the painful notes. The search for these devices is initially stimulating, but quickly becomes tedious and frustrating. The same goes for the level design heavily based on the trial and error formula, with situations often exhausting for the player's patience. The new enemies introduced for the occasion do not help, among which we find very dangerous drones and creatures capable of regenerating once shot down. In this regard, the characteristics of our team come in handy: just to give an example, the mutant Dog is able to feed on the carcasses of his opponents, effectively preventing their regeneration. It will be up to us to make the most of these unique resources. The level cap of the character has been raised to level 35 for the occasion, and given the difficulty of this DLC it is advisable to present yourself with the appropriate skills. The singular economy of Sierra Madre comes to our aid, in fact we can buy food and objects through special distributors, using the gambling fisches instead of the classic caps. The campaign is quite long for this type of product, estimated at eight hours, and the player will be able, as expected, to bring the new weaponsconquered and the experience accumulated in the main game.", "date": "2011-01-20", "grade": "7.0"}
