{"name": "Championship Manager 03/04", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/championship-manager-0304.html", "text": "CM 03/04 vs CM 4 As I will say later in the comment, CM 03/04 is little more than an update of CM 4, and it is normal that two similar releases only 7 months apart (CM 4 appeared in shops in April 2003, CM 03/04 in November of the same year) raise the doubt of a purely commercial operation, perhaps with a renewed graphic layout, aimed at exploiting the success achieved by CM4. In this box I will therefore try to list, summarizing them briefly, all the innovations present in CM 03/04 compared to its predecessor: - ~Human~ relationships between players: players will be able to have opinions about their teammates, and these will influence their performance as already they did the personal problems or the relationship with the coach. So, to give an example, if we decide to sell a player who is well regarded by one of his teammates, the latter may not like it, and his performance in the match will drop. - Prizes for the best goals of the month and of the season - Live draws from competitions: nice to see, even if they are still pre-calculated at the end of the previous round, so for all intents and purposes it is useless - Weather effects: the conditions of the field will greatly influence the performance of the players, therefore in case of rain the more technical players will be penalized, and in the cold weather injuries will be more frequent. - Improved scout reports: depending on the value in the characteristics they may or may not add a more specific comment about the players. - Constant updates on player injuries and rehabilitation: so we'll know if the physios did the job they're paid to do and got a player back on his feet ahead of time. - Improved game actions: actions are really realistic, even if sometimes strange behaviors remain such as passive offside penalties, or ignoring the ball to regain position. - Tree view of the cups - Internal classification of players by the coaches: each coach will have a list of the players he deems most suitable for the various roles. - Simpler and more intuitive training system: it will finally be possible to manage everything from a single screen, save the various weekly training programs and, above all, clearly see the effects directly from the individual player characteristics screen. - CM 4 repeated crashes eliminated These are the most relevant changes, the rest comes down to a few graphical tweaks. The tactic Anyone who usually follows the football league knows perfectly well that the most important and complex task of a coach is to field the best formation and that even the slightest mistake can lead to defeat and protests from management and fans. To guarantee the maximum possible realism, each player is equipped with an impressive number of characteristics (as many as 31, 30 for goalkeepers) divided into technical, mental and physical characteristics that distinguish them and allow them to evaluate their abilities, as well as information on their career, and contract details. Then, in the tactical section, we will be able to personally choose how to position them on the pitch, or search in the archive among the dozens of formations present which one best reflects our style of play. We will also be able to decide many other aspects, such as the intensity of the interventions, whether to play more defensively or more offensively, on which side of the field to concentrate the attacks, and many others that images describe much better than words. However, sometimes it will be necessary to give particular orders only to some players and not to others, so it will be possible for each of them to modify as many parameters, reaching a practically absolute level of customization of the team. The market Another of the aspects necessary to bring the team to the highest levels is to constantly keep the market under control. No team is perfect, and it will be essential to find the right players to fill the holes. To do this we will be able to make use of the scouts (collaborators who we will have to hire anyway) to search around the world for the new soccer promises or, more brutally, use the search engine, customizable in every part, and hope that what we need is within the reach of our pockets. In any case, we will not always be able to have complete information on the players (to tell the truth, almost never for non-famous ones), and the scouts will again be useful for obtaining more information. Once we have found what we are looking for, we will then have to choose whether to buy it directly or opt for somethingcheaper options such as loan or co-ownership, negotiating with your team and finally defining the details of the contract, all seasoned with a myriad of different options. The workout This is perhaps the most difficult aspect of CM 03/04. Each phase of the weekly training must be set, day by day, and with each day divided into three distinct periods. The undertaking is decidedly difficult, since here too the range of possibilities is really wide, furthermore regardless of the settings it is extremely difficult to understand where one is going wrong and the only clues are the table of player improvements and a skimpy graph indicating which sector the training program is more intense. I tried for hours to find the best combinations, but the results were almost non-existent, moreover, at the beginning it is very difficult to understand what to do. A real pity, because it is structured in an excellent way, but it turns out to be a titanic undertaking even just obtaining minimal results. The match Once the team has been set up, the time has come to try it out in practice, i.e. on the field against ~real~ opponents, and in my opinion this is certainly the funniest part of CM. The interface during the games is very simple and intuitive. A series of screens summarize game statistics, from player performance to ball possession, and it is also possible to call up the tactic screen to make substitutions and give new indications. The best, however, is given by the very simple graphic representation of the match, which is very reminiscent of the very first Kick-Offs, with the players seen from above as colored dots. However, every movement, choice or tackle that the players make is calculated taking into account both their characteristics and their moment of form (after all, even a champion can have a bad day) and this gives life to extremely complex and realistic actions . Some defects still remain, such as the absence of the concept of passive offside, or some, fortunately rare, incomprehensible behaviors (such as defenders who instead of intercepting the ball run in the opposite direction to recover the position, allowing the attacker to catch the pass and continue the action), but the overall result is so exciting that more than once I found myself cheering like a fan after a particularly painful goal. Not just football CM 03/04 is a huge database, which contains data from 96 leagues from 42 countries, as well as national, continental and world cups, and their players (we are talking about over 255,000) and insiders. A painstaking job, even if, for obvious reasons, it becomes less precise when you go down to the lower leagues or in the countries that have only recently approached the ball. The only thing that leaves us a bit perplexed is the inability to identify our role as players in real teams. In fact, we won't be a Moggi, a Capello, or a Moratti, but a sort of middle ground between manager and coach (even if a little shifted towards the coach). We will therefore be able to decide to buy all the players we want, but the club will limit us in terms of the cost of the card and salary, and we will have no control over the purely economic operations of the club, such as management of the stadium and equipment (which we can request, but which could be denied to us), sponsors, subscriptions and merchandising, which will be completely automated based on our results. However, CM does not end here, in fact we can also decide to change teams by taking advantage of the exemption of some other colleagues, up to aiming to become national coach and try to win the World Cup. The possibilities are therefore many and depend only on the aspirations of the player. Final comment I still remember the times of the old Manager, when players were indicated by only 3 values and the only options were to choose the formation, buy new players in a very limited market, or send the team to retreat. Years have passed since those now historic beginnings, and everyone is making themselves heard! Despite this however, when compared to its predecessor (CM 4 released in April), CM 03/04 is just a tweak, with fewer bugs and small additions that embellish it and make it more fluid and intuitive, but without real innovations. For this reason, those who have already played CM 4 will be able to find the final mark excessive, but precisely because it is substantiallypart of an update, I don't think it is possible to express a vote in relation to its predecessor, and I refer you to the box for the detailed comparison between the two titles. Apart from this, however, CM 03/04 is a pleasant game, at times exciting, which has only the difficulty of some parts and the sense of bewilderment that one feels at the beginning when faced with such a large amount of data to analyze. A must for all lovers of concept football and not of muscles and sweat, and also a good starting point for those who want to approach this genre and are not the type to be discouraged in the face of the difficulties and failures that this title offers in abundance in the beginning, before becoming familiar with every part of it. Pros: Huge database: practically all the most important leagues in the world Possibility to really customize every aspect of your team Realistic representation of matches in 2D Cons: Too difficult to get results with training Considering the amount of things to manage, one feels the lack of a tutorial Playing all 96 divisions requires a NASA mainframe (30 minutes per game day on a P4 2800) 25th ~The referee kicked off the whistle, while the fans in the stands made the entire structure of the stadium tremble, cheering on their favorites. In the midst of that unbearable bustle, only one person remained cold and concentrated, because his or her success would depend on the result.~ future: winning would have made him the hero of the city, while defeat would have condemned him to an infamy exoneration.~ Championship Manager 03/04 is a managerial game (as the name suggests), and as such the task we will have to complete will be to organize the team, not to physically control the players on the pitch, so immediately remove yourself from the test joysticks and 3D graphics and start thinking in terms of statistics, training, tactics and the market. At the beginning we will have a group of players and collaborators (more or less good depending on the chosen team), a limited budget and a request from the management and the fans, which we will do well to satisfy if we don't want to be fired. Everything else will depend on our decisions. We will have to analyze the characteristics of the players, decide which ones to keep and which ones to put on the market, look for new elements to strengthen the team, choose the formation and the type of training and, obviously, direct our team in the match.", "date": "2003-12-29", "grade": null}
