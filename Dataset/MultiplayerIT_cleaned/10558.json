{"name": "I nazisti veramente cattivi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70195-wolfenstein-i-nazisti-veramente-cattivi.html", "text": "Version tested: PCAfter eight years of silence, during which the Second World War was gutted in all possible ways, with each time the attempt to present it in the most realistic and rigorous reconstruction possible, Id Software's fantasy shooter returns: let yourself behind you the beaches of Normandy, the islands of the Pacific and the deserts of Africa and get ready to enter the nightmare of Nazi genetic engineering. Forget, too, the totally anonymous soldiers, who almost forget that they represent the most evil army in history: in Wolfenstein there are the ~real~ Nazis, the very evil and merciless ones, who decades of Indiana Jones have taught us to know . Germany, 1945: having lost all hope of being able to win the war by traditional means, the third reich has pushed its research on the paranormal and on technobiology to the maximum to churn out hordes of armored soldiers, mutants, sci-fi armed and gifted in record time of psychic powers. The heart of the project is in the city of Eisenstadt, where the secret information of an ancient brotherhood is found, whose followers have found a way to enter a parallel dimension called The Veil and from which they have learned various powers capable of modifying the time, space and, to make matters worse, they have discovered a new source of energy more powerful than any other existing on earth. The mere idea that the Nazis are exploiting these powers convinces the allied secret services to send their best man to investigate the project and possibly stop it: B.J. Blaskowicz, whose paranormal experience is undoubted following the events at Castle Wolfenstein. Welcome to Eisenstadt The plot of Wolfenstein is certainly not the most complex there is in the world, and, indeed, it can be said that it is simply a glue with which to unite the different missions in the game, each of which will lead the player to discover new aberrant genetic and war experiments which the Nazis arrived with the exploitation of the powers of the Veil. The theater of the mission is the city of Eisenstadt, a real open-air battlefield between the army and the partisans of the Kreisau Circle (already appeared in the previous episode) that B.J. he will have to cross several times to reach the places where the real missions will take place. However, the possibility of ~exploring~ the city should not be mistaken as an attempt to remove the linearity that has always distinguished the products of the series. Simply, B.J. he will receive the missions from the partisans or members of the Black Sun cult and will carry them out one after the other, crossing the city, exterminating hordes of Nazis and reaching his goal, be it a hospital where genetic experiments are carried out, armaments factories science fiction or churches in which you try to revive the dead. Linearity that obviously continues during the actual missions: apart from rare and trivial puzzles, in fact, the player will simply have to advance by shooting everything that moves, trying to take advantage of the shelters in case he is seriously injured: following the current fashion, in fact , there is no energy bar, but a blurring graphic effect will warn the player that death is imminent and it is advisable to stay indoors for a few seconds to magically heal. One of the certain advantages of Wolfenstein is given by the variety of enemies and weapons present: where the other shooters on the Second World War limit themselves to presenting hordes of identical soldiers, whose maximum difference lies in the models of the uniforms, in Wolfenstein there are many ~classes of enemies to face. The most widespread are certainly the common Nazi soldiers, military veterans, they rely on the number to try to overwhelm the player by shooting at him with machine guns and rifles. The official municipalities are joined by them however the hierarchs of the Veil, endowed with magical powers capable of making themselves or their soldiers invulnerable, or of launching energy waves against their opponents. There is no shortage of supersoldiers, dressed in an exoskeleton and armed with sci-fi electric and plasma cannons, mutants of all kinds, often very fast and lethal in close combat, the undead and the inevitable end-of-level bosses who, perhaps a little nostalgic in this period, in Wolfenstein they return in all their gigantic splendor. Fortunately, to face these hordes of so different (and very bad) enemies, the good B.J does not have to rely on firearms alone: alongside the classic Mausere rifles and MP40 submachine guns, he will be able to take advantage of the cream of experimental weapons (there is no limit to the number of transportable objects)and moreover, thanks to the magic medallion that he found at the beginning of the adventure, he can in turn exploit the powers of the Veil to peer beyond walls, slow down time, become immune to the most common attacks and enhance the blows of his weapons, making them even more destructive. Ups and downs Graphically speaking, Wolfenstein defends itself quite well: although the game engine does not reach the quality level of Call of Juarez 2 or Call of Duty: World at War, the settings are realistic and, where necessary, obscure enough to leave the player satisfied , also by virtue of the not very high requirements required to run the game satisfactorily. The three-dimensional models of the characters are good, although there are some rare uncertainties in the animations and occasionally we see curious phenomena of interpenetration of the bodies, due to which it happens occasionally to see the barrel of a rifle sticking out of a wall (and shoot at it, Moreover). Excellent, really excellent, the special effects related to electricity, explosions, visual distortion caused by water or smoke and flamethrower fire: spectacular is the only word that can describe them correctly. As for the physics engine, the award-winning havock (that of Max Payne and Half Life 2) is used which manages, without major problems, to do its job: the flames logically spread throughout the environments and the bodies fall adapting to the surfaces on which they recline, the only noticeable defect is occasionally some hypergravity effect in the objects, in fact it happens that chairs and ornaments, if hit by bullets or bumped into by the characters, make rather improbable flights and falls. However, some doubts are left by the artificial intelligence of the enemies: although obviously one does not expect great tactical ruminations from drug-addicted mutants or Nazis stuffed into robocop armor, it is not clear why the enemy soldiers, although they try (and even suggest ) smart group tactics like attacking under cover, coming forward while the player reloads and taking cover when the player starts shooting, very often keeping out of sight, or walking several meters out of cover under fire, or standing still when they could very well charge and trap the protagonist. A few observations to make on the sound: the music is good and evocative, the sample of ambient sounds and weapon detonations is normal. The Italian dubbing of the characters is remarkable, with the only note that, for inexplicable reasons, the ~Nazi~ accent of the enemy soldiers has been practically eliminated, who now speak a clean and flawless Italian. Sin. The veil and the competition Wolfenstein's multiplayer mode is similar to those of thousands of other games of the same genre: there are several maps in which the teams of the Axis and the resistance that opposed it face each other in objectives such as capture the flag, conquer/defend the objective, slaughter the enemy. The two factions have three different classes (soldier, engineer, doctor) that respond to the classic canons of the genre (the soldier has access to heavy weaponry, the doctor dispenses medicine and brings his companions back to life, the engineer distributes ammunition, builds fixed fire and place bombs). Each class also has access to some Veil powers with which to enhance their basic skills and make their attacks more effective at the right time. We are therefore not talking about something extremely innovative or sensational, but in any case the balance between the classes and the captivating map design make Wolfenstein's multiplayer worth at least trying.", "date": "2009-09-02", "grade": "7.7"}
