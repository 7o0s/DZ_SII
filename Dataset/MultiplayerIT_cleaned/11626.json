{"name": "MX vs ATV Untamed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-vs-atv-untamed.html", "text": "For the uninitiated, MX vs ATV Untamed would in fact be the mobile conversion of a racing game of the same name released on the main home consoles. However, the conditional is a must, given that the only element that the Universomo product has in common with its older brothers is basically just the name. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, the title refers to Stuntman Ignition, from which it inherited the graphic solutions and numerous gameplay aspects. The user therefore controls his motorcycle on a strictly two-dimensional scenario, characterized by jumps, bumps and various bumps, all to be tackled in the best possible way in order to minimize the loss of speed. The discriminating factor is represented by the inclination of your two wheels, easily manageable through the directional cross: you will therefore need to be careful to land correctly after a jump, but also to distribute the weight well while tackling the various ups and downs. The final yield is guaranteed by some appreciable physical routines, even if the level design certainly does not make life easier for the player: following a rather bland first stage, the game undergoes a dizzying surge in the level of difficulty, which remains on rather high peaks high for all subsequent 39 scenarios. To appreciate MX vs ATV Untamed you must therefore arm yourself with patience and prepare yourself for a difficult challenge, which however does not deny moments of genuine satisfaction. The product offers three modes - championship, challenge against time and freestyle - which ultimately resolve themselves into the same playful substance: running as hard as you can trying to stay in the saddle and performing a few tricks in order to multiply your score. Even the execution of the acrobatics just mentioned is quite intuitive, and even if the moves available are not particularly numerous, they are all quite spectacular and fun to perform. Unlike its ~inspirer~ Stuntman Ignition, MX vs ATV Untamed suffers from a palpable underlying repetitiveness, which in the first title was averted by the presence of different obstacles and objectives in each level: here it is always and only a matter of reaching the finish line all whole and with an adequate score, an operation that objectively gets boring in the long run. From a technical point of view, unlike similar products such as FMX III Hardcore by I-Play, MX vs ATV Untamed has chosen the 2D path, gaining in slenderness and speed but accusing the blow in terms of visual impact: in short, although it is not to be thrown away, it certainly cannot be said that the Universomo work is a real pleasure for the eyes. The scenarios are in fact rather bare and chromatically monotonous, without denoting a particular attention to detail: however, the good realization of the motorcycle and pilot sprites and the animations assigned to them intervene to save the situation.
