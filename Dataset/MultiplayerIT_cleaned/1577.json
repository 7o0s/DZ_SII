I just got there earlier Throughout the eight levels that make up the game, you'll hear more than one McClane-esque joke. The fact that the character is dubbed in Italian, among other things with the splendid voice of Mario Cordova (who, strangely, has not voiced Willis in any film of the Die Hard series, but he did in Pulp Fiction and in the TV show Moonlighting) , it really helps a lot to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Die Hard: Vendetta. While we're at it, let's open a small parenthesis: the dubbing of the game is a bit ~strange~: at the beginning only the voice of the omnipresent Marco Balzarotti (voice actor of Sirius the Dragon in Knights of the Zodiac, just to one, and for years engaged in the dubbing of video games (you know Warcraft and Mafia?), disguised a dozen times to adapt to as many characters. Later, however, the aforementioned Cordova and other voice actors arrive to act as a side dish, giving the product a much more professional air. Closed the discourse on adaptation, let's move on to the structure of the game. Die Hard: Vendetta, as already mentioned, is a classic FPS but with some adventure elements. In addition to shooting and destroying everything that moves, in fact, it is also very important to interact with the characters you will meet and with the environment in general. The X button lets you talk, open containers, and activate switches. These are fundamental things for the continuation of the game, and it is often advisable to listen fully to what people have to say: they could point you in the right direction or give you an important item. Also very interesting is the possibility of arresting criminals, arriving behind them in ~stealth mode~ (i.e. simply with the weapon not pointed, moving more slowly than normal) and always pressing X. This sometimes allows you to solve otherwise desperate situations, such as when hostages are at stake and one wrong move can decree their elimination (with the consequent game over, of course). Between old and new The first-person shooter structure allows you to insert some new features, and the developers have done so with ~hero time~: for a limited period of time, by pressing the Dual Shock 2's two analog sticks on its base, you can move ~in slow motion~ to deal with the most difficult enemies, in order to dodge their blows and inflict more damage in less time. All while playing Beethoven's 9th Symphony in the background! This is something I've personally only used a couple of times, against tough opponents. For all the others, even a simple revolver is enough, provided you move with cunning and caution. The control system is simple and intuitive: the left analog stick is used to move forward, backward or sideways, while the right one is responsible for aiming and therefore also for changing direction on the move. I highly recommend changing the aim setting, by reversing directions, for those used to playing flight simulators and the like. The directional cross is used to quickly scroll through the weapons (quite numerous, actually) or to select inventory items, while the back keys allow you to shoot or use ~manual aim~ (equipped with zoom, in some cases). Finally, the ~normal~ keys are used to speak / open, jump and switch to stealth mode. You can maintain good behavior even in the most agitated situations, which is essential. From this point of view, one can only complain about the lack of accuracy when trying to hit distant targets, even with the sniper rifle. The graphics of the game are functional, there is no arguing about that. Die Hard: Vendetta is not a title that makes you cry out for the amount of polygons on the screen or for the power of the graphics engine (which, to be honest, sometimes struggles a bit). The characters have been done quite well, but not in the way you might expect from a 2003 PS2 game. Fortunately, everything fades into the background after a few games, thanks to the atmosphere, dialogue and action The music is not very incisive, the effects good but not exceptional. In short, the sound aspect of the game really owes a lot to the dubbing and localization in Italian. Concluding... If you liked the films of the Die Hard series, buying Die Hard: Revenge will not be a mistake at all. This is not a game that amazes for its qualities, but the structure is solid and there are so manyThings to do. As far as longevity is concerned, the eight levels offer medium-length entertainment and lend themselves to being replayed. The lack of checkpoints (there's only one per stage) makes things very frustrating at times, and you end up doing much of what you've done all over again (or the entire level, if you load the game) several times, when an obstacle of a certain size is encountered. Being able to complete the missions, however, gives great satisfaction. All this is accompanied by some multiplayer modes (exploitable especially if you have a Multitap and four pads) and a nice ~making of~ with interviews with the programmers, also translated (only textually, however) into Italian. Ultimately, Die Hard: Vendetta is a first person shooter that winks at first-person adventures. Beyond the technical realization, the final result seems enjoyable and fun to me. Pros: Valid and engaging game structure Dubbed in Italian, with Mario Cordova's voice Equipped with a certain depth Cons: Not exceptional graphics Not very engaging music Often frustrating The return of the prodigal son The plot of Die Hard: Vendetta refers in many ways to that of the third film in the series. In that case, the role of ~villain~ belonged to Jeremy Irons, who played the brother of Hans Gruber, killed by Willis/McClane in the first Die Hard. In the game, however, McClane will have to deal with Piet Gruber, son of Hans and trafficker of works of art. We are located in Los Angeles. Christopher Von Laben, supervisor of the Townsend Art Museum, organizes a ceremony to celebrate the arrival of a particularly valuable painting, donated by Piet Gruber. The reality, however, is quite different: Gruber's men, taking advantage of the situation and with the complicity of Von Laben, intend to steal all the paintings in the museum, replacing them with fakes. Caught red-handed by officer Lucy McClane, they take the girl hostage and precipitate the situation. Sitting in front of the TV broadcasting the event, John McClane certainly cannot sit idle, and so he runs to his daughter's aid. If for other games the plot is simply a side element, in Die Hard: Vendetta the developers have tried to make it central. Players, impersonating McClane in a classic first person shooter but with different adventure elements, are faced with an experience that closely resembles the films of the Die Hard series.", "date": "2003-07-22", "grade": null}
