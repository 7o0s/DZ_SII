{"name": "Una citt luminosa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143833-lumino-city-una-citta-luminosa.html", "text": "Sequel to the controversial Lume, released in 2011 as a real archetype of what is now presented as a complete product, Lumino City is the result of the efforts of the London-based team State Of Play, a multifaceted software house active not only in the videogame sector but also in advertising and edutainment. We are dealing here with a graphic adventure with a truly delightful style. One of the most talked about aspects of Lumino City lies in the way in which the settings saw the light: in fact, they were physically created, using humble materials such as paper and glue, screws and ropes, wood and wire. Each scenario is therefore a real diorama in which creativity and attention to detail are expressed at the highest levels: after all, three years of work were required to obtain such an extraordinary result, which involved real professionals such as architects, technicians of lights, interior decorators and designers. The view used is what we could define in 2.5D that we have come to know from the days of Pandemonium! and Abe's Odyssey: the main scenes are therefore represented in two dimensions, but the camera that follows the protagonist frames the landscape using all dimensional axes. Never as in this case is it appropriate to refer to the camera, as the settings have been physically filmed and what happens on the screen is therefore not the result of mathematical calculations but of real shots. If anyone were to think of the plasticine Neverhood, an unforgettable adventure from the mid-Nineties whose spiritual sequel Armikrog is expected shortly, it would have hit the mark: the same techniques were used in that case too. More than an adventure it is a puzzle game in which the puzzles are amalgamated by a delightful graphic style Short but intense? The protagonist of the story, Lumi, must once again go on the trail of her grandfather who mysteriously disappeared and to achieve her goal she will have to contend with a series of non-trivial, even if not particularly complicated, puzzles. In fact, most of the puzzles in Lumino City are represented by geometric / mathematical exercises along the lines of the Rubik's cube, and they almost always take place within the individual scenarios, therefore without the possibility of retracing one's steps. However, the level of difficulty is increased by a choice that forces you to sharpen your eyesight: the mouse cursor does not change according to the area you pass over, and this makes discovering the so-called ~hot points~ a little more challenging. although the cleanliness of the ~drawings~ certainly helps in the research. There is an inventory that is rarely used and which can be accessed in case you get stuck on a single puzzle for too long, provided you have the patience to read all the thousand pages of a nice memorandum that the little protagonist carries from the very beginning. More than an adventure tout-court, it is essentially a puzzle game in which, however, the different challenges are well linked thanks to the excellent structure of the scenarios. The game, written entirely in Flash, can be taken easily even for very short sessions and requires a handful of hours to complete. The plot, carried out with the comics technique, turns out to be perhaps a little too weak, but at least it suits the innocent style with which the characters are made. The soundtrack unfortunately turns out to be devoid of the charisma that the visual aspect shows off: one cannot speak of insufficiency, but to get on par with the enchanting graphic design, the musicians would have had to reach decidedly higher standards. The longevity aspect is shaky: apart from sporadic moments that could keep the casual player blocked for a few minutes too long, Lumino City can be completed, if desired, even in one breath. This means that to be able to see the end credits you won't need more than four or five hours which are honestly a little too skimpy and that leave you dumbfounded: if on the one hand you can be forgiven given the ~indie~ nature of the adventure, on the other it is difficult to digest considering the price of  19.99. In conclusion, some annoying bugs that refer to the Windows desktop for no apparent reason should be mentioned: the problems have already been reported on the dedicated forums and it seems that State Of Play is taking measures with a future patch.", "date": "2015-02-03", "grade": "6.8"}
