Nothing could be more wrong: it all starts from none other than a Disney World attraction called ~Pirates of the Caribbean~, the last one to which Walt Disney personally contributed. Developed in the 1950s but only inaugurated in 1967, it is still today one of the most successful ~rides~ in the park, thanks to its exceptional capacity and continuous technological renewal. Inside, in fact, there are more than one hundred animatronics and the path to be followed on board the boat measures about five hundred meters. Between one scene and another, there are numerous references to characters appearing in the films, and the atmosphere is king, interspersed with thrilling ~dives~. From amusement parks to movies, from movies to video games, the road traveled by Jack Sparrow and his companions has also seen the birth of some spin-offs, such as this Pirates of the Caribbean Poker: a card game (but not only! ) in which we will have to take on the role of a pirate and face a series of opponents in each port, measuring ourselves against them not with the sword but on the gaming table. From the start screen we will be able to choose whether to start the story, try our hand at a solitaire (resuming an already completed stage), play a quick game (with random values), adjust personal settings or challenge a friend in a round game. The story represents the most substantial modality, the one in which we will move to a certain number of locations to play from time to time in a different way: sometimes it will be poker games, sometimes dice, sometimes blackjack, for a total of seven variants. It is interesting to note that the table can be approached by choosing between an arcade or realistic setting: in the first case, the cards will be decidedly more ~lucky~, fitting straights and so on to a much greater extent than with the realistic approach. The control system is quite simple, with the joystick to move the on-screen indicator, the 5 key to confirm moves and the * key to check the money left for all players sitting at the table. Our goal is to tear apart all the others, one by one, in order to be able to move on to the next port Although it is a card game, this Pirates of the Caribbean Poker shows a respectable technical realization. The graphics show the various characters of the films represented in a rather successful caricature, with a good use of colors and scenarios of discreet workmanship. The animations are absent, as could be expected, but the goodness of the interface makes us defer to the lack of solutions of greater impact: the hands are always very legible and there is never the risk of interpreting the information incorrectly. The sound sector, for once, tries to do its part and contribute to the general atmosphere, in this case with a good MIDI version of the original film music, the volume of which can also be adjusted independently from the mobile phone. PRO Good number of minigames Technically well done Simple and addictive AGAINST Not all minigames are at the same level Sometimes very challenging Sometimes the games last a long time", "date": "2008-08-13", "grade": "S.V."}
