{"name": "Detective Gallo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/detective-gallo-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Long gone are the days when point-and-click adventures, at the height of their popularity, entertained legions of gamers with their irreverent streak of humor and a multitude of challenging puzzles to solve. The sagas of LucasArts are still remembered with nostalgia by longtime fans: titles such as Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle and many others have literally marked an era for those who preferred to put narrative and deductive reasoning before naked action and raw. Many things have changed since then and today the genre survives above all thanks to that small niche of enthusiasts who appreciate works with a calm and staid rhythm. This same passion must have also united the guys from Footprints Games, the small Italian development studio to which we owe the creation of Detective Gallo. Clearly inspired by the great classics of the genre, the adventure was funded a couple of years ago through the Eppela crowdfunding platform and debuted on Steam and GOG in May this year. Only recently, however, the title has also landed on PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch and it is precisely on this latest version that we have had the opportunity to get our hands on. Gall's rules For the creation of Detective Gallo, the developers have chosen a very colorful, simple and clean graphic style, entirely based on hand-made illustrations and animations. The protagonist of an unlikely and bizarre investigation is precisely Gallo, a grumpy private investigator with a mission: to solve all those cases that require a good dose of ~little gray cells~, to put it in the manner of the affable Hercule Poirot. Our alter ego claims that he doesn't like the city in which he lives and works at all, but his extraordinary professionalism encourages him to always give his best in every case that involves him, even when an equally bizarre multi-millionaire in crisis asks for his services. mystic after her beloved decorative plants were brutally killed by still unknown individuals. It is precisely following this strange event that the investigations and deductions of the witty protagonist will begin, immediately grappling with objects to recover and cold interrogations of the local population in search of crucial information to carry on the case. But Gallo is also the man of rules, no matter how many there are. There is an unwritten code, a handbook made up of maxims and pragmatic considerations on how to deal with all the problems and lessons that working life has taught him over the years. But even the best are not infallible. Even the iron and stainless mind of our indomitable feathered detective falters and then well... rule n. 245 by Gallo who remembers it anymore? And how did the 359 do? It does not matter! There are still trifles for the most feared and respected detective in the entire city. The mastery of the haughty protagonist is thus lashed by a subtle but constant vein of humor which accompanies the work for its entire duration. Jokes and sarcasm find fertile ground above all by leveraging the absurdity of some of the situations that emerge as the story continues and moves towards the epilogue. Events that in truth have not always managed to involve us to the point of making us laugh out loud, even though they never came to be out of place, annoying or somehow forced. A classic point and click adventure Being a classic point-and-click adventure, Detective Gallo provides for a marked interaction with the objects present in the various game screens. Sometimes it is sufficient to recover a specific material to then proceed towards the next objective, while in other cases it is necessary to combine several elements together or to exploit only one to obtain something useful and continue the investigation. At the top of the screen you can access a bar in which all the objects collected up to that moment are kept, flanked by the inevitable notebook where the tasks to be completed are diligently stored. The search for the correct logical path is partially facilitated by the so-called Sense of Rooster, useful for identifying all the interactive points present within each screen. Some will simply provoke a reaction in the protagonist, who will subsequently continue undeterred in the search for a solution to the problem, while in other situations a heated confrontation is created with the characters involved in the events from time to time. The dubbing in Italian allows you to better identify yourself in the most unlikely situations, with a style of the characters that is well suited to the unserious atmosphere of the game.game. We also point out that the voice of the protagonist bird was entrusted to Federico Maggiore, who perhaps some of you will also remember for the contributions to the video previews and video reviews right here on the pages of Multiplayer.it. As mentioned, Detective Gallo's humor never gets to take off as one would expect, it experiences many ups and downs, and we should certainly work on this in view of a hypothetical sequel. Longevity is around five or six hours, depending on how quickly the player is able to recover the objects necessary to solve the investigation managed by our feathered detective. Moreover, despite the limited duration of the story, one ends up returning often and willingly to the places already visited previously. A choice that undoubtedly leaves some doubts, because a few more screens and characters would certainly have benefited the general impact that the title has on the user. Thumbs up, instead, for the soundtrack, influenced by slow noir jazz sounds and supported by an effective background based on trumpets, saxophones and percussions.", "date": "2018-08-29", "grade": "S.V."}
