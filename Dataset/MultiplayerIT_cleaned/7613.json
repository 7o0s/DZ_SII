We immediately point out that this is the first time of a The King of Fighters on PC, at least officially (through emulation it is possible to play almost all the old episodes), given that the previous chapters have never enjoyed a version dedicated to the world of computers and that The King of Fighters Online, which entered beta in late August, is a MOBA. In a certain sense we find ourselves talking about a small event, which we hope will be repeated in the future with titles of similar beauty. Yes, because The King of Fighters XIII is a fighting game with undoubted qualities, as already well told by the good Giovanni Polito in the review of the console version, of which we can only confirm the vote (with a small distinction which we will talk about in the next paragraph) and to which we refer you for all the details. It is one of the best exponents of the genre of the current generation of gaming machines, capable of remedying the mistakes made by the most recent chapters and bringing the series back to its original splendor, giving it back the prestige it deserves. The plot continues and concludes the story of Ash Crimson, an androgynous character in appearance and behavior, who continues in his quest for absolute power. Obviously it is not the plot that pushes anyone to devote themselves to a The King of Fighters, but the richness of its cast and the variety of moves proposed, all elements that excel here. Let's prevent some criticism: it's easy to accuse The King of Fighters XIII of being a mere fan service. However, doing so would make an unforgivable fundamental mistake, given the entire series is a fan service by design. Born to collect and bring together characters from different SNK series, gradually introducing new ones, it has never actually hidden its more alluring side towards players of other titles and, indeed, soon made it its strong point . Not for nothing is it the only surviving series among those published in the nineties by SNK (who remembers the Art of Fighting? Just to give an example) and therefore the only one that keeps the memory of the label's works high. The King of Fighters XIII also comes to PC in its best incarnation What's new in the PC version If you have gone to the bottom of the article, you will have already seen that the rating of this version has increased by one point compared to that console. The reasons for the upward retouching are easily explained. The first is that SNK Playmore has done a great job on the netcode, which ensures stable and lag-free online games. Our direct experience speaks of about forty clashes without the slightest delay (actually in one case we recorded a shot, but it was not compromising and one case out of forty remains a more than acceptable average). In short, it seems that the prolonged and accurate beta testing phase has only done good for The King of Fighters XIII, which is more stable online even than famous competitors such as Street Fighter IV. The other novelty, more than welcome, is the inclusion of all DLC characters in the base package. Iori Yagami, Mr. Karate and Kyo Kusanagi NESTS are no longer purchased separately, as was the case on consoles, but are available immediately, bringing the roster of characters to thirty-six. It is clear that these are not revolutions in content, but welcome additions that are worth rewarding. Let's also add a third added value: on PC there are fewer fighting games than on consoles, so when a title of this level comes out it's worth emphasizing its existence. For the rest, the characteristics remain the same as the 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts, including the very difficult final boss, which reminded us of the good old Krisalid (Rugal and others were much more affordable), and also including all the scenarios and the plot divided into blocks. There is no shortage of tutorials and different game modes, as well as Steam achievements and trading cards. Obviously we strongly advise you to equip yourself with a good joypad to play it, even if the best is obtained with an arcade joystick. But if you like fighting games and dating, you should already know this.", "date": "2013-09-19", "grade": "9.1"}
