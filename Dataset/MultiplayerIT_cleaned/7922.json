{"name": "Postal 4 - No Regerts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/postal-4-no-regerts-recensione.html", "text": "Do you know Sharknado, an unthinkable 2013 film in which adorable sharks jumped out of a waterspout causing terror on the streets of Los Angeles? It was undoubtedly the most striking example of a work ~so ugly that it is beautiful~. Postal 4 fits right into the first part of the famous phrase, but will the usual doses of vulgarity and violence be enough to complete the sentence and enter the Olympus of video games? Reading the comments on the early access version it would seem so, we will try to provide a more critical point of view in our review of Postal 4: No Regerts. The Postal Dude is back! The cover of Postal 4 This is not a typo, you read that right: Postal 4 starts off on the wrong foot right from the title. Filed the unfortunate interlude of the renegade Postal 3 (that was just ugly, with an enviable 3 saddled by our Tommaso), whose creation had however been entrusted to an external team, Running with Scissors started work on the fourth chapter even three Years ago. The skeleton of the game has remained similar to that of Postal 2: the title is divided into five days (from Monday to Friday) and in each of them our Postal Dude will have to try his hand at increasingly epic enterprises. Having abandoned the city of Paradise, the scene of the previous raids, the filthiest hero in videogame history is robbed of his camper while he is fulfilling his physiological needs together with his faithful dog Champ. Without a dollar, but with a great desire to climb the social ladder, he arrives in the town of Edensin where he will start with the most menial jobs: maintenance man of the sewer system, dog catcher, prison warden. Obviously every task can be completed with the attitude of someone who ~goes to the post office~, so fights in prison will be put down with the sound of gunfire, traffic jams in the sewers will be cleaned up by throwing grenades inside the pipes (perhaps paying attention not to be overwhelmed by debris...), fines for cars regularly parked by destroying parking meters. There are therefore multiple ways to solve the quests, although in most cases you will prefer the faster and more violent one. Why waste time catching cats with croquettes when you can shovel them and then use them, against their will, as silencers for a Kalashnikov? Weapons and other amenities Excuse me, do you have a light? In this regard, the arsenal of the Running with Scissors game proves to be among the most creative (and vulgar) conceived: in addition to the classic weapons that mimic those of PUBG (including the red flare gun), cages of pigeons, mops for cleaning floors, spray cans up to the definitive Spurt'N'Squirt 9000, whose name should need no explanation. Triviality, especially of a sexual nature, is intrinsic in the DNA of the game but probably no longer as disruptive as it was at the beginning of the millennium with Postal 2, either because the shock effect has been assimilated, or because that flash of madness that had characterized the first two episodes. One of the designers' greatest merits is that they have filled the protagonist's days with a series of amusing tasks, such as sabotaging the amusement park rides or petitioning to install a bidet in every Edensin home. Of course, the most reluctant citizens will be happy to put their signature with a gun pointed at their temple... However, the real reason for the success of the series are the numerous citations, ranging from TV series, to films, to video games themselves. On Thursdays, for example, Postal Dude has to deliver catnip to the basement of a pet store, with a clear reference to Breaking Bad, but scattered here and there we also find tributes to Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Demolition Man. Then there are references to other games, in particular to the first id Software titles, Half-Life, Duke Nukem. In short, you will spend a good part of the exploratory phase just for the pleasure of finding all the easter eggs hidden by the developers, some of which are in bizarre places. The level design is another of the most interesting aspects of Postal 4, with locations that develop over two floors and contain numerous hidden passages. A disaster all along the line Postal Dude portrayed in a moment of reflection If from a ~cultural~ and level structure point of view, the new episode of the saga proves to be on a good level, from a technical point of view it is a disaster across the board. We are in the presence of a title so poorly optimized and graphically poor that the doubt that certain opprobriums have been placed there artfully is more than legitimate. Postal 4 uses the fourth versionne of the Unreal Engine, a toolset that by now should have no more secrets even for less experienced programmers, let alone for those who have been on the scene for over twenty years. Still, the game is marred by loading times that are incredible: even the introductory logo snaps! You will be able to whiz with your electric wheelchair for only a few tens of meters, after which Postal 4 will stop for about ten seconds to load the next portion of the map. An open world map which, to be generous, is smaller than that of the first Assassin's Creed, anno domini 2008, which already had no problems of this kind at the time. And that's despite the 32GB of RAM and Corsair's ultra-fast SSD (an MP600 Pro XT) used in the Editors' Choice system. It's not just bad optimization, on the contrary: this is just the tip of the iceberg. Speaking of physics, for example, you will immediately notice that the ~hitboxes~ are random: hit a passerby in the waist with the machete-boomerang and you will find him decapitated, throw a grenade at him and he will not rebound, sprinkle him with petrol and the wall will catch fire by his side. On the other hand, there are many voices Who wouldn't fall for Postal Dude? Since we like to twist the knife in the wound, just like the Postal Dude would, let's talk about artificial intelligence. Here we enter the field of metaphysics: at any level of difficulty the behavior of the inhabitants of Edensin does not change. You can shoot a protester in a procession and the other five around him will stand still as if nothing had happened, as will some prison rioters who, after hinting at a reaction, will freeze and await their execution. On the other hand, try to put a ticket on a parked car and the owner will pull out the .22 in the space of a few tenths of a second, even if he is strolling across the block. Total embarrassment also for the graphics: in Arizona (the state where the developer is based) the calendar must have stopped at the beginning of the millennium, because Postal 4 is struggling to keep up even with the games that ran with the first GeForce. Sorry to be so severe, but, just to give an example, the Blood Spear tech-demo tested a few months ago and created by a group of novice high school students, looks like a triple A title in comparison. Incorrectness is the order of the day at Postal 4 It seems that all the effort has been poured into the dubbing: Postal Dude, initially played by Jon St. John (the same as Duke Nukem and Serious Sam), can also take on the historic voices of Rick Hunter (Postal 2), acclaimed by the fans after an initial refusal and even Corey Cruise, who had lent his vocal chords for the third chapter. This is probably a real record.", "date": "2022-04-18", "grade": "4.0"}
