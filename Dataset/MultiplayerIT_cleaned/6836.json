To be fair, the title developed by h.a.n.d. on behalf of Bandai Namco has already been released for a few months both in North America and in Japan, where it has enjoyed some success. It therefore arrives on our shelves, the texts localized in Italian and the dubbing in English, a few months before a Christmas in which it could be the perfect video game to put under the tree of children and grandchildren. For the older ones it's a different story, and it's worth trying to understand how much it really has in common with the two ~life simulators~ signed by Nintendo... Sooner or later someone had to think about crossing Animal Crossing with Disney characters! Stickers, stickers everywhere! The first minutes of the game are very predictable: we are called to create our Mii or to import a ready-made one that will represent us in the town of Castellopoli, a kingdom that impressively recalls Disneyland, where Miis and Disney characters practically live side by side. The tutorial, let's be honest, is very heavy: the game of h.a.n.d. he takes us by the hand and explains to us every single option or feature of the game, implicitly emphasizing the real target of the game, namely the little ones. Once this tedious and necessary introductory phase has been overcome, and made friends with the king of Castellopoli and its illustrious Disneyan inhabitants, we immediately go into action. Fans of Animal Crossing and Tomodachi Life will immediately recognize some common features, such as the importance of collecting objects and materials scattered around the city or the need to socialize with the inhabitants of Castletown to become popular and unlock new content. The interaction relies on the directional cross and the corresponding greetings that it is possible to address to the various inhabitants, who could reward us with objects or stickers: the latter are crucial, since each Disney Magical World content requires a certain number of stickers to be unlocked, imposing a gradual progression that prevents you from immediately revealing every feature of the game while offering a fair amount of freedom of action. Unlike Animal Crossing, in which the unlocking of content depends on the passage of time and the calendar, in Disney Magical World it is theoretically possible to continuously unlock each new element simply by accumulating stickers thanks to the tasks entrusted to us by the inhabitants of Castellopoli. The problem is that it would get pretty monotonous pretty soon, because the random tasks are downright mundane and repetitive, all centered around collecting and delivering items, materials, and clothing. In this sense, Disney Magical World should be played in small doses just like the most famous Nintendo ~life simulators~, in order to avoid getting bored soon. Fortunately, however, the various features that can be unlocked gradually contribute to broadening the spectrum of activities, making each game session potentially different from the others. The 3D effect Without infamy or praise, the stereoscopic effect of Disney Magical World gives the minimum of depth that could justify moving the lever, but heavily affects the frame rate, making us strongly advise against it. Photos, ghosts and pastries The various Disney characters are not mere extras, but the reference points around which some important moments of our life in Castellopoli revolve. Donald Duck will teach us how to fish in his pond, Daisy Duck will sew us tailored clothes and costumes, Chip and Dale will make furniture for us and so on. There is a kind of crafting system, in Disney Magical World, which allows you to consume the materials recovered around Castellopoli and its surroundings to make various objects: it is also possible to buy them in Uncle Scrooge's shop managed by Qui, Quo and Qua, but why further inflate the pockets of that greedy rich man? If the clothes are mostly used to socialize with the inhabitants, and perhaps to unlock a few more stickers, representing a divertissement just like the Animal Crossing clothing items were, the furniture and upholstery that can be manufactured are intertwined with the small restaurant that will be entrusted to us. Not entirely dissimilar from our home in Animal Crossing, the restaurant is a kind of management minigame in which we will be able to furnish the living room as we like, but also decide the menu to offer to customers and hire staff, also choosing the way in which our employees must dress when they report to work. The popularity of our local couldbbe attract the attention of other Disney characters with whom we will therefore have one more opportunity to interact, and it is also the meeting point between multiple players in the limited multiplayer function offered by Disney Magical World. Part pastime and part ~didactic experiment~, the restaurant is one of the features that most distinguishes the h.a.n.d. from the competition, but it is not alone. Between the dance competitions at Cinderella's court and the missions on behalf of Aladdin in Agrabah, for example, we could decide to explore the dungeons in search of rare objects and materials: armed with Yen-Sid's magic wand, Disney Magical World turns into a kind of action adventure in which we will fight ghosts and other funny enemies in real time with spells. The various wands that can be manufactured and equipped offer different types of magic, but the difficulty of the clashes is calibrated downwards to appeal to younger players, while representing a nice interlude in an RPG key without too many pretensions but certainly pleasant. In this sense, Disney Magical World hits the target perfectly: even without daring, it manages to capture the attention of the little ones thanks to the enchanting Disney universe and to amaze the older ones with decidedly interesting gimmicks. It therefore remains to be understood why the legendary Mickey Mouse fails to win against Tom Nook...", "date": "2014-10-16", "grade": "7.5"}
