{"name": "Call of Duty: World at War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-world-at-war_a.html", "text": "Call of Duty has been a certainty for years for fans of the first person shooter genre: the series was born on PC in 2003 thanks to the developers of Infinity Ward for Activision, who combined spectacularity and depth in an exceptional mix. The step towards the world of consoles was short: the second episode was converted exclusively for Xbox 360, the third also sanctioned the opening towards PlayStation 3 and Wii. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, then, is recent history: also produced as a multiplatform title (skipping the Wii in this case, but appearing well in a portable reduction for Nintendo DS), it saw the momentary abandonment of the 40s in favor of a current scenario. With this fifth episode (which however does not bear numbers in the title), the baton passes into the hands of the Treyarch team and the setting returns to that of the Second World War. In the mobile sector, however, things do not change that much: also in this case it is Glu who takes care of the reduction for mobile phones, unfortunately starting from the far from positive experience with the conversion of COD4. The first impact with Call of Duty: World at War for mobile phones, unfortunately, is not the best: the references to the mediocre reduction work of the previous episode are all there. In fact, Glu has done nothing but reuse a ready-made game engine and structure, adapting the rest for the occasion. So away from the first person shooter setting (a genre that seemed destined for great things on mobile phones, but which has recently been put aside a bit), in favor of a classic top-down action game in which we dress the clothes of a soldier of the allied troops. We will have to face a certain number of stages, providing support to the teams in action and eliminating any enemy we meet along the way. At our disposal there will be a fairly rich arsenal, which allows us not only to hit the opponents but also to destroy sections of the background, when perhaps they block the road (see the flamethrower, with which it is possible to burn hostile vegetation), and the structure itself of the internships may undergo variations depending on the occasion. The control system sees us move our character using the d-pad, shoot with the 5 key and throw grenades (if available) with a double pressure of the # key: once to determine the target, once again to hit . Using firearms, we won't need to aim: the game has an automatic system that allows us to hit the closest enemy with our volleys, clearly visible on the screen. The clashes are often decided by the presence or absence of shelters: if there are any, then we will simply have to take cover behind one of them and shoot only at the right moment; otherwise, it will be better to strike from a distance, when they have not yet noticed our presence. The technical implementation of the game has not improved compared to last year: if it already appeared below average then, now it can only be inadequate compared to the good things we have seen on mobile phones in recent times (also and above all by by Glu!). The sprites are tiny, with a confused design, characterized by a truly laughable and essential animation. And the situation doesn't improve for the backgrounds, which are overflowing with redundant elements and textures. Finally, the sound consists of some MIDI music that may not be bad, but which in the general picture cannot in any way raise the qualitative level of a tie-in which is really pulled out. PRO Good number of internships Simple and immediate Some variation in gameplay AGAINST Unwatchable sprites and animations No innovative elements Very linear", "date": "2008-11-18", "grade": "S.V."}
