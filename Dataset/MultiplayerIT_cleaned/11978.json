{"name": "Black Book", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-book-recensione.html", "text": "What would you be willing to sacrifice for the person you love most in the world? Vasilisia, the protagonist of Black Book, has no doubts and for this reason she has decided to become a witch. However, do not think of an intrinsically evil figure, because the adventure conceived by Morteshka allows us to do evil as much as good. Here is our review of Black Book, an interesting if imperfect deck building RPG. From Russia with love Black Book: Russia and mythology Black Book, as mentioned, starts from an interesting premise. Vasilisia, an orphan raised by an old koldun (ie a sorcerer), has lost her beloved, who committed suicide. The man is therefore destined for Hell, as Christianity teaches us, but the young woman does not want to give up. She then agrees to become a witch, wield the Black Book and break the seven seals. Succeeding means being able to make a wish and Vasilisia wants only one thing: to reunite with her other half. From here begins a journey that will take us around Russia, hunting for demons and everything we need to advance our journey. Black Book is strongly based on the Slavic culture of the north and has the clear goal of teaching it to us too. The whole adventure is a concentrate of traditions, pagan rites, mythologies and magical creatures typical of the region. Morteshka has also stuffed the game with Russian terms, which are fortunately explained by a glossary in real time (just hover over the colored word for a complete explanation). It is a unique subject and also quite interesting. The same can be said of the main plot: between characters who will enter Vasilisia's life, demonic creatures ready to serve us and some fierce antagonists, the cast of Black Book is certainly not limited in purely numerical terms. In qualitative terms, while not crying out for a miracle, we can be satisfied with the characters staged, simple but pleasant and, especially in the final stages, ready to offer us different points of view within a Russia that is still mostly rural and ~superstitious~ , but which approaches the modern world (the period is not clearly defined, but we are talking about the second half of the 1800s). The real problem of Black Book, both narratively and playfully, as we will see later, is the pace. The game tends to drag out many events, inserting various uninteresting sections that add little to nothing to the story. Black Book is in fact very verbose and structurally repetitive: the adventure is divided into chapters, each of which is composed of a series of events placed in a precise order on a map (with some optional deviations). Our task is to pass from one event to another, simply by clicking on the next point on the map. Only the final areas of each Black Book chapter offer a real explorable 3D area, always very small and mostly bare, with just a few points of interaction to collect healing herbs and activate the plot event of the moment. Instead, most events are a fixed screen with a backdrop (most of the time some forest, which will repeat soon) with several lines of text, often too many. These generic events are extremely repetitive and have no impact on the plot: after a few hours it is natural to avoid reading and press directly on one of the available choices to avoid wasting time. Those choices are fight, escape and occasionally the possibility of solving the matter with words or playing cards (Durak, a Nordic game whose rules we don't understand, we admit). The Black Book Each turn we choose a few pages to attack with Among the various choices, as just mentioned, there is combat (some fights are mandatory, including bosses). But how exactly to play in Black Book? Basically we are talking about a deck-building style turn-based RPG. We need to create a deck made up of the pages of the Black Book, that is, of spells that are capable of attacking the enemy, applying defenses and bonuses to Vasilisia or malus on enemies. As we progress through the game we get new pages with various effects and, above all, possible combos. The rhythm of the fights is the classic one of many deck-building games (such as Slay the Spire, Roguebook): we act first, we choose which pages to play in a certain order and we see in advance the action that will be performed by the enemies, so as to prepare ourselves for their attacks. The problem, as stated, lies in the pace of progress. The first hours of the game are extremely basic as we have very few pages and few effects, so the clashes are simply an attacco+defense, which does not require any kind of reasoning. It takes at least five or six hours before you can start getting some interesting pages, and as soon as that happens, you discover the second big problem with Black Book's combat system: the total lack of balance. In fact, Black Book puts pages in our hands that, by themselves, might seem uninteresting, but its structure allows us to create unique combinations. Without going into too much detail, know that from the second half you can create a deck that allows us to have the same pages in hand at every single turn: with these, it is possible at the same time to reset the enemy attack and inflict in a single blow damage equal to three times or more the opponent's life. Furthermore, we are not talking only about normal enemies, but also about bosses: we have lost count of the number of bosses we have annihilated in the first round, with a single attack (including the final battle, very anticlimactic). Dialogues are the order of the day in Black Book The whole combat system collapses, therefore, making getting new pages almost useless. We say almost because there are rare boss-fights that have special effects that forced us to change our combination of pages, due to particular resistances. In such situations we created decks almost as powerful, always winning easily, but at least we had fun imagining solutions to a problem, almost as if the match were a puzzle. These situations demonstrated that, with a little more focus and balance, Black Book could have been a much more interesting and satisfying game. In its current form, unfortunately, much of what it offers is repetitive and too simple. To be honest, we specify that we played at a normal level (the one suggested by the game), but we are sure that even at maximum difficulty nothing would have changed, given the overwhelming power of the protagonist. The duties of a witch Some environments can be evocative The gameplay is not based, in any case, only on the combat system. There are little extras, like the aforementioned Durak and chort system. These are demons at our service, which we will get as we progress through the game. The chorts are evil by nature and want to have someone to torment: we will therefore have to send them on a mission, choosing one of the available events from a dedicated map. Each event has a duration in terms of game days, a cash reward (useful for buying healing herbs and equippable items) and above all Sins. These can also be obtained through some of our actions (cursing a villager, stealing, not helping those tormented by demons...). The Sins are an independent ~currency~ which, according to the indications of the game, will have an impact on the progress and especially on the final events. Chorts returning from a mission, as mentioned, increase our Sins. To prevent this from happening, we should keep the chorts with us, however suffering rather serious penalties, such as the inability to use certain card bonuses or having less life and less attack and defense capabilities. The player should therefore be encouraged to put himself in difficulty in order not to commit a sin. The problem is that it is not clear how bad it is to get Sin, so most players will prefer to avoid creating problems and will always send all the chorts on missions. In addition, a skill can be obtained very quickly (Vasilisia levels up through experience gained from battles and can acquire skills from various trees) which allows the number of Sins obtained to be transformed into a negative value. In other words, sending chorts on missions decreases our Sin value, completely negating the problem. Once again, Black Book shoots itself in the foot by making something that should have been complex too simple. The solution would have been to force us to always have at least one or two chorts with us, thus choosing which malus to take with us and which to cancel. On a technical level there are limits, but overall Black Book is pleasant Finally, we close with a comment on the graphic and sound creation. On a technical level, Black Book is very limited, with low-poly scenarios and characters (very low, little poly). This is not a great limitation in our opinion, as in the more particular sections the development team was able to create intriguing and evocative scenarios on a visual level even with the little they had available. The problem, as already mentioned, is the repetitiveness: the work easily lasts 20 hours, if you explore each secondary event, but after just a few hours you find yourself in front of the usual generic backdrops. We congratulate youce for the sound side: the soundtrack is nice and we regularly unlock beautiful Russian folk songs; moreover, the English dub maintains the Russian accent and helps to get into the game atmosphere without having to rely on the incomprehensible Russian dub which, at least for our ears, causes some fatigue (every single line of text is dubbed, Black Book ~talks~ to us continuously and for a very long time). Final note, the game is not translated into Italian: as mentioned, it is verbose and long, so some players may find it difficult to follow the entire story if they are not accustomed to the Albion language.", "date": "2021-08-05", "grade": "6.5"}
