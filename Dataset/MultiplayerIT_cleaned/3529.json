{"name": "Dead Cells", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-cells-la-recensione-su-ios.html", "text": "Released just last August after a period of Early Access, Dead Cells immediately revealed itself as one of the best independent titles of recent years, managing to combine metroidvania and roguelike elements in an extremely convincing mix, also supported by a pixel art graphic component bright and full of character. The work of the French of Motion Twin has reached, in addition to the PC, also all current consoles or PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch; now, thanks to the collaboration with the compatriots of Playdigious, Dead Cells also lands on mobile platforms, first with iOS and later with Android. A considerable challenge, considering that anyone who has played even a couple of games with the original will have understood very soon how the precision and responsiveness of the controls play a fundamental role within a very demanding and often punishing gameplay. So let's find out in our review what the result was, instead referring you to last year's article for all the details on the game itself. Controls via touch screen Despite these legitimate doubts, it is necessary to start by saying that Playdigious has a long experience not only with regards to the publication on mobile platforms, but also with regard to the conversion of titles born on other platforms, such as for example Teslagrad, Evoland 2 or Cultist simulator. Certainly however skilled, the French are not yet able to work miracles, which is why they have chosen to approach the touch interface through different solutions, starting however in each case from the adoption of virtual keys. The stick is then placed on the left of the screen, which can be chosen between fixed or floating. On the right, however, the keys have been placed to replicate the attack actions with the 4 slots for the respective weapons, the jump, the dodge and the one for interacting with the various objects. Above them there is then the map, while on the opposite side, always at the top, the buttons for healing and using secondary skills. A lot of stuff then, and it is clear that although it is possible to change both the arrangement and the size of all the inputs, one can find oneself in embarrassing situations, especially during the very first games. Let me be clear, Dead Cells can still be played decently even on a touch screen, but in the more advanced and complex stages it is more than evident that the limits are impossible to overcome completely. However, it must be said that in the options there are a couple of alternative solutions that are worth trying: in fact, alongside the original mode, which reproduces the one studied by Motion Twin in a perfectly faithful way, you can find an alternative called Automatic Attack which, as can be guessed, it autonomously manages the attack with the melee weapon when you are at the correct distance from the enemies. Although it may seem blasphemous to purists, in reality lightening the touch controls by at least a ~commitment~ makes progression less frustrating, to the point that this mode could soon become the favorite of many playing in this situation. Much less appreciable is the ability to activate dodging by swiping on the screen, which simply proves to be too unreliable to be seriously considered. Graphics and content It goes without saying that all these talks about the limits of the touch interface immediately lose meaning in cases where an MFi controller is available: in our case the always excellent Steelseries Nimbus allowed us to fully appreciate the original experience without compromise , being able to enjoy it on the move in the same way as is feasible on Switch. It is also worth emphasizing again how the release of iOS 13, now imminent, is destined to bring with it native support for PS4 and Xbox One controllers, making gaming on Apple platforms even more interesting. Obviously similar speech also on Android, which will see the arrival of Dead Cells in the coming months. From a technical point of view, our experience on the iPhone Xr and iPad Pro left no room for criticism: predictable, also given the affinity between the Nintendo Switch hardware and that of modern smartphones. Yet it remains a pleasure to observe the splendid work of French artists on the screens of smartphones and tablets, who have been able to recreate a decadent and gloomy world while not skimping on the use of a wide color palette. The good variety of settings and the excellent level of detail then manage to make even the inevitable need to retrace the same places dozens and dozens of times after each death pleasant. Only the fact that the ~lock at 30 fps~ option is activated by default is questionable: whoever has a sufficient devicementally powerful, it is advisable to deactivate it immediately to appreciate the greater fluidity of the action. Finally, it is worth emphasizing how the sale price is set in this edition at  9.99, which is largely the lowest currently available on all platforms. And of course it's the full version of all the content found elsewhere, with no ads or extra purchases. An additional element that could suggest the purchase of Dead Cells right on the App Store or, soon, Google Play, for those who have not yet had the opportunity to appreciate its enormous qualities.", "date": "2019-08-28", "grade": "9.2"}
