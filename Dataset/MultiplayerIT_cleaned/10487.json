{"name": "G-Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70935-g-force-porcellini-alla-riscossa.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 The first thing you have the curiosity to try by picking up G-Force is the 3D viewing mode. Just like the movie in the cinema, but with a much older technology, even the video game can be experienced in three dimensions, a feature that makes it quite unique in the panorama of electronic games. However, if at the beginning you can't wait to put on your glasses, after a few minutes you can't wait to take them off. There is little to go around it, the effect obtained from the red and blue lenses is annoying for the eyes, and after about twenty minutes it will be inevitable to take a break. Moreover, the result obtained does not justify the effort of the eye. It is true that the difference immediately catches the eye (the pun was not intended), but the involvement and sense of wonder remain the same as always, so, after the first dutiful try-on, it is easy for the glasses to stored in the game case. We close this parenthesis on the third dimension by specifying that the versions for Wii and PlayStation 2, although identical to the others for the rest of the contents, do not have the 3D option. Not a great loss, as we have seen. Ok Roger, over and out! G-Force is an adventure that sees you in command of Darwin, one of the guinea pigs who forms the Task Force set up by the government to put an end to the plans for world conquest operated by a mad billionaire, who will apparently use banal household appliances to achieve its purpose. Just like in a spy story with all things right, we will be perfectly equipped and continuously supported by our team, both from headquarters and on the pitch. In the headset we will receive from time to time information on the status of the mission and the objectives to be achieved, one after the other until the end of the level. If something is unclear to us, pressing a key is enough to display a signal on the screen that will show us the direction to follow. A spy is such when no one knows of his presence, but during our adventure it will be inevitable to come out and engage in battles against the Saber appliances, common everyday objects until they sharpen their weapons against our poor agent. In our defense we have an electric whip for close attacks, and different types of firearms that can be unlocked as you progress through the game. Technology also helps us travel, however, thanks to the trusty jet-pack always on our shoulders, we will be able to fly for a few seconds and move undisturbed at safe heights. Furthermore, if the visibility should be too poor, just activate the x-ray viewer, to see more clearly! This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds... Darwin is an excellent agent for a guinea pig, but even he will have to raise his hands in the most tangled situations. It is on this occasion that the use of Mooch comes in handy, a miniaturization miracle in the shape of a fly, which can fly around the level by slipping into the smallest cracks, to neutralize the security systems and slow down time to overcome the most insidious obstacles. Mooch can be activated at any time and it will be up to the player to decide when to take his controls and when to continue with the protagonist. Although Mooch passes undisturbed by any human or electronic eye, it has the unfortunate tendency, like all flies after all, to approach lamps to attract insects. Jumping from one protagonist to another to solve the slightly more intricate passages are the best moments of a game that repeats itself for practically the entire adventure. The level of difficulty stands at medium-low levels, but it is still possible to raise it from the options for those who want a harder challenge. Although one of the weakest points of the game is the relative simplicity and repetitiveness of the situations offered, G-Force is more suitable for kids who already have some experience with video games. In fact, a good coordination skill and the study of the game environment are required in order to advance in the adventure, things that could discourage or annoy those who are not used to a more advanced game system compared to other titles dedicated to children . If for the younger ones, therefore, G-Force could be a game out of their reach, it becomes a pleasant stimulus for those who already have a few months of game practice behind them. Furthermore, for these people G-Force is an excellent link between games for the little ones and those for a more loyal audience.
