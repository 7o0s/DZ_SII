There is always the possibility that you have ended up there by chance, or that you are those readers who must necessarily communicate to the whole world how much they hate pokmon in the comments to the article, but it is more logical to think that you are here because you are interested in Nintendo monsters, because remember the first Pokmon Mystery Dungeons with nostalgia or because you have never heard of these spin-offs and you feel a little confused. Don't worry: in the past few weeks, we've told you about developer Spike Chunsoft and mystery dungeons set in the Pokmon universe, so we recommend you read our insights to learn more about the subject. If, on the other hand, you fall into the other categories, go ahead, because in the next few lines we will explain why we liked this remake so much. The human who became pokmon Anyone who played Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Red Team or Blue Team many years ago will undoubtedly recognize the very first minutes of the adventure and the small questionnaire that, based on our answers, will determine our personality and the most suitable pokmon for us, choosing it among the initial sixteen. It's a decision that the game doesn't really impose on us, and in fact we can refuse the assigned pokmon and choose one on our own, in defiance of RPG laws. In any case, the adventure begins with our mysterious transformation into pokmon: we will awaken in the world of little monsters, with no memory and unaware of the reasons that forced us into these uncomfortable features. The pokmon that we have chosen as a helper just before will find us and convince us to put together a rescue team to help all the pokmon in difficulty, especially now that natural disasters occur left and right without anyone understanding why. The choice of the pokmon protagonists does not change the texts and dialogues in an important way, also because the story of Rescue Team DX faithfully follows the original script, while enriching it with some new dialogue or interlude sequence. And the story that the original title told in 2005, and that this remake repeats to us fifteen years later, is really a beautiful fairy tale. Engaging and in certain moments even touching - and whoever completed the original knows it well - it deviates a lot from the canons to which the Pokmon mothership titles may have accustomed you: here all the pokmon speak and communicate as if they were authentic people. Each of them has a defined personality, often shaped around the species they represent and the descriptions that Game Freak has pinned in the PokDex over the years. The writing, in excellent Italian, is simple but not childish, flowing but not at all superficial, and at times it is difficult to believe that the story takes place in the world of pokmon. It must be said that the Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX campaign is not very long and is completed in about fifteen hours of play, but continues with a very generous amount of dungeons and additional content that the remake contextualizes better even at a narrative level : to defeat each boss and complete each dungeon it takes many more hours, not to mention that here too you will have to... catch them all. In dungeons: campaign, difficulty, graphics Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX combines Red Team and Blue Team into one version, although the differences between the two were minimal. Blue Squad was simply the Nintendo DS version, visually more defined than the Game Boy Advance Red Squad and with the map on the second screen of the handheld. In terms of content, however, only a few pokmon changed, exclusive in one version or another: well, Rescue Team DX finally brings them together in a single adventure, also adding other monsters, mainly of the fourth generation, with their evolutions or Mega Evolutions. Most of these are organically integrated into the campaign flow, others only unlock after you see the end credits, but overall, Rescue Team DX is a pretty faithful remake. The first difference that catches the eye is the graphics, of course, which abandon the pixel art of 2005 - and the 3D of Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon for Nintendo 3DS - to embrace a beautiful cel shading in pastel shades. Although the animations are not always convincing, especially during the cutscenes, the aesthetic result is, in one word, beautiful: the world of Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX looks like the illustration of a storybook and the direction araesthetic, made of soft features and soft colors, creates a carefree and picturesque atmosphere that accompanies the player even in the darkest moments of the story together with a catchy and lively remixed soundtrack. It's an important balance that serves to lighten long play sessions in dungeons. Might as well make things clear right away: Pokmon Mystery Dungeon is a fairly repetitive RPG by its very nature. Your task will be to explore the procedural dungeons in search of an exit while trying to complete the tasks that the other pokmon have entrusted to you directly or indirectly: usually you will have to find a pokmon in difficulty, sometimes a lost accessory, but the structure of the game does not change. Preparations are important: each dungeon features different species of pokmon, so you'll have to choose three pokmon to start it with from those you've recruited to your team. Recruiting is the ~gonna catch'em all~ part of Pokmon Mystery Dungeon - in fact, it's almost entirely random. You will simply have to defeat hostile pokmon in dungeons and they will sometimes decide to join you. If you have unlocked a specific field in which to host them, you will be able to recruit them at the end of the dungeon and choose them in the next missions: in this way you will be able to take advantage of the relationships between the Types established in the mothership titles, but also their Specialties, random bonuses that can help you a lot. There are Specialties that make it easier to recruit pokmon, others that make moves in the corridors infallible and so on: one of the best parts of Rescue Team DX is precisely this collectible component that pushes the player to repeat the dungeons to recruit over four hundred pokmon , possibly with the Specialties that are right for you. Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX is indeed a fairly challenging game. The simplicity of the first dungeons and the presence of an unprecedented automatic mode risk deceiving you: the Spike Chunsoft title can be really difficult after just a few hours, especially if you underestimate the relationships between the Types and don't spend some time improve the team in dungeons or in Makuhita's Dojo. As we said, preparations are essential, because you will be able to take a limited number of consumables with you, without knowing which ones you might find in the dungeons. Often you will have to choose what to leave on the ground and what to keep in your bag, evaluating every opportunity and remembering that every step that the team leader takes in the dungeon consumes a tiredness value which will have to be restored by eating the appropriate Apples: once the fruit is finished, the leader will lose Health Points with every step until he passes out. And then, of course, there's the combat, which mixes turn-based and real-time. It is not very easy to explain them: in practice, every time you move or act as the leader of the team, all the pokmon that follow you and also the enemies on the map move or act simultaneously. Each move has a certain range and a limited number of uses just like in the classic RPGs of the series; despite this, you can also attack enemies in other ways, for example by throwing stones or shaking magical branches that inflict abnormal conditions. However, the positioning and choice of pokmon at the head of the team are fundamental and the game allows you to view a special grid in the more visually complex and colorful dungeons, where it becomes more complicated to calculate movements and positions when our team has up to eight pokmon busy fighting against one or more enemies. Despite these strategic aspects, and fun bosses that require greater attention in the choice of Types and consumables, Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX remains a title specifically focused on dungeon repetition and experience point grind. If it is true that the first dungeons can be overcome easily by looking for the exit or the goal on each floor, the more advanced dungeons are characterized by much more complex floor plans, very irritating invisible traps and sudden peaks of difficulty in the form of pokmon that they hit hard without leaving a chance. In these cases, the defeated player loses all the items in the bag and the money he had with him - which is why it is advisable to deposit them in the appropriate banks before each expedition! - to then return to the base with the tail between the legs. Alternatively, you can ask other players for help through the same asynchronous multiplayer feature seen in previous titles.", "date": "2020-03-04", "grade": "8.0"}
