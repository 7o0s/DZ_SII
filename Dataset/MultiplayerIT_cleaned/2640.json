{"name": "Rayman Revolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-revolution_a.html", "text": "A look at the technique After this dutiful clarification, I'm going to examine more properly technical aspects, such as graphics and sound, and here we are at high levels. The environments, extremely varied and with a well-kept and crazy design, are of incredible beauty. The graphics palette of the Ps2 is exploited to the bone: a myriad of colors invests the player and not infrequently one will be amazed not so much by the number of mapped polygons, but by the nuances and chromatic combination of them. In addition, the light effects are very accurate; consequently the general picture can only be positive. However, there is always a flaw around the corner. The previously described tunnel effect involves a series of imperfections, which fortunately only a very attentive eye can see: when you are too close to a wall, or to any backdrop that delimits the boundaries of the game, if this is full of details, we will see the definition of the textures go to hell. There will be a sensation of flattening the colors and subjects represented. I repeat, it is not a defect that irreparably undermines the use of the title, but after so much beauty and opulence, any little thing that is not up to par seems excessively out of tune. The polygonal models of the characters are delightful: in a game that makes cuteness and likeability its raison d'tre, never an adjective seems more spot-on. The filthiest pirate or the most bastard missile aimed at you will never put you in a position to jump in your chair. This is good as the look of the characters is very funny and deeply grotesque (seeing Rayman himself, a walking aubergine or the pirate with rails in his mouth), but it is also a bad thing as the empathy factor disappears instantly. The sound does its job more than well; although the music is not particularly inspired, it certainly has the advantage of not being boring after five minutes. Very funny is the dubbing of the characters. It doesn't matter if it's a trick to save on localization or a precise choice of direction, hearing two weirdos muttering something incomprehensible, but it's perfectly in tune with the register of the conversation and genuinely makes you laugh. Do I stop or continue? In two minutes I'll stop... or rather I'll continue... or rather I'll stop... Playability is the real question mark of the title. The strangest thing of all is that at the same time Rayman invites you to move forward to discover new locations, but at the same time as I said before, he locks you in a golden cage, but still a cage. Not that the game is boring and repetitive, but the challenge factor isn't very high, and seeing so many beautiful things on the screen to then only admire them from a distance is certainly not the best. For heaven's sake, the game offers a series of extremely varied actions to be performed, such as riding snakes and missiles, which go beyond the classic script of platform games, but the impression is that they are a bit ends in themselves, put there to vary something of an equal whole. A praise must be given to the control system, easy to manage and above all to the degree of simplicity of the Rayman-external world interaction, so that the title will never be frustrating and you will never be hit by the millimeter jump syndrome so dear to Tomb fans Raiders. This doesn't mean that you don't need to be precise, but just pay attention to where you put your feet and you're done. The Magic Wells are interesting: through these it will be possible to acquire new skills, such as radar and various shots, which add a pinch of strategy to a somewhat flat context. I found the sub-games very pleasant: it seems that lately if you want to have fun with forgotten genres such as horizontal scrolling shoot and run, the only way is to give it up with the emulators, or rely on the mini-games included in the actual titles. Rayman is perhaps the most striking example. Given the impossibility of confronting one's origins (a 2D platformer today?!?), the best thing is to cannibalize the past to re-propose it as a small souvenir of the good old days, and at the same time eliminate any possibility of comparison with the present. What else to add? Summing up, Rayman Revolution is certainly a pleasant, flowing, decidedly fascinating game, but it certainly won't be remembered for long, nor taken as a touchstone for future products. Graphically it is beautiful, the characters are cared for and animated to perfection, but going to tighten it does not differ fromto normal or from the mass of 3D platformers. Many will certainly like it, but those looking for a product with a certain charisma should go elsewhere. It is not the game of life, but a pleasant pastime, between a game of Super Mario and one of Castlevania.. ...oh Rayman again We missed Rayman on a new platform, so Ubisoft promptly accommodated us. For those who have lived on Mars in recent years, we must add that the Rayman franchise has been one of the best sellers of recent years (we are talking about millions of copies), and strangely, alongside an exceptional economic response, it has never failed the quality. This is also the case for this new version which, however, after an absolutely uncompromising first impact, shows some defects that partially invalidate an overall positive judgment. The title of the almighty Ubi does not differ much from the scheme inaugurated by Super Mario 64: behind a fake 3D view there is a strictly 2D setting. What happened in the never too little acclaimed Pandemonium for Psone happens: the player runs, jumps, shoots, operates levers as if he were acting in a tunnel, which does not allow many other movements. Of course, the camera can show us the action from the most disparate angles, but the space available to us will always remain the same. So those who expected a complex world to explore are warned.", "date": "2001-01-25", "grade": null}
