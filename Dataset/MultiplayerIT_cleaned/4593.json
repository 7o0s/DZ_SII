We are still talking about the games that introduced the extraordinary mechanics of free running into the action adventure genre, and we define it as ~extraordinary~ because for a game designer, conceptualizing and applying a system capable of making vertical movement within everyone's reach is something comparable to a mystical vision. However, the current discontent of many of the fans of the brand derives from the solidity of that base: Assassin's Creed reached considerable heights with the Ezio trilogy, to resize as soon as the goal was set higher. After the third main chapter, the narrative was largely lost along the way, thus expanding the interesting starting background but at the same time putting the main plot in the background with chapters that seemed more like sops than real sequels; Unity, then, failed to represent the evolution that the saga needed, due to numerous structural problems and ideas implemented only halfway. Ubisoft's choice to change direction from the last two chapters, therefore, is very justified: Assassin's Creed Origins is a huge open world, entrusted to the directors of the excellent Black Flag and designed to offer an even more successful mix of exploration, combat and freedom of action than usual, all within a suggestive Egyptian setting in the era of Caesar and Cleopatra. Today, strengthened by a few days' test session in Paris, we will try to understand with you if the origin of the assassins really represents a new beginning for this iconic series. Born of the Nile Starting with evaluating a game's story and characters is common practice in a review, but in the case of Origins doing so is somewhat complicated. The motivation is not to be found in the narrative complexity of the title - actually built around a linear and far from incomprehensible basic plot - but in the many connections to the events of the previous chapters, which we do not want to reveal to you in any way so as not to spoil some interesting surprises. In fact, Origins is not a simple prequel focused on the origin of the creed of the assassins... it is an important piece of the puzzle that projects itself towards the future in unexpected ways, and manages to restart events that have been paralyzed for too long. In short, the adventure of the Medjay of Egypt Bayek and his wife Aya falls within the typical stylistic features of revenge stories, yet the Ubisoft Montreal screenwriters have managed to cleverly exploit everything and offer a significant range of options to anyone who needs to try your hand at the next chapters. Let me be clear, the qualities just described do not necessarily imply that the narrative of Origins is exceptional: overall we are faced with a plot built in a worthy way and with more than one interesting character, who, as usual, properly reworks the real historical events in function of its universe and has more moments of quality than falls of style. However, the attempt of the software house at the reins of the project to insert interesting figures and moments also in the secondary quests should be celebrated; an admirable choice obviously inspired by The Witcher 3, which despite not being 100% successful makes Bayek's raids in Egypt more exciting than expected. Curiously, CD Projekt's magnum opus shook not only the writers of Assassin's Creed Origins, and came to influence all developers at Ubisoft Montreal; however, believing that all the innovations related to gameplay derive exclusively from the desire to emulate the Polish team would be a serious mistake. Sand on the horizon Not that it is difficult to make a mistake after having wandered around in Bayek's shoes for a few hours: the closeness to Geralt's adventures is evident, and after an initial introductory phase with a rather bland rhythm, the first similarities immediately appear related to the combat system, to the exploration on horseback (the mount can be recalled at any time and is central when it comes to quickly reaching distant places) and even the quest system, complete with a recommended level for completing them. Where, however, the third The Witcher still remains a title with a marked role-playing component, equipped with multiple-choice dialogues and an impressive narrative background care, Assassin's Creed Origins instead pushes the accelerator on the action, with a renewed emphasis on battles and the evident desire to be a compendium of all the design gimmicks that have sprung up by the Ubisoft teams over the last decade. Perhaps it should be clarified: Origins maintains the typical flaw of all recent open worlds outside of Breath of the Wild, or a basic repetitiveness of the tasks related to limited interactivity of the game world and side missions that are all too similar between them. However, if CD Projekt had circumvented it with well-kept subplots, Ubisoft Montreal decided to do it by giving the player a sensible number of possibilities for approaching the clashes, within quests which basically almost always boil down to a ~go to place X and kill someone.~ These approaches derive directly from the mechanics seen in the entire library of titles of the French giant, with some elements taken from other well-known video games. Therefore, during almost every mission the Senu eagle is used, equipped with functions almost identical to the Watch_Dogs 2 drone and in turn able to mark enemies (or stun them); multiple kills are chained after an execution or havoc is created by releasing wild beasts from cages as happened in Far Cry 3; or you can simply decide to take advantage of stealth to silently eliminate all the soldiers in a camp, perhaps by placing traps in the alarm torches or by poisoning the corpses left on the ground. Nothing is real, everything is imperfect Of course, that's not all; we didn't haphazardly praise the mechanical variety of the Canadian team's work. Do you want to specialize in bows to the point where you can eliminate an entire field with rapid arrows or ~sniping~ from a distance? You can. Want to slow down time in flight like in the latest Zelda? The ability is present. Do you feel the need for variable sets of moves for each weapon and special attacks loaded with multiple effects? Little hand raised. Mounted combat? There is. Drugs that confuse enemies? smoke bombs? Trainable beasts accompanying you? All thrown into the same cauldron, for a system that now of the end is anything but trivial and manages to partially dampen the boredom of the leveling in the first acts. Just one problem: every single factor in this huge equation is flawed. In other words, Origins is a game where finesse is not exactly at home, which entertains and offers a huge buffet full of first fruits thanks to its systems, but it never reaches excellence. For example, the fights suffer from a rather painful artificial intelligence of the enemies, aggressive yes, but never smart enough not to be tricked with various tricks. This stupidity of the opponents also badly affects stealth, where we often see the phenomenon of the ~little train~ and it's really easy to disappear and come back when things have calmed down, despite the fact that the guards tend to move quickly and carelessly after having discovered you ( movement patterns are close to those of the latest Splinter Cell and the aforementioned Watch_Dogs 2). It's a real shame, because overall the game works and with a few more polishes it could have reached very impressive levels of quality. On the other hand, the developers have put a lot of effort into shuffling the cards on the table, inserting between the main story and the secondary missions optional bosses, gladatorial battles, and ~special~ clashes that manage to enhance Bayek's offensive capabilities. However, it is also difficult for us to understand why there have been some steps backwards linked to systems already functionally included in the series: stealth no longer has the covers and the clear field of vision seen in Unity and Syndicate (even if the simplification, it must be said , didn't entirely hurt him) in favor of a return to bushes and assaults from above; the investigative moments, on the other hand, now only require activating Bayek's sixth sense in search of clues in the vicinity, without multiple solutions or valid puzzles. In practice, one gets the impression that some ingredients of the formula have regressed more than they should, and the team did not have the time - or the skills - to do what they really wanted to the end. A warm desert Although the push for intuitiveness at any cost has influenced all of Ubisoft Montreal's work, there is no lack of very refined elements in this Egyptian blender. The chariot race, for example, is a secondary activity that goes well with the fights in the arena, and worthily breaks the rhythm between one quest and another; moreover, the care placed in the aforementioned free running is once again masterful, and Bayek moves with incredible agility in the complex mapseg of the game. For heaven's sake, there are some hiccups and you'll get stuck from time to time, but the work done on the protagonist's mobility remains exceptional: whether you're in a mountainous area or in a magnificent city of ancient Egypt, it makes no difference , the feeling of fluidity and naturalness is always the same. Among the elements worthy of praise, it is undoubtedly the case to also include the extras related to exploration, because Assassin's Creed Origins is full of secrets, and between sumptuous pyramids, advanced quests and interesting clues to discover, it will not be easy to complete it 100%. A richer job could undoubtedly have been done on the tombs of the pharaohs and on the secret locations - you will never find really challenging puzzles waiting for you - yet it is still very pleasant to discover hidden passages, tombs never revealed and buried treasures while wandering at random in the huge regions of the game, not to mention the charm of some gems in the desert that we will not describe here. In any case, the question of microtransactions remains to be revealed, a modern plague of triple A titles from which even the latest Assassin's Creed makes the mistake of not distancing itself. Let's make things clear right away: here too we are faced with a title that allows you to bypass the slow leveling from quest to quest if you spend real money, and offers in its online shop both additional special costumes and legendary weapons, extra materials and chests with random items that can make the player's life easier in combat. This mass of advantages is however as usual attached to the game with spit. Origins is clearly not designed with microtransactions in mind, and campaign progress isn't slower or more tedious than seen in a myriad of other open worlds due to these additions; even the difficulty derives almost exclusively from the level difference, since it takes two or three levels of detachment from an enemy to die with a couple of hits, and there is no legendary weapon that can change this situation (every day you can also search for a bazaar rover that offers rare weapons for completing quests, and powerful tools of death are certainly not lacking as you progress through the game). The greatness of Egypt Finally, it is difficult to criticize the technical sector, which stands out within the open world genre both for the graphic detail and for the majesty of the explorable map. Seriously, ignore some non-exciting NPC models during cutscenes: they are negligible to say the least in front of masterpieces like Alexandria, Memphis, or the whole area of Cyrenaica. In Assassin's Creed Origins we move within an Egypt that manages to perfectly blend the solemnity of some of the greatest wonders ever built by man and the needs of game designers. It's amazing how the Ubisoft Montreal artists have been able to give a map largely covered by sand a variety of environments that at times dwarf some of the best chapters of the series: no Egyptian city is the same as another, and between salt mines, verdant oases, brutal deserts, mountainous areas and majestic monuments, one really cannot complain. There's no shortage of bugs - Ubisoft is certainly not known for its impeccable testing - and sometimes they ridicule rather dramatic moments, but we must say that we have never come across really serious stuff outside of a completely blocked secondary quest (and in any case resettable at any moment) or some botched transition within the main missions. Even the sound is of great quality, with varied background music that travels between modern melodies and the well-known themes of the saga, and a very remarkable dubbing in the original language (the game is also worthily localized in Italian, but the random pronunciation variations are so almost comical). However, we have to open a separate chapter on performance: our Paris test allowed us to try the Xbox One X version of the game, installed on dev kits that ran everything in the splendor of 4K. Bayek's Adventure wasn't perfectly optimized for those kits though, and while holding steady for the vast majority of its runtime, it sobbed in a handful of scenes. We also tested Assassin's Creed Origins on the base PlayStation 4 and on Pro, and its fluidity gives us practical certainty of the validity of the Xbox One X version, but without the final console in our hands we cannot tell you if, once at 1080p, the game will run at 60 fps or less. From the test, the stable 30 fps at all resolutions seem to us a significantly more likely option. We can say one thing though", "date": "2017-10-26", "grade": "8.5"}
