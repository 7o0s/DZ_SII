At the time, with the expansions of the fourth chapter still in production and some experiments including the successful Revolution in the pipeline , it was not at all easy to trace the road for a journey that was more than five years long. What's more, it began in a period that was certainly not favorable to the PC market, squeezed as it was among the champions of a very lively console scene. History seems ready to repeat itself and Civilization VI, if as likely it will, will see the light with two new exponents of living room gaming ready to claim all the spotlights and make life a little more difficult for those dedicated to production exclusive or almost exclusive on Windows and Mac. Waiting for that future, over the course of these years we have seen the fifth episode of the Sid Meier saga mature, first enriched by downloadable contents of fluctuating success and then by two excellent expansions; the last one in stores in a handful of days. Brave New World is an important and successful step forward, which will delight many fans. Brave New World is an important and successful step forward, which will delight many fans To each their own Civilization Civilization V: Brave New World was considered by 2K Games and Firaxis a content of such quality and quantity as to justify the price of 29.90 euros. Already requested by Gods & Kings, which is not necessary for the installation, a reasonable amount therefore considering the scope of the package. As always, the first addition on display when a new game is launched is that of a certain number of unpublished civilizations, nine even at this juncture, which call into question different continents and historical periods of maximum splendor: Poland, Shoshone, Portugal, Indonesia, Morocco , Venice, Assyria, Brazil and Zulus. Some of these additions are returns requested by fans while others make the representation of the globe of civilizations more homogeneous and still others fit perfectly into certain innovations made to the gameplay. Venice and Portugal, for example, are historically linked to trade and navigation, both aspects of the gaming experience that are enhanced by the arrival of Brave New World. Assuming that something will always be missing and it will never be possible to satisfy everyone, whoever bought every piece of content released for Civilization V would end up with over forty civilizations at his command, a variety that should be enough to satisfy every appetite and which in any case did not prevent Firaxis to develop original and successful ideas. The Assyrians and their leader Ashurbanipal, to cite an interesting case, gain the right to ~steal~ a previously acquired technology from each city conquered on the battlefield, enjoying a contemporary scientific progress. However, the two scenarios are subtracted from the standard rules and categories: the first takes place during the American Civil War, putting the player in command of one of the two fronts fighting with the aim of conquering the opposing capital, while the second carries Civilization V in the race to colonize Africa during the nineteenth century. The latter in particular is well constructed because on the one hand it allows you to take on the role of the European conquerors, committed to discovering the secrets hidden within the African continent, on the other the local populations, determined to repel the invaders, and on the other yet another ~lateral~ empires to this clash of civilizations but intending to derive the greatest possible benefit from it, such as the Ottomans. Two scenarios with a few hours behind them, ultimately, which are well worth at least a minimum of attention. Unpublished routes As we already pointed out on the occasion of the test a few weeks ago, the purpose of Civilization V: Brave New World seems to be above all to expand the scope of the gameplay during the second half of the game, possibly creating more varied victory conditions. The first big news, however, involves the gaming experience as a whole, effectively revolutionizing trade and commercial exchanges as we knew them: now it is in fact possible to open routes by land and sea with other civilizations and with the city states, placing the basis for a network that can also increase its international prestige and influence. In fact, not only goods and money pass along the commercial routes but also one's own culture, which is fundamental for tourism, and the policies adopted are propagated. A change that triggers and enhances several others, playing on consolidated systems to say something new. The culture points now have outlets on three different figures, Artists, Writers and Musicians, whose works are to be exhibited in dedicated buildings, those same places that will attract the visitors needed to achieve the influence on other civilizations that leads to cultural victory. The figure of the archaeologist, on the other hand, plays with the map, working on the ruins left on the ground by previous civilizations to restore them to their maximum splendor and make them an attraction. Another nice idea that gives further depth and options to those who decide to go down this road. The unprecedented Aesthetics and Archeology policies fit into this same groove, reinforcing its scope, while the three ideologies Order, Freedom and Autocracy are unlocked once the modern era is reached and are another way for the user to choose whether to take advantage of economic bonuses, military and so on. However, every ideology, especially in open civilizations connected to others, risks becoming a reason for discontent and protests over time, therefore the potential advantage of this introduction is accompanied by unprecedented challenges. The same goes for another novelty, perhaps the one we appreciated most together with the trade routes, namely the addition of the World Congress: this body meets for the first time when all the nations are revealed, anticipating the United Nations , and allows you to make shared decisions on sanctions against specific civilizations, to organize common initiatives and in general to move the diplomatic scene of the map. In short, a turning point for the scene and the race for diplomatic victory, which during the hours of the game also highlighted a certain freshness in the responses of the artificial intelligence. Ultimately, having launched a game of Civilization V: Brave New World, you find yourself in the presence of a product that is certainly not revolutionized as a whole but with greater variety in terms of viable paths, as well as answers and initiatives taken by the opponents. As with Gods & Kings, it is perceived that a mix of original ideas and user feedback have guided the hand of Firaxis, increasingly at ease with the fifth chapter of the series.", "date": "2013-07-08", "grade": "8.4"}
