Unlike the Ubisoft title, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate, however, did not arise as an exclusive for PlayStation Vita but also enjoyed a version for Nintendo 3DS, clearly less sophisticated from a technical point of view but structurally identical. In both cases, the remastering operation commissioned by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and put into practice by Armature Studio responded to a clear need, namely that of bringing the experience of this interesting ~metroidvania~-style action platform to a even wider audience, made up of PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii U owners. The game is set some time after the events narrated in Arkham Origins and sees Batman meet Catwoman for the first time, busy stealing data for a mysterious client. The clever thief engages the Bat Man in a long chase that serves as a tutorial for the peculiar ~two and a half dimensions~ mechanics that characterize the title, but in the end she is captured and sent to Blackgate penitentiary. It so happens, however, that shortly thereafter a revolt breaks out in the mammoth prison that puts the various Jokers, Penguins and Black Masks to compete for control of the prison, each in command of a small army of henchmen. Batman decides to reach the island by swimming and to penetrate the walls of the penitentiary to end hostilities and save the inevitable hostages... perhaps even with the help of Catwoman. Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition is a valid action platformer, albeit with some flaws A new adventure As highlighted in the review of the PlayStation Vita version, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition draws heavily on the main series, developed first by Rocksteady and then by Warner Bros. Games Montreal, and therefore there are many recognizable elements that permeate the experience despite its ~simplified~ nature. The combat system is one of them, and despite the two-dimensional context it offers good ideas and valid ideas, an excellent performance of the blows and some of the maneuvers that the Bat Man used to perform even in the standard episodes of the franchise dedicated to him, such as the counterattack, dodging and aerial evasion from a lunge. Likewise, common enemies show up armed with clubs, knives or even machine guns, and in the latter case the best strategy to defeat them is that of silent elimination, perhaps resorting to the traditional ~detective mode~ to figure out where a opponent and in which direction he is facing. On the Sony portable console you had to touch the touch screen to access this feature, which often implied a break from the standard mechanics and the use of the index finger instead of the thumb to highlight devices or areas on the screen to pay more attention to. On PC and consoles this practice has become much more immediate and is activated by pressing a back button, with navigation assigned to the right analog stick. A rather evident improvement, to which we have tried to add another one, that is an improved management of the map. The problem with the game on PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS was in fact the presence of a two-dimensional map that had nothing to do with the complicated evolutions of the scenario. Well, the developers have decided to replace it with an isometric version which unfortunately, in the same way, fails to give us a precise idea of the position of the various places to reach and is quickly supplanted by a memorization of the locations. Of course, in the meantime, carrying out the necessary backtracking turns out to be a decidedly more tedious operation than it was legitimate to expect, also because there is no respawn of the enemies and we therefore often find ourselves returning to now desolate places; all for the approximately seven hours required to complete the campaign, which however offers a certain degree of replayability thanks to the three different endings, obtainable by choosing our last enemy. Under the magnifying glass It is clear that those who have tried Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate on Nintendo 3DS will notice substantial improvements in the transition to this Deluxe Edition, while the impact will be reduced for those who have seen it in action on PlayStation Vita. On PC, at 1080p, things don't start in the best way, given that the very pleasant comic-style static cutscenes, which introduce the plot and characterize the moments of conjunctionbetween one phase and another of the adventure, they appear evidently ~magnified~ and the effect is not very beautiful. The situation improves when we move on to the analysis of the textures that cover the surfaces of the scenarios, undoubtedly sharper (even if during the zoom we come across some giant pixels), while we cannot complain about the frame rate, which on the configuration of test remained nailed to 60 frames per second without ever a hesitation and with v-sync activated. Too bad for the lack of advanced options for video adjustments, since you can barely change the resolution and little else, where instead we appreciated the exclusive extra skins for the protagonist, each of which is accompanied by different passive skills. Finally, it is possible to play using the mouse and keyboard, but it is a choice that we tend to advise against, opting instead for the traditional Xbox 360 controller, which is perfectly supported.", "date": "2014-04-07", "grade": "7.3"}
