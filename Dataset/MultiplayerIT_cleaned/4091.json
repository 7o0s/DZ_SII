{"name": "Dragon Quest XI", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-quest-xi-recensione.html", "text": "Dragon Quest XI had a complicated gestation. The Enix-branded series, born on the Famicom in 1986, has been re-released several times in recent years, especially on Nintendo portable platforms. Just last year, for example, Nintendo 3DS hosted the re-release of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, the title that effectively relaunched the franchise in the West as well when it debuted - moreover without numbering - back in 2005 on PlayStation 2. This means that thirteen years have passed since then, and in the meantime it is not that Enix, which later became Square Enix, has been idle: the Japanese developer has experimented with new paths at a time when the genre of Japanese RPGs, which Dragon Quest mostly represented in Japan, seemed stagnant. Dragon Quest IX and Dragon Quest X have embarked on the path of MMORPGs with mixed results: the second, playable only online, has never even arrived in the West. Which brings us directly to Dragon Quest XI, a midway reversal that brings Yuji Horii's series back to the tradition lane, while projecting it into a more modern and savvy landscape. The game arrives on our shelves a year after the Japanese release and we also lack the overview, because Square Enix has developed it in tandem with a peculiar version for Nintendo 3DS that will not be marketed in our country. The localization took longer than expected also because Square Enix has decided to make some important changes to the structure of the game with the precise aim of making it more attractive to the western market. Given these premises, it would have been reasonable to expect a disaster, a title without a precise identity, trapped in a kind of limbo between East and West, past and present. And instead Dragon Quest XI is, quite simply, the best chapter of the series. The Story: The Odyssey of the Cursed Boy Dragon Quest has never been particularly famous for the stories it tells, more like fairy tales than complicated narrative plots, but Yuji Horii has used the capabilities of new hardware to adapt to more modern standards without betraying the fairytale and parodic spirit that distinguishes always the series. Thanks to the more dynamic shots in the kinematics, the excellent Italian adaptation of the dialogues and the implementation of the English-language dubbing, absent in the original Japanese version, Dragon Quest XI reserves a rhythm that the series, until now, had always dreamed of. . He is a tightrope walker, this Dragon Quest, who deftly swings from drama to comedy with unprecedented naturalness. In the prologue, a woman saves her swaddling child by paying dearly for her courage, but the infant, found and adopted a bit like Moses, grows up and becomes our nameless protagonist. Upon reaching the age of majority, the young man discovers that he is the reincarnation of the Lucente, a legendary hero who manifests himself every time the Dark Lord threatens to invade the world. The problem is that some consider the Bright One a threat and a bringer of doom, which forces ours to flee. Alone and without a guide, the hero will have to rely on a colorful band of adventurers who will join him for the most disparate reasons: a good-hearted thief, two powerful twin sorceresses, a mysterious jester, a wise old man and a clever warrior. The cast is extraordinary. The script annexes the new characters to the Lucente group with a certain organicity, giving the player time to practice their fighting styles and their repertoire of magic, but it is always possible to reshape the party even in battle, replacing the heroes in front row with reserves. One could criticize Akira Toriyama's not exactly very inspired character design, but it has a certain sobriety that makes the protagonists much more captivating, also because Dragon Quest XI does not forget their existence, but rather explores the background, revealing secrets, explaining the their motivations and involving the player in a long journey full of surprises. The world of Dragon Quest XI is a mosaic of different cultures. Each city is inspired by some country of our world and one of them, Gondolia, is enormously reminiscent of Venice, where the inhabitants speak in a dialect that mixes English and Italian with hilarious results. In this regard, we would like to emphasize that it is not possible to change the audio track of the dubbing: it is important to understand that the game was dubbed only in the western edition, therefore it is not possible to set the Japanese audio. And unfortunately it is not even possible to choose the format of the soundtrack that the compositor of all time, Koichi Sugiyama, holds you hostage to sell CDs and concerts in orchestral version: in the game, the new songs and the more traditional ones are simple midi that you get used to in the long run but, despite this, you can't do without to think that the soundtrack could have given much more. It is in fact the weakest element of the package, because on the technical front Dragon Quest XI is a real show thanks also and above all to the cleanliness of the image, the choice of colors and the three-dimensional modeling of characters, scenarios and creatures. Playstation 4 trophies Fifty bronze trophies, seven silver and one gold: to unlock the platinum trophy you don't have to work too hard since many are obtained simply by following the story, but others require more effort, especially if you want to discover every secret. The game between tradition and innovation In reality, there isn't much to say about the structure of Dragon Quest XI that hasn't already been said, for example, in the review of Dragon Quest VIII: Square Enix has faithfully followed the classic structure of the series, without looking for strange solutions such as fragments of Dragon Quest VII or the pseudo MMORPG component of Dragon Quest IX. The player controls the protagonist and explores the locations into which the world of Erdrea is divided: Dragon Quest XI is not an open world title, even if the vastness of the scenarios would suggest otherwise, and the locations are separated by more or less short loads. Fortunately, you move quickly: the protagonist learns the teleportation spell within a few hours and, in this version for the West, you can hold down a key to run at breakneck speed, even if the most savvy players can resort to mounts. Horses are the most common and users can recall them by ringing the appropriate bells, but some enemies, once defeated, become mounts in turn and give the player additional abilities such as the ability to fly over water and jump higher, reaching thus previously inaccessible platforms and ravines. Perhaps there is a lack of more elaborate exploration, perhaps a few more puzzles in the dungeons, but Dragon Quest XI is actually a fairly easy title, at least until you come across some bosses or some really tough enemies. In those cases, the game encourages clever use of the spells and techniques in the various characters' arsenal, especially abilities that can buff the party or weaken enemies, as well as the appropriate weapons and attacks. The player has some control over the growth of heroes. Each of them is linked to a sort of chessboard that allows you to consume the Skill Points earned at level ups to progress in different directions that represent the various skills: each new box unlocked allows you to access the surrounding ones in a kind of chain that requires a minimal planning. However, it is possible to reset the points spent at any time, even if you give up a small amount of money. This too is an advantage that takes Dragon Quest XI away from the more frustrating aspects of the past. In fact, veterans of the series will remember the need to ~grind~ some levels to face the more complicated missions with greater serenity. In this regard, it is worth remembering that it is possible to check a series of items, at the beginning of a new game, which allow you to customize the difficulty of the experience, for example by removing the possibility of escaping from clashes or buying new items at the merchants. In Dragon Quest XI there is no real Game Over, given that the defeat of the party sends us directly back to the last save with the wallet halved. Despite this, Square Enix has implemented a novelty that significantly lightens the ~grind~ sessions and that is the camp. It is a safe area, located on each map, where players can completely regenerate health and mana for free, but also chat with the group to discover new details about the story and save the game at the statue that takes the place of the traditional churches. At the camp it is also possible to use the celestial forge, a crafting system very similar to the one already implemented in Dragon Quest VIII and Dragon Quest IX. Once you have learned an alchemical formula - often hidden in books scattered around the world - you can create the corresponding object through a nice mini-game: by completing the process with a minimum of attention, you can get your hands on extremely effective weapons and protections. The search for the rarest materials and hidden formulas pushes the player to exploreevery corner of the world, which is anything but frustrating or boring as enemies pop up on screen and get around with ease. It is also possible to attack them preemptively to start the fight with a small advantage: at that point, the game loads the party members into the canonical row that opposes the enemies. Combat takes place in turns, ordered according to the agility levels of the characters and monsters. Perhaps we would have liked an indicator that suggested the order of actions, but at that point Dragon Quest XI would have become much too easy. The Square Enix title, in fact, does not offer particularly complicated mechanics. In this sense, the possibility of choosing an alternative control system, which allows you to orient the camera at will and to move the characters on the battlefield, raises some perplexities, since it has no practical effect on the battle: it probably serves to allow the players greater freedom in the arrangement of the characters should they decide to share a photo or video of the battle. But maybe Square Enix had originally planned to implement a strategic disposition system, only to backtrack, who knows. The fact is that the combat system in Dragon Quest XI is simple and intuitive, truly suitable for everyone. You don't need great tactical minds and the enemies are so funny and well-animated that every battle is delightful. However, there is no shortage of novelties, specifically represented by perky powers. When characters take a certain amount of damage, they temporarily become stronger and unlock a variety of cinematic special attacks that they can perform alongside their companions. The perky state lasts for several turns and doesn't necessarily expire at the end of a fight, so players can manipulate this power-up in some way to face the toughest bosses and enemies, not to mention that there are numerous side quests that require you to defeat a certain opponent with a specific perky power. In fact, some inhabitants of Eldrich will entrust us with small optional tasks to be completed at any time to obtain objects and formulas as a reward. Dragon Quest XI is an extremely long-lived title, in this sense. The main ~campaign~ alone, so to speak, lasts between forty and fifty hours, to which we must add a large post-game which, in reality, is not all that optional: it picks up the threads left hanging and continues the story , leading to an alternate ending that comes full circle. It is an intelligent and different solution that recycles assets in a sensible way, exploiting a narrative trick that we cannot anticipate. However, we can tell you that if you love completing games that belong to this genre 100%, Dragon Quest XI may be able to amaze you.", "date": "2018-08-28", "grade": "9.0"}
