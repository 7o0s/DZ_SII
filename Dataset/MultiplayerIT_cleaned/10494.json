Secret War + Civil War Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 is inspired by two of the most beautiful and famous sagas about beloved superheroes, Secret War and Civil War, after which the Marvel universe has never been the same, divided into factions as we find in the game. The new title opens with Nick Fury, head of SHIELD, together with Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man and Iron Man on a mission to Latveria to capture the new Prime Minister, but this action triggers the reaction of the hostiles who attack New York creating many civilian casualties. Superheroes are held responsible for what happened and a plan never proposed before is implemented, the registration or rather the filing of all beings with powers. This causes a big split in the universe of the game and the player must decide whether to accept the bill and then get filed, for example Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic are in favor of this, or not like Captain America, Iron Fist and Luke Cage . Once the choice has been made, it is no longer possible to go back and therefore in the team of four that it is possible to command there are only fighters of one or the other faction. Beat Beat Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 is a scrolling fighting game in which the player has the task of leading a team of four superheroes and essentially clearing all the obstacles in their path. The 4 team obviously immediately leads to the question of whether it will be possible to play multiplayer both locally and via Xbox Live and the answer is obviously affirmative, in both cases it will be possible to play together with 4 friends at the same time. In the single player version the player can seamlessly switch from one super hero to another in a flash and can also choose to quickly switch team members. As mentioned, the choice of field that the player must make remains at the base of the game, this choice obviously has the main consequence of not being able to use all 24 heroes in the first campaign, in fact to use the other faction it is necessary to replay the adventure . The game is proposed with an isometric view that allows you to always keep the battle zone well framed, allowing the player to find all the items on his path and above all to destroy everything without any mercy. The control system performs very well, divided between heavy and light attacks, jumping and grappling, but it is clear that the maximum is reached when these attacks are combined with the pressure of the back buttons that give access to super powers. The super abilities when you start the game are only two but, bringing death and destruction to each level, advancing in the adventure you unlock two more powers for a total of four devastating combinations. It is almost superfluous to remember that each hero has its own peculiarities and strengths, as obviously its own super moves. All these super hits ~weigh~ in terms of energy or rather stamina, and you immediately notice how this on-screen indicator empties easily. Over time the ~bar~ of the level gradually rises and it is possible to fully exploit the powers of the various Wolverines, Spider-Man and the others again. It is possible to manage the skill points in order to ensure that these super moves consume less stamina and above all that this is restored faster. These points can also be made available to make our character or the entire team less vulnerable. In addition to those skills there are also Power Points, as the name suggests these are used to increase the damage that the heroes are able to do to their opponents, but that's not all since advancing through the different schemes also increases the level of experience of our characters. The system that we have described to you is all connected and novice players may have problems managing the improvements of the team and of the individual heroes, it certainly does not help that the Activision title has not been localized at all, not only in the dialogues but not even in menus and subtitles. This is essentially the role-playing component of the Vicarious Vision game, a component that if it seems too much to you, you can have the artificial intelligence manage independently, worrying only about advancing in the levels. FU-SIO-NE To conclude with the analysis of the gameplay we can only underline a good news, the presence of the Fusion Power, it is in fact possible to take two team members and merge their respective powers for a period by performing deadly combos. This introduction makes the game more exciting and increases the desire to know the effects of the fusions between all the characters, The Thing and the Iceman? Iron Man and Wolverine? Seeing Tony Stark's beams reflected from Logan's blades gives complete satisfaction. This new possibility works at the beginning and the curiosity to see the effects of the fusions is very high, sure that with the passing of the hours played everything flattens out a lot, the effects are even too devastating and confusing and the unions between the heroes sometimes they look a little too alike. As far as the exploration of the areas is concerned, we must say that the map, which can be used via the menu, is used very little, essentially only to find hidden places or explore in search of new items, given that by pressing the right analog stick it is always possible make a handy direction indicator appear on the screen, an arrow that shows us the way. After the fiercest fights it is possible to find power-ups applicable to the whole team. These items can be used via the menu or by pressing the back key which opens a quick menu on the left of the screen. Usually these bonuses to be applied to the team modify both the offensive and defensive statistics of the team. Speaking of statistics, navigating the main menu for each member of the team, it is possible to know not only the use in terms of time but also all the data relating to strength, level and skill. So much data to waste hours. Xbox 360 goals The 1000 canonical points of the Xbox 360 version are divided into 25 rich objectives, you will have to finish the game at least 2 times to get them all as well as playing thoroughly online. It is necessary to complete the fusions with all 24 characters, complete at least 8 or 24 maps in co-op and above all upgrade the super heroes. Lights and Shadows From a technical point of view, the Activision game alternates light and shadow, for example the models of the super heroes are well cared for and detailed as are the explosions and light effects and the physics applied in substance in each game area. To be reviewed for sure many animations and interlude films that also allow a sort of interactivity in the dialogues but which are made in a too superficial way. During these dialogues it is possible to choose the type of answers based on three levels, aggressive, diplomatic or defensive. Using the right answers, or rather the style of the statements, you receive bonus teams that are very comfortable in continuing the adventure. The big problem, as we mentioned at the beginning of the article, is that in order to accurately choose the answers, it is necessary to know English well since Marvel: The Great Alliance 2 has not been translated neither as regards the dialogues, nor the subtitles and not even the menus. The game action is always very intense but also very confusing, it will often be difficult to distinguish between opponents and allies among the many explosions and special shots. The bosses that you meet from time to time never represent a very high difficulty and in essence the strategy will always be to attack without a moment's pause, without complicated reflections, as in every level of the adventure.", "date": "2009-10-05", "grade": "7.5"}
