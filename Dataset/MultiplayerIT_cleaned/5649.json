The idea of playing a sort of Secret of Mana set in medieval Japan, with a Diablo-style random loot system to boot, was enough to fuel some enthusiasm while waiting for the Nintendo 3DS to complete the short download of the software. Once we started playing, we realized almost immediately that something was wrong ... and of course we explain what aroused our perplexities in the following review. Part Diablo and part Secret of Mana, Sadame is a not too successful nostalgic tribute Leave Nobunaga alone! Set in the Sengoku era - between about 1400 and 1600, for the uninitiated - Sadame tells us an alternative version of the story in which the very famous and even somewhat infamous Oda Nobunaga is actually a demon who has practically conquered the Japan with its supernatural armies. The task of stopping the invasion and driving the evil daimyo and his lieutenants back to hell obviously falls to us, in the role of four different characters who will have to explore woods, mountains and ancient ruins, mowing down zombies, demons and various monsters to save the inhabitants terrified. The story, as you may have guessed, is not particularly original, also because many games have already been set in this context, starting with the various Dynasty Warriors so as not to disturb Onimusha and others. Each level opens and ends with a narrative break that tells us the story and offers a minimum of interaction between the characters, but if you expect deep characterizations and incredible twists from an RPG, Sadame is not the game for you . The four protagonists are indeed rather anonymous; their enemies are much more interesting, especially Nobunaga's generals, gigantic monsters who act as bosses at the end of the levels and are inspired by real historical figures such as Takeda Shingen or Yuusai Hosokawa. The bosses are actually the best part of Sadame both in terms of gameplay, as we will see later, and technically: huge, full of details and wonderfully animated, they tower over the player and force him to learn their patterns to understand when to attack and when retreat. Not that the rest of the game is technically subdued, mind you: the developer Mebius has instilled in Sadame the colorful spirit of the 16-bit era, drawing sprites of more than decent size and well animated that move in maps rich in details and sufficiently various to push the player to complete each level even if only for the curiosity to find out what will be next. It's a shame, then, that the game in and of itself betrays these expectations. The 3D effect Not received. There is no escaping fate Between past and present, Mebius has sought a meeting point between the action RPGs of the past and today's game dynamics, winking at the features and peculiarities of many other games in a package that, unfortunately, leaves enough to desire. In terms of replayability, it must be said that Sadame does his duty: the four heroes we will be able to choose from are very different and satisfy different styles of play. The samurai, of course, is the melee warrior par excellence, and is much tougher than the others; the monk is a ranged combatant who favors elemental spells; the ninja leans into mid range attacks with a good compendium of magic. The thief, who is more reminiscent of Final Fantasy's Job and who has very little to do with this historical setting, proved to be the strongest character of all, and also the most unbalanced: she excels at both long and short distances and can take advantage of various spells that make it a real war machine. Fortunately, Sadame allows you to share equipment with other characters through a kind of common deposit, and to use the other heroes as ~partners~ when switching protagonists. If so far it may seem that the Mebius title works very well, you begin to feel the full weight of its defects within a few minutes. The levels are extremely repetitive, but it is a precise structural choice: the progression is divided into ~screens~ and the next one can be explored only after having cleared the current one of all the enemies thrown at it. In this sense, Sadame takes the form of a scrolling fighting game rather than an RPG, also because the role-playing mechanics leave something to be desired. The characters increaselevel, they learn new spells and can equip different objects - in which it is also possible to embed gems to modify their attributes and bonuses - but most of the spells and ~combos~ are simply impractical and leave us at the mercy of enemies too aggressive. The difficulty peaks are in fact frequent and ruthless, assisted by a woody control system that does not foresee diagonal movements and attacks and which therefore often leaves us uncovered while we try to hit moving targets: in those cases, especially towards last levels of the game, a simple error of judgment is enough to be annihilated in a few blows by an angry horde of demons. Thank goodness, Sadame constantly records the player's progress and, even if he fails, the mission can be restarted with all the objects collected and the levels earned before dying: in that case, however, defeating enemies and bosses becomes a simple exercise of brute force , more than a strategic expression.", "date": "2016-03-14", "grade": "6.0"}
