Although the constituent elements of the game are those that have now become quite standard in this genre of games, the team has lowered the whole mechanism into a particular setting, succeeding in the arduous task of making the construction of production mechanisms and assembly lines; all also by inserting a background that has narrative ambitions, although this aspect obviously always remains in the background. The Sandships are huge self-moving machines on tracks, a sort of mobile and self-sufficient factories, capable of collecting raw materials, processing them and churning out materials and more or less processed products at the end of various production processes which all take place within the rooms inside the ~ship~. The Sandship protagonist of the story was once part of a glorious army of the advanced society Noranti One, but due to an accident she found herself stuck in hibernation mode for an incredibly long period of time. When the systems are reactivated, the surrounding world finds itself in ruins and the Sandship can do nothing but wander the immense desert that covers the planet's surface in search of ancient lost technologies and trying to help somehow rebuild civilization through the creation and transformation of resources and trade, while battling a mysterious cult bent on the destruction of the factory ship. In short, it could be defined as a fusion between Factorio and Dune, as regards the setting and atmosphere of the game, which manages to give a certain peculiar characterization to the whole, also thanks to a truly excellent technical realization. The graphics of the game are clean and equipped with a style that manages to make even a simple assembly line interesting and pleasant to see, with excellent animations and a ~mecha design~, so to speak, somewhat inspired. The Sand Factory Sandship: The Last Engineer is a micro-management game in the style of Factorio or Big Pharma, focused on the management of resources and the production of materials and objects, starting with the construction of an assembly line and all the various components needed to establish the production line necessary to achieve the required objectives. There are really many areas to pay attention to: the Sandship is a complex system and requires maintenance and continuous upgrades, as well as the production of objects and materials based on the contracts that can be established with the characters we meet around the map. There are different levels of operations to consider, with the ability to trade with items outside the ship and all tasks to be performed within the ship. In general, however, it is always a question of producing more or less processed materials or objects through internal factories, which can be more or less large and complex. The size of the production chain can be expanded through the enlargement of the available space, consequent to the advancement for the experience levels of the ship. A long skilltree allows you to concentrate research in various areas of production, thus unlocking the various machines that can be used for the construction of new resources. Basically, each of these tasks always requires a certain amount of different objects and we must constantly try to convert the internal production to meet the various requests. When one progresses in knowledge of the system and in the quantity of usable equipment, a different strategic approach to production takes over: instead of creating a new production chain each time, reconverting it each time for a single product, one finds oneself designing complex systems with the conveyor belt that passes from one instrumentation to another up to the various delivery points to allow a faster collection of different products at the same time. All this determines a constant increase in the challenge, which passes from the initial phases in which it is above all a question of discovering the new instruments and their different purposes, to the more advanced ones in which the difficulty is also given by the spatial organization of the structures the need to give a logical order to the progress of the production chain. The increase in the challenge rate is quite balanced and the game manages to integrate it graduallyand in its increasingly complex mechanics, even if the interface can be tricky with smaller screens, given the large amount of icons and the small size of these and of the written text. The main problem of the game obviously lies in its monetization system: being a free-to-play game based on a resource production system, this triggers a series of expectations that can become structural in the gameplay and become so almost immediately. Expectations are eliminated by spending gems, which are the in-game currency that can be purchased with real money: in the initial stages the problem does not emerge particularly clearly, but as you progress it becomes quite intrusive, forcing you to switch off or buy, because the conquest of gems via gameplay obviously it is always in deficit with respect to the request. There are also repeated cases of crashes or periodic impossibility to enter the game.", "date": "2020-06-15", "grade": "7.3"}
