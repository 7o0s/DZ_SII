The reason is obvious: it was a very, very expensive system. In addition to the $650 needed to buy it, in fact, each cartridge was sold at disproportionate prices (up to $300) based on the size of the chip. A luxury that few could afford, in short. It is perhaps for this reason that in recent years his toy library has been making a comeback in the form of ~classics~ for the various digital platforms, including the App Store and Google Play, so as to give everyone the opportunity to try them... without spending crazy sums. In the case of Blazing Star, we are dealing with a classic horizontal scrolling shooter, which on iOS and Android offers a couple of interesting alternative options to the story mode: the mission mode, to replay the completed levels in search of the high score, and two-player cooperative multiplayer via Bluetooth. It is also possible to customize the controls, but in a rather limited way: you can choose between ~invisible~ touch controls and a virtual d-pad, as well as move the A and B buttons, whose small size however creates some problems for due to the lack of autofire. Some see this feature almost as a sort of cheat, a trick that allows you to defeat enemies without too much effort, but in reality on mobile devices it is not a small requirement, because the automatic shot allows us to concentrate on the movement of the spacecraft and does not require a continuous solicitation of the touch screen, which can sometimes translate into a poorly received input precisely at a key moment in the action. Drag, drag... The seven levels that make up Blazing Star's single-player campaign are full of different enemies and big, bad bosses, characterized by a good design and a ~modular~ structure that must be destroyed piece by piece. It is interesting to note how the various parts of a boss are responsible for certain types of attack, so we can decide to focus on the most dangerous weapons, destroying them and then moving on to the rest. At our disposal we will have six spaceships, each piloted by a fairly stereotypical character (see the girls, all ~breasted~) and, above all, equipped with different weapons and movement speeds. Unfortunately, the performance of slower vehicles compared to touch controls seemed disastrous to us: you have to ~drag~ your finger continuously on the screen to move and avoid enemy fire, an operation that becomes really frustrating in the more advanced stages. Unlike the Cave shooters, in which there is a ~frame~ that allows you not to occupy the area with your fingers, here there are no such precautions or a response to commands worthy of expectations. If moving becomes difficult with the slower spaceships, in fact, it cannot be said that the situation is much better with the faster models, and the comparison with the episodes of Bug Princess in this situation is merciless. Which is a real shame, because the value of Blazing Star in terms of mechanics and structure is indisputable and, while not placing itself among the best titles of the genre on the App Store and Google Play, the shooter produced by SNK could certainly represent a interesting alternative.", "date": "2012-08-09", "grade": "7.0"}
