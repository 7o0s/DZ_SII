{"name": "Shopping Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shopping-madness_a.html", "text": "At first glance, Shopping Madness looks a lot like the Clash Machines reviewed on these pages a few months ago: while sharing the same origins, the two products are in reality only united by a fairly similar control system, while the underlying concepts they are completely different. Shopping Madness is in fact set within the five floors of the Zoy shopping centre, and puts the user in the role of a real shopping addict competing with other crazy people like him to win the highest number of items on sale. Armed with your trusty shopping trolley, therefore, you have to grab everything you can before the time runs out, without disdaining the collection of some useful bonuses for our ~noble~ cause: some allow, for example, to add a handful of seconds on the countdown, others temporarily increase the value of the objects on display, and so on. As is evident, Shopping Madness is based on very simple concepts, which are accompanied by an equally elementary control system: in fact, the game uses only the '4' and '6' keys to manage the rotation of the character, who moves forward constantly automatically. To be honest, this is the so-called Pro configuration, which can be selected from the options menu: by default, the title is set in a Basic mode which, despite the name, proves to be incredibly uncomfortable. Beyond this small misstep, the developers of Sumea have done a good job in trying to make Shopping Madness sufficiently varied: each floor of the mall offers in fact a main mode which is the one we described a few lines further up, and a second different section for each department you visit. You will therefore find yourself engaged in a sort of treasure hunt (trying to reach a particular object before the others), as well as in a sort of survival in which you have to keep possession of an item for as long as possible, and so on . A praise must therefore be given to Sumea for having squeezed the most out of the play structure of Shopping Madness, which in any case - given its very simple nature - ends up becoming repetitive after a while. As long as it lasts, however, the Digital Chocolate product is fun, graced by a very colorful and pleasant two-dimensional cartoon-style graphics.
