Ok, Homefront compared to Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield and company does not put any soldier in the shoes, but the offer of the new Kaos Studios effort seems to want to challenge the giants of the genre, those who succeed when they are bad anyway to sell a few million copies. Hence, the campaign for the single player is a short but exciting race calibrated to give everything before - statistics in hand - the average player gets tired, leaving the task of entertaining the multiplayer beyond entangling the user in a tangle of experience points , levels, skills and equipment. Until the release of some new content and the inevitable, already announced sequel. At first, approaching the game, the sense of predetermination can appear overwhelming but after having delved into each facet of the offer it is not wrong to say that Homefront is an imperfect but interesting starting point, with some blunders but also a lot of experience put to use service of some original ideas. The reckoning It has been talked about over and over again, the last one a few weeks ago through a trial of the three initial chapters of the campaign: in 2027 proposed by Homefront, the United States of America must bow to the invasion of the two Koreas, reunited by dictator Kim Jong-un. The developer worked closely with John Milius, author of Red Dawn among others, and some consultants such as Tae Kim, a former CIA agent, to recreate a credible context where the attack on the world's greatest power was justified by a fantasy political mosaic that spoke of crisis in Asia and the Middle East, economic balances and different realities that collide, finally creating a dramatic situation; remote but plausible. The player is asked to take the field after the occupation is already in an advanced state, when years of hatred and violence have created the right humus from which to give birth to a movement for the liberation of the country. In the role of a helicopter pilot initially in the hands of the Korean enemy and then freed by two rebels, Connor and Rianna, the user travels through seven levels which are also a guided tour through seven attractions, seven glimpses common to the US citizen now rendered unrecognizable: from a suburban suburb to the country village, from everyday environments such as schools and department stores to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, stripped of its function as a suspended passage over the Pacific Ocean and become a battlefield for surrender of the final accounts. However, all the energies invested in the premise are not exhausted in itself or in the choice of settings, having repercussions on the gameplay: several times, in fact, the action is interrupted to make room for long stretches played without firing a shot, moving between more or less scenes less raw which are a perfect way to justify the extreme effort required of the protagonists of the events, also humanizing the enemies and giving greater weight to the shootings which obviously remain the main focus of the experience. From a mechanical point of view, Homefront is quite traditional by offering long linear levels to be cleared using the weapons scattered around or collected from some corpse. The approach is the one chosen for other famous series, such as those mentioned in the introduction of this article, that is to impose a certain pace and press the player by giving him a limited number of possible choices both in terms of movement and attack techniques. A preponderant use of scripting which is in itself neither a bonus nor a malus, here exploited properly to create rather varied, albeit unoriginal, situations: there is, for example, a mission in which, shouldering a sniper rifle, one must move without alerting enemies, or urban warfare scenes, ambushes and other similar recurrences now standard for the genre. More original additions such as the use of a large semi-automatic drone, the Goliath, whose missiles can be aimed manually, while the sessions on board the vehicles, especially on a helicopter, are a short but interesting diversion. On balance, there are a couple of major flaws in terms of gameplay: the first is a spawn of enemies that is not always perfect and in a handful of occasions even visible, the second the annoying tendency to flush out the player with grenades at the moment same where you take cover a little too long and the position of the opponents does not foresee their approach; somewhat as seen in several Call of Duty. And then of course there's the thorny issue of longevity settling down tbetween four and five hours. Obviously going up to the highest of the four difficulty levels it will take more and more in an absolute sense, given that different passages will have to be repeated several times, but the duration of crossing the levels is that and the linear nature of the product does not suggest the use of a variety of different approaches. In short, a couple of more levels and a more incisive ending regarding the fate of the conflict would certainly not have hurt the experience as a whole. Recipe for a multiplayer Behind Kaos Studios, already working on Frontlines: Fuel of War, is the heart of the team that created the historic mod Desert Combat and that helped DICE complete Battlefield 2. In short, the pedigree speaks of an unbridled passion for the multiplayer component and also in Homefront this propensity is clear, to the point of making it the most successful and exciting sector of the entire product. In particular, it is interesting how the developer based in New York has taken some now essential elements, such as the growth in levels, the presence of perks and challenges to be completed to earn more experience points, and then mix them with completely new or revised ones in a new shape. The starting point is the choice to remove the classic kill streaks, with the accumulation of points that can be spent within the moment of one's death, in favor of a system that equally rewards kills, assists and the completion of objectives, but which one carries behind even after being shot down. Based on the gadgets chosen to customize each of the five classes present, the Battle Points earned are spent to have access to special weapons such as the missile launcher or one of the remotely controllable drones, land or air, useful for attacking or making a pitch reconnaissance. In a similar way, with each rebirth it is possible to return to the game on your own feet or, if you can afford it, by commanding one of the purchasable vehicles: humvees, light and heavy tanks, small helicopters or huge war Apaches. Among other things, their use requires the presence of at least one other seat in addition to that of the pilot, therefore they are also fundamental tools in the economy of team play. To complete this system, then, the Battle Commander takes care of it: a special artificial intelligence routine which, in the games in which it is decided to activate it, evaluates the work of each player by asking two or more members of a team to commit themselves to take down the most dangerous member of the opposing team. The latter in turn will have to try to maintain his positive streak, gradually gaining new buffs and upgrades. The resulting action is extremely dynamic, perfectly integrated with the two game modes: a team death match and then a reinterpretation of the classic Territories in which you conquer two or three objectives before moving on to the next ones, which in the meantime have activated on a new previously inaccessible part of the map. The six settings available, created to accommodate a maximum of 32 players, are not numerically very many today but their size, excellent design and the great variety of different situations they manage to suggest make them an excellent starting point that we hope can be expanded - possibly without excessive economic outlays - in the future. From an options point of view, choices such as maintaining the three postures - standing, crouching and lying down - are welcome, as are the presence of dedicated servers on all three platforms. Unfortunately we have not been able to find some references to the possibility of deactivating the kill cam, which some will not like very much, just as we would have liked a mode without Battle Points and rebirth. Going into the specifics of the PC version tested for this review, for once the conversion, by those same Digital Extremes currently also working on The Darkness 2, was the subject of great attention. In fact, within a couple of weeks of its release, the executable to mount your own private servers will be released and other interesting options have been foreseen for the competitive environment, such as the possibility of recording games, creating custom rotations and having a console from which to access the commands for managing the team and spectators. Furthermore, on PC, the vehicles have a second view from the inside, complete with a cockpit made for each vehicle and for each position held within it, significantly increasing realism and involvement. In particular, the helicopters were at the center of a finishing work that also affected playability, with threedifferent levels of realism selectable to decide how to affect their control. Finally, voice communication is supported via VOIP while textual communication via chat, global or team, and via an indication system that allows you to give simple commands selected through a radial menu. Unfortunately it seems that for the moment the release of tools to support the modders community is not foreseen, hoping that a possible success will change THQ's mind. Subversive landscapes The visual component of the game has been designed to complement the narrative perfectly. The Unreal Engine 3 has undergone a major conversion work both in terms of image rendering and interface, to the point of seeming a completely different engine and avoiding a certain repetitiveness in the look suffered by many titles that use it. The environments are full of details, finished with care although perhaps not incredible in terms of polygonal count. The America occupied by the Korean enemy is a strong place of suggestive glimpses that play on the contrasts offered by the structures reconverted in their new functions wanted by Kim Jong-un's regime: football fields become tent cities or mass graves, quiet residential neighborhoods are torn apart by explosions and forever upset by the raging battle, and the fields and farms that once made the enormous spaces of the country yield, are now at the mercy of the invading enemy, on one side, and of the little common sense shown by a slice of the citizenry increasingly out of control, on the other. The weapons are not in industrial quantities but are reproduced with care and the same goes for the variety of different models and enemy skins. Unfortunately there is a certain static nature of the environments with which one cannot interact in terms of destruction - and this would be fine - but which are not even equipped with certain interactions that a slice of the competition has had for some time, such as the ability for bullets to pass through the least resistant surfaces. Overall, however, the graphics sector does its job well, gratifying the eye as expected from a high-level production.", "date": "2011-03-11", "grade": "8.5"}
