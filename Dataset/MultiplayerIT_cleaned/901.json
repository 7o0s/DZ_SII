{"name": "Alien Hominid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alien-hominid_a.html", "text": "Who mentioned Metal Slug? The game mechanics at the base of Alien Hominid is extremely simple: in a two-dimensional environment you have to eliminate the many enemies that are sent against us, trying to avoid their bullets and facing, at the end of each stage, a big and bad boss. Those who have tried one of the episodes of Metal Slug know exactly what to expect, as Alien Hominid is extremely similar to the game born on Neo Geo: our character does not have his own energy, therefore he can be eliminated at the first attempt if he does not have a ~ barrier~, which is acquired by collecting the new weapons and which in fact represents a second chance (it resists a single shot). The obtainable weapons are numerous, and each of them boasts specific characteristics; all, however, have counted the shots. Grenades are added to the main weapon, which are useful when you need to quickly eliminate a resistant opponent. But that's not all: our alien can instantly dig a hole and hide inside it until an FBI agent passes over it, after which it can grab it to kill it immediately. Or he can leap on an enemy's head and take a bite out of it, while causing dismay to other opponents on the screen. In some levels the normal structure is distorted in favor of ~road~ settings: you have to jump from car to car to proceed and take possession of one of them when needed, for example when the action itself becomes an evasive practice to defend against attacks of a boss. The bosses, by the way, sometimes show similar attack strategies (high blow, low blow, etc.), but they are quite successful and at ease with the spirit of the game. Technical realization Compared to the version playable on the internet, Alien Hominid on PS2 has obviously been revisited. The graphics of the game are done in an impeccable 2D, with well done animations for the characters and very varied (especially if you take into account the types of death that FBI agents can meet). The explosions, in particular, are done really well. The general look is very reminiscent of the ~ironic~ cartoons that are fashionable in recent years, and represents an excellent show even for eyes accustomed to millions of polygons and photorealistic textures. The sound sector defends itself very well: the music is well done and can be listened to with pleasure, in particular thanks to a more ~homemade~ feeling compared to other productions, due to the choice of instruments used. The sound effects fit perfectly. The normal game mode, which can also be used by two players at the same time, is accompanied by an extra represented by various mini-games. These are thought harps with essential graphics, which nonetheless represent a valid pastime. Comment Alien Hominid is a pure arcade, characterized by a very particular technical realization and certainly up to the situation. To appreciate this title you have to be a fan of two-dimensional action games, with all that this type of video game entails. In AH, in this case, you die continuously because sometimes it becomes really impossible to avoid enemy fire, and the use of ~continue~ becomes a constant practice, which takes away a lot from an otherwise fantastic experience. Apart from this, those looking for an immediate and fun title will find the crowning of a dream in Alien Hominid: engaging alone and fantastic in two, the game will give you moments that you thought were lost together with the previous generation of video games. What would you do if someone hit your spaceship causing it to crash, and then take it away? Our lemon yellow alien hominid has clear ideas about it: he will go around various levels killing FBI agents in all possible and imaginable ways, until the stolen goods are returned to him.", "date": "2005-06-27", "grade": null}
