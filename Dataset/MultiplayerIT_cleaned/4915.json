Square Enix's idea of joining forces with Omega Force to create a spin off of its famous franchise in musou sauce initially made us turn up our noses, but the first Heroes proved to be a successful experiment capable of dampening in the tedious formula of the musou starts, enriching it with many elements and nuances taken from the JRPGs. Without aiming too far from that good result, Dragon Quest Heroes II wants to repeat its success by correcting some flaws. Goal achieved? Dragon Quest Heroes II only partly manages to improve on its predecessor To the adventure Following the main series, this second chapter has no direct connection with the previous one, making it the perfect starting point for those who want to try this spin-off. In Dragon Quest Heroes II we will find ourselves facing a powerful and dark force that has endangered the peace that has reigned between the Seven Kingdoms for more than a thousand years, united by an alliance that never seems to be in serious danger as in this case. To avoid a catastrophic war, Lasaar and Theresa, two cousins enrolled in the military academy, will face an exciting adventure full of dangers that will take them around the world in an attempt to eradicate the threat and restore peace by making an ancient prophecy. A not particularly complex plot full of twists and turns, but interesting enough to keep the attention high and the desire to find out how it will end. As in the first chapter, even before starting the adventure and getting to know the two boys, we can choose in the shoes of which of the two to face the story, with the warning that the choice will have no effect on the flow of events and on the other characters . Given the inevitable involvement of the master Akira Toriyama in character design, there will be no possibility of customization at an aesthetic level, leaving free choice as regards equipment and paraphernalia. Locations and protagonists are completely new even if among the members of the group of heroes we are going to lead there will be several faces known by Dragon Quest lovers, such as the merchant Baldo Baldini from Dragon Quest IV or the couple Terry and Carver from the sixth chapter . The cast of Dragon Quest Heroes II is quite vast and, given its nature halfway between an action hack'n'slash and a JRPG, it will be necessary to study the characteristics of each character to build a party that is as balanced and versatile as possible. able to face both the huge waves of monsters that will appear in front of us and the most aggressive bosses. At most we can carry four heroes with us, plus the possibility of being able to exploit the devastating combinations of magic made available by the chained attacks which in a short time allow us to hurl all sorts of elemental attacks against the unfortunate person on duty. In addition, by landing hits the tension bar is charged which results in a state of invulnerability of the character with infinite magic points and the addition of a supreme attack. At each level up, in addition to an increase in life and magic points, skill points are earned to be spent to unlock new moves or to improve the statistics of each character. For Lasaar and Theresa, however, the possibility of choosing which vocation to undertake between warrior, fighter, magician, priest or thief is added, all to be unlocked by completing specific game quests. Both start as warriors but, unlike the other characters who will join the group with the continuation of the story, if shield and swords are not for us we will be able to choose the path of the magician by enhancing the magical arts or focus on gloves and brass knuckles for body combat in body. This option is designed to expand the range of possibilities offered by Dragon Quest Heroes II to better adapt to the needs of the players. Playstation 4 trophies Dragon Quest Heroes II offers 43 trophies, of which 26 bronze, 13 silver and 3 gold, to which is added the inevitable Platinum. In addition to completing the story, to collect them all you have to range from getting all the weapons and all the materials, up to bringing the party to the maximum level and completing all the quests. In short, dozens of hours of gameplay. Lights and shadows As mentioned, Dragon Quest Heroes II does not overturn, but fixes. Adjust the shot first on the game world, a vast open world full of enemies that swarm among its pinstallments proving that our quartet of brave heroes will fight them. In addition to the cities in which the shops are located and most of the sections closely connected to the main story take place, the connecting areas present themselves as the natural destinations for exploring the game world and completing side missions with the possibility of move easily between them by unlocking the convenient teleportation system. Both in the freely explorable areas and in the dungeons there is a much higher attention to detail than what we are used to seeing in the musou, with fewer enemies on the screen but more attention to modeling and animations. Dozens of enemies and not hundreds therefore, even if the quality of the clashes always remains rather low thanks to an artificial intelligence not received and a general level of difficulty calibrated downwards which make the monsters simple cannon fodder. And AI also remains a problem with our partymates, who often delay in performing healing and magic leaving their companions to die badly. The limits of the genre to which they belong also emerge overwhelmingly in terms of the level design of the dungeons, made up for the most part of rooms to be cleaned up and then continue to the next one and so on until the clash with the boss on duty. Except for some very limited sections with environmental puzzles and stealth phases, repetitiveness spreads undisturbed with the sole purpose of lengthening the broth; a real shame, because the combat system is enjoyable, also enhanced by some changes to the medal system already present in the first chapter. In addition to the Activist and Sentinel medals with which one can respectively summon a defeated monster that will guard a portion of land or summon monsters that enter the scene only to use their special ability and disappear immediately afterwards, the Substitute medals are added to be used to temporarily transform into a monster and use all of its abilities. A nice addition, which we appreciated for its ability to liven up and vary the clashes, also thanks to the great variety of monsters taken from the various chapters of the franchise. Another novelty of Dragon Quest Hereos II is the cooperative multiplayer that allows up to four players to join forces and face the story missions in company or specific dungeons at the end of which there will be interesting rewards, but given the repetitiveness of the same, not they proved to be a satisfying option once the main storyline was completed. From a technical point of view, Dragon Quest Heroes II detaches its predecessor thanks to the cartoon-style cel shading embellished with a bright color palette and a decidedly superior image cleaning compared to that of the first chapter. The models of the characters and monsters are accurate and well detailed, but the same cannot be said of the settings - both natural ones and towns - where rather flat and not very detailed textures abound and completely lack destructibility. Finally, the problem of managing the view remains, especially in battles against large bosses where the camera tends to get stuck in the polygonal models, completely blocking the view.", "date": "2017-04-25", "grade": "8.0"}
