Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. With an excellent touch edition of the ~classic~ FIFA already under its belt, Electronic Arts has seen fit to create a casual management game to target a different audience and to choose, for the occasion, the popular freemium format. iPhone and iPad owners can therefore download FIFA Superstars for free from the App Store and play it without paying a penny, albeit with some limitations, while the more enthusiastic will be able to buy in-game items and enrich their experience by putting their wallets in their hands. This practice, however, is not absolutely mandatory for entertainment purposes, as we will see shortly. FIFA Superstars requires access to the Origin account to work (and therefore an active data connection), but registration is also free and can be done in seconds, in case you haven't already done so in the past. The main screen shows us the current formation of our team, created from scratch thanks to a handful of random players, together with a series of information at the top of the screen: rating, experience level, training level ( ergo the physical condition of the team) and finally the number of premium (blue) and normal (yellow) tokens, which constitute the currency for the purchase of various types of in-game items. The game options are located at the bottom of the screen: ~play~ to access one of the available leagues and simulate matches; ~manage~ to manage tactics, staff, squad, equipment, and so on; ~training~ to improve the physical condition of the team; ~staff~ to use the features made available by the sponsorships, the coach and the trainer; ~store~ to buy new players, tactics, credits and equipment, using play money or not. The first steps in the game are guided by a simple tutorial that allows us to quickly get into the spirit of EA production and to become familiar with its structure, based mostly on a list of achievements that is updated from game to game and which therefore he always sees us engaged in the completion of a new goal. With open cards As mentioned above, the freemium nature of FIFA Superstars allows you to play without any expense, with the only limitation of the ~credits~, which are used to play the actual matches and which ~recharge~ as the minutes go by. Every time we return to the game, however, it rewards us with extra coins, transfer cards and other welcome bonuses, so as to further remove the prospect of spending real money to get something more. Much of the charm of the gameplay lies in the transfers, which take place through the delivery of a certain number of cards that we can discover one by one, to enjoy any surprise, or reveal in full. The replacement of better-performing players within the formation takes place almost automatically and in fact very little skill is required to proceed in the career, even if the selection of certain tactics or modules can make the difference once on the pitch. As for the match simulation, it too can be used in a complete or synthetic way, by reading the ~commentary~ action by action or immediately highlighting the final result. League games that we lose can be replayed until we can bring them home, while access to new leagues goes hand in hand with the level of experience and, therefore, with the amount of time we spend playing.", "date": "2012-03-17", "grade": "S.V."}
