{"name": "And 1 Streetball - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/and-1-streetball-recensione.html", "text": "All stars On paper, what And 1 Streetball offers to the gamer is a product that faithfully follows in the footsteps of the Mixtape Tour and its phenomena now known as NBA darlings: Half-man Half-amazing, The Professor, The Pharmacist are just some of the players royals who tread the pitches of And 1 recreating movements and skills down to the smallest detail. The game is divided into two sections: the first puts the player to the test with a simple match, two teams competing for victory until the final seconds (in configurations ranging from 1vs1/3vs3 in the midfield, up to 3vs3/5vs5 across the board); the second is instead structured as a real story mode capable of making the gamer live the experience of starting out as the more classic 'Mr Nobody', up to getting on the And 1 bus and embarking on the richest tour of technique and imagination in the field of basketball handlers. To continue one's experience with And 1, it will be necessary to continue to win and amaze, in order to earn more and more money to spend on clothing, tattoos and skills to add to one's physical characteristics. A character editor and live mode conclude the book of proposed modes. The first one is really very accurate and well made, very useful for creating your own nemesis to be used in friendlies and mixtape tours, to increase the sense of identification; the second follows the mechanics of the single player mixtape tour, expanding it to the live universe ~rewarding~ the best players with inclusion in the And 1 virtual team. Way of play More than following the canons of basketball, And 1 emphasizes the skill of the players in executing moves, feints and ball games capable of disorienting the opponent, opening a way to the basket and above all earning precious points. The interface called i-Ball was specially designed for the game, which allows players to perform, with a simple sequence of keys, a series of evolutions at the limit of humanly possible. Given the effective complexity of this control, a tutorial comes to the aid of the player in the early stages of the game by explaining all three levels of evolution (on an obvious scale of difficulty) in detail: to perform a particular move, the simultaneous use will suffice of the left analog stick (to move) and the right one to take advantage of the move, the more well executed the combination between the two sticks, the greater the chances of creating a feint capable of -metaphorically- splitting the opponent's ankle, i.e. leave it in place while you proceed undisturbed to the basket. From this point of view of special moves and evolutions, the more they will be used in the competition and the greater will be the possibility of filling a particular energy bar which will allow, once full, to have a real match ball in your hands, a ball capable of yielding from 3 to 5 points depending on the type of basket. This last type of action will be of vital importance in view of games that end at 11 points: intelligent exploitation will be able to overturn even the most compromised situations. WYSIWYG? The reality of what results from this And 1, differs decidedly from all the theoretical assumptions from which it is structured: the game, although faithful to the Mixtape and to everything that orbits around it, gets lost in a series of details that weigh like boulders on the game economy. First of all, the i-Ball system, the evident flagship of the production, is at the same time the cross and delight of the final product: although the creation of the evolutions appears on paper as something long-lived, a normal game leads back to a rather rambling series of moves resulting from chance, from haste and from the lack of precision of the commands; the link between moves and energy bar also covers a fairly obvious weakness with games that could be solved even just by spending one's time making random evolutions to fill the bar and continue to hit opponents with heavy blows in terms of score. During the Mixtape competitions, in addition to the classic goal of victory, it may happen that you come across tedious (at the end of the actual game) tasks such as ~making a certain number of evolutions of a certain type~ making the game very cumbersome and tiring in the long run. Also accused are the graphic and sound sectors, decidedly subdued: the first, while presenting absolutely credible player models, brings with it a whole series of problems due to the bad characterization of the animations (which appeared absolutely dull and monotonous) and an excessive simplification of the movements; the sound instead is signaled egr its absence, despite a whole series of hip-hop tunes that follow the player throughout the game, the match commentary is really non-existent, one of the key points of the real And 1. Comment And 1 StreetBall starts from excellent premises, then unfortunately gets lost along the way with a series of errors that affect the gaming experience. Doubts remain about the reasons that led to bringing such a game to Europe since it is a practically unknown movement here, in anticipation of all those gamers who will be able to recognize And 1 Streetball as a common basketball game, making a mistake. Pros: i-Ball system is very original Carefully crafted mixtape tour Real players and great editor Cons: Inaccurate and sometimes frustrating control system Gets boring quickly Player animations are too simplistic The end of the nineties marked the ~official~ birth of a new basketball movement associated with a shoe brand, And 1, which promoted a parallel way of experiencing basketball, focusing almost exclusively on ~circus~ skills ~ of its players, real street performers of the orange ball. Since then this way of understanding basketball has found more and more fans until the creation of the Mixtape tour, a real traveling tournament throughout America, and the channel dedicated to him on ESPN. The transition to the world of video games perhaps came a little late but in any case it is now here, with all its loads of stars, moves and 100% healthy streetball.", "date": "2006-07-04", "grade": null}
