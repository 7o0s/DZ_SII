{"name": "Everspace 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everspace-2-recensione.html", "text": "Adam Roslin can die. He could also die in Everspace, but with the guarantee of being cloned to immediately return to action. After all, roguelikes somehow guarantee videogame immortality, at least until the end of the game, but unfortunately for him Rockfish Games has decided to change course, i.e. genre, and now the privilege of having infinite clones available to try his luck again in a procedurally generated space is no longer granted to him. The Everspace 2 review must immediately deal with this decision, which completely changes the cards on the table, transforming the series into something more epic and structured, less entrusted to the whims of chance. History Everspace 2 equipment is very rich The game begins with one of Roslin's latest clones escorting a mineral-seeking expedition to a remote asteroid aboard his space fighter. Entry into the game is quite immediate, favored by a welcoming and quite exhaustive tutorial, which guides us in our first steps with great attention, then immediately making us put the concepts we have just learned into practice in a protected context. Penetrating into the asteroid we therefore learn to maneuver our spaceship, to use its weapons first to clean up some passages from aggressive vegetables, then to face space pirates, who just don't want to share the riches of the place with us. The escort mission, which was supposed to be pure routine in the plans, turns into hell that will completely change our hero's future, bringing down his plans to take advantage of the Grady & Brunt company pension plan to live forever on Eden-6 along with his friend Ben. All of which can be translated into a long single-player campaign in which we will have to travel the length and breadth of the DMZ, or demilitarized zone, ending up entangled in a story involving different factions, including space bandits, Okkar aliens, colonial forces and the Grady & Brunt itself, which as a good multinational is only interested in profit. The target? Follow Dax Bashar, our new travel companion, who promised us unheard-of riches with which to retire to private life... were it that simple, would they have made us a whole video game? Game structure Everspace 2's space fights are addictive One of the first things you notice when playing Everspace 2 is that the equipment system now terribly resembles that of a looter shooter: therefore the objects that we can obtain or recover during the game grow together with Roslin and have five different levels of rarity, which they range from the common to the legendary, as seen on the many other loot-focused titles. We almost didn't expect it actually, even if the strange combinations of Diablo read around a bit had made us suspicious. Playing a little, one realizes that it is not only the equipment that has been inspired by that of hack and slash action RPGs, but also part of the general structure, including side missions and activities to be carried out that are useful in any case to gorge on equipment and experience points. In short, Rockfish Games' promise to overcome the first chapter, accused of being too repetitive, has been fully maintained, as has that of creating an epic space game, with RPG elements and a strong single player campaign. Everspace 2 is actually many things. Meanwhile it is an intelligent open world, which avoids the Rockstar / Ubisoft model to focus more on the splendid combat system, not very simulative and very direct. It is also one of those titles that knows how to recognize its limits and manages to mask them without trying to overdo it in any way. The developers therefore focused on spaceships and space, avoiding introducing superfluous systems such as direct control of the character outside his vehicle. When we're not on board, we're certainly witnessing some cut-scene done like an animated comic. We also soon discover that the story is better than we might have thought and that the cast of characters we will find ourselves interacting with is varied and interesting. Not that it's particularly important for a game so truthful in its objectives, but going from thinking: ~ah, there's a story too~, to ~let's see what happens next~, wasn't so obvious. Too bad for the not very exceptional dubbing and for a drop in the final part. Having said that, the intelligence with which the story does its job very discreetly, without ever representing a distraction from fighting in space, must be applauded. Many things to do The graphics of Everspace 2 are not very complex, but produce dand very beautiful moments We are in the cosmic immensity, the distances to travel are enormous and the bullets to be fired are many. Given the nature of the Everspace 2 equipment, we had initially feared that we would be faced with the classic useless fair, in which one weapon is as good as another as long as it does more damage than the previous one. Naturally there is a lot to choose from among the many junk that is around, but soon the game leads to thinking about configurations of armaments, leaving the player the possibility to experiment with the nine classes of spaceships available and find his own style, without forcing it in any way. Furthermore, the greater power alone is not enough, but you must also learn to fight, studying the use of all the tools available, if you want to get the upper hand and continue. In terms of usable spaceships, the nine classes offer a good variety and allow you to develop your own fighting style in harmony with the equipment. We have already said that fighting in space gives great satisfaction It's just a pity that unlocking the upper tiers of aircraft costs a lot of money, which unfortunately reduces the desire to experiment a little and leads to the purchase of a few ships, especially if you don't want to spend time carrying out missions just to collect credits or to study trade routes with which to earn more. In total, we only changed a handful of ships throughout the game, always choosing the most expensive ones in each tier because there was no point in spending time accumulating enough money to try them all. Despite some small flaws, we loved Everspace 2, because it was full of things to do and places to see. As we said, the game is a particular open world in which you travel to various relatively small areas of space, but all with their own particularity. Having focused on a strong design has made it possible to better characterize and make each individual environment more interesting, including flights in the atmosphere of some planets, space stations to visit, asteroid belts to avoid and so on. In Everspace 2 you also visit some planets Furthermore, the focus on fighting has made the secondary missions less oppressive, which, even when very trivial, never choke the gameplay because in the end they are experienced as an excuse to fire a few shots and perhaps try out the new equipment that has just been mounted. There's also the option of wandering around the space on your own to visit areas you haven't previously reached, where you're sure to find something to see or do. That said, the amount of possibilities can get a little overwhelming at some point, but luckily it never escalates into choice frustration (at least not in our case) and the forty or so hours it takes to complete the game isn't they regret. From a technical point of view Everspace 2 is an excellent title. More than anything it was done with great intelligence. As mentioned before, he knows how to mask his limitations well, pushing on his strengths. So the developers have worked a lot to make space and space travel as beautiful as possible and to create beautiful spaceships (it's not for nothing that they are the object you will see for the most time on the screen), paying less attention to some secondary elements, such as already mentioned narrative sequences. In certain situations you find yourself fighting in breathtaking areas for the colors and morphology of the scene, so much so that it does not seem to be in a cosmic vacuum. Even the special effects of weapons and explosions are very accurate and do not regret larger productions.", "date": "2023-04-13", "grade": "8.5"}
