{"name": "Super Robot Taisen MX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-robot-taisen-mx.html", "text": "The War of the Robots, MX Version It is useless to talk about the plot in Super Robot Taisen, for two simple reasons: the first, that in general it is always a joint attack by all the enemies of the robots, allied to defeat our heroes, to which the alliance of the most famous heroes responds and their companions; the second, which is totally in Japanese and hardly understandable. In general, however, the plot of Super Robot Taisen develops through an endless series of dialogues (spoken and not) that take place between one mission and another. But in MX there is also one more reason, quite particular: in this new chapter, in fact, the stories of the protagonists are intertwined with each other and, simultaneously, with the storyline of the animated series to which they belong. So here is Dendoh (Gear Senshi Dendoh) facing Arthea to recover Circle Leo while Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami (Neon Genesis Evangelion) face the terrible night battle against Ramiel, the Angel who attacked NEO Tokyo-3 in episode 6 of the anime , backed by the Gundams, the Getter G and the Dragonars. Even more marked, in this chapter, the distinction between Super Robot and Real Robot. For the uninitiated, by Super Robot we mean the so-called ~big robots~, the heavy, clumsy and very powerful ones, those of Go Nagai to be clear (Mazinger Z, Grandizer, Getter Robot), while by Real Robot we mean the ~mecha~ agile and realistically warlike, like the very famous Gundams, the Evangelions and the Aesti-Valis. In MX robots of the second type definitely seem to abound, since from the very first missions a decidedly abundant number of Gundams are made available to the player, in all their variants (Z, ZZ and so on); however, Banpresto's choice of robots included in this episode appears questionable: new entries like RahXephon and the Dragonar or welcome returns like Dendoh take the place of real, old glories, like the Shin Getter Robot, the Mazinkaiser (it's funny that these were born thanks to to the Super Robot Taisen series) or Vultus-V and Combattler V. On the other hand, one cannot but consider this choice by Banpresto to be courageous, aimed at renewing at least a little the ranks of robotic units, for too long now all too similar . In this regard, the character design and the mecha design of the so-called ~Original Banpresto~ characters and robots, the ~counterparts~, in short, of the player, really tacky and excessive, are much more questionable. We regret Axel and Lamia from Super Robot Taisen A, as if to say... not all donuts come out with a hole. ... Lift-off! MX's first innovation: the choice of the favorite series. It sounds funny to say, but that's exactly how it works: at the beginning of the game, we will be offered the list of animated series that will ~lend~ us their robots to face the enemies, and the player will have to choose one of them; from that moment, the heroes and robots of the series in question will receive more experience points and bonus points to be distributed to increase their capabilities. In fact, each destroyed unit will give the pilot of the winning robot a certain amount of experience points which, accumulated, will make him level up, allowing him to learn new skills to use during the clashes; in addition, each enemy defeated grants a certain amount of points to be spent at the player's discretion to upgrade the robots' various stats, from their amount of HP to the power of their special attacks. After all, the comparison between the units takes place based on the countless characteristics that each robot possesses, from its defense to its agility, from its position (in flight, on the ground, underwater) to the power of its special moves; when you engage in battle with an enemy unit, the player selects one of the available attacks and at that point a non-interactive sequence starts in which our pet uses the chosen attack to hit the enemy and, possibly, destroy it. In MX, among other things, many of the features already seen in some prequels make their reappearance, such as the support-actions, which allow a robot in a square adjacent to the one in action to intervene during the fight, and the combined attacks, which they allow certain robots to join forces in a deadly cross-shot (who said Final Dynamic Special?). The so-called ~Ace Pilot~ system is also back: once 50 or more victories have been achieved, a pilot is named ~Ace~ and from that moment he will start each new mission with the moral (which influences the robot's actions and is necessary to carry out the attacks more powerful) already at 105. For the rest, Super Robot Taisen MX is played exactly like its predecessors: missions are solved by completing the various objectives (which generally involve the annihilation of everything hostile onlla map) and you upgrade and manage pilots and robots through the complex menu that you can use between one mission and another, equipping items, increasing the values, replacing the pilots and so on. In short, the usual Super Robot Taisen with a few more novelties. Matter of style The mediocre results obtained with the three-dimensional transpositions of the series (see Super Robot Taisen Alpha for Dreamcast or the recent Super Robot Taisen Scramble Commander) have pushed Banpresto to bet more and more on 2-D, which is why, in 2004, in a he videogame era dominated by photorealistic three-dimensionality, the Robots of Super Robot Taisen is a pleasure to see them in the form that rightfully belongs to them, the two-dimensional one. After the excellent results obtained by The Second Super Robot Taisen Alpha, Banpresto continues on the same path, increasing the resolution of the sprites and creating the animations, the various special effects and the pseudo-animated sequences that characterize the most spectacular shots with painstaking care. The result is incredible. The robots, finally in hi-resolution, always characterized in a ~super-deformed~ version (disproportionate, in short, with an enormous head and short limbs), enjoy excellent, fluid and spectacular animations; their special attacks offer remarkable pyrotechnic displays and the more particular ones briefly transform the deformed robot into its ~serious~ counterpart, perhaps interspersing everything with a short cartoon sequence borrowed from the series itself. The care taken by Banpresto in the creation of the graphic sector does not only affect the combat sequences: finally we notice more accurate and detailed game maps, and on them the units no longer appear as small two-dimensional sprites, but as minute polygonal cel- shade, definitely more pleasing to the eye. The repertoire of special effects characterizing the ~field~ skills of the pilots has also been revised and corrected, and now enjoys significant particle or lens-flare effects. On the sound side, Super Robot Taisen repeats the success of almost all its predecessors: the remixes of the various music from the animated series, which characterize the fights of the robots in the series in question, are excellently made and always very pleasant (exceptional Beethoven's Ninth Symphony , borrowed from the twenty-fourth episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion); but above all, what matters to a fan in Super Robot Taisen, or the vocalizations, return in a big way, mostly reproduced by the original voice actors, those Japanese who freeze the blood with their battle cries, and hear Ryoma Nagare scream like a madman the classic ~Getter Beam!~ it is always an emotion for those who grew up in the myth of Japanese robots. A great job indeed. Getter Robot G Comment Super Robot Taisen is back, and splits the fan community of the series in two. There are those who still prefer The Second Super Robot Taisen Alpha, considered the best game in the series, and those who prefer this new installment, despite the more complex interface and the myriad of new details that characterize it. Be that as it may, it is also true that in the preference of one or the other the presence of cartoons of the heart also counts a lot, and in MX many old glories have given way to new heroes, something that not everyone has gone to. genius. However, it is impossible to deny the quality of this strategic game, both playful and technical, really very high, despite a rather evident imbalance in the difficulty towards the middle of the game. As usual, the only flaws are the monotony of the action, which in the long run takes over, and the idiom, a difficult Japanese as always, which requires a little practice and mnemonic capacity to be bypassed and ignored almost completely. Once this obstacle has been overcome, lovers of Japanese robotic animation will have fun, especially considering what is considered almost the most important novelty of the game: the possibility of ~skipping~ the combat sequences by pressing a single button. It's about time, Banpresto! Pros: Technically excellent. The protagonists are the largest Japanese robots. Extremely long-lived. Cons: Only for fans of the genre. Exclusively in Japanese. Difficulty not always balanced. The first robotic gathering organized by Banpresto dates back to a decade ago, to the monochrome display of the very first Game Boy, where the Japanese software house decided to field the most famous robots of Japanese robotic animation against their bitterest enemies (Taisen, in Japanese, means ~War~, that's why we often talk about Super Robot Wars), in a simple strategy but able to excite the most avid fans. The success of SuperRobot Taisen was immediately extraordinary. Since then, the Banpresto saga has appeared on practically all consoles, from the Super Nintendo to the Wonderswan, from the Game Boy Advance to the Dreamcast. From time to time Banpresto has made small changes, trying to improve a game which, it must be said, always has somewhat stale mechanics, not to mention already seen and revised. Surely the best results obtained so far are represented by the excellent Super Robot Taisen A for Game Boy Advance (which has already seen four titles in its toy library) and The Second Super Robot Taisen Alpha, considered by fans to be the best episode ever in the series. Now Banpresto offers us the sum total of its production, in this Super Robot Taisen MX which wants to draw the strings of what the saga has been up to now, introducing innovations (not so much in mechanics, as in generality of the game itself) and of the changes that will turn up their noses as well as exalt both longtime fans and laymen.", "date": "2004-07-20", "grade": null}
