{"name": "Warhammer: Battle March - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-battle-march-recensione.html", "text": "Battles upon battles The best approach during the many missions involves identifying enemy forces, sending armored units forward, supporting them with archers and wizards to inflict damage safely. The presence of other types of units such as siege, flying or cavalry units makes the battles decidedly varied and profound, also given that sending your own troops into disarray is a tactic that does not pay off in the long run and you end up with a number of small units, it can compromise the final stages of a mission or even the entire campaign. At the end of each mission, it will be possible to pop into the camp, in order to swell the ranks of your troops, acquire equipment for the heroes and upgrade weapons and armor. To do this it is necessary to use gold, which can be found during missions and as a bonus upon completing them. In all cases, even playing on the lowest of the three difficulty levels, you never have enough resources to do everything you want, forcing the player to make choices. Longevity+online Conversion quirks A year has passed since the release of the first episode, and if the Battle March graphics were definitely valid on PC, unfortunately this is not the case on consoles, indeed we must say that the impact was somewhat disappointing. From the excellent, incredible CG footage that introduces the adventure, the break with the actual game has a ~devastating~ effect, with a very low level of detail and too many textures in absolutely low resolution. The movies made with the game engine are at the limits of presentability, we have no doubts that they would have belonged without problems to the previous generation of consoles and we still don't understand how it is possible to make such a careless and hasty conversion of a game that boasts a large crowd of enthusiasts. Fortunately, there is a distinction to be made given that the characters and animations are discreetly cared for and using the zoom of the camera that can be adjusted as desired we will be able to see the troops defined in every detail. The game scenarios, on the other hand, are absolutely flat, created with the above textures, and devoid of any originality. The biggest problem also concerns the stability of the game engine which on more than a few occasions limps showing frame drops that are decidedly avoidable given the low exploitation of the resources offered by Xbox 360. In addition to the mere graphic quality, the game is distinguished by a atmosphere and a detail capable of making the happiness of strategy and miniatures enthusiasts. The outlines of the settings as well as the characters appear deliberately blurred and this gives the game a particular charm. The special effects related to the heroes' powers make a decent impression, with shock waves and distortion quite nice to see. The audio is another rather successful aspect, with well-characterized voices (subtitled in Italian) and well-finished dialogues. Comment Warhammer: Battle March born as an expansion for Mark of Chaos, now arrives in its most complete version on Xbox 360. The title published by Koch Media does not introduce significant innovations in the world of RTS, however it guarantees a fairly interesting and particularly long-lived game structure thanks to the combination of the base game and the expansion. What convinced us the least is certainly the work done by the developers to bring the good starting product to Xbox 360, the experience is in fact marred by a control system that is too unintuitive and cumbersome, which does not follow in the wake of the latest RTS on consoles. The too fluctuating graphics is the further lack of this new game, in which well-kept characters with good animations are counterbalanced by too bare scenarios and too many fluctuating textures. For the rest it is the world of Warhammer that returns to visit us, fans will have to at least try it. Pros Solid structure based on Warhammer Good longevity Cons Technically poor Control system too cumbersome Goals 360 There are 42 objectives in which the 1000 points offered by this new RTS made in Namco Bandai are divided. 27 achievements are dedicated to the main campaign mode and the other 15 concern multiplayer via Xbox Live. It will be necessary to finish the story with all 3 factions, win duels and upgrade heroes. Online is the developers have bet on the number of games won and the number of heroes killed.", "date": "2008-09-25", "grade": null}
