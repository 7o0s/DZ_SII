Dragon Ball Super, the most recent animated series, is about to reach its 100th episode, and has already inspired some video games, among which the two Dragon Ball Xenoverse for home consoles and PC stand out above all, bizarre fighting games characterized by RPG elements. Dragon Ball Fusions, the latest proposal for the Nintendo portable, follows the same hybrid philosophy: it's an RPG that at times resembles a fighting game, but above all it recalls well, Pokmon. How is it possible? Read on for our review to find out. The new Dragon Ball-inspired RPG employs the Pokmon formula to please fans above all else Fight them all Dragon Ball Fusions is not inspired by any particular narrative arc of the manga or anime and the plot is basically just a pretext to kick off the actual game. Unfortunately it is also quite silly: designed more than anything else to amuse hardcore Dragon Ball fans, it relies on terrible dialogues and arbitrary manipulations of the original salient facts, intertwining them with unpublished storylines and an inevitable hunt for the dragon balls. Nor does it help that the Italian localization is impoverished by frequent spelling errors and questionable stylistic choices. The truth is that there isn't much to tell: the protagonist - the default name is Tekka - and his best friend Pinich decide to sign up for a big martial arts tournament in which, however, you have to participate in groups of five fighters. To this end, they decide to travel the world in search of fighters to recruit and immediately come across the little Goten and Trunks who, at this point in the story, can already merge into the very powerful Gotenks. From then on, it's a succession of situations that fans of games based on Toriyama's popular manga should be used to: in practice, the team will find themselves traveling from one dimension to another and from one era to another in search of allies, reliving the most important battles of the series, albeit reworked for the occasion. In fact, most of the main opponents we will face will be able to merge, often giving rise to very funny hybrids. Many Dragon Ball fans have always wondered what would have happened if a certain character had merged with another and the title developed by Ganbarion tries to answer those questions with imaginative combinations to say the least. The game, however, follows a decidedly repetitive path made up of missions and micro-zones - decidedly empty - that Tekka can explore at three hundred and sixty degrees thanks to his ability to fly (linked, however, to a rather awkward control system that requires a little practice). The heart of the experience lies entirely in the so-called ~post-game~, that is, in the contents that are unlocked once the adventure is completed: it is at that point that you can indulge yourself in completing all the side missions and recruiting the most famous characters of Dragon Ball, perhaps to form an ad hoc team with which to face other players in the online multiplayer mode. The 3D effect Not received: in other words, the game is completely devoid of 3D effect. Billiard strategy While Ganbarion has tried to change things up a bit by introducing daily quizzes and other simple mini-games, Ganbarion hasn't managed to give a bigger breadth to a structure that features an exorbitant number of battles. Fortunately, the combat system is really good, although the continuous skits in which the actions of the fighters are translated tend to be a bit tiring due to their length. Once you agree to fight or engage one of the enemies roaming the map, you move on to a battlefield where up to five characters against five will face each other. Each fighter - including our alter ego, Tekka, who we can create at the beginning of the game and customize later - is marked by a symbol that represents his strength, i.e. power, technique or speed. The three values form a triangle relationship that decrees who inflicts more damage to whom, so we need to balance the team and choose the right targets at each turn to maximize the effectiveness of our shots. Turns, in turn, are marked by an indicator at the bottom of the screen, but the player can alter the order of actions by pushing his opponents out of the ~ring~ and resetting their turns: each hit, in fact,tti, repels the target and choosing directions with care you can chain numerous attacks without giving him respite. The most skilled, for example, could cause an enemy to bounce from one character to another, multiplying the damage dealt as they reposition their team in anticipation of the next round. Obviously enemies can also play strategy and artificial intelligence immediately proves to be quite annoying. In this sense, Dragon Ball Fusions seemed a little unbalanced to us, especially when it introduces additional rules during the clashes that can make them quite difficult. If you want to recruit some characters, then, you have to be luckier than skilled: first you need to meet certain requirements to meet them, then you have to face them, fill the Zenkai gauge and finally capture... that is, attack the character in question to add him to the our little army. Unfortunately, to acquire most of the most famous characters, you have to resort to an abstruse system that forces heavy ~grind~ sessions; the same goes for fusions and special techniques which, a bit like in Dragon Ball Xenoverse, must be unlocked somewhat at random and somewhat by satisfying special conditions. In short, players who want to assemble their favorite team and equip it with the most powerful special attacks admired in the cartoon will have to work hard. Fortunately, Dragon Ball Fusions is a title made more than fairly well from a technical point of view. Ganbarion has chosen a vaguely super deformed style to depict all the characters, including adults, and the colorful cel shading gives the game a clean and pleasant look especially during the most spectacular cutscenes. It's a pity that the soundtrack is forgettable and that the dubbing, in Japanese, is limited to short sentences and some inevitable battle cries: every now and then it happens to hear some excerpts from the anime rearranged for the occasion, but in general the soundtrack leaves enough to be desired.", "date": "2017-02-13", "grade": "7.0"}
