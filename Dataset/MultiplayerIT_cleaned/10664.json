A lasting success therefore, which can also be said to be still growing, with several hundred thousand active users and daily peaks that reach over 50,000 simultaneous accesses. Apparently insignificant figures when compared to the 11 million World of Warcraft subscribers, but which take on an even more relevant dimension if we consider the absolutely unique nature of Eve, a niche product which represents, in its uniqueness, the niche itself, but which instead of fragmenting its user base into myriads of servers from a handful to thousands of players, it collects them all in the largest, most complex and most populous virtual universe ever. A game that has made the motto ~for many but not for all~ its philosophy, where ~many~ actually means a rather small number of individuals with the patience and perseverance to face a learning curve much more similar to a deadly steep cliff and for whom the definition of gamer is actually reductive: much of the activities required to achieve success in Eve actually escape a generic definition of fun and provide a type of fulfillment much closer to that of work and the associated social recognition gained from peers. Apocrypha What we are going to examine today is nothing less than the eleventh free ~expansion~ of Eve, which as per a now long tradition of more or less six-monthly releases, does not simply enrich the game with new content, but evolves it in its main mechanics in several directions and on several levels, thus impacting almost the entire population of players. There are so many new features in Apocrypha that CCP has even taken the opportunity to physically bring the game back to stores, with a new retail edition in collaboration with Atari, 6 years after the unfortunate partnership with Simon&Schuster, from which the very brief appearance on shelves of the first version of Eve. Soon CCP bought back the rights to his own game and was an absolute pioneer of digital delivery, among the very first to offer the entire client as a free download on his site. Indeed, even if the scale of contents that with each ~major release~ go to infuse new energy into the game is mind boggling, to the point that hardly any single player can think of experiencing them all fully, Apocrypha is probably one of the largest and revolutionary, like those that introduced the installation of spatial Outposts by the players and the system of claiming and sovereignty of the Systems. Let's start with the most spectacular and visible feature: the ~wormholes~. According to Eve's story, the current sector of the galaxy populated by the four playable factions was colonized thousands of years ago by a still young human race, which in our Solar System came across a wormhole, a sort of tunnel in the space that connects even very remote regions. The sudden collapse of the original wormhole abandoned the newly established young colonies in chaos, which, suddenly isolated, fragmented, technologically regressing and sinking into a sort of Middle Ages, from which over time the four main civilizations re-emerged and were able to reinvent with own forces the principles of interstellar travel. Now, thousands of years later, a veritable ~storm~ of wormholes is sweeping Eve, with wormholes opening at random locations and instants, randomly connecting portions of known - and unknown - space. Galactic wormholes There are many ways to take advantage of wormholes: one that connects external systems, rich in resources, with the most central and populous regions, would provide an enormous logistical and commercial advantage for the lucky discoverer, while another that should open in the heart of the area claimed by a hostile alliance, it would allow a silent infiltration, completely bypassing its defenses. From this point of view, wormholes have all the appearance of being an unpredictable element, specially inserted to destabilize a system of mega-alliances of thousands of players that has been too crystallized for years, where, barring some striking but rare events, there finds itself increasingly trapped in a cold war enforced by mutual military deterrence. Wormholes also have the unique feature of providing temporary access to completely unknown (and unmapped, whereand manual scanning becomes necessary even for the most trivial operations!), thousands of solar systems without Jump Gates and impossible to reach except through these ephemeral physical anomalies and where it is possible to find equally great dangers and great opportunities. as for the former, it will suffice to think of the mysterious race of the Sleepers, brand new enemies (apparently unmanned ships and other automated defenses that represent all that remains of another branch of dispersed and perhaps now extinct humanity) endowed with a artificial intelligence infinitely more advanced than ordinary NPCs, which do nothing but fix themselves in orbit around a target and go on dumbly shooting until his or her destruction. Sleepers not only react to players firing modules, but take into account various parameters, including radial speed, ship size and ammo types, and are in no way similar to traditional auto-farm NPCs. The reward for the effort to deal with them - in addition to the exotic specimens of alien technology carved from their wrecks - are new types of minerals of astronomical value, essential raw material for the construction of the new Tech 3 components. To set strict limits both to our ability to rake in riches, and to the offensive potential that we can carry with us to annihilate any possible alien threat, the most notorious mechanic that regulates wormholes intervenes: the duration of their ~life~ in fact, at the end of which we will see them collapse and disappear, is determined by the amount of mass passing through it. Crossing it with a fleet of transport ships or even with the components for a Control Tower and its Outpost, are the fastest way to make it disappear in a flash, stranding us hopelessly on the other side. in these cases the only solution becomes to look for another anomaly, with the guarantee of not returning to the starting point, but who knows where in the immense galaxy of Eve, potentially in other unmapped and perhaps dangerous regions. In conclusion, we are talking about 2500 new solar systems, an increase of 30% which brings Eve to 8000 stars. Other than the last frontier! There is no end to the details An expansion of Eve wouldn't be an expansion without some new ships as well. But this time CCP has really changed the rules of the game, introducing the first category of Tech 3 ships, the Strategic Cruisers. If the Tech 2 vessels were nothing more than highly specialized versions of traditional vessels (with some minor aesthetic embellishments as well) the new Strategic Cruisers completely overturn the antiquated system according to which a ship was composed of a basic static structure and a certain number default set of interchangeable modules (weapons, shields, generators, CPUs). Now the ship itself is modular, disassembled and modifiable in an infinite number of combinations depending on our predilection for speed, firepower, resistance, effectiveness in electronic warfare and so on. And the changes are overwhelmingly reflected on the appearance of the ship itself, so much so that for an expert eye it is now even possible to recognize its configuration and strengths. A lot of work has also gone into a complete redesign of the new player experience: from a streamlined character creation process (with fewer binding choices to make and fewer abstruse steps to follow) to a brand new tutorial that literally takes us by the hand to teach us the basics of navigation, mining, trading and combat, the 4 pillars that give an Eve newbie a minimum of independence and survival skills. Furthermore, now each player has two ~resets~ of the characteristics, plus one for each year of subscription to the game, so that those who want to try a different career - military, scientific, productive or whatever - can do so without giving up the years of skill training accumulated by your favorite character (for this purpose, a hurray for the ~training queue~, loudly requested practically since the debut of the game. No more getting up in the middle of the night to change the skill!). The noteworthy additions don't end there: by abandoning the support for some generations of graphics cards now preceding the invention of the steam engine, now most of the graphic enhancements of the premium version of Eve (designed for DirectX 10) are now also available for owners of cards that only support DirectX 9. And there are also some significant improvements to the interface, including our favorite, the window with the 3D model of the ships viewable in the Market database: finally the possibility to appreciate the beautifulimi 3D models, without first having to spot them by chance in flight (which is not easy in a space MMO with thousands of 1:1 scale solar systems). Finally, in a renewed wave of affection, both towards those who love role-playing games and those who grind Missions every day (the equivalent in Eve of the traditional Quests, with the difference that there are literally an infinite number of them and they are totally optional ), among the many records of Apocrypha there is also that of being the most ~story-driven~ expansion ever, with an ~epic mission arc~ that involves all the empires, concocted by a team of professional writers specially enlisted.", "date": "2009-06-30", "grade": "8.0"}
