{"name": "Twin Spin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/twin-spin.html", "text": "This puzzle game from the large international publisher is actually decidedly action-oriented, we will have to move our bizarre character through various levels with the sole purpose of destroying the balloons, initially very delicate and gradually becoming more resistant. Why bizarre? Because the strange being is made up of two spheres linked by a thread, we will control it by pressing a single key and, based on the rotation, we will make it move in the desired direction. The first time we press the key on our joystick or keyboard, one of the two spheres will begin to rotate around the other and with the second pressure on the button it will stop and begin to rotate the other. Depending on the moment in which we press the two spheres will move towards our goal. The direction to take is always indicated by some white arrows on the game table, we will have to reach the balls as soon as possible without wasting precious seconds; once near the colored spheres we will have to do nothing but bump into them several times, until they explode. To destroy our objectives we will have little time and the moves will have to be quick and calculated to perfection, otherwise we will have to start the entire level from the beginning. As we advance through the patterns we will have fewer seconds available and the balls to break will become more and more resistant. To reach our targets we will have to pass through dangerous bottlenecks, prickly obstacles of all kinds until the completion of 20 levels. The InfraWorlds title turns out to be perfect for short matches, for a small break of a few minutes, but certainly its structure is not suitable for matches of a certain length, it could be excellent if combined with some more demanding titles. Technically it is certainly not exceptional but it turns out to be very colourful, fluid and with a simple and effective control system. It could offer the entertainment you are looking for but we are not in the presence of a game that will keep you glued to your mobile phone. PRO Immediate Great for a short stop Simple... AGAINST ...too much Repetitive", "date": "2007-11-22", "grade": "S.V."}
