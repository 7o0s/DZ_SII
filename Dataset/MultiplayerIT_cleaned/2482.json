{"name": "Panzer Front", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/panzer-front.html", "text": "The game will allow you to choose between six tanks and precisely two for the United States, two for the Soviet Union and finally two for Germany. Although they may seem few, in reality they have the advantage of being all different from each other in order to prolong the longevity of the game precisely due to the fact that you can play several times with totally different tanks both in terms of speed and equipment of arms! Once you have chosen your vehicle you will have to start the game which consists of a core of 18 missions plus some special training sessions! During the missions you can also choose to fight with one or the other tank that you will have. Graphically the game unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired! The 3D game features poorly detailed graphics with very blurry landscapes! The view rotates around the tank and is unclear which makes it difficult for the player to identify enemies. The various buildings present are reproduced with little realism and even the surrounding landscape such as trees or ponds are barely distinguishable! Also if you hit a building you will see the walls come down like concrete blocks without taking any damage! The gameplay, on the other hand, is of good quality. The enemies will be displayed on a map which will allow you to choose the best strategy to approach them and destroy them one by one. If, on the other hand, you use a kamikaze tactic by throwing yourself into the arms of the enemy, you risk becoming the target of two or more tanks that will make you happy by bombarding you from all sides. Tank games for PSX can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The purchase of this game is recommended only if you are a huge fan of the genre otherwise forget it and look ahead! Pros: Where do you find another game like this for PsOne? Cons: The rarity of its kind is not worth the purchase due to the superficiality in the global realization. After F-16s and submarines come tanks! The many games released so far for the PsOne have certainly been a problem for the development teams in terms of ideas for creating new titles. But this fact was also a stimulus for the search for something that was proposed on the market as an alternative to the usual action and adventure games. So I ask myself: ~Do you want to see that the Sonyuz guys had the brilliant idea of finding this innovation in the development of a game that can put you at the wheel of a tank?~. Oh well that the concept is not exactly medieval but among many weapons of war just on the one slower than a snail they had to go to focus their interest? And it was precisely the union between a tank and a video game that gave birth to Panzer Front!", "date": "2001-06-19", "grade": null}
