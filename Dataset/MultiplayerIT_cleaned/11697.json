The possibility for the most inveterate football fans to always carry their favorite team with them to train, follow and manage them when and where they want. This must have been the driving force that convinced SEGA and Sports Interactive of the goodness of the operation years ago, together obviously with the possibility of earning a lot of money, and to conceive this series for the Sony laptop. Handheld 2008, let's face it right away, the third chapter of the Football Manager series on PSP, is a sort of porting-title in itself for the same, revised and corrected, and let's add even reduced, of the almost homonymous FM2008 available on PC, and natural evolution of its predecessors always on the portable. In this case Sports Interactive had to reduce the contents of this edition to get as much material as possible into the UMD, thus focusing on the database and on the basic functions of a managerial, rather than on the graphics or sound sector, obviously quite sparse. But in the end this type of game does not contemplate too much attention to these last two aspects, and the result, as we will see, is not bad at all. It's time to play The structure of Football Manager Handheld 2008 is therefore the classic one of the series and of every product of the genre. Few frills and a lot of substance. At the beginning the player is asked to choose the championship where he wants to try his hand (33 in all) among those available in these ten countries: Australia, Belgium, Portugal, England, France, Germany, Spain, Holland, Scotland and Italy. Then it is possible to select the team you want to train without any limitation whatsoever, from the biggest for that tournament, for example Real or Barcelona in the case of La Liga, to the smallest, to lead to a peaceful salvation, such as Levante or Murcia , to always remain in the Spanish context. An interesting peculiarity of the title is the fact that whatever your choice, the problems inherent in the technical guidance of a club will inevitably come up during the season in relation to the objectives set and the men available. In detail, if you decide to coach Manchester United or Milan, you will hardly experience a serene tournament throughout the year, as much as if you choose other less prestigious teams. In the calmest moments when everything seems to be going well, you will have the problem of who to bench among the champions on the team, complete with grunts and long faces from the chosen ones, while in those when the results don't come, the pressure from the managers and of the public will gradually become more intense. It therefore becomes essential to maintain a certain balance between technical-tactical management and human relationships, taking care of the psychology of the men available in the staff. A cash prize, a renewal, a place in the first team in a key match at the right time can help keep the locker room united and calm the champions who often go on the bench, more than anything else (for example, it is possible to criticize or praise their players in public or in private to motivate them). And this serenity of the group should then lead to results on the field and consequently less pressure from fans and team owners. Management is everything Of course there are a thousand other factors that determine the success of a technician. Starting from the wise choice of tactics and strategies perhaps according to the men available. In this FMH 2008, among other things, the option has been implemented that allows you to customize the above in more detail, and then perhaps exchange them with friends via Wi-Fi. To then continue with the intelligent and careful observation of the men available. One of the novelties of the title lies in fact in the availability of a second team made up of reserves which tends to increase the number of players on the staff and therefore to vary the possibilities of choice and evaluation of the individuals. Not to mention that among them could be hidden the still immature talent on duty, to be weaned, which once discovered (in the squad or through scouts elsewhere and then hired) and launched could allow, in addition to winning more often, also to scrape together a nice pile of money from the sale of the oldest champion who occupied his role. Think, for example, of finding Messi or Dos Santos on duty: theoretically you could give in to a millionaire offer on Ronaldinho and sell him, having two offspring like the Argentine and the Mexican in your team... And the transfer market is another aspect important to the game. Here it is possible to practically do everything: snatch players with expiring contracts on a free transfer from other clubs with offerstempting, sometimes even fake, or outperform the competition on the Phenomenon of the moment by adding bonuses to his possible salary to attract him more. And still convincing your old stars like Maldini or Nedved not to retire and to play for another year or more, etc. In short, everything, absolutely everything that happens behind the scenes of the transfer market and the management of a team can be achieved in FMH2008. Sparse but with style Once you have made the various choices, you finally face the race. But there is little to say here. Everything happens in written form, there is no visual simulation of what happens in the field unfortunately. After having put together the best formation, juggling injuries, suspensions and precarious physical conditions, there is nothing left to do but read what is happening on the green rectangle and intervene accordingly to the ~reports~ that reach us in the ~written chronicle~ with module changes , men, strategies. However, the post game is not bad at all. You may find yourself against some cards and subsequent disqualifications and then appeal to the sports judge, or even harshly call a particularly listless player and fight back to the press. From an aesthetic point of view, as mentioned above, the title turns out to be rather poor in details, but on the other hand, the tinsel is not what matters in this kind of product. Graphically, the game interface appears pleasant, stylistically similar to some TV productions and very accessible. We have repeated several times in the course of this article audio has never been the strong point of managers, however here it has probably been exaggerated. It's okay not to take up space on the UMD with sound files, but at least one music track they could put on. During the long often navigating through the game menus, in fact, silence reigns supreme, interrupted only by the various clicks linked to pressing the pad keys after your choices.", "date": "2007-12-28", "grade": "8.0"}
