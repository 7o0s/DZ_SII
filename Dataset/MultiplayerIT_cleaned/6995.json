The reasons, we say it immediately, concern the excellent trait that characterizes the drawings and the presence of rather articulated mechanics that also reserve some small surprises. But before getting to the game dynamics, a premise is necessary. Why does a young damsel wander through a ghost town? The reason for the disturbing trip is the disappearance of his father who recklessly agreed to work as a caretaker on the estate of the Willows, the family that founded the aforementioned city. Obviously, something went wrong and Elena, the protagonist, immediately understands that that something has to do with disturbing spirit presences. Discovering Whispering Willows, a maze of mysteries, enigmas and disturbing presences Face to face with death The gameplay of Whispering Willows is based on the dual character mechanic which is a true classic in the field of puzzle-based graphic adventures. Using a magical medallion, Elena can summon her own astral projection which, thanks to its ectoplasmic nature, can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and help the protagonist in solving some puzzles. The medallion is also capable of revealing, by lighting up, the presence of ghosts and the evoked spirit, or the aforementioned astral projection, can interact with benevolent spirits who can provide us with clues and reveal information about the town's past. A past that includes our mentor, an enigmatic Indian spirit, and which gradually reveals itself leading us to explore intricate buildings full of stairs, rooms abandoned since time immemorial, stories to tell and collectibles to collect. In all of this, puzzles obviously play a fundamental role. It starts with simple keys to be combined with the right door to get to the classic labyrinths but the whole setting represents a big puzzle. In the absence of a map it is in fact necessary to remember where there are closed doors, levers and mechanisms that become reachable only after having performed a certain action. This, in essence, is the fulcrum of the game that reserves us, however, some surprises. In fact, it happens that we find ourselves in peculiar situations that we could almost define as action. Where evil spirits manifest themselves, it may happen that she has to flee and in some of these situations Elena's cautious walking automatically turns into a wild ride that allows her to escape from situations of imminent danger. During the escape, among other things, it happens that you have to quickly solve a puzzle and it is in these cases that the title gives its best with the tension accumulated in the exploration phase that explodes all of a sudden. In these cases the title almost comes close to fulfilling that horror promise heralded by the developers, although Whispering Willows never really scares. On the other hand, it is difficult to create the mechanisms of extreme tension with a two-dimensional setting perhaps made necessary by limited funds but unable to generate the fear that one would expect from a defined horror adventure. Yet the degree of involvement always remains high thanks to a decidedly rich plot that includes disturbing anecdotes, touching moments and some unexpected revelations capable of always keeping the desire to explore and overcome the puzzles high. Too bad that this desire is however destined to end soon due to an overall duration that is certainly not exciting. The puzzles themselves are short-lived and the experience can be completed in about three hours without too much effort although exploration can take longer especially if you don't have an iron memory and you're not that kind of old-fashioned gamer used to bring back the path on a little technological but always reliable sheet of paper. In any case, the duration does not affect the enjoyment of a narratively complete experience that boasts an appreciable artistic sector. The illustrations have character and various details emerge forcefully from the background, giving us suggestive rooms capable of giving further meaning to the puzzles that allow us to reach them. But the animations, however valid, are limited, the characters are static and the protagonist moves in a cast. Things, let's be clear, have improved considerably with the launch of the final version but there is the feeling that a few more frames in the animations could have given an extra touch of magic to everything. Fortunately, the play of light intervenes to compensate for these shortcomings, which are quite effective when the spThe rite we control turns into a will-o'-the-wisp to squeeze into tight spaces. And it is also thanks to these touches that the atmosphere, supported by a simple but spot-on soundtrack, is more than valid. Unfortunately, the speech that would have increased the involvement rate is missing, but the translation of the texts into Italian is not lacking and the experience always flows pleasantly, allowing the Night Light Interactive title to win a clear, albeit not striking, promotion.", "date": "2014-07-22", "grade": "7.0"}
