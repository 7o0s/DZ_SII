{"name": "The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-celebration-stuff-recensione.html", "text": "Orange flowers and balloons We have thus been able to take care of pets thanks to The Sims 2: Pets, we have seen and managed the normal seasonal cycle in The Sims 2: Seasons, we have discovered the attractions of the nightlife and we have tried our hand at the life of a university campus, respectively in Nightlife and University, also expansions of the original The Sims 2. But all this is not enough, because the life of our Simmini is also marked by the taste for creating the environment in which they live and the satisfaction of their social needs. That's why Maxis and EA have brought to our shelves, in addition to the aforementioned expansions, an additional package of themed objects and accessories. Specifically themed celebrations, including 60 objects in total, distributed in the three main categories: clothes, decorations and furniture. And what better celebrations than those that follow the celebration of a proper wedding? What is meant by ~properly~, of course, is up to you to decide, thanks to the addition of a series of objects, clothes and hairstyles designed and studied to let our happy couple of Sims live the best day of their lives. Vanity of vanity? We have all sorts of objects dedicated to the success of a wedding reception, from cakes to floral arches to arrange in the garden, wedding decorations and lamps, centerpieces and accessories of all kinds, as well as, of course, a series of wedding dresses (and groom, of course) that will allow us to experience the virtual wedding we prefer. Of course, however, there are not only weddings to think about, and our festive soul (and the relationship needs of our Simmini) will also be satisfied on much more worldly occasions, thanks to a series of accessories designed for the parties of the older ones such as of the little ones, among which we mention cakes, balloons, festoons, buffet tables, lanterns, grills and decorated chairs. The imagination, creativity and style of each user will be fully satisfied, thanks to the number of objects implemented by this add-on, which, however, must be underlined to be devoid of any modification to the gameplay. It is in fact a collection of objects, clothes and hairstyles with a celebratory theme. No new zones or new careers are added, the structure of the game remains, in short, completely unchanged. Not to be confused, therefore, with the real expansions, but to be considered a nice addition to our collection of themed objects that allows us to create more complete situations from an environmental and aesthetic point of view.

Comment There isn't much to say, in fact, about a title that doesn't represent a real novelty for the game mechanics, but which must be considered rather what it actually is: a collection of objects and accessories capable of enriching the library already existing of The Sims 2. Themed collection, which embraces everything festive and celebratory that can be contemplated in the game, but which frankly, at the price at which it is offered ( 19.90), can perhaps be considered something more for a passionate fan, but is easily ignored by those who consider themselves an ~average~ user. If, on the other hand, you want to have the complete collection of the series, this is certainly something not to be missed. Pros Can't resist wedding dresses Parties become ~more parties~ Cons No additions to careers or zones Items suffer from repetition An almost real life The sims are perhaps one of the most popular titles of recent years, their almost ~extreme~ simulation feature is well known to the general public and it is probably this feature that has decreed its success. Indeed, who would not succumb to the temptation of feeling ~God~ of a universe to be created at one's exclusive pleasure, modeling the characteristics of its inhabitants and the environment that surrounds them, while following in the footsteps of the world in which we live and of which we every possible imitation tool is provided. The key to the success of the Maxis masterpiece is in fact giving us the opportunity to create our virtual alter-egos and manage their lives by recreating situations and environments that we dream or desire or simply create charactersand plots that stimulate and satisfy our every narrative fantasy. To help us in this life simulation task, Maxis has always kept faith with the needs of its users, providing a series of expansions to the game that have gradually implemented new elements to the installed base.", "date": "2007-05-04", "grade": null}
