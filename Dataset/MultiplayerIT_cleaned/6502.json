{"name": "Il paradiso all'inferno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146508-assetto-corsa-il-paradiso-allinferno.html", "text": "Those who have followed the various evolutionary steps of Assetto Corsa with constancy and passion, since the debut of the spectacular ~Technology Preview~ in February 2013, have seen a product grow and mature before their very eyes which, thanks to the priceless emotions given behind the wheel and the seductive visual impact, has rightfully entered the Olympus of the best driving simulators, a superb work that we awarded a resounding 9.3 on our pages last November. The work of Kunos Simulazioni has made a significant leap forward in terms of quality and stability with the release of the Release Candidate, which was followed by the first real commercial version, freed from the fruitful Early Access program on Steam. Despite the deserved recognitions and the objectives achieved, as we specified in the review, Assetto Corsa was not yet a complete product in all its components, and the chisel work by the developers continued with the systematic release of patches and updates, which will continue in the future as well. Today's date, in this constant maturation process, represents a stage with a very special flavor, for two simple reasons: the first is the achievement of version 1.1, with a whole series of improvements that we will list in the next paragraphs; the second is the release of the first paid DLC, that famous ~Dream Pack~ which was discussed so much during the development of the title. The question we will try to answer is the following: is it worth spending around fifteen Euros (they were 10 in the pre-order phase) for ten cars and a new track? Assetto Corsa is enriched with 10 iconic cars and the legendary ~Green Inferno~ Four wheels to bring them all together If the so-called DLCs are so disliked and hated by users, it depends primarily on the greed of the big publishers, who, with at least inappropriate maneuvers, have damaged the relationship with their customers and above all their trust over the last few years. Downloadable content, however, fortunately doesn't always represent ~absolute evil~, as being able to extend the longevity and experience of a particularly welcome product, at the right price, can be an honest incentive to reopen the wallet. Players of the splendid Mario Kart for Wii U are well aware of this, just to cite one of the most recent and fitting examples. The first additional package for Assetto Corsa, since its announcement, has not escaped the meat grinder of the network, nevertheless, now that we know its specific cost and contents, we can already tell you, after testing it thoroughly, that it is worth the ticket price . First of all, those who are passionate about driving games, be they arcade or simulation-style, know well that car packages generally have higher costs than the average, not only due to the aforementioned desire to make money, but also because the licenses are rather expensive, and inevitably increase the selling price. In short, there's a big difference between including licensed Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches versus a set of clothes within a game. That said, it should be specified that Assetto Corsa is a pure simulation, a product with an extremely refined physical and dynamic model, whose algorithms replicate elements and characteristics peculiar to each vehicle present, which make it significantly different from the others. If in driving games, generally, there is a leveling of the physical model between cars of the same category, in simulators like iRacing, rFactor and Assetto Corsa itself, the situation changes completely, and for each model there is work behind it much longer and more complex development. The ~Dream Pack~, so called because it includes cars desired and voted for by the community of enthusiasts in a special survey, not only offers ten of the most fascinating models in the history of four wheels, but collects and translates their spirit into a digital version, giving emotions totally different - but equally fantastic - for each of them. The Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA (acronym for Gran Turismo Alleggerita), born in the 60s thanks to Autodelta and the intuitions of the engineer Carlo Chiti, is a car that absolutely needs no introduction, and its rendering, in Assetto Corsa , both for the fidelity of the polygonal model and for the behavior on the track, it is simply incomparable. Also from the house of the serpent, the wicked 1993 155 TI V6, a racing car born to participate in the old DTM championship, and the recent 4C, offer two polar opposite driving experiences: the first, with four-wheel drive and three differentials, is capable of unleashing impressive power thanks to the best technologies of the time, comparable in terms of solutions and materials to contemporary onesFormula 1; while the second enhances the pleasure behind the wheel through balance and lightness, with its four-cylinder engine in a central position, rear-wheel drive, a monocoque frame in carbon fiber and profusion of aluminum, which set the weight at around 900 kilograms. The Sauber C9, on the other hand, is a real monster, a Sport Prototype which, in addition to impressing with its crazy progression, amazes with the modularity of the Mercedes V8 (hearing it scream at maximum revs is a joy to the ears) and the yield of so-called ground effect, an engineering solution of fluid dynamics which, perfectly simulated in Assetto Corsa with special algorithms, makes the car behave like an inverted wing as it slices through the air. In the splendid and very expensive McLaren P1, probably the best polygonal model present in the Italian simulator, the hybrid system, KERS and DSR have been simulated in detail, terms and technologies well known to Formula 1 enthusiasts, and always of the prestigious British car manufacturer , the very fast F1 GTR also finds space in the Dream Pack, with its iconic driver's seat in a central position. Another car that needs no introduction is the legendary Mercedes 190E 2.5-16 Evo II, one of the most popular historic racing jewels of all, while the more recent Nissan GT-R Nismo 2014 GT3 and GM Corvette C7R GTE, with their own engineering solutions, officially introduce two new brands in Assetto Corsa and expand the offer of the most powerful and meanest GTs. The last car of the lot is the brand new BMW M235i, which for precision and sensitivity ranks among the best cars in the Italian simulator. Overall, these are ten cars which, for various reasons, significantly enrich the Assetto Corsa experience, where the technological solutions and new algorithms introduced will also benefit modders. The sound of the new engines is generally more incisive and effective (all cars will be updated in the future), while the polygonal models are simply sublime. We will deepen the discussion on the specifications of some of these cars in the Auto in Gioco section. Hellish curves The main reason why the Dream Pack was so eagerly awaited by enthusiasts, without detracting from the aforementioned ten splendid four-wheelers, is the new track included; not just any circuit, but the notorious ~Green Hell~ of three times Formula 1 world champion Sir Jackie Stewart, the very long 20-kilometre Nurburgring Nordschleife (north ring), which, in addition to being known as a testing ground par excellence, it was the scene of the very serious accident that occurred to Niki Lauda, which decreed his exclusion from the Formula 1 circus in 1976. Available in three variants, i.e. the classic Nordschleife configuration, Endurance, which also includes a portion of the Nurburgring GP (for a total of 25 kilometres), and Touristenfahrten, i.e. the one known by trackday enthusiasts complete with a reproduction of the ~parking lot~, the The track is present for the first time in a PC simulator with the support of the spectacular Laserscan technology, which replicates every slightest imperfection, roughness and inclination of the roadway. It was a huge job, which took two years of effort to complete, but the result achieved can only make the developers proud, given that it offers a simply memorable driving experience. Suffice it to say that the RSR Nurburg team, a company based on the circuit that educates drivers and organizes trackdays, has started using the digital version of the track present in Assetto Corsa to introduce its customers to the real experience. We are therefore faced with a real digital masterpiece, beautiful to look at but above all superb to drive: launch the Sauber C9 along the track at breakneck speed, trying to keep the steering wheel firmly in your hands, amidst the constant jolts caused by the irregularities of the 'asphalt, is an experience that any racing game lover should try. Changeable weather The launch of the first paid additional package, as specified in the introduction, accompanies the release of version 1.1 of Assetto Corsa, with a series of significant improvements made in various aspects. Among the most interesting introductions are the climatic conditions; no night and rain, but different degrees of cloudiness and fog with a tangible impact on the visual rendering of the tracks, on the color palette of the cars and even on the simulation component, given that they impact on the temperature of the asphalt and the relative response of the tyres. From a technical point of view, an improvement in performance is appreciable, which, after the jump ofquality accomplished with the Release Candidate, is now even more marked: with our test configuration, on the Nurburgring Nordschleife, with 24 cars on the track and at maximum detail, we manage to maintain 60 frames per second without uncertainties. Still from a technical point of view, some post-processing and lighting effects have been improved, with an even more enveloping and satisfying HDR: a pity about the problems related to the blur effect, which, especially when implemented at the highest levels and on slopes long, makes the image particularly unstable. Fortunately it is a completely superfluous effect for the enjoyment of the title, and pending a solution it can be easily disabled. The smoke has been remodulated so as not to affect performance, and various details have been added such as new light effects for the lights and internal instruments, as well as a tire pressure indicator. Among other things, we also find new visuals by pressing the F6 key, a series of spectacular shots that enhance the details of the cars, but above all the exceptional quality of the shaders used for the various fabrics and materials. The yield of mechanical and aesthetic damage is more incisive and balanced, and also the Artificial Intelligence is more realistic and competitive, although it should be emphasized that precisely on the Green Inferno, with the exception of some of its traits, the cars controlled by the CPU do not attempt the overtaking, keeping in most cases on the trajectory. It is an aspect on which Kunos Simulazioni is still working, as well as on several features loudly requested by the passionate community; among them we remember the false start, the pit stops in the single player mode, better management for the races in the online modes and a more efficient penalty / flag system (some new elements have also been included in 1.1), plus other details that we hope to see them soon introduced in the best videogame work produced in Italy today.", "date": "2015-03-11", "grade": null}
