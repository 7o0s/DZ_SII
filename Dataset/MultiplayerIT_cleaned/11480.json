Surely we are faced with a genre that has made great strides in recent years, tracing the history of what has been seen on home consoles in almost three decades. Evolution has been able to fly on the wings of technological progress, which has always been lightning-fast in the mobile sector, and has seen in a very short space of time the transition from completely two-dimensional titles to those with vector elements, to finally arrive at products such as Bimmer Street Racing 3D, which make polygonal graphics their strong point. Developed with the best arcade racers in mind, BSR3D offers us the possibility to try our hand at quick games (characterized by random values) or to start a career, which clearly represents the most substantial part of the game. We will start with the cheapest car and with the aim of dominating the illegal racing scene, to earn the money necessary to buy ever faster cars. As mentioned at the beginning, we will have a total of six cars available for six tracks, while what changes will be the type of race to be tackled from time to time. In addition to the pure speed of our vehicle, we will also have a nitro bar available, very important when there is a need to regain ground on the opponents: it can be activated by pressing a button, it will provide us with searing acceleration, to be used only when the route allows. In this regard, Bimmer Street Racing 3D adopts a strongly arcade approach, in the sense that it will be possible to tackle the curves at high speed if you manage to cut them in the best way. The vehicle is controlled using the joystick or the corresponding number keys, and it's really a pity that the developers did not include the possibility of activating automatic acceleration: if your terminal does not have a convenient and versatile input system, this feature of the game will completely ruin your experience, making every cumbersome maneuver and every turn a nightmare. It is interesting to note that even reverse gear has not been engaged: once pinned against a wall, we will simply have to accelerate and swerve to free ourselves and continue... The game graphics are fully polygonal. The cars are very well made, with a good level of detail, an excellent use of colors and an above average fluidity in terms of movements, in this case the inclination of the vehicle to the right or to the left. The graphics engine is powerful enough to also offer us rotating shots, and the track flows really fast, but the approach to the curves unfortunately appears ~woody~ and abrupt. The sides of the road are bordered by barriers, so it's impossible to get out of them, and the buildings in the background are quite well done, but they always appear suddenly, showing off a terrible pop-up effect. As for the sound, we have some really beautiful music, reminiscent of some productions dating back to the Commodore era. The control system, as anticipated, unfortunately does not have an option for automatic acceleration, therefore the quality of the gaming experience strongly depends on the input devices our mobile phone is equipped with. PRO Smooth and fast graphics Six cars, six tracks Catchy music AGAINST Continuous pop-up effects The track design leaves something to be desired", "date": "2008-04-16", "grade": "S.V."}
