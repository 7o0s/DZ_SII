{"name": "Inside: la recensione per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/inside-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Inside represents in many ways the evolution of a vision that Playdead had introduced with the surprising Limbo, eight years ago. Like the team's debut title, this too is a two-dimensional platform (although the graphics easily space in three dimensions) with particularly dark tones, embellished by a hermetic narration and an almost perfect direction for times and ways, capable of create an amazing atmosphere as you go into the adventure. At the command of a boy who, no one knows why, feels the need to enter a huge structure, our task will be to avoid the patrol of the guards, hide where necessary, perform certain maneuvers with the right timing and arrive, at the end of a journey that doesn't last more than three and a half hours, to reveal a dark mystery. Gameplay: alone in the dark The control system of Inside is extremely immediate, with a button to jump and one to interact with the scenario: a layout that also fits perfectly with the use on Nintendo Switch, both in portable and docked mode, in the latter case with the ability to adjust the brightness of the screen to avoid moments of total darkness. The various sequences alternate different situations, which make up the picture of a sort of game design exercise and once again confirm the incredible qualities of the Danish studio, which we hope to soon see grappling with a more substantial project, perhaps with a budget adequate to the their ambitions. In the first phase we focus on the movement of the young protagonist, who crosses the woods at night avoiding the lights of the torches of dangerous recovery teams, and who in case of capture will kill him without too many worries, immediately revealing a substratum of violence and cruelty visuals that didn't seem to be part of the game's DNA at first. One immediately gets the sensation of being in a dystopian scenario, or at least in a place where there is totalitarian control over people, apparently used to conduct disturbing experiments, which transform them into a sort of zombie with no will and therefore willing to work tirelessly, following any indication given to him. But there is something more, and the boy we take on the role of seems to know it, in his heart: penetrated inside the huge structure that represents the fulcrum of the scenario, we will be able to use devices that allow you to control the ~ manpower~ above, playing with directions, barriers and platforms to compose a sequence of increasingly multifaceted and interesting puzzles, but never really difficult. The trial & error formula that characterized the Limbo experience is reaffirmed in Inside, but it often happens that you understand right away what you need to do to continue, and so the bulk of the adventure flows away without particular dead times, carrying out its communicative task. It therefore happens that you also have to deal with completely submerged areas, to be explored on board a fascinating underwater vehicle, and in this situation it is necessary to calculate well the times of crossings to be completed strictly by swimming, chased by dangerous marine mutants. Until we reach a final part that is surprising to say the least, of which we obviously don't want to reveal anything, but which will not fail to impress you and leave a mark. Technical realization: the atmosphere above all It is certainly correct to say that the bulk of the charm of Inside lies in the incredible situations it manages to create in each of the settings that we will find ourselves exploring; strong atmospheres of the precious support provided by an extraordinary sound design, which takes advantage of the essentiality of the sounds to emphasize their importance, in some cases mixing the music and the in-game action so as to provide us with a foothold where necessary. However, the Playdead guys have done a job of great precision and care also from the point of view of the graphics, and this can be seen not only in the solidity of the moving sequences, in the goodness of the animations and in the general style, but also in the attention given to the details. There is probably not a single aspect of the game passed on the sly, which has not been the subject of a separate and in-depth analysis, aimed at offering the best possible result, which is precisely what the authors have managed to obtain. The Nintendo Switch version of the game appears practically identical to the others, without any problems or drops in performance, although the graphically more demanding sections, in the final part of the campaign, we found ourselves playing only in docked mode. Portability remains an extra big in any caseinterest, even more so when applied to an experience that runs out in a fairly short time and lends itself even a minimum to being replayed, clearly without the involvement and surprises reserved for the first lap.", "date": "2018-07-09", "grade": "8.5"}
