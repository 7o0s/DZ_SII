{"name": "Knighthood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knighthood-la-recensione.html", "text": "After almost two years in soft-launch, King's fantasy RPG arrives in definitive form and we are therefore faced with the Knighthood review, which explains that the expectations for the game were largely well placed. First of all there is a premise: it is another free-to-play mobile RPG with microtransactions and elements that can be traced back to the gacha mechanics, moreover developed by a mobile gaming giant with easy monetization like King . Knowing a little about the environment and the genre in question, we have to be super suspicious about this game, and it is therefore with great surprise that we discover how Knighthood works very well and can attract even those who can no longer even hear the smell of mobile RPGs of this type. This is because, in fact, it is a game that as a whole can be considered decidedly different from the standard of RPGs seen on smartphones these days, demonstrating a remarkable study carried out on game design and on the progressive mechanics that push us to bind us to this type of gameplay. In the role of a new Rage Knight, or Knight of Fury, we are directed towards the art of combat by a veteran warrior who launches us into the great adventure of saving the known world from the threat of a dark power, which has corrupted even great knights a valiant time. There isn't much room for story in Knighthood, because it's basically about advancing from battle to battle, opening new paths on the map and reaching other locations, all inserted in a constant progression that is reflected in the increase in experience levels, prestige and power of weapons and armor and in the rarity and power of allied heroes we can field at our side. However, this insistence on combat, loot and stat-raising works, because it is inserted into a game structure that is mechanical but not too mechanistic, also leaving room for the player and his choices in the combat system and in the management of the personages. There is a moment where you find yourself hitting the wall of microtransactions, in particular due to the stamina which in the long run becomes a problem when the missions begin to require a lot of energy points, but if you manage to dose the matches and don't get too caught up in the PvP competition, you can play the game without the hassle of additional payments. The first thing that strikes you in Knighthood is its graphic characterization, with an extremely clean and coherent pseudo low-poly style, which somehow recalls Ashen, even if here everything is much more detailed and above all equipped with an almost humorous vein in the cartoon stylization. However, it is clear that the production value is considerable, for a game in which King wanted to invest in an important way. We are well above the average standard of mobile productions, in terms of artistic direction and stylistic coherence, elements that only increase the appeal of this title. The flip side of the coin, with a technical realization of this caliber, is the fact that smartphones tend to go under strain, heating up and consuming the battery considerably. The hard life of the raging knight Knighthood takes place mainly on a map divided into different areas, which can be explored through paths dotted with points of interest: usually these are combat zones but in some cases you have to deal with villages where you can get supplies and buy weapons and armor or meet NPCs who give us side quests. We're not wrong: the game always and in any case requires us to deal with clashes that always take place in the same way, even with opponents that present numerous variations, but the requests that are made to us manage to make the action a bit varied. There are for example the hunting areas, in which we can obtain numerous special materials to enhance the equipment, or special requests can emerge with the need to knock down particular enemies that infest some areas in the various territories. Whatever the pretext, the gameplay is still based on combat, which follows a very specific structure: within different scenarios we find ourselves fighting teams of enemies made up of various types of creatures, each requiring a particular approach in terms of weapons and skills to use. A Knight of Fury, which is the protagonist of the game, is distinguished by the use of a special glove that is added to the standard equipment, with which it is possible to attack enemies directly like a weapon but above all to summon the support of two heroes which act as actual eelements of the party, fighting alongside us with their weapons and special abilities, which can have specific advantages over certain types of enemies. These heroes animate the gacha element of Knighthood, since their unlocking depends on the conquest of certain crystals that are found as loot, linked in particular to the opening of chests that can also be purchased through gems, or the in-game currency . The specific characteristics of the various characters and the possibility of having many different skills to choose from, starting from the pool of unlocked heroes, make this summoning system interesting, which to tell the truth doesn't even seem too focused on pay to win, given that the drop rate of the crystals is low but also balanced, at least in the first phase of the game. On the battlefield we have to face three progressive waves of enemies of increasing difficulty and in some cases with a real boss at the end. The combat system is simplified as befits a mobile RPG but still requires a minimal strategic approach: it's about touching the enemy to attack with the classic weapon (there are a large number and different types to buy or find in the loot ) or with the gauntlet, or make the heroes attack by touching the corresponding icon, which loads as the battle progresses and requires a certain cooldown period after use. By charging the Fury bar it is then possible to launch a special attack with the support of one of the two heroes at our side, with different effects based on the characteristics of the latter. The depth of the system derives from a certain strategic approach to battle: it is in fact necessary to choose the right heroes with the specific skills that have the greatest effect against certain types of enemies, as well as the most suitable equipment for each fight. For this reason, before each fight you access a preparation screen in which the types of enemies we will face are indicated and we therefore have the possibility to modify weapons, armor and support heroes in order to have the best chance of success. the action it is also possible to try the multiplayer PvP inside the arena, where it is possible to take part in clashes on average much more demanding than the standard ones, having to face a knight with heroes in tow and support monsters. This mode also introduces a further mechanic linked to the capture and training of monsters which deepens the gameplay even more, even if this is obviously the privileged field for unleashing the pay to win effect, unfortunately.", "date": "2020-03-04", "grade": "7.5"}
