Anyone who remembers this work by David Cage and has been lucky enough to play it in the past knows exactly what to expect from the new video game. The similarities are very strong in the way of telling the story; in the management and subdivision of the narrative arc through multiple characters whose lives will inevitably tend to intertwine; in basing most of the gameplay mechanics on the use of quick time events. Even that idea of placing the player in front of an enormous number of choices that will have consequences on the characters, sometimes even fatal and dramatic, until determining a precise epilogue within a spectrum of multiple endings, is present here intact. In short, Quantic Dream's desire to move away strongly from the action and perhaps even more linear drift of Beyond: Two Souls, which to date represents the negative peak touched by Cage's software house, is clearly evident from the first minutes of the game. Or at least the most anomalous product and far from the stylistic features of his second life as a developer, the one in which interactive adventures have taken the place of the more structured and profound gameplay of the Omikron and Fahrenheit era. It is therefore essential to approach Detroit: Become Human having in mind what is about to start on your PlayStation 4 and above all contextualizing it to the current market situation which is extremely different from the one present at the time of Heavy Rain, eight years ago. At that time indies were in their infancy, walking simulators and more generally titles with a very strong inclination towards narrative were not yet an integral part of the digital offer of the various stores, and the rebirth of graphic adventures by Telltale Games was just started. Today those who want to enjoy a good story, not worrying too much about the controls and commands, have numerous alternatives, even at very low cost, and it is with this mindset that we have begun to mature our judgment on Detroit: Become Human. Every hero has a tail Let's start right from the narrative plot of the game, undoubtedly its determining and most characterizing element. Carefully avoiding any spoiler risk. Detroit: Become Human is set in the relatively immediate future. We are in 2038 and the populous American city in the state of Michigan, after having contributed in a decisive way to the diffusion of cars, is now experiencing a new youth returning to being the center of economic and technological progress thanks to Cyberlife, a company which in just a few years it has managed to become the largest in the world in terms of turnover, breaking all previous records. The reason for the success is very simple: it is the only one who has succeeded in inventing, patenting and bringing androids to market. Human-like machines, with an artificial intelligence far superior to man and capable of carrying out any task, from low-skilled workers to concept jobs, respecting and carrying out the orders of the owners. The advent of androids has naturally upset the Earth's economy from its foundations with very serious repercussions on employment and more generally on the idea of welfare state, urbanization of cities and the evolution of technology tout court. Androids are an integral part of society, they are indeed at the service of man but they also generate a dangerous love-hate relationship with humanity. Starting from this very fragile situation of forced coexistence, Detroit finds itself narrating the story of three distinct robots created with different specific uses and whose existences will intertwine over the course of the week in which the game's events take place. Markus is an android in the service of a wealthy artist with frail health: a sort of personal assistant who helps him carry out his biological functions but also to live a comfortable and comfortable life. Kara is the technological version of the nanny with maid duties who will find herself, against her will, involved in a dramatic family situation. Finally there is Connor, the most technologically advanced, a prototype built by Cyberlife to help the police with the most complex cases, those that require the intervention of a detective. The narrative will be set in motion by an increasing number of situations and events that seem to highlight an awareness by a small (but constantly increasing) group of androids who have managed to overcome the limits imposed by their programming to free themselves from the control human and earningscreate a precise identity. These robots are becoming sentient beings capable of thinking for themselves and even capable of feeling emotions. They are the deviants: the very ones Connor will have to hunt down. The entire narrative force of Detroit is based on this idea of machines becoming human, and of humans who are more ruthless than machines, on the fascinating concept of integration, slavery and exploitation. to break free from the clichs of genre fiction. Compared to a Heavy Rain which in its simplicity of a thriller anchored to more ~normal~ and everyday events still managed to offer very original ideas, Become Human constantly feels like it has already been seen. It is never easy to innovate in the field of science fiction and, especially when it comes to touching the concepts of artificial intelligences that humanize themselves and robots, androids, replicants, that mix with humans, it takes a moment to appear obvious. Let it be clear that there are some twists (albeit, unfortunately, very phoned) and at least a handful of very touching and interesting situations thanks to the way in which David Cage deals with them with his writing, but the fact remains of a story that it never seems to stray from the confines of an already enormously abused genre between books, films and TV series, even very recent ones. Press one, two, three buttons at the same time Taking up and evolving what was seen in Heavy Rain, also in Detroit: Become Human the game proceeds through a very cinematic cut scene structure that the player can ~alter~ according to the decisions made and the actions carried out. We tend to always have an incipit or an entry point which may depend on what was done in one of the previous scenes, then there is the development of the actual level with all its load of causes and effects and finally an epilogue which in turn it may have repercussions on what we encounter next. Compared to any Telltale title, here the consequences are much more palpable and do not only concern the dialogue options selected within the time limit but above all include the physical actions that we will be called to carry out constantly and which, in the most agitated moments, can also have fatal consequences on the three protagonists or on the numerous secondary characters that we will meet during the adventure. Precisely with regard to the numerous crossroads that we will face on our way, there are two elements concerning the structure of the game that we must absolutely mention. First of all Detroit: Become Human offers a selectable level of difficulty both at the beginning and during the game and which allows you to tackle the adventure even in a very simple mode where the most frenetic quick time events, basically those involving fights or pursuits are eliminated or greatly reduced in their complexity. Secondly, upon completion of each scene we will be able to observe a sort of map-diagram containing all the potential choices of that scenario, with the various crossroads and their outcomes. The system is designed with the aim of stimulating replayability given that it will only be possible to read in detail the actions that we have actually carried out, while all the others will be ~blocked~ and hidden behind simple ellipsis. In our review phase, it took us about fifteen hours to complete Detroit: Become Human by revisiting a handful of the more than 30 chapters that make up the story and trying to see at least three different epilogues. Also keep in mind that the title does not in any way allow you to skip dialogues and cutscenes, often forcing you to tedious deja-vu of even very repetitive situations. And we come right to discuss these quick time events, the proverbial cross and delight. In Detroit we can find the entire compilation of what has already been encountered in Heavy Rain: buttons to be pressed at the right moment during the most agitated situations, or to be held down for a long time in increasingly complex combinations to simulate situations of stress or fatigue; any type of rotation of the analogs to interact with handles, gears, locks. There is even the use of the sixaxis gyroscope for a handful of physical interactions such as the ability to jump and the PlayStation 4 Dualshock touchpad which becomes the surface to touch for some more ~artistic~ activities such as playing a piano or drawing graffiti . It is really complex to positively judge Quantic Dream's decision not to move a millimeter from the most criticized element of the previous titles and we cannot hide the feeling of repetitiveness and sometimes evenof anachronism, which one feels at the twentieth door to open or at the convulsive movement to be made with the pad to disassemble a bio-component from an android. But on the other hand it is now clear that for David Cage this is the only existing way to tell a good story with a very marked cinematic cut: the player is asked to intervene but always and only with basic commands and carried out with the right timing. Obviously, in addition to the QTEs, there is always the possibility of moving freely within the various scenarios, all of which are quite small in size and designed to keep the player within small interactive enclosures. Furthermore, in Connor's case, we will also have access to a handful of investigative sections where we will have to analyze the crime scenes, highlight the clues, analyze them one by one and in this way reconstruct what actually happened so that we can possibly find the culprit and maybe even catch him. It is a variation of the gameplay which, despite possessing an evident basic simplicity and linearity, can be very tantalizing and at times even quite satisfactory given that the results of an investigation carried out in an exemplary way always have significant repercussions on the crossroads unlocked by the player. Technology will bury us The evaluative dualism that permeates our review also has some repercussions on the technical front. Detroit: Become Human has a simply exceptional graphic detail and above all an artistic design. It is obvious that creating such closed scenarios in terms of exploration possibilities while offering an experience that, although full of crossroads and choices, is particularly linear, helps to push the rendering quality upwards. However, we must also recognize that the work done on the facial modeling of the characters and their expressiveness has really convinced us, especially as regards the three protagonists and a handful of secondary characters who really stand out even in comparison to other very noble recent productions. At the same time however, these same characters are less credible in their physicality due to excessively woody animations and above all due to a ~robotic~ effect of the movements which gives a ~dummy~ feeling. The game environments are largely splendid and populated by numerous details even if the interaction with them is reduced. We went through the entire experience of Detroit: Become Human on PlayStation 4 Pro and, despite the lack of graphics options to set, for example, the precedence of resolution over frame rate, the title has always remained very fluid and seemed well anchored to us at 30 frames per second. Unfortunately we are unable to evaluate whether the resolution is in native 4k but the visual impact, HDR included, is absolutely pleasant. On the other hand, we were not completely convinced by the management of the camera which too often conflicts with the command necessary to open various doors and wardrobes. Since the latter is relegated to the right analog, the same one used to move the shot, it will happen many times to turn the camera instead of starting the opening animation of the furniture or, on the contrary, you will find yourself interrupting an animation just started because you were actually trying to move the camera. In a couple of excited situations the effect has generated a healthy dose of frustration. The soundtrack is absolutely excellent with very pleasant accompanying songs that make extensive use of strings capable of restoring a certain sci-fi feeling to Inception, Blade Runner and Interstellar combined with more delicate and relaxing guitar and piano musical carpets. Our judgment towards the Italian dubbing is less positive due to some problems with the mixing of the audio volumes which sometimes make the words spoken by the characters unclear and above all due to the choice of some actors who are very little in the part. For information, Detroit allows you to set the dubbing language separately from that of the subtitles and, for example, it will be possible to play it with the audio in English and the texts in Italian. For once, by the way, it is also possible to set the size of the subtitles.", "date": "2018-05-24", "grade": "8.0"}
