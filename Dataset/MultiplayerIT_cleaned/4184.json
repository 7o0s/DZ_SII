{"name": "Westworld", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/westworld-la-recensione-del-gioco-mobile-201700.html", "text": "With the conclusion of the second television series, Westworld must now build on the notoriety waiting for the third series to start, and what better way than the release of an official video game? There is a kind of strange unwritten rule that seems to impose the strategy option as a convenient and cheap solution to build a tie-in on some famous series, we have seen it applied to various situations in the past including animated productions by Matt Groening, but in this case the choice fits perfectly: making Westworld a strategic-managerial one is in fact perfectly in line with the original concept of the show, net of all the philosophical-sociological implications that emerge from this. Obviously it could only be a free-to-play, but the need for micro-transactions is not urgent, as long as you have a certain patience and a tendency to appreciate the continuous need to ~level~ even through the obsessive repetition of the same actions . In a word: it can easily become the grinding party. Going to the heart of the matter, the fact of allowing players to directly manage the Westworld park is a good idea, able to excite fans of the show but also guaranteeing a good playful base for those who are less interested in multimedia references, with a structured and quite deep product while remaining obviously simple in the technical realization. Lately, the game in question has come under the spotlight for an uneditable reason: its similarity to Fallout Shelter led Bethesda to sue Warner Bros. for alleged copyright infringements, considering that the developers Behavior are the same for both titles and which, according to the publisher, would have reused technologies and assets from the Fallout spin-off for the new title. The resemblance is indeed evident, but it also falls within a certain canon that is emerging for titles of this type and in any case the strong characterization given by the setting and characters of the television series is able to give a precise identity to Westworld, to the clearly derivative elements in the framing used and in the general layout. Westworld in the palm of your hand The cartoonish style chosen to represent the world of Westworld is particularly apt in a game which, in one way or another, constitutes a sort of simplification of the ideas conveyed by the show, where management of the park becomes a continuous mechanical reproduction of gestures and decisions to be made as if you were inside a gigantic control room. However, the reduction to a small size of all the nuances of the complex system set up by the Delos company, in the series, to keep that wonderful playground that is Westworld going forward is remarkable. Furthermore, there are some references to the meta-game in this case as well, as if to demonstrate that a certain depth from the HBO series has however also leaked into this adaptation. There are many elements to keep under control: the main action, i.e. the ~narration~ of the park, takes place on the surface, where it is possible to build and evolve various buildings and areas that open up different situations for visitors and androids, while underground the various sections of the Delos branch off, these too to be built and developed with the investment of funds to open up new construction and guest management possibilities. The basic element of progression is the interaction between visitor and android: each visitor has particular desires and inclinations and requires an android who is specialized in a particular activity, with the need also to make him level up in order to be able to always meet requests more selective than guests. This opens the door to grinding, which is present in considerable quantities within the game and mixes, as usual, with the frequent breaks that the system imposes every time the androids are engaged in some activity, except for the possibility of compressing these times with access to micro-transactions. It is rather strange to note how the game practically immediately puts us in front of both questions, with the need to make the androids evolve soon and the request to wait that comes from the beginning, indeed in a particularly pressing way when you find yourself in still have a few androids to manage. If nothing else, Westworld immediately makes it clear what it's made of and honestly doesn't hide its flaws that much, which are still avoidable by the most patient players and who don't disdain practically continuous grinding. As the game progresses, new thematic areas open up in the park on the surface and new rooms to add to the Delos nel so basettosoolo, exponentially increasing the facets between new androids, new specializations of these and further management possibilities given by the characteristics of the various sections of the base, which can range from the recalibration of the androids to more properly narrative elements.", "date": "2018-06-28", "grade": "7.8"}
