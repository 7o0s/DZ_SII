{"name": "Lumines Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-lumines-remastered.html", "text": "If for fun we tried to draw up a list of titles potentially suitable for adapting without major problems to any era, it would be quite natural to also include Lumines: Puzzle Fusion in this list. Born to celebrate great classics of the past such as Tetris and Columns, the colorful puzzle game born from the mind of Tetsuya Mizuguchi was one of the first titles to appear on a very young and still unexplored PSP. The first chapter was in fact published for the first time in December 2004, to then be included in the European launch line-up of the Sony portable, where it debuted on September 1, 2005. Lumines: Puzzle Fusion clearly winked at a very specific way of understanding the video game, a legacy of the arcade experiences that accompanied anyone who approached the medium between the 80s and early 90s. After delighting players with Rez's synesthesia and creating the acclaimed Space Channel 5 musical experience on the Dreamcast, Mizuguchi set out to combine the classic puzzle game structure of yesteryear with a successful soundtrack with electronic sounds, shaping a sort of ~21st century interactive Walkman~, as he liked to call him to those who asked him for a classification of his idea. This is because Lumines, despite having a very empirical and immediate play structure, was also able to create a successful marriage between gameplay and music, adapting its sounds to the movements of the blocks and the combos implemented by the player during the game. It was a success from a qualitative point of view, less from that of sales, despite the fact that over the years new chapters have periodically appeared here and there on platforms such as Xbox 360, PS3, PlayStation Vita, but also iOS and Android. And now? Well, now it's time to gleefully roll back with Lumines Remastered. Schematic gameplay In case you've never had the opportunity to try it so far, Lumines can be considered a rhythm puzzle title. From a gameplay point of view, it has clear similarities with Tetris, since you have to chain a series of blocks divided into four sections on a horizontal grid, making them go down and sorting them according to their color. Unlike the latter, however, the bricks all have a square shape and can be rotated 360 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise to create combinations of the same color which will then be eliminated after forming groups of at least four mini blocks. Creating combos, with which to increase your score, is just as simple and intuitive. The time indicator that crosses the screen clears the blocks already associated previously, therefore the more combinations you manage to chain with each new passage, the higher the score multiplier will be. In short, Lumines is an immediate title and within everyone's reach, nevertheless it is able to satisfy even anyone who loves to test reflexes and reasoning by mixing gameplay, colors and sounds. As we have said, this last variable is precisely the main characteristic feature of the game. The electronic tones of the original musical tracks, created for the occasion by Shinichi Osawa - known as Mondo Grosso - and by other Japanese artists such as Eri Nobuchika, blend perfectly with the playful part, giving a personalized and defined aspect to each level and marking also the pace and speed of each session. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of thirty Lumines Remastered Trophies, divided into nine bronze, fifteen silver, five gold and platinum. Game modes for all tastes Lumines Remastered keeps the game modes of the original edition unchanged, however introducing the Missions section that we had the opportunity to experience for the first time in Lumines II. The Challenge, divided between the normal format and the endless one to be unlocked, continues to be the highlight of the offer, provided you have time for medium / long sessions. When the clock closes, you can fall back on timed sessions, which in a maximum limit of 60, 180 or 300 seconds require you to link together as many blocks of the same tone as possible. The 600-second variant was also available in the original version, but this time it has not been revived. The Puzzle mode is of a completely different nature, in which it is essential to sharpen the view to create increasingly complex figures using the various combinations of bricks. The 1-on-1 Clash modes against the CPU or a friend close the picture. In this case the screen is divided and the one who is fastest to make combos and high scores wins, forcing theIn this way the opponent to withdraw more and more his field of action on the grid of play. In short, overall Lumines Remastered still does its good job of keeping players glued to the game and persuading them to invest extra time to try to solve that particular puzzle or to try to improve that record that just doesn't want to be archived. Except for the obvious improvements to the menus and graphics, the only real innovation introduced is to be found in the so-called ~Trance Vibration~, an unprecedented feature which rewards the already vaunted sensoriality, leitmotif and distinctive trait of the works created by Mizuguchi. By selecting the appropriate item from the settings menu, it is in fact possible to configure your controller in order to perceive the rotation, the positioning of the blocks on the grid and the vibrations marked by the background music. What's more, this option can be activated on four different controllers at the same time and then be able to put them in your pocket and feel the sound vibrations on your body. An undoubtedly less cumbersome operation for those who can use the Joy-Con on Nintendo Switch.", "date": "2018-07-19", "grade": "8.0"}
