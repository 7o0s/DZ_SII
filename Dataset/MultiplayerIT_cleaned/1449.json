{"name": "Nba Live 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-2012.html", "text": "live in 2004 Once you enter the game, you start with the usual roundup of options and playful modes, as always in the very complete EA tradition. To practice the speed of play and the control system, it is advisable to rely on the classic friendly and training, while if you aim for a greater depth of play, it is possible to devote yourself to a more demanding season mode, which includes the entire NBA season. The Dynasty mode is also very interesting, which allows us to manage our team, training it and improving the basic characteristics of the players. Unfortunately, the result is that there are too many limitations, and perhaps what could have been the most welcome section is missing: the online one, present in the American version and inexplicably left out in the European edition. In any case, having made our choice, we can start playing and we immediately notice, compared to the last edition, the decreased speed, although perhaps still necessary for tweaks, as well as some changes to the control system. The most obvious one is the introduction of two different types of shots, which add a certain variety to the action: in fact, the effects will change according to the area of the field where we are. The notorious Free-style mode, which allowed us to trick the opposing player with light-speed feints and beyond, has been significantly reduced, in order to favor team play and less personal play, while not missing the usual ultra-move which allows too many times to overcome the opponent without too many problems. Fortunately, the programmers, at the higher difficulty levels, have raised the difficulty considerably, thus making the encounters very similar to real ones, where indecision or solitary action can cost a lot. Unfortunately the substance of the title does not change, that is a fast and frenetic arcade, and it can be frustrating to see the CPU coordinate strategies that are not within the player's reach, simply due to the frenetic pace. From this point of view, longevity is affected a lot, and can only be said to be positive in the classic multiplayer mode. If you're in the game, you're (not) in NBA Live After the exhausting wait of almost eternal uploads, it's finally time for the action. The rigorously two-dimensional audience witnesses the players enter the scene, with a credible appearance, at least as regards the most important, but neurotic players, accelerated due to the lack of animation frames, and which are so decidedly unrealistic in their movements . The illusion of watching a real game is however undoubtedly increased by feints, skilful interceptions by the defenders, prodigious dunks, all however always recreated with gun cotton, with a strange frenetic vein. During the replays and in the closest shots it is possible to see the first defects, located above all in an approximate representation of the poorly sponsored players, while positively one can admire the definition of the polygonal models, the goodness of the textures, the well squared field and the dimensions realistic, the thousands of details and touches of class of the different visuals, spectacular but not very functional for a complete control of the team. And it is precisely here that the electronic arts philosophy comes into play: the maximum emphasis for the minimum playful feedback. The different shots are practically television, but the portion of the field seen is not acceptable for setting up a game strategy, provided that this is possible due to the defects listed in the playability. The sound, at least, can be said in its favor that it is not that distracting. The effects are at least laughable, just mentioned and synthetic, while the spectators are not that warm. The various jingles, in the end, are the only thing that tries to revive a bleak audio picture a bit, even if it supports the most sophisticated sound sources. Comment It was difficult to expect significant innovations after an episode curated as Nba Live 2003, and in fact EA does not deny itself by simply updating the previous edition, with limited improvements to the gameplay and above all to the technical aspect. In fact, the animations and expressive features of the players have been improved, despite not reaching the completeness of 2k, and the slowdowns have been almost completely eliminated. The improvements in the actual game have been focused on the free-style, perhaps clumsily retouched, and on the introduction of new defensive and offensive moves, designed to increase a realism that is not always found on the playing field, despite the tendency to give up to the arcade speed of live 2003 by lowering the speed of the action. Longevity is finally tenderdifferent modes, where, however, the online game present in the American version is missing. Ultimately a good contender for Sega's basketball simulation, still the undisputed ruler by virtue of a greater depth of play and a significantly superior technical realization. Pros: Fast-paced gameplay Different modes available Cons: Unrealistic at times Lacks online play option Freestyle control system could be improved 6 Introducing a review of one of the EA sports series without highlighting the clichs of the famous software house is a decidedly difficult undertaking. In fact, every year, punctual like a Swiss watch and like the latest advertisement for a mobile phone, we are constantly inundated with a bizarre series of titles in which usually the perfect symmetry with the previous chapter is the fundamental epicenter of the work. This time, however, we feel like throwing a small spear in favor of these infinite re-propositions, stating that the penultimate nba live (2003 version) has proved to be an excellent title by EA standards, raising the prices of a saga that in the first incarnations for the new console was found to be lacking in several parts, even as regards the technical realization and with the usual approximation of playability. The base of use was the Arcade spirit: speed and frenetic game like Nba Jam, counterpointed by the new freestyle control system that worked very well. In terms of quality, however, they were still far from the magical balance achieved by Sega with the epic ride of Nba 2k, the greatest basketball simulation from the glories of total Nba. Also this year therefore, the challenge is renewed, between Japan and America, between arcade component and pseudo simulation, between two historical houses such as Sega and Ea.
