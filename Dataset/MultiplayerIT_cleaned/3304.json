{"name": "Monster Hunter World: Iceborne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-recensione-versione-pc.html", "text": "Monster Hunter: World, of which you read the PC review, is part of a series that has always been a productive pillar of Capcom, capable of dragging the software house even during its most difficult years, and of placing millions of copies practically without difficulty at each release. However, the diffusion of the brand achieved thanks to World is still higher than any expectation: this revision calculated around home consoles has been able to make the experience more accessible without distorting it, convincing millions of new players to devote themselves to hunting. A stroke of genius, partly helped by the market situation, but no less worthy of praise; with World the Monster Hunters were reborn, and the arrival of the excellent Iceborne has only consolidated their position in the imagination of gamers, ensuring Capcom an amazing starting point for the next generation. The success of the game, however, is not over yet, because after a long wait, even PC players can finally get their hands on this ~glacial~ and very juicy expansion. We obviously didn't miss the opportunity to analyze it, trying to understand the technical validity of the port and to what extent the PC ecosystem is actually able to improve everything in a detailed review. Don't worry, we have almost nothing but good news for you. Hammer master We have already reviewed Iceborne in the past, and therefore there is no need for huge explanations related to the contents; a dusting off, however, is always welcome, also because on PC you will find the exact same missions awaiting you as the game at the console launch, with some not negligible differences linked to the endgame - which we had already had to dissect later with a special at the time, because of the usual NDAs. At the base, however, Iceborne is nothing more than a modern ~Monster Hunter Ultimate / G~, or a modernized revival of the G Rank hunts - significantly more difficult than those of the original title - renamed Master Rank for the occasion. Waiting for you during its long campaign you will therefore find all the World monsters with slightly modified patterns (usually they have additional moves, or atypical behaviors that make them less vulnerable), and a long list of new entries, many of which come from past chapters. In short, a good mass of content, the only lack of which (at least for veterans of the series) is the quite negligible number of completely new monsters. Of course, most of the returns are very iconic, and the ~variants~ of certain beasts are so well calculated that they seem like completely new hunts, but we would have liked some extra unpublished monsters now of the end. On computers, obviously, there are no news on this front, but if nothing else, Capcom has decided to immediately apply some of the most recent updates to the game related to the aforementioned endgame. Curiously, however, we cannot describe in detail what happens at the end of the campaign (the Japanese company has asked to avoid spoilers, although the information has been circulating for months now), but at least we have the opportunity to tell you that the most important patches have been applied to what comes after the elimination of the ~final boss~, and therefore some of the problems related to this part of the game are already resolved. For those who don't know what we're talking about - but, as mentioned, you can go and read our special about it - the last phase initially had some design solutions that made certain processes excessively slow, and emphasized too much grinding (the execution repetitiveness of certain actions to get something, typical of many video games and also of the Monster Hunter series); a real shame considering its scale, and its considerable potential. This formula has remained similar even after the necessary corrections, of course, but at least some gimmicks have been applied capable of making it less heavy, and players with computers will immediately have them available. Not all, but many Let me be clear: ours are only superficial complaints, because Iceborne remains a monstrous expansion in terms of content and more than satisfactory for anyone. Almost all the monsters in the game have been reworked in some way, and the new mechanics added make the experience fresh and more exciting than ever, especially due to the increased flexibility of the various weapons and the incredible effectiveness of the grappling hook (however inserted with ingenuity among the pre-existing maneuvers). Simply, nitpicking is our job, and therefore it seems fair to point out that some of the problems found in the original have not magically resolved in this port. For example - despite being aThe expansion is clearly designed to be an all-encompassing experience for new and old Monster Hunter fans - Iceborne isn't particularly geared towards speedrunners, and there haven't been any changes to the arena missions or random elements at the start of the hunt to make life easier for those who enjoy eliminating monsters in a few minutes (even these are partly negligible characteristics if you decide to face the hunts with certain limitations, yet the situation in World was paradoxically less difficult to manage). Another thing that escapes us: the weapon rebalancing that arrived with the 12.01 patch, linked to the functionality of certain moves and the ease with which small arms can injure monsters after using the grappling hook (a very important element of the gameplay, it should be emphasized), are present in the game even though the endgame is already updated. In fact, our review code was stopped even at update 10.12 as regards the rest of the contents, and we don't really understand the meaning of it. However, these changes should all arrive very soon on PC as well. Less soon, however, the monsters inserted will appear thanks to these patches, which are scheduled for February and March respectively. If nothing else, the reason is more than clear here: the added beasts heavily modify the balance of the game, and represent a final content that deserves to be completed with a little more calm; porting them immediately would have been counterproductive, in some ways. Hunting ~in style~ In short, after removing the changes to the final part, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne on PC is in all respects the same as the console version at launch. We expected more or less this on the other hand, and the certainty that all the improvements made will arrive within a couple of months cancel any will to protest. Therefore, if you play on a computer, the differences are not to be found so much in the package offered by Capcom, but in the advantages associated with the platform and the modder community. And the advantages are there, although the work of the Japanese team is not among the most optimized in circulation (World was already heavy on the CPU, and Iceborne does not seem to have changed things much). The scalability of the game is more than worthy, and maintaining a granite 60 fps is very feasible even on non-powerful configurations with some sacrifices; on computers of a certain level, then, everything works wonders, and the enormous shortening of the uploads makes the experience infinitely more pleasant. If the issues related to the technical sector are easily describable, however, the same cannot be said of the modding situation at the moment. Partly because Capcom expressly forbade us to test old World mods on the expansion (which we would have avoided anyway, in order not to run into some incompatibility-related mess), and partly because it's not yet clear whether the community will support Iceborne with the same vehemence as the base game. Even with possibly minor fanbase support, however, we expect a plethora of mods within a few weeks, as the developers haven't quite met the community's wishes for weapon and armor looks (transmog , i.e. the ability to build only aesthetic armor that does not affect the stats, is for example still only partial in the game, while thanks to mods on PC it will probably become total without waiting in the short term). This kind of support cannot be underestimated and could offer not indifferent surprises in the future, perhaps even able to eliminate some of the marginal defects described above.", "date": "2020-01-07", "grade": "8.7"}
