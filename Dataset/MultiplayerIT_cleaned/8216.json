Of course, we are not talking about dizzying sales, but about a very respectable niche of fans that has allowed the franchise for the Nintendo portable to multiply in various editions, increasingly rich in quizzes and mini-games. The formula was particularly suitable for portable gaming, above all because it can be used even for just a few minutes a day with the simple aim of keeping one's mind in exercise, which, moreover, has significantly widened the catchment area. It was quite obvious, therefore, to expect something similar on the new Sony console as well. However, the question is a little more subtle, and the PlayStation Vita user quite different: in short, Smart As... can it compete with the most famous Brain Training in the world? Smart life Smart As..., without too many words, is a real Brain Training clone: it is useless to hide or pretend that it is not, because certain games and the general setting of the title are all too similar to those of the cartridges for Nintendo DS. On the other hand, the developer XDEV has tried to instill in his creature all the style and modernity of the slim Sony console, both from a technical and a playful point of view. While Brain Training is characterized by essential graphics and an audio sector reduced to the bare minimum, Smart As... continually tries to remind us which console it runs on thanks to a defined and colorful polygonal cosmetic and a pleasant sound accompaniment in which the lion's share our guide does it, a stick man who never shuts up and explains to us, with a good dose of sarcasm, every function of the game and every progress of our beloved little brain. Navigating the menus is very simple and intuitive: the game can be explored and controlled only via touch-screen, and a few taps are enough to choose an activity and switch from one screen to another. If in Brain Training touch controls were simply used as a ~means~ to solve quizzes, in Smart As... the structure of the quizzes seems to revolve around this feature. In short, many mini-games seem to have been specially developed to take advantage of the various features of the console, and this is not always a good thing because this idea often tends to overcomplicate activities that should be intuitive in nature: sometimes a glance is not enough to immediately understand what to do, but you will need to read and listen carefully to the instructions for the game in question. One of the quizzes, for example, proposes a labyrinth of cubes and tiles: we will have to tilt the console so that the force of gravity moves two colored cubes, placing them in specific positions. Another quiz tells us in advance the directions in which a polygonal man will jump: our aim will be to touch the surrounding platforms to raise or lower them, so that the man reaches the finish line without falling into the void. Ideally, these logic puzzles are simple and intriguing, but the gameplay that characterizes them feels a bit abstruse at times. PSVita trophies There are twenty-nine Smart As Trophies: ten Bronze, ten Silver, six Gold and one Platinum. Getting them will not be easy, or yes if you are Sheldon Cooper: in addition to practicing daily, you will, for example, have to complete the various activities at each difficulty level and earn the maximum score. Shared brains Simpler, but not trivial, are the mini-games based on traditional mechanics, such as writing and arithmetic. The console interprets with excellent precision the signs drawn to write a number or letter on the appropriate slates, often necessary to complete a word or transcribe it correctly after hearing it pronounced, or to indicate the result or component of a mathematical calculation. Generally, Smart As... is at its best when it offers exercises of a classic nature, rather than elaborate puzzles revolving around this or that feature, however amusing they may be. In any case, discovering them all is not easy: the game randomly offers four, one for each category, during our daily training; but to play them all at will in the typical free mode, you must first unlock them by achieving a near-perfect rating in the mini-games already completed. It is a controversial choice because on the one hand it stimulates repetition of the exercise to solve it and, therefore, improve; on the other it blocks the progression of those players who, for one reason or another, just can't get those three stars in a certain mini-game. In this case, our intellectual humiliation will be complete and globalized thanksto the solid social component of the game: in reality, the ~online~ mode of Smart As... leaves some time because it basically allows us to do other people's business, comparing our brain performances to those of users of PlayStation Network, Facebook, Twitter or near. Do you want to know who is the smartest user in the city, in the country, even in the world? Smart As... tells you. Do you want to know the evaluation of a certain player in a certain exercise? Smart As... tells you that too. Want to upload your results to Facebook and let all your friends know you're a blockhead? You can. Want to find out who's playing Smart As... in your city? Thanks to near you can do that too, and maybe propose a certain exercise as a challenge. In short, there is a wide range of possibilities, curious but not particularly useful: on the other hand, somehow you had to take advantage of the console's Internet connection, right?", "date": "2012-10-31", "grade": "8.0"}
