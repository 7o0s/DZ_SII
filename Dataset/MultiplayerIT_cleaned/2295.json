A difficult coexistence I must say that since the days of Warcraft, never a theme has been more abused than this. In short, I understand that the background is always pleasant and that basically it seems like the perfect solution to combine the two genres of games, but a little more inventiveness never hurts, especially in these times where the feeling of dj vu is mistress. In any case, in the continent of Bersiah, the races of Light (Humans and elves) and those of darkness (Orcs and other pleasant creatures) have serious coexistence problems, whose battles have always revolved around their two main deities: Amoth and Tobied. Based on these premises, KUF Gold tells of an invasion by the forces of evil who want to restore their hegemony by erasing Azillia, one of the richest and most prosperous nations on the whole continent. As in any good self-respecting RTS, we are given the opportunity to play on both sides and to complete each campaign we will have to successfully complete the 13 missions that make it up. We said that the game is the classic RTS perfectly borrowed from Warcraft, and therefore we will not dwell in any way on the characteristics of the interface or units, because they are absolutely similar to what has already been seen in other titles and therefore nothing new up to now. The surprises come from the presence of the heroes and some levels where the gameplay is very similar to that of Diablo. Two games in one? Hmm better say a game and a half The heroes are particular characters who have their own powers and characteristics, but above all they can evolve and acquire new powers and this is like any good self-respecting RPG. To ensure that our Hero evolves there are special levels, very similar to those of Diablo, where the interface and the game system also change, which becomes much more arcade and less tactical. It is extremely important to successfully complete these phases, because we will find the characteristics acquired during the classic RTS-style games. That said, it sounds like a great idea, but the execution leaves something to be desired. Dungeons are always very small and the game interface remains similar to that of the RTS part, resulting in the long run boring and not very stimulating. Of course there are various objects and weapons, we will also find many potions during our adventures, but overall the realization is just discreet and does not present any challenge. The thing clashes even more if we consider the different level of difficulty of the strategic part, which proves to be much more difficult. A 3D that doesn't exist. And a sound  that there is. The game is done all in a classic 2D. This is not a demerit note, above all if we consider the excellent quality of the animations of the sprites which reach the considerable figure of 120,000 frames. The units are made quite well, even if perhaps they lack a little personality, but on the other hand we have already seen Orcs and Elves of all types and all sizes. The picture is completed by 60 magical special effects and 6 backgrounds for the maps. On the other hand, the only video resolution which is a canonical 800x600 (which in more complex battles may not even be enough) clashes. The sound sector has lights and shadows (heh heh like the plot of the game). The lights are represented by a good sound sector with worthy effects that are never annoying, on the other hand the music is decidedly subdued and this not only for a lack of variety, but for a decidedly superficial composition (some pieces are really unpleasant) In short the times of beautiful Starcraft music are long gone. Multiplayer and Wargate. Knock Knock Is anyone there? Let's move on to the muliplayer which proves to be very effective except that playing with someone is really a feat for the simple reason that I have met very few Western players. The portal is called Wargate and can be accessed directly from within the game, like Blizzard's best-known BattleNet. Evidently Phantagram has a fair number of admirers in its own home (remember that the company is Korean), but outside the domestic walls the panorama is somewhat reduced. A real shame, because although the game introduces nothing, playing KUF in multiplayer is a pleasant experience. Conclusions Before moving on ton the canonical conclusions, I remind you that this version is called GOLD because of a mission editor and some new heroes, added to give more balance to the original game. While waiting for Warcraft, many companies have ventured into the enterprise of anticipating the American giant. The results have all been very disappointing, including this KUF. But be careful if we consider the game only for the strategic part, then we must also say that the result is definitely worthy of our attention. In short, the classic Warcraft clone but well done. Umm sorry. They knocked on the door. Strange .. I feel a terrible stench and a not exactly friendly growl. Is it some Orc still alive? Wait while I take up my sword and shield to remind him that I didn't want to be disturbed when I write. RPG and RTS waiting for Warcraft 3. In the summer of 2001, Phantagram, an enterprising Korean software house, released a game with the ambition of setting a new standard, mixing classic RTS elements with those of the best RPGs, entitled Kingdom Under Fire: we talk about it today due to the release of a new version, called GOLD, which introduces some new features compared to the original. Before continuing, I would like to point out that in reality other software houses have already ventured into the same theme by trying to combine the two genres, such as Warlords Battlecry, but to be honest, the result has never been particularly exciting. Let's find out if this time there are the conditions to create something different.", "date": "2002-01-02", "grade": null}
