{"name": "tERRORbane", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terrorbane-recensione.html", "text": "Maybe we shouldn't express a judgment before having dealt with a certain topic in detail, but since both in this case depend on the writer, who cares. If someone, nowadays, were to ask me ~how would you define the concept of originality?~, we would show terrorbane. And we'd probably continue to show it for a long time to come, until someone comes up with another idea so weird, so crazy, so damn brilliant; someone who - mind you - at the same time will also be able to develop that idea in an effective and perfectly functional way within that product, loved and criticized, always divisive, which today is known as a video game. Why we liked tERRORbane quite a lot: we have always liked his idea, we had also reminded you of it in the recent trial. But we also had several doubts (this is what the review of tERRORbane you are about to read is for) about how much it was possible to make that idea into a title capable of keeping the attention from start to finish, without falling into monotony and repetition , danger inevitably around the corner. Now that the knots have come to a head (ah!) we explain why you should play tERRORbane at least once in your life. And also the reasons why, perhaps, it's not really for you. The plot: I'm the developer, you're a gamer Being a developer, explains tERRORbane, can be stressful I'm the developer, you're a gamer: what will you ever understand, how complex it is to create a video game. This is the premise of the plot of tERRORbane, whose progress is always, constantly marked by the metanarrative. Basically, it is a video game that explains how difficult it is to make a video game. Assuming the perspective of the developer (the Dev), who - poor guy - has to deal with an exorbitant amount of requests. Because players, as we know, want everything at once: they want a freely explorable game world, charismatic characters, a captivating storyline, gameplay that is as varied as possible, and above all, woe to encounter bugs or glitches of any kind! It's not easy to please everyone. The poor developer accompanies us from the beginning to the end of the fruition: he is a sort of speaking supporting actor, who occasionally intervenes directly, helping us with his ~magic~ powers, consisting in the use of programming code. Instead, we have the task of guiding the protagonist of the adventure, terrorbane, in the very banal and predictable enterprise of saving the world from an evil deity. If only it were easy: the game programmer is so messy that he has created an apparently unplayable experience, because every second a strange bug pops up to make the context unpredictable. But here we come right to the heart of tERRORbane: even before the hero, the real protagonists are the programming errors, which prove to be the critical tool with which the sender reaches the recipient with a precise message. The message consists of unconditional love for two different but always interconnected experiences: the work of a programmer and the use of video games. Slightly buggy gameplay The gameplay of tERRORbane often plays with the existence of programming codes Now you could argue that you may have understood the beautiful message underlying tERRORbane, without actually understanding how to play. We have already explained to you how bugs represent the heart of production, so much so that the entire advertising campaign has insisted on this aspect. In fact, two things are understood right from the start: that the main purpose is only marginally to get to the end credits of the unlikely hero's adventure. Instead, it is much more important to collect as many bugs as possible along the way. Entrust us with a list, the developer is counting on us: by exploring his video game far and wide we will perhaps be able to submit to him all the aspects to be modified as soon as possible, because they are ~broken~. But - that's the thing - tERRORbane is all broken! Virtually nothing is saved, from entire cities that disappear swallowed up by a black hole of poorly made code, to easily circumvented bosses by improvising combat systems never foreseen in similar situations. In all of this, no one ever takes themselves seriously and everyone is aware that they are almost inside a theatrical performance. NPCs, for example, joke a lot about being poor insignificant presences: ~just because you're the hero, doesn't mean I have to tell you something interesting~ answered an inhabitant of the first game area. How to blame him? tERRORbane continually plays with ce's expectationsrti video game genres and intelligently aping them all raises considerable food for thought, as well as truly genuine moments of laughter. We could name dozens of them, but why take away the pleasure of the surprise? Classic turn-based combat? tERRORbane has those too, crazy as they are If we really had to force the game into a genre, perhaps we would choose the labels of ~adventure~, because in any case there is a mission to complete, albeit divided into completely disrupted sequences, and ~puzzle~, given the presence of puzzles impossible to overlook, all stimulating creativity (don't think even remotely of canonical solutions, be crazy). In reality, however, the eclecticism of tERRORbane is such as to present, at different times, almost all known and lesser-known genres of the videogame industry, from text adventures to classic JRPGs, from arcades to battle royale. Whether for a sudden quote, or for direct changes in the gameplay, no genre, no theme, no historical franchise has been overlooked. The only flaw perhaps objectionable consists in a narration marked by precise tracks, extremely guided; after all, granting absolute freedom to the player, in such a world, would have compromised the general virtuosity. One would inevitably get lost along the way, ending up overwhelmed by all different situations, with little incentive to complete a plot which, moreover, still remains a mere pretext.", "date": "2022-04-04", "grade": "8.5"}
