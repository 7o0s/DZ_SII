The price of the game also includes the update with the second half of the adventure, which will hopefully be released before the summer. Digital Happiness is also planning a DLC with a free-roam mode and new ghosts to face. The latter package will be paid. DreadOut begins like many horror films. A trip by car among students in the company of one of their teachers. All so beautiful that they look like children of Bayonetta. But then they find themselves off the road with an abandoned town beyond a collapsed bridge. The students get out of the car, stretch their legs and exchange comments from the afternoon comedy. The teacher doesn't know which way to turn. But we finally get the chance to move Linda, the mute protagonist whose buttocks are kept in evidence by the design of the skirt and the positioning of the camera. This too is a choice of style: everything must look like a B-Movie with no aesthetic pretensions. However, once in Linda's shoes, since we don't see any passages, we walk in the opposite direction to the one we came from, imagining that we will soon find an invisible wall placed by the developers. And yet this does not happen. We walked for more than four minutes, and the road even changed its slope, as if to encourage us. No external indications, zero interfaces. Disorientation. Panic. Why doesn't anyone help us? The answer is simple: because this is a survival horror like they did in the nineties. No outstretched hands and developers who, as we'll see later, are sadistic bastards. You will have already understood that DreadOut is inspired more than any other game by Fatal Frame, with a bit of Silent Hill. Someone will shout that Fatal Frame was a hundred times better. Maybe it was better, yes, but it's not on PC, so games like DreadOut are welcome, which offer a very rare horror experience today, and which deserves to be tried at least once. Anyway, let's go back to Linda and the passage towards the town (for the record: we recharged, making it back on foot to the car seemed too much punishment). Once you set foot on the roads that cross the devastated urban area, you can see how the developers have done an incredible job of setting to make up for budget constraints. DreadOut won't have mind-boggling effects, but when can you admire an environment in which no three-dimensional model is replicated? Thanks to this shrewdness, the value of exploration is very high. You breathe an authentic atmosphere, undoubtedly exotic for us, and one wonders who lived in those houses, what prompted them to flee. Or are they all dead instead? While we ask ourselves these questions, one of our classmates discovers a gigantic abandoned school. It goes without saying that everyone embarks on a frenzied exploration, including the teacher. Only Linda stays out with her best friend. Time for another sopa opera dialogue, which should perhaps prepare us for the fact that Linda is tough, and then everything gets out of hand. And oh well, it was called, but when it happens, also thanks to the music, and above all the darkness that has fallen in the meantime, the desire to show off passes in a flutter of moth wings. You can survive the horror. Act 1 of DreadOut teaches us how using only a smartphone! Selfie with the dead The first act of Dreadout lasts about four hours, something more if you decide to discover its secrets as well. Indeed, there are hidden ghosts in the city and explorable areas outside the school, if you time it right. Also, completing the game three times unlocks a different costume for Linda each time. These precautions are another pleasant surprise and demonstrate how Digital Happiness has made great efforts to offer the best possible gaming experience with the means available, sacrificing the least important sector, the graphics. But the best part is the action content. If we take only the ghosts within the school, the variety is remarkable. There is not one equal to the other, and for a game of a few hours there are too many, so that with each clash we feel again on tenterhooks, looking for a means to chase away the presence with our smartphone. And don't think it's a joke. The developers have gone to great lengths to get us into trouble. At the same time they had brilliant intuitions to give Linda always new possibilities despite the very limited actions she is granted. We can turn on or off the light of the mobile, point and take a picture. End. We can already tell you that discovering the weak point of some spettri was tough; you have to observe very carefully, because the clues are reduced to a minimum and inconspicuous. On the other hand, the indications reach us by stimulating sight and hearing. Sometimes it's a change in tune, other times a cat leading us past a destroyed balcony. Or the way a ghost backs away. If we are as alert as those in danger would be, the solution should come. Instead the main puzzle that dominates this first act is perhaps a little too cryptic, stuff to make us curse the day we entered the school. To get to the bottom of it we have to try hard and grasp the subtleties of the scenario, as well as find the necessary objects. We liked the fact that Linda doesn't have to use items with an extra action. Only having them with her allows her to expand her powers, for example by seeing symbols with the camera that weren't there before. This minimal choice goes hand in hand with the total absence of interfaces. Try playing in the dark with headphones and you will feel like you are present in that cursed school. There is life after death We can't tell you if DreadOut is actually scary. The game doesn't seem too interested in looking for the scream in the player, but rather in creating an eerie and foreboding atmosphere. In this he succeeds very well. There are some flaws, however. Small visual bugs and a control system that requires more luck than skill when fighting in confined spaces. In the end, however, you don't die so much in DreadOut, but you die in a few seconds, especially during boss fights. To beat them you need to figure out what to do, it takes brains and a bit of manual dexterity, but once the puzzle is solved, they become almost trivial. Only, the time we stay alive is short: from there that anger that was once welcomed like a gauntlet and that today many may find frustrating. Once you die, however, you don't start over immediately. Something strange happens instead, Linda finds herself in limbo. Up to here it would seem just a narrative device like any other, while in reality in this limbo we have to act, run towards a light that has the shape of two wings. In the meantime, the developers throw us some mocking comments, such as, Maybe you should switch to a casual game, or again, Winners don't use drugs (a quote from an old writing that appeared on arcade cabinets). Why take this trek into the light every time? Partly because the aim is not to rush to the end of the game, but to be patient and try to solve the puzzle before us. And partly because starting over immediately in a hurry could only generate an infinite series of deaths. Or maybe the developers just needed an excuse to load the game without showing it. Limbo can be loved or hated. It depends on what kind of player you are. However, this too is a choice of style, moreover in line with the series of clichs with which Digital Happiness seems to entertain itself. Where, on the other hand, there is nothing already seen is in the audio sector, which uses music and noise in an intelligent way to draw our attention to a detail or simply to let a trickle of sweat run down our back. From what we've been able to see so far, DreadOut has the potential to become an excellent survival horror. The closing of the first act is perfect and leaves us full of questions and curiosity about the horrors that will follow. Now Digital Happines just has to take advantage of the time and the new budget available to smooth the edges and clean up the game mechanics. We are waiting. As long as there's battery, there's hope.", "date": "2014-05-23", "grade": "7.4"}
