Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. It sometimes happens that for ~The Free Game of the Week~ space is given to products that have already been available for a while on the App Store and/or Google Play, perhaps because they have been updated recently and have gained in quality and thickness, or simply because they are imposed on the ratings and it has become impossible to ignore their impact on the public. Soccer Hero, released on iOS and Android terminals in June, belongs precisely to this category of titles. It is a football manager developed by an Italian team, capable of offering a pleasant, immediate and fun experience, which gains further appeal in the eyes of football enthusiasts... who, as we know, are quite numerous here. The incipit is the usual: once a virtual footballer has been created, we will be able to follow his career from the beginning to the apex, passing from the teams that compete in local tournaments to the most important world clubs, with a view to a particularly full-bodied campaign, in which the events are marked by a progression system that works not only on the basis of the experience gained on the field but also taking into account the result of training aimed at improving our character's power, technique and vision of the game. The developers have also thought of taking care of the social ~outline~, by inserting accessories in the shop, objects that affect the player's skills, increasingly luxurious cars and apartments, to be purchased using mainly virtual currency. All without placing particular constraints on the use of real currency, represented by gold coins, and resorting to the by now traditional expedient of ~energy points~ which are consumed during each game or physical activity and which are automatically recharged as the minutes. Soccer Hero is a simple and intuitive management game, with a full-bodied and multifaceted structure Upgrade to freemium Taking care of the character is one of the fundamental aspects of the Soccer Hero experience, but as always happens at a certain point our planning, training sessions (which involve an active effort and a certain commitment) and the eventual purchase of items they will lead to the championship matches in which we play, and there we will have to put into practice what we have learned to bring home a victory and maybe score a goal or complete some assists. The progress of the match follows the classic canons of managerial games, with a textual ~commentary~ that can be followed in real time or in accelerated mode, and which stops when we are called to perform a direct action. At that point you are faced with a screen with the pitch and the players of the two teams, represented as in a normal football game, and you have to use a touch screen-based shooting system to make a precision pass or finish on goal , an operation that is quite difficult to carry out, so much so that we will often end up preferring the assist to a teammate who can score from before. The situations set up by Soccer Hero in this particular juncture are quite numerous: ranging from the simple pass to the tackle, from free kicks to corner kicks, trying to give the right effect to the ball where necessary to climb over a barrier or take by surprise the goalkeeper. Of course, when the action ends and we return to the ~commentary~ it is possible that our efforts prove useless and that the opponents score repeatedly, and this is probably the least brilliant aspect of the Appfactory production, in the sense that the control over the work of the team is particularly limited and therefore it becomes sometimes frustrating not being able to overturn a negative result due to no fault of ours. It must also be said that the technical sector boasts a good interface but leaves something to be desired as regards polygonal models and animations: the former are all practically the same, the latter appear repetitive. Obviously the charm of the game is in its entirety, in the mix of sometimes original elements that go to draw an interesting and pleasant picture, even more so because it can be used for free.", "date": "2014-08-02", "grade": "7.5"}
