{"name": "Sackboy: A Big Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sackboy-a-big-adventure-recensione-ps5.html", "text": "Writing the review of Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PS5 means telling of a less flashy title than others, one of those that risks being left a little in the background in the PS5 launch line up. Alongside highly appealing products, such as Demon's Souls and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Sumo Digital platform is a less attractive product for passionate users. Yet it is a sensible graft: with Christmas around the corner, a title that satisfies everyone's needs, also allowing you to play in a cooperative, it can't hurt, giving you a few moments of lightness between a session of cursing with the title From Software (masterfully revised by Bluepoint Game) and a ride as Spider-Man among other buildings in New York. The mechanics are typical of the genre, which the English developer takes up slavishly, sometimes perhaps too much, but the joyful tone of the setting, the iconic protagonist and the supporting actors infuse the work with a light spirit at times irresistible. Five worlds full of levels, challenges and items to collect. Not enough to affect the sacred monsters of the genre, more than enough to guarantee a good dose of hours of entertainment. Big deal for Sackboy When the fearsome Vex invades the world of Sackboy and his companions, things immediately go badly: the enemy of the moment threatens to deprive the protagonist and his friends of freedom, leaving him (and leaving us) the only possibility to get on the road. Waiting for us are five worlds full of levels, with as many themings. They range from the classic forest to the underwater depths, from futuristic cities to the center of the earth. The Little Big Planet theme, with backgrounds and characters made of cardboard, glue, paint and fabric, returns here with a delicious and very colorful creation. At the same time, the physical and concrete nature of the materials used (virtually) to recreate the levels tends to make them, in the long run, a little too similar to each other. They remain very colorful and it is enough to watch any video to realize how good the work done by Sumo Digital has been, but at a certain point of the experience it is as if one had the impression that visually the game had already given everything that had to offer. Net of a few flaws, the character and his universe are still well defined and recognizable, a fundamental element for an operation of this kind. The rules of the platformer Sackboy: A Big Adventure is the fruit of a scientific approach to the platform genre. There is practically everything seen in other similar titles: more or less open levels, horizontal and vertical scrolling, musical moments and timed challenges. The character does not have a real progression but learns a handful of moves during the first bars, to then acquire, depending on the level, particular skills that allow him now to remain suspended in the air, now to fire a shot with a bionic arm or to hook and then swing with a grappling hook. A bit of everything, and the same goes for the enemies that follow one another with a fair variety before reappearing a little at a time in an enhanced version. The level of difficulty has been deliberately contained: so forget the effort required to overcome the more complex passages of games like Crash. Sackboy: A Big Adventure wants to be completed by anyone, even if to collect all the spheres useful for continuing the adventure you will have to put your own into it; a bit like the classic Mario stars. If only the level of challenge had been a bit higher, probably the final phase of the experience, which feels the weight of the effort sustained up to that moment by the chosen game structure, would have been alleviated. Thus the game lends itself better to fleeting sessions rather than a long tirade that inevitably shows some limitations. There are levels meant to be played co-op, a panacea in a PS5 launch line up that otherwise wouldn't speak to the whole family. And then there are the aforementioned timed challenges which, if you want to cross the finish line with decent times, require a certain concentration going forward. The control system responds very well; rather in some cases the large number of perspective changes leave some passages more confusing than others. Nothing serious anyway. Too bad instead that the boss fights, one for each world, are not particularly inspired and in one case they are repeated almost the same. An extra effort would have been very welcome. Regardless of your skill level it is likely that in a dozen hours, maybe more, you will be able to collect enough orbs to unlockking and complete all levels. It will take you a little more time to retrace your steps and collect the missing ones, which leads us to applaud Sumo Digital for the work done in inserting in each level a sufficient number of secret passages, small areas hidden and fun extras. Impressive graphics and sound If, as we mentioned above, it is true that Sackboy: A Big Adventure suffers from a bit of tiredness in the final stages of the adventure, it is equally true that in general the graphic work is excellent. The levels are very colorful, full of details and the realization of all the materials that make up this ~handmade~ world really gives an idea of what step forward has been made in recent times compared to similar looks proposed in the past. The camera, normally placed at a certain distance from the character and from the enemies, often prevents visible details from being observed when it approaches, for example at the end of the level, such as the exceptional creation of Sackboy and other supporting actors. However, we were unable to test the PS4 version which will inevitably have to make some compromises. Among other things, the protagonist can spend the in-game currency to buy a whole series of costumes and aesthetic elements that have no impact on the gameplay, but are incredibly fun to see and wear. The staging reaches its absolute peak in some thematic levels, for example a very funny race on the rapids, and above all during the musical schemes. In these cases, the licensed songs are the pretext for making the entire level dance to the rhythm, from the enemies to the backdrop. The first of these moments, on the notes of Uptown Funk, will be a little revelation. The sensory part offered by Dualsense, the new PS5 controller, is basically divided into two. On the one hand there is a precise use of haptic feedback and the integrated speaker, which accompany the action and make the connection with what is happening more immersive and direct. On the other hand, unfortunately, the adaptive triggers are not exploited as seen elsewhere, for example in Astro's Playroom. A pity because, although it is true that the triggers are not used except to pick up and throw objects, this novelty is still something we would like to try a little more.", "date": "2020-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
