{"name": "No Man's Sky: la recensione dell'inedita versione Xbox One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-mans-sky-recensione-xbox-one.html", "text": "The arrival of the long-awaited Next update coincides with that of No Man's Sky on Xbox One, long awaited on a platform that has been excluded for two years from the exploration of the imaginary developed by Hello Games. Today, four updates later, the people of the Microsoft console can finally embark on their intergalactic journey in a universe that has profoundly changed since launch, enriched by the buildable bases of the Foundation update, the specializations for the ships of Path Finder and the more structured and richer universe, also thanks to 30 hours of narration, of Ascent of the Atlas. All seasoned with new filters, technological refinements, planetary vehicles and, of course, the novelties of Next, at the center of our new review of the PC version, which include multiplayer support, third person view, more refined interface, more articulated crafting, novelties for the foundations and the important promise of a future made of transparent communications, regular updates and in-game events. No Man's Sky: a deeply changed title No Man's Sky is a hybrid between space simulator and survival born in the sign of the exploration of an immense universe generated in a completely procedural way. And it is from the complex automatic creation of the planets that the magic of the work Hello Games arises, a title that thrives on the amazement of the player who, with each landing, finds himself facing a new planet, with its specific environmental conditions and full of outposts, relics, mysteries and strange races to discover. Each new destination is a leap in the dark, each new game a different universe of colors. But there are some fixed points, however designed to enhance the concept of travel but immovable such as the subtle but still welcome narrative component and such as the reputation system that determines interactions with the three alien races and with the three guilds. And we can make friends by taking care of the missions, in this case generated automatically, while obtaining nanites to exchange for projects that with updates and with the articulation of the galactic economy, ship types and crafting. We are far, mind you, from the complexity of dynamic and interconnected universes like that of Elite: Dangerous, but the illusion holds and that's enough while we enjoy the news of the latest update which include third person view, some improvements to the flight model planetarium, dynamic clouds, increasingly breathtaking landscapes, more believable planets, larger stations, complex base building and new management dynamics that include managing a fleet. All topped off with that multiplayer support that eventually became part of the No Man's Sky universe, allowing us to invite friends or participate in random games to target other players or face challenges in company. However, elements to structure it are missing, such as the effective sharing of missions, which we hope will arrive in the future, or PvP dynamics, which we will never see, even if it is not the case to make a drama out of it. Multiplayer, among other things on consoles linked to the need to be subscribed to Gold and Plus, is certainly not the only relevant novelty of the new update. Among the substantial innovations of Next we find the revision of the crafting which makes things more structured and a bit more complex. In fact, more and more tools are needed to access certain resources, but the necessary technologies, such as the terrain manipulator, are immediately available and the possibility of building bases on each planet allows us to bring all the comforts closer to us, without having to leave the planet or go through it to find trading terminals or non-player characters. Nonetheless, the stations are larger and more populated, with various aliens who can speed up our understanding of languages in exchange for credits (in the world of No Man's Sky called units) or other objects. Furthermore, certain technologies must still be pursued between stations and anomalies, which keeps alive the need to explore every corner of the universe to discover ever more varied planets that now include more cute, larger, more varied and more picturesque creatures. Xbox One goals Of the thousand objective points offered by No Man's Sky, most are predictably linked to the exploratory dimension which includes the scanning of alien species, the distance covered on foot, the distance covered in flight, the words learned and the alien encounters. Getting them, it goes without saying, is almost exclusively a matter of time, especially in the case of arriving at the center of the galaxy in permadeath mode, even if there are some prizes for those who do not mind eliminating enemies and testing their survival skills. Merits, limits and technical issuesThat No Man's Sky, we said, has several limits, and we will talk about them in more detail in a few lines, but the first thirty hours, it is good to put it in black and white, are those that remain etched in the memory. Breathtaking panoramas, continuous discoveries, futuristic technologies, acid storms and sudden escapes culminate in an explosive first journey to the stars, a heart-pounding dive towards a universe full of mysterious space stations, unimaginable planets, alien languages to learn and trade with other pilots passing through the hangars of the huge space stations. The intensity of the experience is tangible and also thrives on the visuals of a graphics engine that certainly doesn't make one cry out for a miracle but thanks to an excellent design work, capable of restoring glimpses with an extraordinarily alien aftertaste, it gives us memorable suggestions, capable of drag us body and soul among the stars. And the plot does the same, thin but effective in putting us in the shoes of an intergalactic explorer, to which are added the increasingly complex crafting and the construction of the bases which after four updates provides hundreds of pieces to be placed even on the deck of our frigate and, with Next, in the depths of the sea. There are really many things to do, also thanks to the two survival modes and multiplayer, even if sooner or later the lack of something that breaks the repetitiveness of a universe that, as we said, is not as complex as it appears . There are fixed rules, in fact, to guide the economy, while the variety of planets, excluding climatic conditions, is a mere matter of resources and aesthetics. And when these elements become evident, the attention slides inexorably on the limits that include a basic combat system and a flight experience incomparable compared to that of other simulators. Both factors, it is clear, do not compromise the exploratory experience, with the flight system that is still quite convincing and fun, but the difficulty of getting rid of the planetary sentinels (part of a sort of preservation police) and the continuous arrival of pirate ships often put us in front of small ordeals that we would have gladly avoided. And that's also why we trust Murray's promise of continued innovations which we hope include customization of console controls and greater optimization, even if from a performance point of view the Microsoft console fares better than we would have believed. Xbox One has to settle for 1600x900 resolution while PS4 reaches native 1080p, but the rendering between the two consoles isn't that dissimilar thanks to the excellent quality of graphic effects and textures. And there's no need to complain about the framerate either, except for some slowdown in space which however does not translate into a freeze as on PC, with a rather constant 30fps which should not be taken for granted given the capricious engine of No Man's Sky. Engine that on Xbox One X reaches the native 4K against that used by PS4 Pro, even exceeding the 30fps quota with the synchronization unlocked. Better to keep it active, however, given the significant drops in framerate that also occur when switching from Ultra HD in the Quality mode to 1440p in the Performance mode, even if in this case the number of images per second rises to 60. All wrapped up in the splendid soundtrack that PC and PS4 users already know and without which the journey through the universe of No Man's Sky would lose a good part of its magic.", "date": "2018-07-30", "grade": "8.0"}
