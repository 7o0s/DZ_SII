The success of the second chapter and the splendid aesthetic and historical qualities of our beautiful country have in fact produced a sequel to all intents and purposes before the change of setting that will occur with the next episode, a sequel that begins exactly where the previous one ends, with Ezio Auditore da Florence which is located inside the Sistine Chapel after a ~chat~ with Rodrigo Borgia and interesting implications on the apple of Eden, the leitmotif of the story since the original title. Rome at the end of the 1400s is therefore the absolute protagonist of Brotherhood, in its imposing garments and in a map that has a good part of the famous landmarks that belong to the Eternal City, starting from the Colosseum, passing through Porta Nomentana and arriving at San Pietro, Campidoglio and so on. In parallel there is the current life (or rather future, in 2012) of Desmond Miles, who thanks to a machine called Animus tries to relive the memories of his ancestors assassins in secular struggle with the Templars, and discover the location of the apple to prevent the latter from getting hold of it. In this chapter, therefore, the events of Rome will be relived, where the brotherhood of assassins is in cahoots to free the city from the extreme influence of the Borgias, which sees Cesare, Lucrezia and Rodrigo himself as key characters among others. Brotherhood is not a dance The structure of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, as it was reasonable to expect, resumes in the foundations and in a slavish way that of the second chapter, with the third person view and the control system where thanks to the combination of the R1 and X keys it is possible to run, zompettare and climb practically everywhere, according to a natural and by now established dynamic. The story also unfolds through the well-known genetic sequences, with the next piece visible on the map by means of a special exclamation point, the secondary missions represented by different icons and the sections of Rome that become available as the adventure progresses. The first novelties that catch the eye are represented by the possibility of riding inside the city (curiously not galloping, probably due to frame rate problems or generation of nearby buildings) and by the fact that each mission, whether it is main, secondary or extra, can be replayed at any time using the DNA menu, to the extreme happiness of trophy hunters (those who have played the second chapter know what we are talking about). In reality there is a further and fundamental difference, each sequence can in fact be completed 50 or 100% in relation to a secondary condition that must be completed. Among many: completing the mission within a certain amount of time, without being discovered, killing the target with the hidden blade or crossbow and so on. The ~reward~ that is obtained translates into replayability, variety because the game leads to tackling the missions in a different way, but also into additional memories that appear on the game map. Having abandoned Monteriggioni (but he will appear more than once during the adventure, don't despair) the whole ~micromanagerial~ section of Ezio Auditore and his brotherhood has been extended to Rome in its entirety. A new hideout is obviously available but now the concept of earnings revolves around the restoration of some structures present within the Capitoline city, starting from the various shops to arrive at the imposing structures mentioned above, which once restored at a cost variable allow to generate income which is finally deposited on a regular basis in shops that act as counters. However, each district containing shops and structures must first of all be freed from the influence of the Borgias, through a ~practice~ which involves killing the captain in command and setting fire to the respective tower adorned with banners belonging to the many hated nobles. Before focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of the game, we would like to conclude the description with three other big distinctive elements of this Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which also determine its strengths. Beyond the various guild and faction side missions, the crypts of the second chapter have the six halls of Nero as their alter ego, each of which hides a key to access the tomb of Romulus. These sanctuaries mainly offer long and very pleasant platform sections where Ezio's control is a real ballet between ledges and holds,and where everything is harmonious and natural as long as you play a little with the manual camera to avoid making a leap into the void. To then support the introduction of the pistol and parachute in terms of technologically advanced inventions, in Brotherhood there is no lack of Leonardo's presence with further decidedly lethal arquebuses. The problem is that in this case he developed them under threat from the Borgias, and so other missions appear where Ezio must first burn the project and then take possession of the invention itself to get the better of the opponents and destroy it (unfortunately!) in the last joke. The result? Very amusing game situations where it is possible to manage naval cannons, rudimentary tanks rather than hang gliders. These sections are also an ~excuse~ to offer the player different settings from those of Rome: in fact, you go to visit the Castel dell'Ovo in Naples, Monte Circeo, the Valnerina but also Florence and Venice, obviously in smaller configurations but pleasant to see and deal with. Multiplayer mon amour The most ~glaring~ novelty of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is certainly represented by the section dedicated to multiplayer, absolutely new for the saga. We need to make a couple of premises, the first is that the Ubisoft title remains basically a single player experience with a pleasant multiplayer addition, the second is that we have had the opportunity to test the beta extensively and very little the final version, due to the lack of players present with the title not yet released in stores. That said, an initial tutorial session introduces the game mechanics with the first mode available, the wanted one, which requires the player to identify some prey that must be eliminated. The multiplayer structure includes 50 levels on the classic Call of Duty style where each one allows access to new skills such as disguises or other, weapons, slots and colors for clothing. At level 5, for example, the alliance mode is unlocked, where a team of two templars is designated as prey and in general the experience points can be increased based on the above kills but also thanks to various bonuses linked to the consecutive number of eliminations rather than the use of certain objects. Between ranked and unranked matches, there are 8 maps available and they foresee the return of ~old glories~ such as Forl and Monteriggioni itself, the total characters are instead 14, they differ only in terms of aesthetics and for the killing animation, they are unlocked continuing in the levels or thanks to UPLAY, the Ubisoft social network that allows you to obtain themes, skins and anything else for the game based on the actions performed. Again in terms of interaction with other users, in the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood menus it is finally possible to see the ~Virtual training~ item, a mode that makes a series of running, combat and so on tests available in a virtual space, with three medal tiers and online leaderboards to compare against your friends or globally. Playstation 3 trophies Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers 51 trophies, of which 15 Silver and 1 Gold. In the second chapter it was quite easy to get them all and even in this the music does not change, with most of them dedicated to the story, to completing the missions of Nero and Leonardo and to collecting feathers and flags of the Borgias, which can be reported by purchasing the appropriate maps of the treasure. The ~problem~ arises from the fact that now there are also trophies related to multiplayer, with the most difficult one, necessary for platinum, which is obtained by bringing your character to level 50, not exactly a health walk. In any case, by completing the main adventure with a good part of the secondary objectives, about 70/75% of the available trophies are taken home. The followers of Ezio Auditore To close the descriptive circle we have the possibility for Ezio to literally hire assassin adepts, who once trained can be recalled to do the dirty work without alerting the guards, thanks to a special bar placed immediately after the energy bar. Their management is almost RPG-like, in fact they acquire experience, they level up and through special dovecotes scattered around the game map it is possible to assign each one some skill points rather than sending them around Europe to complete missions that return different quantities of money, items and experience points, based on the level of difficulty and feasibility. Having said that, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood once again carries with it two now historic defects of the saga. Artificial intelligence above allpractically identical and once again not convincing in the phase of identifying Ezio rather than in the fights. As for the latter, the use of football on the family jewels rather than the counterattacks that are performed with R1 more square allows you to get the better of any situation and without worries, not to mention that the assassin adepts add fun and variety but make the fights themselves even easier. The situation improves in missions that must be completed without being discovered, but even in this case there are several ~tricks~ to cheat the artificial intelligence on most occasions. As a reflection, the level of challenge of the game is quite low, you have to put your effort to die and it is clear once again how the Ubisoft title focuses entirely on the gaming experience and on the fun to captivate the player until its completion. in a conceptual parallel that we like to make with Fable II. However, you will have already seen the decidedly positive vote at this point of the reading, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood also due to the above defects fails to make the leap towards the absolute masterpiece, however it improves practically every aspect of the previous chapter to the extent that it remains extremely entertaining, has an incredible variety and eliminates almost all the boring points present in the past (think also of the underground tunnels to move quickly between all the points of the city), not to mention the pleasant additions and the narrative system that also in this case expects an ending with a bang. By making a direct comparison, the main adventure can probably be completed in a lower amount of hours (about 10-15) than the second episode, the fact is that in our road test we were naturally led to complete the game doing most of the side quests and extras, with our counter set at a whopping 23 hours. We have not forgotten the technical sector! Rome is beautiful to see with its variety, vegetation and known places. We have excellence in the construction of the most impressive structures and in the interiors of St. Peter's, for example, where the textures are truly exceptional. The polygonal models of the characters are equally improved as are the light effects and the day/night cycle, the overall impact is even more pleasant and in general we are dealing with one of the most valid titles from this point of view in the videogame panorama . As regards at least the PlayStation 3 version, however, the graphics engine continues to lose some hits in terms of fluidity and tearing. The situation is better than in the past especially in key desync of the screen, but situations in which the frame rate drops to around 20/25 frames per second are not uncommon. The feeling is that the situation is similar to what we saw with the second chapter compared to the Xbox 360 version, which at a quick first glance seemed to be more stable from this point of view. The dubbing is obviously in Italian and identical to that of the previous episode, the soundtrack once again of the highest level especially during the fights or in the original songs such as the one that accompanies the player in the Roman forum district, truly a pleasure to listen to .
