In fact, Close Quarters shifts the focus of the clashes to small and narrow spaces, thus canceling the game by force of any means from the maps, all in favor of frenetic indoor shootings, where whoever has the biggest one (the shotgun) wins. Close Quarters is therefore a more or less total ~betrayal~ of the traditional gameplay of the saga, but it undoubtedly has the advantage of still being fun, caciarone in a nutshell. The package consists of four maps, Donya Fortress, Scrapmetal, Ziba Tower and Operation 925, while on the weapons side we have ten new guns for ten new assignments. Regarding the game modes we find Team Deathmatch Close Quarters, which needs little explanation, Conquer Domination and Gun Master. The latter two are the Made in Sweden version of Dominio and Gun Game that everyone who plays Call of Duty knows well. A look at the maps... Made for up to sixteen players, Ziba Tower is the smallest map in the package but it's all played on a marked verticality. Set in Tehran, the building pushes the players to go up and down between the floors, complete with the inevitable bottlenecks, keeping an eye on the internal courtyard from the balconies, a real no-man's land at the mercy of the shooters from above. An immediate and very fast map, perhaps the one most conceptually similar to the Call of Duty shootings. Zero tactics, heads down and heavy weapons ready to fire to easily maximize experience gains. From the rich bourgeois areas of Tehran we move to the full industrial area with Scrapmetal. Here too the vertical development is ensured by the two multi-storey sheds that form the map, joined by some walkways useful for keeping an eye on who is moving from one building to another. The map is really well designed, large enough to challenge players with a good number of access routes to the factory hotspots. It is also therefore rather intricate and to be studied carefully before jumping into the fray. The complete opposite of Ziba Tower in plain English. Donya Fortess takes us back to the Middle East, setting the action in an old fort renovated for the occasion. A purely horizontal map despite a two-story building overlooking the central courtyard, it is also small in size, but well developed with narrow underground passages to move from one end of the map to the other. A level therefore conceptually similar to Ziba Tower, fast and frenetic, which will make the happiness of heavily armed teams, it being understood that the central balcony is a good point from which to lurk. The largest map in the pack, Operation 925 enhances the new game mode Conquer Domination. Again in Tehran, the complex consists of three levels plus an underground car park. Distinctly vertical map with the caf balcony dominating the entire complex. Among the various proposals of Close Quarters, Operation 925 is the least frenetic and a tad more ~reasoned~, with more space to catch your breath to organize better concerted attacks and defenses. Definitely the best of the lot. The basics are obviously the same as the other three maps, but the larger size and slower pace favor a playability closer to what Battlefield is. ...and game modes Speaking of game modes, Conquer Domination sees the two teams contending for three hot spots until one or the other runs out of re-entry tickets. We could say no particular innovation, the interesting thing is that the times of conquest are extremely fast, consequently it is all a move between A-B-C thus favoring group massacres with little room for refined techniques of circumvention. In this sense, it should be noted that the proliferation of mines, explosives and rocket launchers is viewed badly by the community. Surrounding a base with mines or pigeon shooting with rocket launchers is certainly possible, but it trivializes, or rather brutalizes the game dynamics given the limited spaces of the maps. Gun Master is instead the exact copy of Gun Game. Players start with one weapon, every two kills it is replaced with another. If you are killed, the earned weapon is taken away from you, effectively losing a position in the standings. The weapons available are for the most part unpublished from Close Quarters: starting with the MP443 pistol and ending with the knife. A modality that therefore seems to be made to become familiar with the new arsenal, mto nothing more than a simple pastime. In short, the veteran of Battlefield 3 may not appreciate this Gun Master who effectively cancels the class specializations within a frenetic circle in the maps. Then there is the matter of the so-called HD Destruction implemented specifically for this package. Given the impossibility of pulling down entire buildings, otherwise the maps would have become unplayable due to the debris that would have clogged the narrow spaces of the levels, it was preferred to focus on the generous destruction of all furnishings and furnishings and more generally in pulling down the least resistant surfaces. Definitely nice to look at, but less useful, however, in terms of gameplay than seen in the standard game. Our judgment is undoubtedly positive, but we cannot fail to dwell on the fact that Close Quarters is not Battlefield 3. This second DLC in fact exposes the DICE point of view on what Call of Duty offers, and it does it well, but we don't understand who exactly is it aimed at? Precisely for this veteran users of pitched battles are warned.", "date": "2012-06-22", "grade": null}
