It's impossible that at least once in your life you haven't found yourself in front of one of his cabinets, or that you haven't seen a gadget dedicated to the two well-known dragons Bub and Bob (the green and the blue one, respectively) at some comic fair. Nor can we exclude that in more recent times some of you have eyed their return in three dimensions, known as Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey. However, it is useless to deny what we can properly consider a triviality: the first love, or the first episode of a successful series, it's usually also the one you never forget, and that years later - remakes aside - still gives check to all subsequent episodes. Take Metal Slug, the first Super Mario, or even the '94 Puzzle Bobble, in fact. That's why we couldn't help but exclaim ~finally!~ when the development of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! was announced, a video game that takes the series back to its origins, but without skimping on the necessary concessions to modernity (rankings, new modes, a story, and so on). What follows is the review of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!, which basically proves two things: that Puzzle Bobble is more alive and fun than ever and that in the end there is really never a need to twist the basic philosophy to produce something attractive for the contemporary market. Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!: A story mode The unmistakable style of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! The first novelty of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! consists of the introduction of a story mode. Taito has selected four very balanced protagonists, the already mentioned and well-known Bub and Bob, but also the female counterparts Peb and Pab, who all together will have to save their island from a very particular threat: an invasion of colored bubbles. In fact, the miniroons - that is, the smaller dragons, who cannot yet shoot bubbles like their adult counterparts - suddenly ~activated~ all together, altering the balance of the ecosystem; in reality it is a larger threat, hatched by some of the historical enemies of the series, who also appeared in the various chapters of Bubble Bobble, to which reference is made several times with a delicate and appreciable quotation. necessary glue to the various areas scattered around the island: world after world, the player will complete all the levels unlocking access to the next ones. It is interesting that, beyond the hand-drawn backdrops that make the various areas cohesive and coherent, the objectives also change from one to the other. For example, the first world (the Chuck'n's Rainbow Village) doesn't even require the destruction of all the bubbles on the screen, but simply the rescue of the trapped creatures. From the second, however, it becomes necessary to eliminate all the bubbles, and further on the requests change again. Each single area hosts about fifteen levels, completed which unlock a higher level of difficulty; and the completion time must also be taken into account, because one to three stars will be unlocked based on how quickly. In short, completionists will love the structure of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!; at the same time, the challenge is never really prohibitive even for newcomers or less skilled players. Everything has been dosed with extreme intelligence, taking into account personal skill, desire for perfectionism, replayability after the first completion and collecting (new helpers are unlocked by aiming for records). So many possibilities The competitive mode of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! The story mode is the flagship of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!, but not the only surprise it can boast. Since the gameplay has returned to being the pure and simple one of its origins, we prefer to delve into these many possibilities, given that for better or worse you will know ~how to play~ Puzzle Bobble: you shoot colored bubbles trying to aim at the one of the same color, given that combining three or more similar ones allows you to explode all the connected ones of the same shade. All before the board fills up to flood the player (or time runs out). First, Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! introduces a cooperative mode for up to four players locally, as well as a competitive 2 VS 2 mode. You will remember how in the past it was possible to ~only~ face level after level alone, or challenge a friend. Now, if you want, you can collaborate: a giant screen is invaded by bubbles, and four players together try to pop them all. Each has its own arrowand its ammunition, so it's not simply a question of giving support to the protagonist who shoots: everyone must guarantee their contribution, under penalty of collective loss of the round. Something similar happens in the two-on-two competitive mode: in this case, the pair of players independently manage their bubble quadrant, and the other pair does the same. But even here every single present has its weapon and its bubbles: all, at the same time, have the same possibilities for action. And basically the real news is this, the elimination of a main role and a support for the introduction of equal roles. The Baron Tower and... Space Invaders? One of many variations of Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! Puzzle Bobble Every bubble! it is based on the alternation of two specific values: extremely conservative gameplay, but solid and above all full of sparkling possibilities (unpublished bubbles, objects to be destroyed, customizable helpers); and then on the many unpublished modalities. It is as if the first chapter of the series had been taken up again, updating it (but faithfully) in the artistic direction, and enriching it with possibilities. Apart from a few too many uploads, it will also be the love for the series, we struggle to find significant flaws and believe that the moments in which the developers have dared the most should be valued. For example in the introduction of a completely separate game mode also separate in the start menu, where Puzzle Bobble meets Space Invaders. You got it right, and if in words it seems crazy, we assure you that in practice, repetitiveness aside, it works very well. The Space Invaders spaceships are ready to invade the Earth, only to stop them are the dragons that run around the screen, throwing bubbles at the attackers. Dodge here and shoot there, whole half hours have flown by. Puzzle Bobble Every bubble! meet Space Invaders There is also online, present in two different offers. The first is the classic Versus mode: you are matched with a random player and you have to defeat him exactly as you would a friend of yours locally. Nothing shocking, as long as you are able to find an opponent of the same level as you. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the Torre Baron seemed undoubted. It is an infinite level, in which only the score accumulated before being defeated counts; score which is then entered into a global ranking, updated by difficulty level. At the time of writing, we are the fifteenth in the world in normal mode. Too bad just Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! will be available to everyone on the market we will presumably end up in the last places.", "date": "2023-05-22", "grade": "8.0"}
