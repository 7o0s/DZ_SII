{"name": "Back Track", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/back-track.html", "text": "All this to tell you about a first-person shooter that tries its way to success on the GBA. The setting is the most classic (Doom-like to be clear), where you mainly need to exterminate everything that comes under fire and find your way out to the next level. This time there are twelve levels, all within the base made up of nine floors and, as usual, to move from one stage to another you have to use elevators or secret passages to be unlocked with keys or switches. The blasting action is made easier by an intuitive control system that uses the cross for movements, the back buttons for strafe, the B button to change weapons and the A button to shoot and activate doors and switches. The viewfinder is at a fixed height so the only concern is to turn towards the enemy and hold down the fire button (there is autofire!). The weapons available are very bizarre ranging from the normal pistol, shotgun, spray can that works like a flamethrower, etc. Technically the game uses a pseudo3D engine and this is both its greatest strength and weakness: playing an FPS on a console with a few-inch screen has a certain charm and it must be said that the movement is rendered very convincing and that it is possible to see the weapon held in a decent level of detail; the enemies are quite detailed (although lacking in variety) and there are nice smoke and transparency effects. Also noteworthy is the short video in computer graphics that is shown when the game starts. On the other side of the scale, however, there are to consider the disappearance of the walls as soon as you move away from them a little, the poor definition of the textures that cover them as well as a certain monotony (basically the textures change only when the level changes); the poorly legible writings and the few animations of the enemies are also added. Even the sound is not entirely convincing: I haven't finished the game yet but I can say with certainty that the background music is very few while the sound effects are more convincing, among which we can appreciate the presence of a series of vocal samples. The difficulty seemed well calibrated to me (moreover you can choose between two levels), but the longevity is undermined by a certain monotony of the action and the stages; this is not a real defect but someone used to the variety of situations of some latest generation fps could turn up their noses. Fortunately, the programmers have included a part dedicated to multiplayer, consisting of the classic Death Match and an unprecedented mode called Matrix Assault. In both you fight against three characters (human or computer controlled) but, in the latter mode, you have to change your alter ego every four fragged enemies (in total there are five characters, each equipped with a specific weapon). Summing up Back Track is undoubtedly a fun title for those who can tolerate somewhat spartan graphics and the lack of variety in the actions to be performed. For all the others, I recommend the rental before a possible purchase. Pros: Immediate Fluid and fast You can challenge three friends Cons: Graphics a bit confusing Lack of variety of situations Almost non-existent music Fans of b-movies about aliens trying to take over the Earth by ~borrowing~ our bodies will feel a certain sense of deja vu as they read the story (told as if it were a science fiction tale) in the English manual that accompanies the game . Jim Track (who would then be you) is informed of the shady plans of an alien with the unpronounceable name of Domingoaniax. The bad guy has seen fit to betray his fellow men and to conquer his planet and the rest of the Universe; the plan involves the occupation of a secret Earth base on the moon (BSBODSOM the code name) and the kidnapping, via teleportation, of hundreds of men to be transformed, after mutation into cyborgs and other disgusting-looking creatures, into the soldiers who will go to replenish his army. Naturally, the last hope of the entire Universe is you and so, equipped with a miserable pistol and a mega battery in your backpack (the battery will be needed later to be able to use some weapons), you set off to save all the humans held hostage by Domingoaniax .", "date": "2002-11-08", "grade": null}
