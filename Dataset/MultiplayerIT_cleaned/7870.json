Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Born about ten years ago on the Game Boy Advance, the WarioWare series has certainly cleared the idea of the compilation of absurd minigames in the West, characterized by an apparently devoid of aesthetics. of meaning because it is hand in glove with a way of understanding humor that is all Japanese. Fortunately, even in Italy this type of culture has developed over time and among young gamers it is now rare to find someone who does not smile in front of a ~super deformed~ character with a funny expression. The Nintendo franchise also had the merit, with the transition to the Nintendo DS, of opening the doors of this particular trend to touch controls, even more immediate and capable of making the experience universally usable, adopting a casual approach by definition. Well, Gioco pi difficile mai 2, horrible Italian translation of the original Hardest Game Ever 2, is precisely the son of this tradition and proudly carries it forward on iOS and Android devices, enjoying extraordinary success and popularity. The title developed by Orangenose Studio is in fact at the top of the US, UK, German and Australian charts, which undoubtedly represents proof of its qualities, promoted in an extraordinary way also thanks to the fact that the game can be downloaded for free and not uses an invasive IAP system, with the possible outlay of only 89 cents in case you want to unlock the arcade mode as well as the one available by default. In short, if we are good enough, we will be able to unlock all twenty-four minigames in the collection without putting a hand in the wallet. The question is: will we really succeed? Faster! Time is the determining variable for our success in Hardest Game Ever 2, which means that we will have to face all the challenges as quickly as possible, stopping the timer within a range that allows us to obtain the best rating (S) and therefore to unlock the following missions through a simple prize system. The structure includes four levels of difficulty, each with six absurd minigames to be tackled by acting on the touch screen or using accelerometer control, even if the latter solution is rarer. Often three buttons appear in the lower part of the screen to be pressed with as many fingers when certain images are revealed, for example a feather tickling the sole of a foot or eggs falling from above towards a cook's head and that we must ~block~ as close to their finish line as possible. The visual representations for each minigame are varied and fun, and you will hardly find other games in which we are asked to carry out the necessary steps for our character to be able to sit on the toilet in the throes of a nocturnal urge, or to give exactly forty-seven slaps to a guy who harassed you on the street (as a girl, of course). The developers have fielded a series of really crazy ideas and have made them concrete in the best possible way, giving us truly arduous challenges that are based not only on coordination and glance, but also on quick reasoning. The final result, also thanks to a perfectly themed technical sector, is irresistible.", "date": "2013-04-27", "grade": "8.5"}
