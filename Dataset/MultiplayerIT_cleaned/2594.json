{"name": "Diablo II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diablo-ii.html", "text": "ARPG extension What a strange acronym! Is it maybe a new type of RAM? Or maybe it identifies a sophisticated electronic device? Well this acronym, on the other hand, was coined to describe the first Diablo and it means Action Role Playing Game and tends to differentiate the Blizzard product from traditional role-playing games. In fact, the action component is superior to other games of the genre (see Baldur's Gate or Ultima) and therefore for RPG purists it is important to differentiate the two types (indeed for some Diablo is a simple Arcade). Two fundamental characteristics of a good RPG, the NPCs (non-player characters n.d.Pucci) and the Quests, were present in Diablo in a completely marginal way, furthermore the same skills of our character did not allow for a great specialization. However, Diablo's success was total. On the other hand, accurate graphics, engaging music (in this respect those of Blizzard are wizards) and an out of the ordinary playability have decreed its absolute success. Let's not talk about the multiplayer that really made school. In short, Diablo is one of those games that can boast the title of masterpiece (and there aren't many). Justified, therefore, the enormous expectation that has arisen around Diablo II in these three years that separate it from its predecessor. Okay. We are ready. All right, we've made up our minds and open this rich package which contains the game on 3 CDs and a good manual in Italian (there are some small imperfections but nothing traumatic). In this regard, it is fair to remember that the game distributed by Leader is entirely in our language. The installation is usually taken care of like any Blizzard product, but what surprises me (especially in relation to the old title) is the amount of data that will have to reside on our Hard Disk. Imagine that the recommended version (the one for Multiplayer) occupies almost 1 Giga! During the installation we can enable support for accelerated graphics which is one of the novelties of this new chapter. Actually the 3D effects refer only to the effects of some spells and to a new visual mode, but that's okay, on the other hand I believe that polygonal graphics are not very suitable for this type of game (at least for now). The full support with Windows NT and Windows 2000 OS deserves another mention. The introductory movie is as state of the art Blizzard tradition, by the way I didn't tell you that the 3 CDs are labeled as Installation, Game and Cinematic. At the end we are faced with the first big news: the characters have now grown in number and their characteristics have changed. In fact, in the previous chapter the heroes differed only on the basis of the basic characteristics and the maximum achievement of these. That's all. This time things are very different and each character has absolutely unique characteristics and abilities. But let's see them in detail: Amazon The sweet is beautiful Amazon is a master in the use of ranged weapons and has an uncommon agility. His skills are given by the combination of primitive magic with the Holy one and is skilled in the construction of weapons. Barbarian If they had called him Bulldozer it was better. A true power of nature that makes physical strength its main weapon. He can easily fight wielding two weapons and also manages to increase his strength thanks to a primitive type Magic. Necromancer It's one of my favorites. Its main feature lies in awakening the dead and using the residual energy of corpses. In practice it can awaken an army of skeletons and Golems to support during the clashes. He is also endowed with good physical strength and excellent dexterity. Paladino The maximum of honesty and devotion. In short, a good boy! He is endowed with great strength and proves to have excellent familiarity with weapons. In addition, his great faith gives him a magical strength not bad. Enchantress Another beautiful girl but I would never dare to invite to dinner! (You never know what you can do). She is an expert sorceress in elemental forces and also has a strong body but disdains physical confrontation. I spoke of ability not by chance! In Diablo we were dealing with spells, here there is a skill tree that has a very specific path. Obviously it is possible to increase one skill over another according to our tastes. Skill points are earned at each level change or are donated to us for completing a Quest correctly. In addition, each character develops their own skills that are absolutely different from those of other characters. e.gPious the Necromancer can create creatures from corpses while the Amazon can use an infinite number of magical bolts. This system also translates into an uncommon longevity that can push us to complete the game with the different characters. Another distinction must be made for Passive and Active Skills. The difference is quite simple to understand and as an example I bring the Necromancer's skeleton resurrect ability. Recalling a skeleton back to life has a cost of Mana (and this is the active skill, i.e. the creation of the skeleton takes away some Mana), while the characteristics of the skeleton (understood as strength and longevity) depend on the Passive Skills (which do not cost Mana). Clear? So when we choose how to distribute Skill points we must also ask ourselves if a powerful but expensive Magic is better than many but weak ones. Speaking of magic, we must point out the absence of magical volumes that conferred certain potentialities. The tomes are there but they only serve to contain the parchments. Now let's talk about the level up system. We don't have any news here and we will find the classic Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Energy as well as resistance to Fire, Cold, Lightning and Poison which we can increase with the points acquired at each level-up or through objects. Graphics and sound One of the reasons for the discussion that concerned Diablo II lies in Blizzard's choice to maintain a video resolution of only 640x480, which in fact in full 2000 makes you smile. For the avoidance of doubt, I exclude the possibility that the game could see the implementation of a patch that increases its resolution, considering that keeping the resolution low is a very specific choice and therefore there will be no second thoughts of any kind. The problem is mainly due to the size of the monitor rather than the actual graphic rendering of the 640x480 resolution. In short, those who have a 19~ monitor are penalized compared to a smaller one. The usual isometric perspective is available, as well as a new one that creates a pleasant perspective effect giving the impression of being in a 3D world. In practice, let's see the objects have their own volume and move in a different way compared to the point of view of perspective. The latter mode is only available if the card supports Direct 3D. I prefer this new mode over the classic one, although it must be admitted that something is lost in definition given that the game is always in 2D. The dynamic light effects that are present are very nice, especially in the Dungeons, and that make our adventure much more pleasant. Furthermore, unlike what happened in Diablo, now the conditions of the times vary, such as those of the brightness of the day, but the only implications are only of a graphic nature. There is little to say about the audio. The music is, as usual, beautiful and the dialogues are localized in a masterly way. The rain and the other ambient sounds are spectacular, as are the screams of the monsters. On this point, Blizzard dictates the law, there is no discussion! To underline the presence of the option to activate 3D audio. Interface and objects Here we don't find upheavals, but only improvements, on the other hand one of the strengths was the simple and immediate interface (but not without flaws). Let's start by saying that, finally, we can run, and in fact there is a Vigor bar that decreases with the run until it runs out, and at that point, before resuming the run, we have to wait for it to grow back. As usual there are the two spheres that contain our Vitality and Mana, and which maintain the same functions they had in Diablo. The inventory hasn't changed, instead we have the possibility to keep our riches inside a chest that is located in the center of each city. The function of the belt has been expanded, which can now hold more items, and the capacity is not the same for each belt. How many of you have happened to leave an object on the field just because we hadn't seen it? Well in Diablo II it can't happen again! In fact, it is possible to associate the vision of all objects on the ground with a key (by default Alt). To facilitate movement, it will be possible to use tele-transports which are found in certain locations and which have no contraindication in their use. The only way to access them is to find them, at which point they will be included in the list of possible locations. Simple isn't it? As usual, the rescue system can be perfected, given that if we re-enter the game we will find all the monsters we had killed sprightly and ready to kill us. On the other hand, the spawn is absentyou during a continuous game, and therefore the monsters eliminated during our travels do not recur again, at least until the next game. This requires us to terminate a Quest in one go, otherwise we'd have to start all over again. There is a renewed Quest window that reminds us of the tasks to be completed and those already completed. The very useful auto-map has been improved and now gives us much more information than before, such as the location of dungeons, shrines, other players, NPCs and more. A great novelty lies in the possibility of hiring other warriors (obviously commanded by the CPU) who line up alongside us. I think this was also done to make singleplayer feel the overall game of multiplayer, in any case it is not possible to issue orders to our companions, but in any case the result is undoubtedly valid. As far as the objects are concerned, the only variations of note concern the wear and the housings for the stones. We find all the types already present in the first episode and therefore we will have to deal with weapons of all types, armor, gloves, rings, scrolls and so on. Finally, objects no longer break when worn out and simply become unusable, but it will be enough to repair them to have them functional again. Another novelty concerns some precious stones that can be set in certain objects that have very specific housings and which give the object particular magical properties. I conclude the discussion of the controls by pointing out the possibility of modifying all the keys to adapt them to our needs. Singleplayer and Storyline I don't want to tell you much about the plot, it would be a shame to reveal it. Better to enjoy it a little at a time. Can't you find? However I can safely tell you that we are following the trail of a man called ~The Tramp~ who is none other than the old hero who defeated Diablo in the first chapter and who is now about to be overwhelmed by the Diablo inside him! We will find many dear friends and there will be twists and turns. We will also pass through Tristram, the old town featured in the first episode! What can be said is that there are many more Quests to tackle and which can also be tackled in a non-linear way (obviously not all of them, given that in any case there is a precise plot to follow). This time the locations are much more varied and there are also outdoor scenarios. We will also be able to enter the buildings, in this case a nice fade will show us the inside of the structure. The cities are four and all very vast and interesting. In short, a solid plot, a lot of enemies, some interesting Quests. But what more could you want from life! The monsters are many and made quite well (certainly the resolution does not help much in this sense), and finally we will be able to see the health bar above the head of our enemy which will allow us to adjust accordingly. The death of our character is handled in a fairly sweetened way. Indeed, we have two possibilities; restart the game again and in this case we will find all the monsters in the dungeon again and we will lose the gold we had with us but not the objects, or we could take back everything that was ours with the aggressiveness that distinguishes us, immediately returning to the point of our demise. Multiplayer As I said before, one of Diablo's strengths lay in the multiplayer. Obviously this mode has been expanded and made much more complete. Games can now contain a maximum of 8 players, and all the management of your character has also been radically changed. Now on Battle.net there are several Servers (called Realms, a bit like OU) and when you create a player, he can only be used on one of them. So be careful to choose the Server to play on well, since it will then be impossible to change Servers with your own character (after all the effort made to create it!). If you manage to complete the game in Multiplayer mode, a special mode called Hardcore is activated. No nothing to censor don't worry! It's an amazing way to approach the game, basically if you get killed during a game, that's it. Understood? I believe that for us poor Italians afflicted with lag problems it will be a really difficult undertaking to grow a character of this type, but it is important that Blizzard has foreseen such a thing that will make game purists happy! The possibility of seeing a player's character in the chat as we will see him in the game is very nice.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
