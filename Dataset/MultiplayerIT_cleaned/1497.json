Ready or not Those who have had the opportunity to play with Frequency will find descriptions and comments in the next few lines that will smack, in some ways, of deja vu. Basically, in fact, the game mechanics have remained unchanged in this sequel, proposing in a slightly improved key all the good things seen in the predecessor. Amplitude plays the player in the role of a futuristic DJ, armed with an imaginary instrument called the Beat Blaster which, in addition to having the appearance of a spaceship, has the potential to hit the musical capsules, each imbued with notes and chords. The 26 musical tracks present in the game will be sectioned for each instrument, which can be viewed on the screen in the form of a path full of icons. Depending on the beats per minute of the various songs, these tracks will move more or less quickly towards the Beat Blaster, with the consequent burden on the player to hit the various capsules in the pre-established time. Passing from instrument to instrument, therefore, if fast and precise enough, he will compose the whole song, the only way to be able to fully hear it. In fact, to understand if you are playing well or not, just listen to the song: if in the middle of the track you will hear a few instruments playing, it will mean that things are not going too well; on the other hand, every time the sound makes use of all the musical sections it will mean that you are playing great. The concept is therefore easy to say: to be able to enjoy the numerous musical proposals it will be necessary to work hard, and not a little. In fact, this Sony title requires qualities of all kinds: from the sense of rhythm to the speed of execution, passing through the mastery of the pad up to having a quick eye in capturing all the intersections presented by the capsules. This game is tough, a perennial challenge against yourself and your abilities. In fact, if in the first two of the four difficulty levels things will be affordable after a few hours of play; in the last two levels, appropriately named Brutale and Folle, combinations bordering on the inhuman will present themselves, with peculiar cases in which a certain sense of frustration will be felt. However, the beauty of Amplitude is also this, that is to succeed where at first it seemed prohibitive. The rock show A context like that of Amplitude requires a graphic sector full of style, even more indispensable than mere polygonal power. From this point of view it is practically impossible not to be struck by the futuristic and psychedelic look of the Sony title. If the game trails are simplified to the bone, the background presents a world, which will vary from song to song, in perpetual movement. Everything will take place at the time of the music, with the apt help of clips taken directly from the videos of the various artists, immortalized in a myriad of boxes present all over the screen. Furthermore, at certain points in the various tracks, the player will be hit by text explosions taken directly from the words of the authors. An authentic tribute to style, to which the soundtrack must be added. The highlight of any rhythm game is unquestionably and inescapably the soundtrack. This time Sony has really outdone itself, giving all fans of this genre a series of artists of real thickness: Pink, the white duke David Bowie, POD, Garbage, Run DMC and Blink 182 are just some of the names present in Amplitude , which compared to its predecessor manages to touch practically all musical genres. Comment Amplitude manages to revive and reinvigorate the excellent predecessor, thanks to a killer soundtrack and a gameplay that leads the player to an eternal challenge against himself. The only real flaw of the Sony title is precisely the excessive difficulty of certain passages, resulting in this being sporadically frustrating. Ultimately this title is consBest suited to anyone looking for a great rhythm game and at the same time a game capable of offering a decidedly massive challenge. For all those who disdain the genre, however, the advice is to give this Amplitude at least one chance, because it is truly capable of converting anyone to the genre. Pros: Fabulous soundtrack. A robust but rewarding challenge. Graphically inspired. Lots of game modes. Cons: Some gaming sessions can be frustrating. If you don't like the genre... Looking carefully at the Playstation2 line up, without scrolling too far back, you can see how a title released on the sly only last year literally managed to send music lovers all over the world into raptures. An intriguing game concept and a pleasant soundtrack made Frequency an unmissable title for all lovers of music played via pad. Sony, strengthened by the great consensus received, has seen fit to try again, again delegating the development to the American Harmonix and providing the game with a pleasant feature such as the possibility of playing online. So Amplitude, this is the title of the sequel, arrives in our ital-musicophile lands proposing all the good things that have been seen in the predecessor, without however rejecting the further improvement of a work that is already in itself precious.", "date": "2003-11-07", "grade": null}
