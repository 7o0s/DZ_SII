{"name": "Syphon Filter 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syphon-filter-3.html", "text": "Yes, but what is it?? For the few who don't know it, the Siphon Filter of the title is a lethal virus and periodically the object of the desire of the super terrorists who have tried  in vain  to put the world at their feet throughout the saga. As you can imagine, we will again have to put ourselves in the shoes of the aforementioned Gabriel Logan, an agent of a secret agency that fights crime on an international scale but which, as you will know if you have played the previous chapters, has too many bad apples among traitors in its ranks , infiltrators and double agents. Precisely from these points (why has the government never managed to discover the intrigues of the agency in time? Have your bosses always been in cahoots with terrorists? Who is behind all this machination?) left hanging especially in the In his last adventure, the general plot of the game unfolds: you, together with some trusted companions, have been placed under investigation by the shady Senator Vincent Hadden, ready to defame poor Gabe at any cost and At any price. Thus, after an unusual start to the game in a Tokyo hotel, intent on assassinating a corrupt Chinese general - with a very elegant James Bond tuxedo that looks so Sean Connery - the story will develop between many old missions, remembered during the interrogation for the investigation I mentioned above. In a nutshell, these flashbacks will have you facing several old dead and buried enemies, from the jungle of the second mission taken from the introduction of the first game to the final confrontation. Fortunately, however, this time you will be able to lead four different characters: in addition to Gabe Logan and his assistant Lian Xing in fact, you will play the role of two other old acquaintances such as Dr. Lawrence Mujari, busy freeing slaves held captive in a diamond mine in her homeland, and Teresa Lipan, who supposedly died in Siphon Filter 2 at the hands of traitorous agent Chance. What's new? To answer this last sentence I could easily add ~nothing~ to a first view of the game but, looking closely, there are several interesting additional elements. First of all, the variety of settings, which include not only Tokyo and the jungle of Costa Rica but also Australia, the American mountains and the sadly current Kabul, make the game quite varied, and the fact that the levels can be tackled following different and non-linear roads (at least initially) give the whole a greater realism. On the other hand, however, the size of some virtual terrains can cause various orientation problems and not infrequently you will die for having lost your way at the wrong time, with the growing proliferation of enemies and perhaps just for not having seen one of the crates full of bulletproof vests camouflaged in the territory. Therefore, the real novelty is not found either in the single or multiplayer mode, but rather in the introduction of the so-called ~mini missions~ option, which consists of a kind of training (rather fun to tell the truth) in which you can face as your favorite character from levels taken from the entire SF trilogy, with the aim of defusing bombs, eliminating all the enemies in the scene, stealing a briefcase, assassinating certain people without being discovered or..Win a shooting contest to the target! The technical point Nothing to complain about either the graphics or the sound: we are dealing with one of the last - if not really the very latest - great games for PSX and the technical side has really been taken care of to the max. The developers of EIDETEC have equipped the game with music full of tension (and for once even the localization in Italian is passable), and the numerous cutscenes that start and end the missions have reached a state of semi-perfection, at least for the hardware of the console. To find some technical defects, I can only say from a strictly personal point of view that the graphics of the game, although good, appear really dated and are not reluctant to some isolated bugs which mainly concern the AI of the enemies and the same: like it also happens in the other two episodes in fact your opponents will often be unable to perform even the most basic evasive actions, while the protagonist continues to have problems with his self-aim; continuing to frame a dead terrorist while the enemies still alive tear him apart. For the rest, however, nothing to complain. Do I buy it or not? This is really a good question. I highly recommend the game to fans of the series, but I thinkthat they, too, may have gotten bored because, innovations or not, it's still the same game. I can only recommend it to those who have never seen Siphon Filter and want a good action game, while others should perhaps think about it a bit, or buy it if they really want to see how the hell the conspiracy around Agent Logan ends . Over and out: happy holidays in advance everyone! Pros: Nice action game All the story kinks come together Four different characters and mini-quests Cons: It's always the same story Graphics are starting to look dated Sometimes it can be frustrating A small introduction A few years ago, at the time of the (great, but it seems superfluous to add) return of Metal Gear, most of the public and critics condemned the first Siphon Filter, despite some excellent judgments and evaluations from the press and the players themselves , like an average, no-ideas clone of Konami's masterpiece. Today, the third episode of Gabe Logan's adventures represents the swan song of the Playstation, which has now reached the end of its life cycle but is determined to exit the scene in style", "date": "2002-01-04", "grade": null}
