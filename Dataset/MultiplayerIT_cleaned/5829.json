Among the software houses that have led the arrival on PC, Omega Force is certainly one of the most active with several chapters of the Dynasty Warriors saga which has recently been added Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree and the Roots of Evil, spin-off of the highly successful Square Enix series which aims to combine the proven formula of the much loved musou in Japan with a franchise with a very different gameplay. The PC version of Dragon Quest Heroes stands out for having little customization of the graphics settings Not too musou From a gameplay point of view, as already underlined in the PlayStation 4 review, Omega Force's experiment managed to further improve the formula already tested by a title with a similar philosophy such as Hyrule Warriors, thanks to the addition of role-playing elements very well implemented in the game structure. The adventures of Aurora and Lucyus will take us and explore every corner of the kingdom of King Doric, in the company of a large group of companions all usable in battle. This is the first pleasant introduction that pushes the game structure of Dragon Quest Heroes away from the repetitiveness typically inherent in musou games. The party of four characters can be managed and developed at will ensuring an excellent rate of variety, with the added possibility during fights to switch from one hero to another in real time to make the most of each specific set of skills. In fact, once the sword has been unsheathed, if on the one hand we found ourselves faced with a very simplified combat system clearly deriving from musou, with the presence of a fast attack and a charged one, the parry and lateral dodge, on the other we have appreciated some introductions designed to give greater depth to the gameplay, such as the ability to cast spells by consuming magic points. Each character has three magical attacks available which underline their skills and contribute to deepening their characterization, already visually excellent thanks to the work of the master Akira Toriyama: for example Aurora masters the elements of ice to freeze enemies and Lucyus is a skilled swordsman capable to sink flaming thrusts, causing massive splash damage. In addition, it is possible to summon creatures onto the battlefield to be left to guard sensitive points while we are busy completing a secondary objective, adding further depth to the structure of the missions. The fights are less crowded than the hundreds of enemies that we usually face in any title of the Dynasty Warrior saga and related, but always set in large arenas with dynamic objectives to complete. What gains from it is above all the overall quality of the polygonal models of the protagonists and enemies, as well as the quality of the animations that are decidedly more accurate than the average of the genre. The whole is embellished by a beautiful cel-shaded graphic style that is even more appreciable on PC given the lower presence of aliasing, even if something more could have been done. Few options One of the negative aspects of the PC version of Dragon Quest Heroes is the frame rate locked at 60 fps, a certainly high value but which given the modest hardware requests could have been easily overcome even by video cards with more than one spring on their shoulders. Similarly, the maximum supported resolution is only 1920x1080 pixels, or the classic Full HD with 16:9 ratio exactly like the console version. This aspect also translates into a qualitative limit in the use of the title, given that in the PC gaming field monitors with higher resolution or different formats from 16:9 are increasingly common: in this case, owners of panels with different values will necessarily have to adapt in the presence of uncomfortable more or less marked black bands on the sides of the image. The graphic options that you can get your hands on are quite limited and all characterized by just three values - low, medium, high - without the possibility of intervening directly on the choice of filters to apply. The quality of the polygonal models of the characters displayed, the richness of texture details, the particle effects and the global brightness are reduced to these three parameters, while shadows, ambient occlusion, reflections and light rays can also be completely deactivated to meet the less performing systems. If, on the other hand, we look in the direction of more specific customization,the total lack of options weighs a lot: antialiasing, as well as ambient occlusion filters cannot be chosen at will but only through predefined values, further reducing the range of possibilities available to players. In short, it seems that this version of Dragon Quest Heroes has been taken from the console and added to the Steam catalog with only a slight optimization work, mostly aimed at avoiding bottlenecks and frame rate drops with the very wide range of hardware available on the market. To give you an idea, we didn't struggle to run it at 60 frames per second with all settings set to high on a GTX 670. Many options are missing and customization is bare bones, which is a real shame given that the title it does not struggle to run very smoothly even on dated hardware.", "date": "2015-12-14", "grade": "7.5"}
