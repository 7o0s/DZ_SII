{"name": "Virtua Cop: Elite Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-cop-elite-edition.html", "text": "Winning biology In addition to the cosmetics, at the time well-kept for both episodes, the two Virtua Cops should be remembered, first of all, for the decidedly accurate gameplay: selected the starting stage, the player (or players), in the role of Michael Hardy, James Cools and Janet Marshall (present only in Virtua Cop 2 and in the fighting game Fighter's Megamix, also by Am2) must thwart the criminal plans of the local underworld, in the above case Virtua City, teeming (as well as statues of Sarah Briant, posters of Virtua Fighter 4 and many other quotes from Virtua Fighter) by many bad guys. As in the other home conversions of the saga, the very high number of continues and hit points can be the death of this interesting collection, leading users to solve both games in a couple of hours; instead setting the difficulty level to normal and limiting the credits and lives to a few units (three or four lives, certainly not nine or, even worse, infinite credits), the gameplay becomes more balanced and only the most experienced will be able to finish the two games within a few hours, with the help of hit points to be replenished and additional weapons (machine gun and automatic pistol), obtainable by killing some zuzzurelloni who, generally, make their appearance in the most chaotic moments or for short periods of time or , again, by destroying certain elements of the seabed; new in this collection are the images that will form the game gallery, obtainable with the aforementioned methods in the field of weapons and extra hit points. Thankfully, the gameplay from the saga has been kept intact in this pack as well; hundreds of opponents will come forward in the seven game levels, all of which can be visited individually or not, necessarily, starting from the first (three stages for a single game, but in Virtua Cop 2 a fourth level is accessible, with the real final boss , only by successfully completing the previous ones), proposing a pace of the game that is at least frenetic with a few moments of pause, generally the most subtle, with traps and ambushes nearby (in addition to the hostages not to be sent to a better life, under penalty of losing a hit point ). However, as is the custom of this videogame genre, once you have learned all the patterns of the enemies, visited all the levels (Virtua Cop 2 at least has a crossroads per level, special stage excluded), only a lightning-fast gameplay remains to be consumed every now and then. perhaps for the desire to break the latest record, to spend a few carefree hours of videogaming between an RPG and a simulator or to test one's reflexes with an ever smaller number of lives and lives and a higher level of difficulty. In the appendix of the paragraph, we must point out the (unfortunately tested) incompatibility with the guncon 45 as well as a certain safety in case the canonical dual shock 2 is used, in which case the gameplay still remains sufficiently fun. Graphics and sound With a graphic restyling that is efficient compared to the original arcade versions, masterful compared to the (albeit excellent) home versions but unfortunately disappointing compared to the potential of the Emotion chip enclosed in Playstation 2, the inevitable disquisition opens up on the strengths and weaknesses of the technical side of Virtua Cop: Elite Edition. A polygonal engine, degraded by obvious aliasing and flickeriing problems, sends constant fifty frames per second, not worried by any slowdowns or drops in the frame rate, due to a polygon count that ranks between the graphic potential of a Nintendo 64 and a Dreamcast, due to poorly cared for sprites and decidedly subdued backdrops compared to, say, Time Crisis 2, also fished out (with delay) by the arcade market but with a redefined cosmetics in an enormously more satisfying way than this re-edition of Virtual Cop. The music, seen from the point of view of the fan or the nostalgic, are the faithful reproduction of the original ones which, taken for what they are, do not show particularly whistable symphonies or melodies to insert in the CD or cassette and enjoy them in the car. The same fate has befallen the sound effects, decidedly cleaner than in previous editions, while the smallness and anonymity of the vocal samples remain. Conclusions Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is an unmissable product for fans of the saga and for those looking for a fun game to enjoy with their Guncon 2, by virtue of the gameplay set at high levels, although the presence of some extra levels would have greatly benefited the new Am2 product, graphically far below the potential of the 128 bit Sony and with a sound sector far from being irresistiblebile. In any case a good product, the second best light gun shooter for Playstation 2, a must have, we reiterate, if you are a fan of the saga or if you know Time Crisis 2 like the back of your hand and Vampire Night bored you after solving it a couple of times. Pros: Must buy for fans of Virtua Cop 2 super fun games for the price of one Second best game for Guncon 2 Cons: Poor technical execution A few extra levels would have helped greatly Virtual cop, deluxe edition Among the innumerable merits of Sega, it must undoubtedly be recognized that of having been the brand that, de facto, launched three-dimensional graphics applied to innovative videogames (Virtua Fighter) or to already existing videogame genres, exponentially increasing the coefficient of exaltation, thanks to the of the Model Series designed by Lockeed Martin; from the wonderful Virtua Racing, passing through Daytona Usa, Sega Rally and dozens of other indelible masterpieces over time, SErvice Games has produced some of the most idolized and ~cloned~ coin-ops in history thanks to first-rate cosmetics and captivating gameplay. Among these, Virtua Cop should be mentioned, a shootem'up with a pistol created by the famous Am2 team, led by Yu Suzuki, the guru who ~gave us~ Out Run, Hang On, Virtua Fighter, Shen Mue and many other undisputed must have games for the arcade market, as well as for the home one (primarily Sega consoles to arrive, nowadays, at a bit of all the hardware currently in vogue). Although the game mechanics were not exaggeratedly dissimilar from that of the various Operation Wolf/Thunderbolt of Taitiana memory, the graphic sector made of polygons and tasty textures at 30 frames per second charmed the gamer (thanks to the Model 1 bar card), initially ready to shell out fine coins to be able to overcome the 3 game levels, and then return repeatedly in the comfort of one's home, thanks to the faithful conversion for Sega Saturn which, in Christmas 1995 (together with two other highly anticipated conversions, Virtua Fighter 2 and Sega Rally ) helped this console, for a short period of time, to surpass the sales of the then already very strong Sony Playstation in Japan. Years later, Am2, strengthened by the potential of Model 2, launched the inevitable sequel, characterized by a clearly superior graphic realization thanks to the greater power of the then queen of coin-op cards (second half of the 90s), capable of showing off exciting car chases, between the 4 game levels, this time with crossroads that can be traveled at the discretion of the gamer, to the full advantage of the replayability of the coin-op and the subsequent home conversion for Saturn, later revived, unfortunately, verbatim (with the help of Windows CE) on Sega Dreamcast. The Elite Edition here present is a sort of collection of the first 2 episodes, with an evident visual facelift compared to the originals and a sprinkle of not-to-be-disdained extras here and there.", "date": "2003-01-27", "grade": null}
