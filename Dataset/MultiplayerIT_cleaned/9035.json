This is more or less the incipit of Temple Run, the new ~running game~ developed by Imangi Studios for Apple devices and belonging to the category of freemium titles, i.e. those games (increasingly numerous) that can be downloaded for free and which your earnings from an in-game purchase system that allows you to gradually unlock new items or to have ~everything now~. Unlike Indiana Jones, in this nice video game we will have to run to escape not a huge rock, but a herd of dangerous howler monkeys who are chasing us from the ~mouth~ (literally) of a temple where our character got stained of who knows what sacrilege. The only present mode sees us running endlessly or at least trying to do so, given the large number of obstacles that we will find along the way, each of which must be faced in a different way to preserve the only life we have. The interesting thing is that you cannot prepare yourself psychologically for a game with Temple Run: the course changes randomly each time and the difficulty gradually increases, so we will find ourselves facing an ever-changing challenge, in which the only elements of progression are made up of tokens that we can collect and the many unlockable achievements. The Running Man We were saying: tokens and achievements. The former must be collected along the way and allow us to buy a series of ~power-ups~ that can be used during the games: bonuses to multiply the number of tokens, invisibility, boosts that can make us splash for many meters without worrying about traps, even additional characters and the possibility of exploiting an extra life, albeit at a high price. As already mentioned, Temple Run is a freemium title and therefore allows us to play for free, but has an in-game purchase system to obtain extra tokens at variable prices: 79 cents for 2,500 tokens, 3.99 euros for 25,000, 7 .99 euros for 75,000 and finally 15.99 euros for 200,000 tokens. It is even possible to buy 2,500 tokens simply by agreeing to display banner ads during the action. As for the achievements, there are about twenty of them and they must be unlocked by completing particular objectives: running for five hundred meters without collecting any tokens, collecting a thousand tokens, covering a distance of a certain number of meters, totaling a certain score and so on. These are certainly boundary elements with respect to the actual game, but which in fact make us want to ring one game after another to try to get this or that extra. Going back to gameplay, Temple Run uses a control system based on a combination of touch screen and accelerometer: the former is called upon to read our ~gestures~ and produce a consequent reaction, the latter is used to move the character to the right or left on the path and therefore collect any tokens present. The protagonist can jump if we draw a line upwards with our fingers, he can slide if on the contrary we draw a line downwards and finally he can turn left or right on the basis of slides taken in one or the other direction. As the meters are covered, the pitfalls multiply and occur more frequently: chasms, bottlenecks, flaming circles, large roots and finally sudden changes of direction. Just one mistake and it's game over, which on the one hand makes the game very exciting and addictive, on the other hand inevitably frustrating.
