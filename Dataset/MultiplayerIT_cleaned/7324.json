A long period, but quite in line with the development times of the Japanese company, which in this case have led it to go from practically two generations of consoles. In addition to making them make choices, in terms of planning and gameplay, which are perhaps not appropriate and certainly not very appreciated by a large part of the public. As our most attentive readers will remember, with Final Fantasy XIII Square Enix decided to try to rejuvenate the franchise and enter the next gen, largely distorting the original concept, that is to say many of those characteristics that had defined its aspects over time main. From the villages in which to interact with the population, to the more or less open spaces where to get lost freely, to the turn-based fights, everything was eliminated as if they were a ballast. This in favor of gameplay focused on action and continuous clashes, in an adventure with a linear trend. For these reasons, accused by the fans of having distorted the very concept of a Japanese role-playing game, Square Enix created a sort of spin-off a couple of years later to try to smooth out all the defects of the illustrious original, and reinstate many of those items deleted in the predecessor. And now, at the conclusion of what can now be defined as a trilogy within chapter thirteen, the Japanese company is still trying to change to seek the right balance between innovation and tradition. The end of Nova Chrysalia is upon us, the world's last hope is a young girl named Lightning Curiosity Before starting to play it is possible to select the level of difficulty by choosing between the easy or standard options. These settings affect various aspects of the adventure: for example, the first makes enemies easier to defeat, the recovery of Life Points occurs automatically and there are no penalties in case of fleeing from battle. Conversely, in normal mode, you are punished with the subtraction of an hour if you run away from the fight or have to regain your health using the classic potions or healing spells, or by eating in a restaurant. Completing the game once unlocks a third mode, the hard one. The end of the world Since telling the story behind the game is an impossible undertaking without running the risk of ruining the surprise, let's say briefly that it is centered on the character of Lightning, who awakens five hundred years after the events narrated in Final Fantasy XIII, in proximity to a catastrophe of biblical proportions. The forces of Chaos have in fact invaded Nova Chrysalia, a land now oppressed and hopeless, and the girl is charged by the god Bhunivelze to save the souls of the population. Or at least as many people as possible, to help them transmigrate into his new world of light. From these premises develops an adventure in which the ~Holy Savior~, who in exchange for her ~services~ could see her sister Serah again, will have to travel far and wide to fulfill her assignment before everything ceases to exist. Quite a difficult undertaking given that to complete this mission she will have only a few days available and will have to act alone. To accompany her throughout her journey, in fact, this time there is not a party of allies (even if there is no shortage of supporting actors, such as Hope Estheim or Oerba Yun Fang) but, on the other hand, a sort of clock that marks the spend time, counting the minutes related to the events that separate Nova Chrysalia from its end. Time is therefore a central figure in the gameplay economy, as it determines various aspects of it. Starting with the monsters to deal with, passing from the side quests to the progress and development of portions of the plot itself. In this sense, the primary function of the meter is to regulate the cyclical change of day and night, influencing what are the typical activities of a role-playing game: for example, by going to a certain area of the city in the morning, Lightning can find some open shops where you can improve your equipment or your arts, buy upgrades useful for your growth, such as new skills, spells, potions and so on, while among the streets crowded with normal patrons you could meet characters needed to deepen the plot or to start a side mission. Vice versa, showing up in the same place at dusk, the heroine can find a completely different scenario, with the shops closed, the area frequented by terrifying monsters, and lose potential jobshi optional. Among other things, the failure to resolve some secondary quests that are accessible only for a certain period of time can in fact imply collateral damage, such as the loss of precious hours. It therefore becomes essential for the player to pay attention to the times, not to waste even a minute of the day and knowing how to choose which sidequest is worthy of attention and which is not, for the purposes of character growth and gaining points, time and money. In fact, by completing the most important tasks, some of which can also be found on the Wish Table managed by Chocolina, you can get gil, experience points and accessories as a reward, but also Eradia points. The latter are very important, as they are used at the ~headquarters~ of Lightining, the Ark, to sprinkle a sacred tree called Yggdrasil. Whenever it is invigorated by the right amount of life energy, the plant sprouts and prolongs the existence of the world for twenty-four hours, thus allowing a little more time for the main mission, which is initially only seven days, but can be extended to thirteen. It should be noted that on the Ark, where Hope Estheim resides, the counting of the minutes is suspended, and a series of secondary activities can be carried out in addition to resting and stocking up on useful objects. This base is accessed automatically every day at 6.00 in the morning. Playstation 3 trophies Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy offers a good number of trophies to unlock between visible and secret, for a total of 43 divided as follows: 31 bronze, 7 silver, 4 gold and 1 platinum. To get them, you have to meet a series of requests of increasing difficulty made by the game, such as improving the protagonist's weapons, skills and accessories, defeating 500 enemies or a particular monster, such as the first example of the Survivors or a boss, and so on. up to the coveted platinum, which is obtained by unlocking all the others. Dynamism and strategy Giving the player a limit and asking him to respect it, especially within an experience that promises to be very long and free from constraints, may seem counterintuitive, and in some ways perhaps it is. But from the point of view of the developers, in the playful context of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, the risks of such a choice seem well calculated. On balance, the clock didn't seem annoying to us - except for the daily obligation to return to the Ark - despite not allowing excessive loss of time in the exploration phase, as mentioned. However, it is clear that in order to fully enjoy it, without losing practically anything of the secrets of the enormous world of Nova Chrysalia, the title must be replayed other times. In any case, during the exploration phases, the user can count on a series of more dynamic controls on the character, who can hang from the edges of the platforms, hoist himself on elevated sections, jump, crouch behind cover, swing and slide. In short, a wide variety of movements that allow her to interact with the surrounding environment and with obstacles in a different way than in the past. To move faster, however, it is possible to use a monorail or, at a certain point, the traditional and much-loved Chocobo: a useful system for avoiding battles. These, as is the tradition for action RPGs, provide the enemies clearly visible on the screen, and the option for the player to evade them by being careful not to be seen. Otherwise it becomes important to play in advance to obtain advantages in the second phase of the fight: in fact, by pressing the R1 trigger, once you get close to a monster, you can perform a physical attack which, depending on the part of the body hit, i.e. in front or behind, causes damage in a lower or higher percentage on the victim even before being catapulted into the classic battle screen. Once projected there, then, we find a combat system which, unlike what has been seen in the previous chapters of the series with the exception of the two MMOs, provides for the control of the protagonist alone. The action takes place in real time and requires a certain timing not only in carrying out the attacks, but also in dodging and parrying the blows suffered. Lightning enjoys a lot of freedom of movement, and can be moved freely with the left analog stick, while the commands relating to physical or magical attacks, defensive spells, parries and other abilities, are mapped directly to the controller's face buttons, and are therefore imparted simply by pressing the appropriate key. A normal pressure generates a single action, a continuous one a chain. The moves that can be performed are related to the clothes that can be worn by the girl, the real and most important novelty of the game's battle system. In fact, the beautiful heroine has a series of clothes, each characterized by different parameters, which, in addition to modifying her appearance, influence her actions and characteristics. Each suit has its own personal Active Time Battle bar which differs from the others in terms of colour, magic, length and recharging speed, and which is consumed with each action. Once the whole bar has been used, or when it is deemed appropriate, the player can move on to the next style, by acting on the back buttons and allowing the previous one to recharge. The suits available in battle are in fact three, but several can be accumulated in reserve, which determines a fair variability in the mechanics of the fights, immediate and fun yes, but at the same time endowed with a certain depth, especially in the more advanced stages of the game. 'adventure. By combining the characteristics of the clothing items with those of particular accessories, objects and weapons, the user can also customize the heroine as he wishes, creating always different ~dress plus equipment~ assets. Online One of the great novelties of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is the online sector. Remaining connected to the network (the option can be deactivated), the user can share snapshots of the point of the adventure he has reached or his Thoughts of Lightning on Facebook or Twitter, accompanying them with a message or comment. Alternatively, he can interact with other players in an environment called empyrean, using the so-called Messengers, special characters who can only be visible during the game if the appropriate option is activated. These characters, who generally appear completely randomly, can be recognized by the presence of the user's nickname and an icon, both blue. They can carry a message, a snapshot or an object. In fact, with each sharing it is possible to combine a surprise that can be bought by other players: a copy of the shared object will still remain in the seller's inventory. Special techniques To complete the picture relating to the skills available to Lightning there are special techniques powered by the so-called Energy Points. These are generally obtained by winning battles, and their accumulation is monitored by a special circular indicator located at the bottom left of the screen, near the ATB and Life Points bars. For the price of a variable amount of XP, pressing L2 allows you to use powerful techniques such as Dyssynchrony, which slows down the flow of time for enemies, allowing the Savior to rage on them for several seconds. As the potential of Lightning develops, more powerful moves are unlocked, which can often be used at the end of the previous one. For example, within the aforementioned Dyscronia technique, one can use the one called Giostra Furiosa, and so on. These special moves are particularly useful, because some of them can also be exploited outside the battle, perhaps to slow down the passing of the hours, and because during the course of the adventure there are many very difficult monsters to beat. The bestiary in this sense is quite varied, between tiny but lethal beings, and bosses of enormous tonnage, and there is no shortage of unpublished creatures in the Final Fantasy universe, demonstrating a very fervent imagination in their realization. New lives are no longer born on Nova Chrysalia, and this also applies to monsters. Each species is made up of a certain number of specimens and by defeating them all their extinction is decreed. The last specimen of each species still alive is defined as ~surviving~, takes on a purplish color and becomes more powerful than its own kind. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, the visual component of Lightning Returns confirms the not entirely positive impressions we had during the preview. On the one hand the graphics are enhanced by the usual personal and captivating style of Tetsuya Nomura, who despite some excesses, especially in the creation of certain clothes, does not mind, but on the other hand is mortified by a realization that has many basses. In this sense, there is an excessive qualitative difference between the polygonal modeling and the textures of Lightning, and that in particular of certain creatures or some elements of the seabed which, honestly, leave us rather perplexed due to their flatness and poverty of detail. A real pity, because then some settings are globally pleasant, especially those inhabited places characterized by a retro style, where sci-fi architectural elements seem to merge with the classic ones typical of some European capitals, the", "date": "2014-02-11", "grade": "7.8"}
