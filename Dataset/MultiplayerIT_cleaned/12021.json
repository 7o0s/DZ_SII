{"name": "Dynamite Headdy (Virtual Console) - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynamite-headdy-virtual-console-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Today the Treasure brand is linked to the idea of adrenaline-pumping games, which combine epochal clashes with huge bosses with a playful concept in which shooting and running, observing and acting appear as activities mixed with a design with skilful dynamism. The genre in which this ~poetry~ is expressed matters little, and it was just ~yesterday~, in the age of sixteen-bit consoles and two-dimensional bitmap aesthetics, that Treasure decisively cemented this fame with titles of the caliber of Gunstar Heroes or with disruptive originality like the present Dynamite Headdy. Strengthened by the critical and public acclaim received by Gunstar Heroes, a comic anti-Contra and unbalanced on the platform dimension, the types of Treasure decided not to capitalize on the success and instead to express their videogame vision in a radically different product, which would fall within in the platform genre only by giving faith to a decidedly elastic classification. Dynamite Headdy is pure dynamite, a fuse that explodes constantly. The platform game is a pretext, with which the types of Treasure manage to keep us in a state of constant fibrillation. What was it yesterday To begin with, even if you jump from platform to platform, the fundamental interaction with the environment is offered by Headdy, an evident videogame metonym in which title and protagonist don't just coincide, but the part stands for the whole and the symbol for the function. Headdy's head, a removable appendage, is both an offensive and ambulatory means as the offensive move against enemies combines the ability to hold onto platforms, as well as a series of transformations which - in a way not unlike those of colleagues such as Kirby o Kid Chamaleon  grant abilities of all kinds: from miniaturization to reach certain ravines and paths to sucking up bonuses and enemies, from doubled power or speed to the production of offensive flames or multiple heads, from healing sleep to protective bubble. However, all this would still not explain the originality of Dynamite Headdy, which lies mainly in the fact that the platform formula is on the one hand hybridized with crazy interaction, driven by constant interactive divertissements and, on the other, flooded by a proliferation of gags and you find visual. What is it today Dynamite Headdy is a game that has stood the test of time simply because very few other titles have explored variations on the platforming formula like this original experiment. It is a one-of-a-kind platformer, revealed as such right from the start, when the player controls Headdy in a CPU-driven race escape with the other ex-cons from the cruel puppet prison responsible for invading the game's theater world. The player is immediately led to understand that he will have to alternate a certain exploratory freedom with a semi-guided game regime. It can thus happen that Headdy is grabbed by a boss in a mad rush and is forced to go through an entire level without being able to move at will, but only by avoiding hitting too frequently along the walls of the tunnels along which he will have to, limited in control, defeat the boss and his minions. In other, freer sections, the platform concept is devoted to the proliferation of transformations, interaction and clashes, according to a philosophy of excess that offers the player an abundance of choice on how to enjoy walking. The counterpart is a lack of compactness of the experience, the absence of that magnificent simplicity and the surgical control of the Nintendo school, but by criticizing this tendency towards the crazy walk, one would risk not understanding the true spirit of Headdy which, moreover, finds explicit consideration in the aesthetics of the game. What is it today Figurative aspect, animations and videogame languages constantly explode/implode in Headdy, a play-theater in which the backdrops collapse into each other like sets from which insiders hang, the bosses occupy the entire levels, the backdrop elements demand attention to an eye constantly distracted by the visual overabundance, aesthetic styles become entangled in a playful and surreal pastiche, evidently developed by a keen sense of creative (and, at times, quotationistic) free association, as when Headdy confronts a boss in an evident homage in Castelian). Dynamite Headdy, thus, flows all too smoothly, almost making people demand greater freedom to observe the thousand vivid details of the backdrops and characters, up to the fourth or fifth level, after which the difficulty curve undergoes a decidedly unjustified surge. The player is thus forced to try everything again from the beginning, dedicating himself for the sfuture survival to the improbable feat of collecting the very limited life bonuses and continuous extras, compared to which the conquest of the hidden extras appears pure utopia. This is perhaps the biggest flaw of a game that unexpectedly cruelly turns against the player after offering itself as sweet and smooth as an interactive show. Yet even so, Dynamite claims the attention that the publication in the era of full decline of Sega hardware had denied it. If one of the major advantages of an operation like that of Nintendo's Virtual Console is to offer the gaming public games that are too quickly forgotten or superficially considered, Dynamite Headdy is certainly among them. Warmly recommended to all those who are looking for a fun and painful run at breakneck speed in a platform game that thinks it's a traveling theater. Explosive creative outburst of a Treasure fresh off the success of Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy is an anti-platformer as unusual as it is brilliant, resurrected by the Megadrive soft library from a decade and a half oblivion and offered to Wii Virtual Console players in exchange for 800 Wii Points.", "date": "2007-09-10", "grade": null}
