The result, as expected, is a derivative experience to say the least, which draws heavily not only from the usual Call of Duty, but also from titles such as Titanfall and obviously Overwatch. A good? An evil? Certainly the extraordinary technical realization of Modern Combat Versus, which really places the game at the top of what has been seen so far in the mobile sector, makes you bite your fingers compared to what could have been and was not. But let's proceed in order. Having completed a brief tutorial on movements and gunplay, the game immediately launches us into the only mode currently available, ~Control the Area~, a sort of domain in which you have to capture a point on the map and defend it to the bitter end from incursion attempts of the opposing team, with a view to four-on-four matches characterized by a very fast matchmaking (thanks to the long soft launch of the title, which has built a solid user base in view of the official launch) and by a now mature approach to the genre, also and above all as regards the touch controls. Having definitively set aside the cumbersome solution of separate fire, in fact, Gameloft proposes in this case a successful synthesis of what it has learned over the years, with a system that opens fire automatically when an enemy is in the viewfinder, activates the run with a simple dragging the left virtual analog stick and double-tapping the iron sight on the right side of the screen. You shoot over him If wall-running is a clear legacy of Titanfall, it's the set of unlockable characters that calls Overwatch, with each soldier possessing different looks and characteristics, as well as a unique ability to activate when needed: energy shields, detection sensors, focus, extra gear, and so on. The game initially unlocks three agents out of a roster of eleven, allowing us to use them freely within games and to pursue their growth by unlocking experience points, credits and the now inevitable crates to open. The rewards can be used to obtain new characters, although the path to arrive at the necessary figures is obviously longish, where using real money things become practically instantaneous, as was to be expected. However, it must be emphasized that the ~pay to win~ phenomenon has been dampened thanks to a balancing system that prevents us from entering the game with users of a much higher level than ours. Likewise, you are not limited in the number of games you can play in sequence: the traditional action energy indicator is missing. In short, it seems that the developers have been able to develop a fairly elastic and permissive structure (net of the only mode available for the moment), which can be used on several levels and which rests on the solid foundations of a gunplay that is the result of the experience gained so far with the franchise. Visually excellent, we underline it once again, in short, Modern Combat Versus has the only major flaw of disappointing those who expected a new ~narrative~ chapter of the now famous series, transformed into a multiplayer experience only for clear commercial reasons.", "date": "2017-10-08", "grade": "7.8"}
