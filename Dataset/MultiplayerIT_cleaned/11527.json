{"name": "Hard To Be A God - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hard-to-be-a-god-recensione.html", "text": "The first thing you notice about Hard To Be A God is that it has too many instability problems. Already starting it on Vista was not easy. Then, consulting the official forum, we discovered that on some configurations it must be run with administrator privileges and we were able to play with it. Unfortunately, the problems didn't end because trying it, the computer crashed several times making the screen purple and forcing us to restart. Before writing these lines we informed ourselves and we discovered that others have had similar problems, especially Vista users, and for this reason we report them. Well, you are warned. The story begins in a training camp and from here unfolds along a series of linked missions that will form the general framework of the adventure. In the first hours of the game it will not be clear who the enemy is and why we are playing. Perhaps part of the disorientation is due to not having read the book by Arkadi and Boris Strugatzki which forms the background to our adventures (Hard To Be A God starts a few years after the events narrated in the book of the same name... if any Multiplayer.it reader has it read, let us know), the fact remains that there are very few reasons to go on. The very first section of the game is the tutorial which allows you to practice the various commands and actions possible within a training camp. This is enough to realize that the interaction with the scenario is very limited and that the ambition of the developers aimed to create a slightly more complex and articulated Diablo without going too far. It's not that hard to be a god The first impact with the game interface is disturbing. The combat is in real time, with the three mouse buttons allowing different strikes. Fighting on foot is, initially, a real suicide since even the weakest enemies, the wolves, can hurt like hell (do you get the joke?) also considering that energy does not recover except by eating food or drinking the classic red potions, initially very rare. For this reason it is better to explore the first map using a horse. Horses give a whole series of advantages that should be exploited immediately: they enhance our attacks, are faster and absorb the blows of the enemies in our place. Too bad that, being on horseback, the bindings become inexplicably slippery and often fail even if they seem well worn. To overcome the frustration you have to get used to it, even if, especially in the most agitated phases, the imprecision has proved lethal in more than one case. Fighting on foot things improve from this point of view, but worse from others. The hit detection system leaks from all sides and you often find yourself stunned in front of sequences of five or six enemy hits that hit in the face of a single animation. This, especially in the initial stages, makes the clashes hell, creating the need to continuously use the ~hit and run~ tactic, moreover not always effective, given that for unknown reasons the damage is often counted before the start of the animation of the shot and injured even when you think you are far enough away from danger. After a bit of clashes spent wondering how everything works, you get used to it, but you hardly get to find these mechanics exciting, especially when things get complicated and the difficulties increase, exponentially increasing the annoyance as well. Let's go, let's go, let's go explore But Hard To Be A God isn't just about fighting; there's actually a lot to explore... even if every three steps you regularly stumble upon some enemies. The game view is absurd. The camera is positioned behind the protagonist, but not in the canonical position we are all used to and, above all, it cannot be moved freely. The developers have chosen to place it approximately forty-five degrees above the protagonist, thus blocking much of the field of vision. By zooming out (the only possible change) you get a wider view of the surrounding areas, but the camera is positioned about ninety degrees above our hero, further narrowing the field of vision instead of widening it. The problem is obviously not only aesthetic but directly affects the gameplay. Let's take the first map: in a secondary quest we are asked to talk to bandits by disguising ourselves as one of them. Unfortunately, the bandit disguise offers limited defense compared to good armor and therefore we decide to change clothes when we have the types in sight. However, the gang manages to locate us when we, due to the view, have not yet been able to understand where she is holed up. The unica solution is to run away and try again or reload the most recent save to try again taking into account the framing factor (oh well, even if you kill them the quest is still successful). Another case of fixed shot frustration comes in a quest on the third map: we have to look for children in a forest, a pity that we cannot move the shot and that, therefore, it is difficult to identify them in the midst of the dense vegetation that obstructs visibility; not counting the enemies who attack us by surprise in the middle of the quest. Dcollage Comment There would be other criticisms to make to the game (for example the impossibility of choosing the character class which greatly limits the variety), but space is tight and, in any case, we believe you have understood: forget it. The only reason to buy it could be a deep RPG withdrawal crisis that doesn't make you sleep if you don't talk to an innkeeper before going to sleep. Buy an ogre stuffed animal and you're done.
