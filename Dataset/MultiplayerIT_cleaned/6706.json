Nothing more than a diversion to the driving gameplay, accessible via a cabinet in our garage. Despite the goodness and the high quality of these racing games, a real interest was sparked among the fans for this curious extra, for what immediately seemed to be something more than a simple add-on. The style, which has remained unchanged in eleven years of life, is the aesthetically clean one, simple to learn but equally complex to master in the long term, of its debut. Despite the closure of the twenty-year software house, the baton of Geometry Wars passed (together with a part of Bizzarre's employees) to Lucid Games, who have come down to us with the desire to create a wider and better structured version. In short, definitive. Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions is an adrenaline rush that will delight fans Open war on geometry Geometry Wars, for those unfamiliar with this title, is an arcade game with angular shapes, which sees us aboard a ship that has to move in a limited space, with the help of the left stick, and shoot with the right one, moving the thumbstick in the direction of enemy threats to see them fall under the effects of our continuous fire. This combination, born with the joypad in mind, is still the best one. In fact, having the PC version we tried the two further combinations available: keyboard and mouse and keyboard with arrows and ~WASD~, but the result, as well as imprecise, does not allow the same reactivity as the original scheme. Our enemies seem to come out of a game of Tetris, rather than being menacing aliens as we like to think, and they move on the screen both randomly and through direct attacks marked by precise patterns. The aim is therefore to keep a certain distance and hit the counterparts, remembering however that fleeing alone will not allow you to take advantage of the point multipliers, which can only be collected by moving in the direction of the enemy ~carcasses~, which release the indispensable green seeds to see the final score shoot up. The offer is quite substantial: in fact, we can enjoy both the arcade style alone or with the help of a friend locally, and face the game online or in the new Adventure mode. Classic or Adventure mode? In Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions the Classic game mode allows us to open up a certain range of possibilities, all unique. In Deadline we have a time limit of three minutes and we find ourselves limited in the area of a rectangular grid. The objective is to survive until the time runs out and try to score as many points as possible, making the most of the multiplication bonuses. Playing King, however, we do not have any type of weapon equipped, in addition to having only one life. The aim is to jump from one area, called King, to another. In these confined spaces, in addition to having protection from hostile threats, we can shoot to try to make a clean sweep of the threats hovering around us, always keeping in mind that these shelters will ~close~, forcing us to flee to another area , before geometric opponents surround us. Evolved is the classic mode that we have also known and appreciated in other productions, the one that has already made millions of players addicted to space combat. Equipped with three lives and as many bombs, in addition to the complete arsenal, you have to shoot until you drop or the vehicle is shot down... which is inevitable after a while. In Pacifism, precision is fundamental, given the implementation of a very particular rule. With only one life and no weapons, we have the task of going through portals as the only way to survive the advance of the enemy. Mass attacks will see swarms of enemies sweeping across the screen in every possible direction until the last element on screen is destroyed. The co-op portion of the game involves having up to four people connected and sharing the screen. Only one can rely on the keyboard and mouse combo, the others will necessarily have to resort to the pads. The coop is present only offline, while the online multiplayer component involves the accumulation of a score as high as possible to stand out among the other players. Unfortunately it is quite difficult to find someone who is connected online, a defect that will hopefully be mitigated over time as sales grow. If, on the other hand, you want to experience something different, the Adventure-style variant is perfect. fyou will have the knowledge of an unprecedented third dimension, the shapes of which can change from a sphere to a cylinder, to what appears as a mega ~pastigliona~, to the most imaginative creations and fusions of figures... precisely geometric. The over fifty levels available prevent the risk of boredom, both for the style of the missions and for the concentration that must be employed in wandering among the always different three-dimensional grids.", "date": "2014-12-04", "grade": "9.0"}
