{"name": "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-5.html", "text": "Summary of previous episodes. Our first few minutes on the world of Vvardenfell will surely go down in video game history. In fact, the character creation system immediately demonstrates what this game is made of. Once the initial hangover has passed, due to the scenographic impact of the game, you start by choosing your race among the ten available, each with its own BonusMalus, its own physical characteristics and its own history. For example, the Dark Elves will be very prone to the magical arts, the Nordics, as well as the orcs, to combat, the Imperials to social skills and so on ... But the creation system is so complete and flexible that the only choice of race will certainly not be binding for the purpose of determining our future career. In fact, if by choosing the region of birth we will give a general indication of how much we are inclined by ~nature~ to do certain things by continuing with the choice of the first class and our zodiac sign, then we will refine the skills of our player character in a truly vast and insightful, perhaps even confusing. The classes in Morrowind are virtually infinite, we will be able to select one among the N available, we will be able to have it proposed by the game itself after a series of questions aimed at knowing our character or, in the name of absolute freedom, we will be able to create our own based on the our preferences. Each class is characterized by a specific area of relevance (Stealth, Combat, Magic) and by two main attributes (to choose between Strength, dexterity, luck, intelligence and so on) which represent the characteristics where the computer will help us during some dice~. Yes, because each skill (there are several dozen) has a reference attribute that will be used during the check on the success or failure of using that given skill. For example, all types of spells will have a better chance of success having a strong intelligence (besides, of course, having a high score in the ~casting spells~ skill). The character growth system is very similar to that used by titles such as Ultima OnLine, this means that the best way to grow in a skill is to use it more often. By fighting with our Katana we will slowly increase the skill related to the use of long swords, while by picking locks we will improve our ~lockpicking~ skills. In this way we avoid those nice paradoxes that those who play with rule systems such as those of D&D often find themselves facing: that of those who, for example, casting spells (and obviously receiving experience points) can decide to exploit the experience acquired by increasing your character in swordsmanship. The yin and the yan. The skills are really many and the designers have spent a lot of energy trying to calibrate the delicate balance between each of them, thus trying not to make some skills more important than the others and vice versa. Unfortunately, as we proceeded in the adventures and became more and more familiar with the logic of the game, we noticed several flaws. Some skills are rendered almost useless by the presence of potions or spells accessible all too easily already from the first levels, while others still prove to be all too simple and profitable to use. For example, thieves will have a very easy life in Morrowind where, very difficultly, the theorem ~crime does not pay~ finds confirmation. On the other hand, however, skills such as Speechcraft and Mercantile will only be useful in the first hours of the game while, as the events continue, they risk becoming bland cosmetic attributes. The first due to the availability of various amulets and spells that increase one's charisma too easily, the second because getting rich in Morrowind is really very simple (especially using some ~dirty tricks~) and therefore getting cheaper prices becomes a secondary thing importantly, moreover you will often find yourself bargaining with merchants who are much poorer than you and who will never be able to buy the very precious treasures earned during your pilgrimages. These and many other small ~oddities~ make the skill system not perfect but certainly top-level. FedEx tough Lex. But luckily Morrowind is a real role-playing game so, albeit with a lot of self-discipline, it is possible to enter your character and take advantage of all its features without using those shortcuts that would make our life easier but which, we are surei, they would also give us less gaming satisfaction. Precisely by virtue of this orientation to the ~Where do you want to go toDay?~ it is also appreciable that many quests can be solved in different ways, depending on the characteristics of our character or our personal point of view: if we have to get something from that given person, is it better to kill him, deceive him with our charisma or rob him? Other times we may find ourselves faced with real philosophical dilemmas that will force us to choose which side to take. Quite a touch of class. Unfortunately, the very nature of the quests cannot fail to make those who have had the good fortune to try titles such as ~Eye Of the Beholder~ turn up their noses, forget about puzzles in which you need to use gray matter and get ready to wear the role of a heroic ~Pony Express without horse. Most of the time the greatest difficulty will in fact only be to find a certain location or important character. All the Morrowind quests are reduced, wanting to be picky, to a few repetitive canvases: ~Kill Tizio in city X~, ~Get Sempronio to give that specific object~, ~find me a precious treasure in that cave~, ~Talk to the my friend Caius~. In short, the game could be sponsored, without too many problems, by FedEx. Tell me who you are and I will tell you who I am. Question: but in the end what should you do in Morrowind? Answer: what you want. Once your character has been created, you will be left to your grim destiny, alone, with a package and meager indications to find the recipient of the same: our adventures will have to begin in the city of Balmora. We don't want to spoil the pleasure of learning about the legends, traditions, betrayals and power struggles that underlie the history of Vvardenfell on your own, however suffice it to say that in Morrowind you will not be forced to follow one of the main storylines ( although this is well written and made) but that you can do what you like best. Join the wizard guild to become a powerful summoner? Wandering aimlessly with the sole aim of helping those in difficulty? Join the Imperial Guards and begin a glorious military career? Be fascinated by the dark side of the force and become a fearsome assassin? These are just some of the things you can do while playing Morrowind, and sorry if it's not enough. Don't be afraid, Morrowind also has a classic main storyline that can be followed more or less assiduously. Also in this case we do not want to anticipate anything except the fact that, at least the first moments, the evolution of the story reminded us of the unforgettable style of some of the most successful plots in the Ultima saga. And sorry for the comparison. Technique ... Much has already been said about the Morrowind graphics engine, praised by many for its artistic qualities and criticized by others for its poor speed, however there is no doubt that it cannot leave one indifferent. Contrary to what one might think Morrowind does not use a proprietary graphics engine. Indeed, Bethesda has a great tradition when it comes to games for the MS-DOS platform (of which ~Terminator FutureShock~ perhaps represents the moment of maximum technical splendor achieved by one of the implementations of the Xn Engine) but with the first experiences, from Windows 95 onwards, it was immediately understood that all the technical charisma was gradually disappearing: Redguard was the tragic confirmation of this. At the beginning of the Morrowind project, which we remember dating back to the last millennium, Todd Howard therefore decided to rely on a third-party graphics engine that would allow, on the one hand, to achieve top-level performance and features in a relatively short time, and on the other to take advantage of the time saved to focus on other issues related to the development of a video game such as that of code stability, an aspect that left much to be desired in Daggerfall and which was indicated by many as the real flaw of the second chapter of the Elder Scrolls saga. The choice therefore fell on NetImmerse, an appreciated graphics engine that we have already learned to appreciate with the MMORPG Dark Age Of Camelot. One of the main features of this engine is the ability to manage very well outdoor environments and decidedly large game maps, all seasoned with the possibility of exploiting all the latest features introduced with DirectX 8.1. It goes without saying that in Morrowind all these potentials have been exploited to the last bit.... and art. By now everyone should know the renowned and notorious ~water effect~ reproduced thanks to the exploitation of Pixel shaders, a series of programmable registers for advanced graphic effects that are equipped on our third generation graphics cards (read starting from NVIDIA GeForce 3 and ATI 8500) and which now risked being forgotten, lost in oblivion jealously guarded by the cobwebs of (false) IT promises. But remembering Morrowind's graphics only for this detail would be a crime. Never before had such a graphic marvel been seen on our PC monitors and not so much for mere technical qualities as for the sense of immersion that the environments of the island of Vvardenfell will be able to give us. The landscapes of Morrowind are art and there are no frames per second or texture detail to hold, Morrowind's graphics are evocative in a way that no other title manages to be. Too bad that the three-dimensional models of the characters, both that of our character and those of all the other NPCs, and related animations are a little out of place in all this graphic perfection. The game world is continuous and we will have to see a short loading screen only when we pass inside houses or dungeons, of course every now and then some sporadic slowdown, due to loading data, shows up but perhaps it was a necessary evil, or perhaps not everyone has yet learned from Dungeon Siege ... Such wonder, however, you have to pay and Morrowind is perhaps one of the most resource-hungry titles on the market today. But considering what it offers, we don't feel like saying that the hardware requests are disproportionate. With an Athlon XP 1600+ and Radeon 8500 we were able to play the maximum detail without noteworthy slowdowns, reducing some parameters such as the complexity of the shadows or the visual distance it is possible to play even with mediumlow power PCs. Even the sound aspect is very accurate, the music has been entrusted to the now veteran Jeremy Soule (the same author of the music of the next NeverWinter Nights) who has composed some evocative music at least as much as the graphic counterpart. It's a pity that the Soundtrack isn't very long, however, and the forty minutes of beautiful music will end up boring us sooner or later. Luckily we will always be able to play our favorite MP3s in the game. The sound effects certainly won't make us cry out for a miracle but they are spot on and always punctual, from the chirping of the woods to the dark howls that reach us in the distance. Don't expect too much... All right, by now it will also be coming out of your ears, but let's remember for the umpteenth time that Morrowind is the sequel to Daggerfall, a game that introduced a huge playing area (still unmatched today), a virtually infinite number of quests and a series of small great refinements (such as the ~No SaveGame Filosofy~) that made it immense despite a whole series of endless technical and non-technical flaws. Many therefore expected some graphic restyling, a substantial improvement in the random generation techniques of quests and game environments and the addition of new features to the already promising game system. Once in hand Morrowind instead we realize that things are certainly not like this and that, indeed, from many points of view we have taken several steps backwards: the world is smaller (although more detailed), some small things like the possibility to have mounts or similar no longer exist, the sense of epicness, for some strange reason, seems to be less pervasive ... in short, all this makes us understand once again how much Daggerfall was ~forward~ for the period in which it was released and, above all, also for nowadays. Freedom of action we said before, but that's not all. A cRPG must also guarantee us immersion, atmosphere, the impression of being in an alternative world. Does Morrowind succeed? We can answer, without a doubt, in the affirmative. And this despite some design choices could make quite a few people turn up their noses. First of all, the game world, if we exclude the many inhabited centers, risks seeming terribly bleak to us; going ahead with the game we will discover that the volcano inside the island is the main cause of the death of most of the local fauna. However, the fact that the game background elegantly justifies this lack consoles us very little, wandering through the highly detailed world of Morrowind in fact we will miss more than once the lack of a squirrel crossing our path or a small group of", "date": "2002-05-31", "grade": null}
