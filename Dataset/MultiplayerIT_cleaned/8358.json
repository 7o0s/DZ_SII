Well, that of the protagonists of Monster Life moves between ups and downs: on the one hand the nice paper creatures are pampered, fed and entertained since they hatch the egg, receiving considerable attention aimed at improving their characteristics; on the other hand they have to face tournaments specially designed for monsters, in which only the strongest can win. Affluence and comfort which, however, lead to a ~violent~ reality: this is the idea put on the table by the Gameloft developers to add a pinch of pepper to the now highly inflated genre of Farmville-style casual management. Monster Life is a freemium production, so it can be downloaded for free from the App Store or Google Play and played for hours without ever having to dip into your wallet, unless you want to accelerate the growth of your monsters or encourage their recovery, which normally it takes several minutes between meetings. As you will have understood, the typical gameplay of these titles has been enriched with ~virtual pet~ elements without renouncing the classic elements, therefore not only will we have to build and carefully manage our village, making it bigger as soon as possible, but also buy new monsters and follow their development, providing them with food and entertainment until the experience points are sufficient to implement an evolution and therefore move on to the next stage. The traditional ~double currency~ could not be missing in this case either, and so the gold tokens, which we earn in abundance by completing the numerous ~missions~, are flanked by rarer and more difficult to obtain crystals, which case we can buy via in-app purchase as needed. How scared it makes me The Monster Life experience is extremely immediate, as expected: during the first few minutes you are led by the hand to discover the village, the buildings, the monsters and their characteristics, after which you proceed alone but with the continuous support of missions (displayed in a bar on the left side of the screen) aimed at making us gain further familiarity with the gameplay and game structure. Coins are collected from the attractions that produce them, this hasn't changed one iota, but as far as monsters are concerned, the appointments are with food or training, with a view to growth and strengthening of the creature. The idea of the habitats is also interesting: after having bought and hatched a monster egg, we will have to feed and entertain the little one until he (quickly) becomes a ~young man~. At that point it will be necessary to move it from the farm to a more suitable place, and this depends on the characteristics of the character: water monsters will be fine in a pond, for example, and this location will even produce power-ups; likewise, a land monster will feel at ease in a quarry, and will enjoy the same advantages. When one of our creatures is ready, we will be able to try our hand at fight tournaments and therefore move to the map of the four islands that host the competition, for a total of thirty-six scenarios in which up to four monsters will face each other at the same time. Despite being the most interactive phase of Monster Life, even in this juncture our interventions are reduced to the bone, as we will be able to activate variants for the attack or defense by spending action points (even those that can be purchased for a fee, of course) or rely solely on the experience level of the character and wait for him to bring home the victory. On the technical front, an excellent design job has been done, in the sense that the cardboard creatures are really very nice, it is even possible to cuddle them to earn some coins and in general good use has been made of the colors. On the other hand, the fact that, despite all the experience made so far with management systems, Gameloft has not yet managed to develop a precise and reliable control system, which does not force you to repeatedly touch objects for the input to be received.", "date": "2012-08-29", "grade": "7.0"}
