{"name": "Ganryu 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ganryu-2-recensione.html", "text": "The last few years have seen the release of several unlikely sequels to games few remembered, including the classic shooter Andro Dunos 2, the Frisbee-based sports arcade Windjammers 2 and now Ganryu 2, the offspring of a Shinobi-like action platformer mixed a Strider, released for Neo Geo in 1999, i.e. at a time when SNK's hardware was already on its way out. It is interesting that in all the cases mentioned it was decided to create new chapters as close as possible to the originals, therefore all 2D games that take up the mechanics and style of the predecessors, avoiding focusing on a more modern feeling to try to please everyone. In the case of the Storybird Studio title, however, something went right and something went wrong, as you can read in the Ganryu 2 review. From 1999 to 2022 Some landscapes are very beautiful The original Ganryu saw us play the role of Miyamoto Musashi in his fight against a resurrected Sasaki Kojir, who was inevitably defeated at the end of the adventure (it lasted just over twenty minutes, but they were really tough twenty minutes). Even if reinterpreted in a videogame key, the game started from a well-known and beloved event in Japanese history, to build a fantastic story on it. In Ganryu 2 we find Musashi now retired in the province of Hokkaido to devote himself to art and culture. Unfortunately for him, somehow Kojir managed to return and decided to take revenge, challenging him to join him on the island of Ganry-jima, which is on the other side of Japan. After the brief introduction, Musashi begins his difficult journey... and here we can already see a substantial difference compared to the first chapter: Suzume, the second selectable character, is no longer there. Taking the controller in hand we notice other differences: the hybridization with Strider has disappeared and our hero is much less agile than in the past, despite having more moves at his disposal. So not only can he attack with the sword and with different types of kunai, but he can also dash forward, make double jumps and use special abilities that can be activated after collecting enough kami, spiritual essences that are left by enemies when killed or found in the containers scattered throughout the game. Having said that, it only takes a few seconds to understand that we are dealing with a pure hack'n'slash, in which you jump between platforms and eliminate enemies that appear out of nowhere, trying to conserve your energy bar as much as possible . In short, one also realizes another detail: it is very difficult. The developers have looked a lot at the arcade model from this point of view, choosing to make the player sweat every single level, between particularly difficult passages, sections in which great precision is required, such as that of the mine cart race, and others that take borrow dynamics from other genres, such as side-scrolling shooters. Gameplay The game is French, but steeped in Japanese culture The gameplay therefore sees us advance along five linear levels, divided in turn into stages, trying to anticipate the opponents as much as possible, both by hitting them as soon as possible and by studying the best ways to dodge their blows without ending up in some trap. The enemies are mainly ninjas, also equipped with swords and kunai, and different species of demons, including some really difficult bosses whose attack patterns must be memorized if you want to have the hope of having the upper hand. So far we have described a game that basically does its duty, trying to satisfy the nostalgics of the arcade and those who still appreciate a good arcade today, except that some problems have made us quite unwell. The most annoying is that of the missing inputs: in several cases we have suffered damage because, despite having pressed the attack key with the sword or the jump key, our good samurai has decided to sit still, doing nothing. It didn't happen very often, but in a game where every mistake can be paid for with life or with the loss of precious energy, it was still too much. Another problem is of a more purely technical nature: Ganryu 2 is presented in a fluctuating pixel art, i.e. the developers have made some elements very well, while others are decidedly poor. Some passages are really difficult In principle, one could be satisfied, because some things are really effective, such as the animations of Musashi's sword strokes or certain landscapes, if it weren't for the fact that others leave you dumbfounded. For example, in some situations animation frames are missing, such as when jumping from wall to wall or when entering the iron cartsoviaries, while in others there is an obsessive recourse to the reuse of the same elements. A third flaw, in this case of a more mechanical nature, is the impossibility of observing Musashi's surroundings perhaps using the right analog stick. The problem is that in this way it happens that you literally have to throw yourself into the void, without knowing what's underneath. Several times we happened to end up on enemies or inside traps because we hadn't had the opportunity to look around, as is now possible in most 2D platformers. Of course, experience protects you from the most dangerous situations, in the sense that after learning the conformation of the levels, including enemies, you can easily compensate for the lack of visual information. Be that as it may, a certain sense of frustration is inevitable when you first run into a dead end. Conclusions Having said that, we absolutely do not want to demoralize you. Ganryu 2 is far from a masterpiece. In some respects it is even inferior to its predecessor. At the same time, however, it is not a bad game and can be appreciated for its extremely respectful nature of the public to which it is addressed. It simply would have needed more time, and probably more resources, for some additional polishing, since the problems encountered are fixable. It must also be said that titles of this genre are no longer very frequent, so fans could easily turn a blind eye and enjoy what remains a good classic experience.", "date": "2022-04-22", "grade": "7.0"}
