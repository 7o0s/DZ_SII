{"name": "Spazio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101014-angry-birds-space-spazio-ultima-uccelliera.html", "text": "It seems strange to think of the expectation Angry Birds Space has aroused among iPhone and iPad owners, after all we are still talking about a product sold for 79 cents, a category that many people tend to consider intrinsically limited. ~Giochetti~, in short, which however have shown over the months that they can conquer a huge number of gamers, casual and otherwise. Thus, after three fundamentally similar episodes (Angry Birds, Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Rio) and over seven hundred million downloads, the Rovio series takes the proverbial big step (or small, to stay on the ~space~ theme and quote Neil Armstrong) and makes the necessary gameplay changes in order to refresh the original formula, squeezed to the core. The birds protagonists of the game are always angry, that will never change, but this time their feeling of revenge against the hated green pigs has even pushed them out of the terrestrial borders. A change of setting that is not only aesthetic, but capable of substantially influencing the action on the screen, producing numerous new facets. Our goal, in each of the sixty levels initially available (to which thirty more can be added by paying another 79 cents, beyond the already foreseen periodic updates), remains that of hitting the piglets using the available ~shots~ in the best possible way , trying to eliminate them even if they are sheltered within more or less complex structures. To succeed, it is important to exploit the unique capabilities of each bird, an element that the developers have always held in high consideration and which has in fact distinguished the various incarnations of Angry Birds so far. Is it him or isn't it him? In this specific case we find the red bird that stands out in the artwork, which represents the ~standard bullet~, as well as the little guy who ~divides into three~ during the launch and allows us to carry out a sort of ~bombardment~ on enemy territory. At their side there is a freezing bird, which with a touch of the screen can transform any structure with which it comes into contact with ice, thus making it fragile; an exploding bird, also with touch-activated power; a green bird, terribly similar to Pierpaolo Greco, capable of giving itself an extra impetus and swooping down on the piglets like a boulder; and finally a ~precision~ bird, which regardless of the direction of launch can point to a target and reach it very quickly. Permanent center of gravity So where are the big news? As mentioned earlier, it is the setting that changes the rules of the game. In fact, on each level there are one or more ~planets~ with their own gravity, which affects the motion of the birds and allows them to take an elliptical trajectory up to the eventual impact. By pulling the classic slingshot, we can decide to throw our ~projectiles~ upwards or downwards depending on the needs and, based on the connotation of the scenario, opt for a strategy that allows us to hit the pigs from behind rather than from the front , especially if they are barricaded behind a particularly resistant structure. The progressive presence of more ~planets~, with forces of attraction that intersect and can produce various effects on the launches, only increases the complexity of certain phases, which in any case we will have to try to complete using the least possible number of birds and, perhaps, hitting the bonus items scattered around. At the end of each ~zone~ we will have to face a nice boss fight based on ~bank shots~. Furthermore, in case of difficulty, we will be able to use the eagles, special shots that create a sort of black hole and have the ability to eliminate several opponents at the same time, as well as tear their positions to pieces. Eagles are earned by successfully completing a certain number of stages, but it is also possible to purchase them through an in-app purchase system; and on the ~commercial~ turning point of the Rovio product it would be appropriate to open a small parenthesis, because we didn't particularly appreciate the fact of having to pay the price of the game again to get the thirty extra levels of the Danger Zone, and the fear is that even future updates will be removed from the usual free, or maybe a distinction will be made between small free packages and much more substantial paid updates. We hope to be quickly proved wrong.", "date": "2012-03-24", "grade": "8.0"}
