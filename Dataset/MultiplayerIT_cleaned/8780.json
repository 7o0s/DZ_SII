A title that, in an equally uncommon way, has generated a remarkable hype even if only for the combination of a remarkable character design, an extremely sexy co-protagonist and a mature story that exudes eroticism without ever falling into the vulgar. All told through a considerable amount of animated interludes by Studio4C, made so well that we almost wish they were collected in an OVA. No wonder if the puzzle component, thoroughly analyzed a few lines below, has almost gone into the background, but with the arrival of the game on our shelves we decided to replay the entire adventure in Italian. A good excuse to watch the more risqu scenes, don't you think?! Confirming the idea we had during the preview, the Italian version of Catherine is localized only in the texts of the menus and in the subtitles, leaving the dubbing of the characters only and only in English. Despite pressure from European fans, there is no possibility of setting the original Japanese dubbing, but the voice and interpretation of the US dubbers has proved to be above expectations. Thumbs up also for the localization work carried out in the Italian texts, error-free and able to perfectly convey the thousand emotions felt by the various actors, even if in some cases we noticed that some more intense and colorful exclamations were slightly rounded off and muffled: moments, these, fortunately rare enough not to represent a point against the Italian version. The choice of leaving some texts in the menus in English is curious, such as the various options on the start screen or on Vincent's mobile phone, but even those who don't know the Albion language will not find any obstacles along the way. Catherine or Katherine? Having almost become a cult object among gamers even before arriving in stores thanks to the publisher's skilful promotional moves, Catherine is the first title developed by the Persona team (always rightly considered among the best role-playing game series by always), produced by Atlus, to arrive on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is an action-adventure with platform, puzzle and RPG elements with a horror/erotic background in which nightmares, love and death are inextricably intertwined, through an intricate plot that unfolds in over twenty hours of play, with gameplay from the all particular that represents in our opinion, like the story, the strong point of the game. Which is, let's face it, much more than an ecchi title for hardened otaku. And this regardless of erotic situations (but don't expect who knows what), sexual references or the winks of the disturbing co-protagonist. We are in a typical modern town, in a suburban area where strange accidents happen, and many young people die in their sleep in an inexplicable way. Those who have seen the corpses of the ~victims~ claim that they had an expression of deep anguish painted on their faces. The topic, logically, therefore attracts the attention of the media who begin to hypothesize about the causes of these deaths, even going so far as to speculate on them, advancing some rather bizarre theories. Suspicious deaths Thirty-two-year-old Vincent Brooks also lives in this area, an employee, without ambitions, without particular goals in life, a bit nerdy and a bit ~big baby~, just to use a term that is so popular in our area. Among other things, a young man mired in a love story that has lasted for five years with former schoolmate Katherine McBride, who has been pressuring him for some time so that their union can lead to a marriage. But good Vincent turns a deaf ear as he is very confused, he finds it hard to cut that hypothetical umbilical cord that binds him to adolescence, to the security, in his own way, of single life. In short, he seems to not want to grow up, to be afraid of the changes that the decision to start a family would imply. Almost sunk into a sort of limbo made of daily routine, Brooks seems to have a jolt of life when one fine day he meets the beautiful Catherine. Blond, young, extremely sexy, she seems to embody the ideal of a woman in Vincent's erotic imagination who falls in love with her and even ends up in bed with her. And from that moment on, trouble will begin for the poor employee. From there on the young manor he will begin to have strange and terrible nightmares, characterized by unhealthy, ambiguous atmospheres, with a feeling of horror around every corner, of imminent danger, of madness. And routes to climb. By day, by night Wanting to summarize, Catherine's game structure, at least as regards the story mode, called Golden Theater, we could describe it as substantially divided into two distinct parts. The first is typically RPG and free roaming. The second, however, more purely platform and puzzle. But let's proceed in order. In the first case, most of the story takes place in a room called Stray Sheep. Here, during the day, our Vincent does everything that any boy his age would do in his place: meet friends, in his case Jonathan, Orlando and Tobias, chat, drink (but be careful not to overdo it, or Brooks will get drunk and he will end up straight and prematurely in a nightmare), plays games, listens to music from the jukebox, carries on his double relationship and exchanges text messages and e-mails through his mobile phone. The latter has an important role in the game, since through it you can not only save the game in progress, but also interact with other people outside the room. This element should not be underestimated since some answers, given or not given, can determine some events related to the plot and lead to one of the different endings foreseen for Catherine, then influencing an unusual morality meter which we will discuss later. Not only that: what is said at the bar or the quantity of alcohol swallowed also have repercussions on what happens later at night, especially on the composition of the towers and on the aggressiveness of the other fugitives. Nightmares and delusions If the daily phases are rightly to be considered the simplest and in many respects also the funniest ones, the platform ones we mentioned earlier are instead to be taken with a grain of salt. The second of the parts into which we have briefly divided the game structure of the Atlus title is in fact more complex than it might seem at first glance. It is called Nightmare, and consists of moving in a different, dreamlike dimension (the nightmares of the protagonist), climbing as quickly as possible a series of towers made up of cubic blocks that appear in front of the young man, and which collapse in time under him, in a sequence of levels, on pain of death. There are blocks to move, ladders to climb, traps to avoid and, of course, platforms to move and jump over. These cube shaped elements can be moved forward, backward, left and right. Initially the thing is not particularly complex and indeed one is often helped, almost, in the most logical choice of the path to follow. Subsequently, as the game progresses, things get complicated, and everything becomes more difficult also due to the presence of monsters and even other unfortunate sheep-like beings who, in turn, trying to escape end up hindering Vincent, moving the blocks or perhaps preventing him from to go up to the next level. Without forgetting the stages with the bosses, that is, those that complete the sequence of levels of each nightmare and allow, after having passed them, to awaken Vincent. And, believe us, the thing is damned difficult, you want for a sometimes exaggerated difficulty, which forces you to repeat some levels over and over again. You want a character control system that isn't too bad by default, but that sometimes behaves in an absurd way, causing our employee to make unsolicited movements, such as throwing for example a block rather than avoiding it. Of course, if you want you can always set the difficulty level to easy and rely on a series of aids, such as a sort of command that cancels up to nine previous moves made by Vincent on the tower, allowing the character to redo the path at will better and fix mistakes. Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty-nine Trophies ~officially~ available in Catherine, plus others hidden. They are divided into 24 Bronze, 3 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them you need to meet some specific requests of the game, both in the main mode, the Golden Playhouse, and in the others, including the mini game called Rapunzel, present in the adventure bar. For example by completing 3 stages in Babel mode, using the jukebox or helping Todd and Archie. Moral or immoral choices Scattered above the cubes are coins and feathers for you to collect. The latter are used to create new pillows which in the game are nothing more than extra lives to be spent in the event of death, while the former can be spent to buy useful items, such as platformsextras to appear out of nowhere to facilitate the path, energy drinks that increase Brooks' abilities, etc. All stuff that can be purchased from a vendor who is always on top of each tower you just climbed. Here you can also talk to other sheep-like beings to gather clues and hints on the best way to pass the next paths. Furthermore, one can submit to the examination of a mysterious oracle which poses questions that must be answered. If you are connected it is also possible, after having made your choices, to see the percentage of players from all over the world who have answered in one direction or another. However, depending on what the user chooses to make Vincent say, many things can change, as happens in the case already mentioned in the previous paragraphs regarding chats at the bar or text messages. In fact, the game has a ~detection~ system of the protagonist's morality which is used to then determine the very manifestation of Vincent's nightmares, as well as, as mentioned at the beginning, the endings. It is a kind of ~moral thermometer~ that changes according to the right or wrong choices of the protagonist. The questions usually concern the feelings that the young man has for his fiance, for his lover and for himself: if one behaves like an impertinent traitor, the indicator bar will tend towards negative, represented by a demon. Conversely, by behaving well and saying sensible, responsible things, the level of morality is considered positive. It is not for nothing that it is represented by a little angel. By virtue of what has just been described, you will want to play the product several times to determine, through your own behavior, various situations. And if all this were not enough to increase the longevity of the title developed by the Persona Team, there are multiplayer modes for up to a maximum of two users, one competitive and the other cooperative. The first is called ~Colosseum~ and must be unlocked at the end of the story mode: it is a series of challenges to be faced against a friend, climbing the stacks of cubes and trying to reach the top of them before the opponent. The other is instead called ~Babel~: with the help of a partner, the usual gamer must complete the various stages in the shortest possible time. If desired, this session can be played alone. The scores obtained in this case will be counted in specific online rankings. Little gem To give more prestige to the intrinsic charm of the plot and the setting, in our opinion, we think about a cel-shaded graphic with a particular style that at times recalls anime like Death Note or other similar products, and which, despite appearances, can boast an attention to detail and a level of detail perhaps unthinkable for the engine adopted for the occasion. Thanks also to the excellent work done by the character designer Shigenori Soejima (seen at work in various Atlus productions, including Persona 3), who was able to give shape and life to Vincent's most intimate anxieties, fears and desires. In particular, we were struck by the design of some bosses, with one whose features even reminded us of the concept, albeit in different forms, of the judge from the Pink Floyd film ~The Wall~. In fact, the overall graphic rendering, although not exceptional, ultimately appears perfect for the context and goes well with the filmed interludes, always in Japanese cartoon style, which accompany the players in the various stages of the adventure. The music that makes up the soundtrack is also excellent, created by Shouji Meguro, already author, among others, of that of some games in the Megami Tensei and Persona series. Confirming his reputation as an experimenter, as an artist attracted by new genres to be ~contaminated~ by mixing different styles, such as orchestral, electronic and rap music, even in Catherine the maestro used revised and corrected versions of great classics from the past, such as the Fifth Symphony in C minor op. 67 by Ludwig van Beethoven, the Study op. 10 n.12 (tude op. 10 n.12) by Frdric Chopin or the introduction to the opera Guglielmo Tell by our Gioacchino Rossini. Furthermore, as mentioned before, there is no shortage of songs taken from old works by Atlus. In the same way, we consider the English dubbing to be satisfactory, characterized by a certain care in the choice of the voices attributed to the various characters, and by the good interpretation of the voice actors themselves. Which partially compensates for the lack of the Japanese audio track, which will instead be included in the European version of the game.", "date": "2012-02-06", "grade": "8.7"}
