{"name": "Fightality", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fightality_a.html", "text": "Try to think of a Street Fighter, or a King of Fighters, without having to bother with the various Tekken or Virtua Fighters; probably among the first things that will come to your mind there will be the speed in using the commands, the combinations with joystick and two or more keys at the same time, the endless combos made of sequences that border on dislocating the wrist... the control system it is therefore an integral and fundamental part of the genre of match fighting games, the basis and foundation on which to build everything else. It is more than evident how the numeric keyboards of mobile phones cannot reach even a fraction of the complexity and elasticity of a pad specifically designed for this purpose, and in fact so far all attempts to bring fighting games to mobile terminals have found a huge obstacle not so much the graphic limits, but precisely those purely related to the controller. However, the Reaxion team, evidently not discouraged in the face of this problem, decided to pack a completely new fighting game, entitled Fightality. The graphic component is the first thing that catches the eye; not so much for the character design, pleasant but banal, nor for the quality of the settings, pleasant and colorful but nothing more. The original aspect is in fact to be found in the fact that, while using two-dimensional sprites and backdrops, the game arena is on the contrary 3d, thus allowing the characters to move not only on an axis, but also in depth by pressing the keys 2 and 8. An interesting and original design choice, just as the decision to delegate all the management of your wrestler to the available keys is quite innovative. And so with 4 and 6 you move forward or backward, with 1 you make a block, while 5 and 3 are associated with kicks and punches. Particularly developed is the management of the numerous combos, which require the pressing of different keys in sequence, and the possibility of performing a ~fightality~, a special shot once a special bar has been filled, is promising. Too bad that this ~special~ move has little, resulting very short, not at all choreographic and therefore disappointing all in all. However, although the effort of the programmers in trying to circumvent the limits of mobile phones should undoubtedly be appreciated, it is indisputable that the Reaxion title has rather evident defects. The rather weak artificial intelligence of the enemies above all, given that to excel in the various encounters it can often be sufficient to press the buttons at random. The strategy therefore ends up in the background, thus making the fights rather boring and monotonous; in this sense, the inclusion of 3 statistics for each fighter, strength, agility and health, to be improved thanks to the victories achieved, is of little use. The ability to unlock 3 wrestlers (for a total of 5) and different arenas therefore keeps interest alive, as does the ability to send your scores to the Gamarama server to participate in a ranking with players from all over the world. The sound is sufficient, even if the volume adjustment is missing, while we must report the total absence of any multiplayer mode.
