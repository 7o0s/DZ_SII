{"name": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Il gioiello di Kojima", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-solid-3-il-gioiello-di-kojima.html", "text": "The Extras of the European version To repay the wait from European users, Konami has introduced some additional modes in this version. First of all, a duel mode, in which it will be possible to directly challenge all the bosses in the game. There is also a sort of ~theater~ where you can view all the beautiful movies (made with the game's graphics engine) that will follow one another during the adventure, a new level of difficulty, called European Extreme, two additional levels of the ~Serpent against Monkey', and finally new camouflages and face masks including that of the Italian flag.The adventure begins We are in the 60s, after the ruinous events of the two world wars, we find ourselves in the midst of the cold war, where world peace and balance are played out on a thin line of agreements between the various superpowers, which in the meantime, thanks to the their dense network of espionage and the more or less secret development of weapons of destruction, are ready for a possible new conflict, using diplomacy and their war potential as a deterrent for more catastrophic consequences. One of the key elements seems to be represented by Professor Sokolov, who thanks to his enormous capabilities designed the Shagohod, a veritable nuclear war machine, with a range capable of hitting America from anywhere in the Soviet Union. Sokolov had already moved to America once, but after the umpteenth agreement between the USA and the USSR he was forced to return to his native country, where like it or not he was forced to complete the project of this weapon. You are one of the components of FOX (which we can define as the progenitor of the Foxhound...), codenamed Naked Snake, and as a first task you will have to infiltrate, rigorously alone, the base where the well-known professor is ~hosted~, kidnap him and bring him back to America. Naturally everything will not be so easy, and the appearance of The Boss, the mentor to whom Snake owes all his knowledge in combat, of Colonel Volgin and of a young Ocelot (yes, really him) will complicate the events not a little. Events that we leave to you to discover, so as not to spoil the surprise too much. Having made this necessary ~historical~ premise, it is evident that the choice of Kojima (among other things, producer of the game) fell in terms of time on a prequel of the first two chapters and, in the light of the criticisms suffered by the narrative system of the second, on more ~coherent~ events, which mix historical appeals with imaginative events. Snake Eater is in some ways a tribute and a continuous reference to films such as Indiana Jones and James Bond: a mix of action, adventure, continuous twists and turns, nature, explosions and espionage, a component also visible in the subtitle of the game: the snake, as the game itself suggests, he is considered by many to be the first spy of human genesis. The setting that forms the backdrop to the events of this third chapter is therefore an unspecified location in the Soviet Union, surrounded by forests, military bases and mountains. You will be there alone, you will have to get weapons and food to survive, you will not have a radar available (in 1964 it had not yet been invented, as well as the loved / hated CODEC) and you will be able to communicate with the base only through a transceiver , thanks to which you can get useful hints for the mission, save and converse with key characters for your mission. I am a big Boss The presence of the transceiver and the absence of Codec and Radar are the first changes that directly affect the gameplay, translating it towards a more stealth meaning focused on the survival of the main character. Furthermore, the radio conversations are more organic and tend to break up the action much less than in Sons of Liberty, to the point of positioning themselves at acceptable levels and often useful for better understanding the story and the relationships between Snake and the other characters. There is no lack of conversations that denote a strong sense of humor or often interesting digressions, without mentioning the continuous references to the films that take place between Snake and his interlocutor after each rescue, and which further underline Kojima's love for works of the mold cinematic. The absence of the radar forces the player to act in a much more cautious and reasoned way during the mission: in fact, we will not have a convenient viewer of the enemy's position available, but we will have to help ourselves with other systems (such as the acoustic position detector or movement graph, which however do not offer the same performance as the canonical radar), with the traces left on the ground, with the direct view, which is often limited by natural obstaclesi such as stones or walls or even from leaves, in case we had to disguise ourselves lying in the middle of the bush. Just the camouflage has a novelty: Snake will in fact be able to use different facial masks and military uniforms, which depending on the location will adapt better and will allow our hero to be found with greater difficulty. In this regard, in fact, at the top right of the screen, there is the percentage of camouflage: the higher it is, the more the enemies will have to get close to you to find you and raise the alarm. So forget about being able to wait for the enemy by displaying him on the radar, in Snake Eater you have to use all the means available to control the area, study the number of enemies and their movements (using the various detectors or binoculars), move with caution and use the right camouflage. This translates into realism and above all into greater immersion on the part of the player in the action, given that many times he will find himself having more or less Snake's view (which we remember can almost always be alternated between first and third person ). In this sense, the camera does not come in great help, as in the third person it happens to have blind spots, which can be filled from the first person view, the use of which sometimes proves to be cumbersome. It is true that the final intent is to make the player feel right inside the action, but with small adjustments the yield would have been even better. So forget about being able to wait for the enemy by displaying it comfortably on the radar, in Snake Eater you will have to use all the means at your disposal to control the area in which you are I am a big Boss However, the level of tension will always be very high, because on more than one occasion it will be preferable, if not indispensable at the higher difficulty levels, to absolutely avoid being discovered, by eliminating, stunning or putting the guards to sleep, so as to prevent a Huge deployment of enemies attacks you from all locations. The artificial intelligence of the latter has certainly increased, not infrequently they will coordinate to attack you from multiple positions, or will control the area in every small point if in a state of alert. There will be moments in which action and spectacular shootings will be preferred, but in general the game manages to offer a good balance between action and stealth, in which the imperative will always be to survive. The latter concept is further amplified by two introductions made by this third chapter: Snake will in fact have to heal himself from his wounds and eat food to survive, otherwise he will die prematurely. The indicator of your health is now indicated by two bars, the first represented by the canonical vitality (Life Gauge) and the second by the resistance (Stamina), which will determine the maximum time it will be possible to swim underwater, the speed of movements, the precision of the shots and the speed with which the vitality bar will be restored, a bar that cannot be filled directly, but only over time. The stamina will obviously be reduced every time Snake performs an action, and can only be restored by feeding, for example by picking fruit from trees or hunting animals, each of which will satiate him in a different way, in some cases even making him sick. On this occasion we will have to heal Snake to prevent his stamina from reaching a level of zero, just as we will have to apply medicines when we receive a bullet, we fall from a very high rock breaking a leg and so on, otherwise it will not be possible to restore the bar of vitality completely (we refer you to the appropriate section that deals with how to heal yourself in Snake Eater). Menu In order not to get lost in the Snake Eater coverage, we have prepared a handy menu for you! - The review - The characters - How to heal yourself - Kojima-Shinkawa-Williams - The movies Technique, miscellaneous and possible The same care placed in the playful phase also transpires with regard to the technical sector, which in some ways squeezes Playstation 2 towards its limits. The predominant setting of the game is represented by the forest and some indoor locations, such as military bases. In the first case, the attention to detail is something rarely seen, just note the falling leaves, the flying butterflies, the scrub, the trees, the rustling of the wind, not to mention the vastness of the digitally reproduced environment, which gives feeling like the forest is ~alive~. The interiors do not enjoy the same impact but are equally well done, with a good variety of textures and colors, certainly superior to what was seen in Sons of Liberty. Good is also the display of poligons on the screen, especially for the main characters, also excellent stylistically speaking together with the structures, thanks to the work done by Yoji Shinkawa, who has always been the mecha/character design of the series. However, all this goodness translates into some slowdowns in larger environments or crowded situations and in a not exactly high resolution of the textures, defects that only scratch the surface of a graphic realization that has few equals around, not only for brute power but also for style and visual impact, thanks to the meticulous attention to every detail. Even the audio sector stands at levels of excellence, starting with the dubbing, cinematographic and almost always convincing, up to the soundtrack, once again entrusted to Harry Gregson-Williams, by now synonymous with quality and which in Snake Eater seems to have surpassed himself, creating a series of songs that are always appropriate to the situations, rich and at times overflowing, which blend perfectly with the 60s setting and style of play, also including songs sung and of excellent quality. Where's the Foxhound? Snake will have the usual arsenal at his disposal, which will range from pistols, revolvers, assault rifles and machine guns, through thermal and night vision goggles and the inevitable cigarette, which will also be used to toast the leeches that will attach themselves to our bodies when we swim in the swamps. Partial novelty is represented by hand-to-hand combat, called in the game Close Quarter Combat, which allows a really high series of different actions. In fact, we will be able to immobilize the enemy with the circle button and use it as a shield by attacking with the square button. Or still point the knife at his throat and interrogate him, to know for example secret radio frequencies or the location of some objects (which we warmly invite you to do), we can stun him by repeatedly using the circle key until he is strangled, cut his throat with the decisive pressure of the left analog stick, or finally land it with a judo move. From all these possibilities therefore emerges a further point in favor of the title, or rather the multiplicity of options available to attack or circumvent an enemy. If we find ourselves, for example, in a forest, we will also be able to lurk behind a tree and shoot the enemy in the temple, make him fall on a nest of bees, drop ourselves from a branch to stun him, sneak up to eliminate him using a CQC technique or even engage a direct firefight, a practice recommended only in certain situations of the mission. To use all the arsenal available and the considerable amount of moves available, all the keys of the Dual Shock 2 are used, not to mention that it will also affect the depth and speed of pressing the analog keys. However, the decision to also use the different degrees of pressure on the ps2 joypad leads to a certain difficulty in mastering the control system, especially at the beginning and in the most agitated moments of the game, not to mention that the use of the first person view is not just the most comfortable. As already anticipated in the introductory phase, the interruptions of the dialogues interrupt the action in an acceptable way, while the cutscenes, although present in good numbers, are better amalgamated and fit perfectly with the development of the plot, shining for direction, technical realization and twists. The narrative development follows tracks that are decidedly more coherent and assimilable by the user and the background of the main characters appears adequate. Obviously there are also the boss fights, represented in particular (but not only...) by the Cobra Unit, a team created by The Boss at the time of the Second World War, and which represent an excellent challenge and can be tackled according to different strategies of attack (emblematic in this sense is the fight against The End). The strengths of Snake Eater can therefore be summarized in a varied gameplay and with pleasant new introductions, supported by a perfectly integrated narrative system, and which has the rare advantage of keeping the player glued until the end of the adventure, which with the continue enjoys absolutely exceptional apexes, not to mention that the final battle can be considered one of the most engaging and exciting ever to appear in a video game. Characters In a game strongly focused on adventure, stealth and storytelling, the characters play a fundamental role in the economy of the plot and player involvement. Kojima has always known how to create a very interesting and articulated historical background around his characters, not even Snake Eater is exempt from it.
