Fist of Awesome is just one of countless examples, but a fun presentation film, funny pixel art graphics and a nonsense narrative premise have allowed the Scotsman Nicoll Hunt to create a decent sequel around what all in all seemed immediately be a beat'em up like so many others. After a badly ended divorce with his ex-partner Andrew Smith (they had made the excellent Hard Lines together), Hunt was able to devote himself to what had been his great ambition since he was a boy: to create an unforgettable beat'em up . After finishing Fist of Awesome we can say for sure that no, the author didn't even come close to his dream. Fist of Awesome is a lively and humorous beat'em up, but also too repetitive Planet of Bears As we said, in Fist of Awesome a few seconds are enough to be overwhelmed by an absolutely crazy plot, full of humor and which makes extreme quotationism its forte. The protagonist is Tim Burr, a lumberjack with a beard and a standard plaid shirt, who all of a sudden finds himself with his house on fire and his family kidnapped. In full Back to the Future style, all that mess is apparently due to an event that took place in the past, due to which bears evolved and enslaved humans, effectively becoming the dominant race. The last ingredient in this cauldron of pure irrationality is the talking hand that accompanies Burr throughout his adventure and allows him to release powerful right-hands. From this point of view Hunt has managed to create a light but effective little story, which between deliberately ridiculous dialogues, puns and obvious references never fails to elicit a few laughs through clenched teeth. Clearly winking at Planet of the Apes, the tangling of the space-time continuum is a perfect pretext to take the protagonist to visit historical eras in their alternative version: what would the Middle Ages be like if instead of humans there were sentient bears? What about the London Underground? Among bears dressed as Boba Fett, possessed deer, Men in Black with fur and strip clubs run by animals, the author gave himself to mad joy, not sparing himself even with references to the pop world and other video games, from Portal to Back to the Future, from Zelda to Game of Thrones. Everything is represented through an extremely funny and lively pixel art graphic style, but the sound component stands out above all, on the one hand thanks to the chiptune music of Echolevel, on the other thanks to a sampling of sounds made verbally by the author himself , with absolutely hilarious sound effects and squeals. Too bad that a large part of the experience is reduced more or less to what has just been said, because once the bars and cameos have been removed, what remains is a beat'em up that is anything but fun. The control system starts from an interesting idea, and instead of resorting to the usual virtual keys, the author has preferred a transparent and intuitive interface: by sliding a finger in the left half of the screen, the protagonist can be moved in various directions, while the right side is used to attack; depending on whether you tap, hold, or slide your finger in a direction, your alter-ego performs a normal attack, special strike, or jump. By combining the various inputs, it is thus possible to perform a Shoryuken, grab an enemy and throw him against his companions, try a flying kick or rage on an opponent lying on the ground. Unfortunately it's not uncommon to hit one shot instead of another, and while the system works quite well overall, we're a long way from the revolutionary and dynamic controls the Scottish author promised in the past months. The lack of variety of attacks and the narrow combos collide with two major problems: the first concerns a poor balance work, due to which eliminating each enemy requires an abundant number of hits, making the experience frustrating and repetitive especially when you finds himself having to face the most crowded groups of opponents. There is very little need to level up and enhance the characteristics of the character, given that the difference in damage inflicted is completely inconsistent. The second big flaw can be seen in the almost total lack of originality and diversity among the enemies, if not for a simple aesthetic factor: all the opponents follow more or less the same attack pattern, and none of these, including the bosses, pushes who plays to adopt an sstrategy rather than another. Therefore, having to repeat the same attacks over and over again, boredom, needless to say, takes little time to arrive. The unlockable achievements or the presence of an Arena mode in which to use any of the characters and enemies are not enough to solve a beat'em up that is repetitive and uninspiring, stretched in many sequences and unable to offer an intriguing challenge from the first minute to the final boss.", "date": "2013-10-21", "grade": "5.8"}
