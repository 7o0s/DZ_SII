{"name": "Transformers: La Vendetta del Caduto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69170-transformers-la-vendetta-del-caduto-la-trasformazione-del-wii.html", "text": "Tested Version: Nintendo WiiSe on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is presented as a fairly well-made tie-in, which follows the plot of the film quite faithfully and allows us to control a large number of Autobots and Decepticons , on Wii and PlayStation 2 the situation is completely different. Developed by Krome Studios, this version of the game pushes the accelerator on the variety of situations and offers an alternative storyline, in which the robots are the absolute protagonists and the return of the Fallen occurs in compliance with an ancient prophecy rather than by the will of the revived Megatron. The structure is never fixed, with action sections that alternate with shooter phases in which the classic Space Harrier is somehow paid homage. The characters are fewer than the ~nextgen~ versions (on one hand Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide and Jetfire, on the other Megatron, Starscream and Sideways) and unfortunately it is not possible to transform at will except during certain situations. Furthermore, there are not two distinct campaigns, in which you take the lead of the Autobots or the Decepticons, but a single story mode that sometimes sees us fighting on the side of the ~good guys~, sometimes on the side of the ~bad guys~... Robotic extras In addition to the main mode, the game offers us a versus for two players, within a series of locations, as well as unlockable content by achieving achievements similar to those found on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Transformers fans will be delighted to be able to enjoy an episode of the original animated series (in English) and to be able to admire the polygonal models of the characters. Even from this point of view, however, the Wii and PS2 versions are poorer. One will stand, the other will fall Our robot (sometimes an Autobot, sometimes a Decepticon) has the objective of eliminating all the enemies present within each stage, as well as overcoming various types of obstacles. The view is fixed and the path, in fact, appears predetermined: in the end, just resolve the clashes in a favorable way to complete the level successfully. In these ~action~ sections, the character moves using the Nunchuck's analog stick and fires the primary (B trigger) and secondary (Z button, to load) weapon using the crosshair that is projected onto the screen through the infrared pointing of the Wii-mote. The hand-to-hand fights are regulated by shaking the Wii-mote (which allows us to land blows), by pressing the C button (to parry the opponent's attacks) and by shaking the Nunchuck (to perform an evasive maneuver). The d-pad is used to activate the special move (down) and to manage the energy bar (left) through a curious system that sees two superimposed indicators: the first represents our health and obviously empties as we suffer blows; The second is the amount of Energon collected from eliminated opponents, which can be used both to replenish the health bar, as well as to fuel the secondary attack (more powerful than the standard one) and the special move. The latter is generally very spectacular, and there is a clear reference to the episodes of Spyro the Dragon also edited by Krome Studios: our robot makes the earth tremble in a sort of bullet time, then shoots missiles or bursts of energy all around enemies that are nearby. The transformation capacity of the characters is re-evaluated during the ~shooter~ phases, which closely resemble the mechanics of Space Harrier and in which our robot (often it is Starscream) can change shape to attack the targets that are in front of him or behind him. Just press the d-pad down to transform, while all other commands remain the same. Stages that offer this type of action usually see us reach a certain goal and then return to the ~action~ phase, destroy what we need to destroy and then start again. QTA, what a passion! During the boss fight, you almost always find yourself facing simple quick time events in which you have to press the right button (or shake the Wii-mote) promptly following the instructions that appear on the screen. Unfortunately, failing one of these tests inevitably results in game over. Cheer up, however, because by continuing we will be able to pick up the game from where we left off without any particular problems. Technical realization As far as the technical aspect is concerned, this tie-in appears just discreet, alternating good things with decidedly less good things. On the one hand we have the characters: Autobots and Decepticons are relatively well done, faithful to qeverything seen in the film (apart from Devastator, here very simplified) and equipped with a fluid and sufficiently varied animation. The special moves are always spectacular, and it's a pleasure to watch them. On the other hand there are the scenarios, which are poor and bare, suffer from a choice of colors that are anything but happy and above all appear obsessively repetitive: we will go around the same places many times, and in particular the Decepticon base will always offer us the same landscape, without variations of any kind. The fixed view has been adopted to simplify the work of the graphics engine, but in this way, in addition to not being free to move, we will also have to deal with disadvantageous shots during the fights. During the test we happened to have to fight with an enemy while our character was hidden behind a wall: a not exactly nice situation. Finally, the special effects are decidedly inadequate. The sound boasts good music (which refers to those of the film), average effects and a well-made Italian dubbing, even if the usual systematic problem of interpretation remains: in a sequence of the game, Optimus Prime decides to go by Megatron because he has Bumblebee hostage and threatens to kill him, but the voice actor of the leader of the Autobots speaks with the calm of someone illustrating a documentary for children...", "date": "2009-07-27", "grade": "6.9"}
