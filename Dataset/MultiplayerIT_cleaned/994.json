{"name": "Tekken 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tekken-5_a.html", "text": "Good night and good blows Tekken 5 was therefore born as a kind of return to origins, abandoning the unwelcome novelties of the last few episodes and offering an experience all in all closer to the aforementioned third Tekken. Which, for those who got to know the series during its ~life cycle~, will have no trouble agreeing that it is absolutely a good thing. And in fact Tekken 5 immediately proves to be a title perfectly capable of reviving the glories of the genre; after a splendid initial sequence in FMV, the trademark of the Japanese softco, the player is in fact placed in front of the large amount of modes and extras that the programmers have decided to include in this domestic version. The main one is clearly the Story Mode, through which it is possible to choose your fighter among the thirty available and follow the vicissitudes of the narrative that acts as a common thread between the various matches. On the occasion of matches with relevant characters who are intertwined with the events of one's alter ego, it will also be possible to witness short interludes and exchanges of jokes, both before and after the actual battle. Obviously at the end of one's efforts there are also in this case the famous final sequences, personalized and enjoyable as per tradition. As an alternative to the Story Mode, there is the Arcade which, abandoning any type of narrative support, is inspired by Virtua Fighter 4, offering the player the possibility of starting from the bottom of a ranking to gradually reach the top. At the end of each fight, you are also given the option to choose your next challenger from a list of 3 characters, differing from each other in terms of skill level. The higher this rank, the more money will be earned by defeating him; money that obviously can be spent, more precisely for the purchase of a whole series of gadgets and clothing items with which to decorate your favorite wrestlers. Glasses, eye patches, jackets, bracelets and necklaces, different colors of clothes and so on until you get to the oddities of which we prefer to leave you the taste of discovery. As for the extras, certainly the most substantial is the 3D adventure called ~Devil Within~ which sees you engaged in the role of Jin Kazama through large levels full of enemies. The purely accessory nature of this short mode allows you to turn a blind eye to a control system that is certainly not flawless, a bare level design and a decidedly repetitive general rhythm. On the contrary, the inclusion of the first 3 chapters of the series is extremely appreciable, obviously in arcade-perfect conversions and without loading times; although the very first chapter definitely demonstrates the years it carries, the second and above all the third confirm the qualities that had been attributed to them at the time of their debut, still revealing themselves today as excellent exponents of the genre. It's a shame that, in the face of this orgy of goodies and add-ons, it's effectively missing an online game mode that would have made Tekken 5 a potential killer-app for the Sony console's underwhelming broadband multiplayer offering. But perhaps it is now too late to push on an aspect in which not even Sony itself has ever believed too much, thus leaving almost total exclusiveness to X-Box in this generation of consoles. Will it be for PS3? Squeezed like a lemon As for the game mechanics, there is little to say; it is Tekken raised to the nth degree, excellently balanced and capable of offering an excellent degree of challenge even to the most expert players thanks to the numerous levels of difficulty. The variety of fighting styles offered by the various fighters is exceptional, truly allowing anyone to find the one that best suits their tastes. Artificial intelligence, while not astonishing in its ability to improvise, nevertheless proves to be capable of drawing on a great variety of behavior patterns, thus preventing the repetition of the same move over and over again. What has made the Namco series so popular, i.e. the depth of the gameplay, also makes this last chapter a title capable of continuously stimulating the player to improve their technique, learning more and more articulated and complex moves. And after 10 years, being able to score a 15-hit combo from King is still a satisfaction that is difficult to describe in words ... As for the technical aspect, Tekken 5 is concrete proof of what it is possible to get out of Ps2 today, now that the perfect knowledge of the hardware allows you to bypass all its limits and thus work ~on the metal~. The fatigue of Japanese programmers is in fact aesthetically one of the best games available for the Sony console, offeringo a truly excellent level of detail and graphic complexity. Everything, starting from the characters to the settings, is modeled with an obsessive attention to detail that doesn't really make you feel the weight of the years of obsolete hardware. The animations are numerous, credible and perfectly connected to each other, just as the collisions of the polygons and the graphic effects are fully convincing; more generally, the overall solidity of what Tekken 5 has to offer aesthetically is surprising, and support for 16:9 and high definition are just the icing on the cake that confirms the care taken by Namco. The sound is also excellent, with always catchy and themed music and effects, and with the sentences pronounced by the wrestlers recited in a credible and not a caricatured way. Comment Tekken 5 is in all respects the first chapter of the series during this generation of consoles capable of really doing justice to the name it bears. Although it is by no means destined to convert the detractors of the series due to a mechanism that is so perfected but certainly not revolutionized, the Namco production manages to hit the mark by offering a product with attention to every aspect, solid, very rich in extras but above all fun. The lack of the online component is the only real flaw that we feel we can move to the effort of Japanese programmers, but on the other hand on Ps2 by now the broadband multiplayer train seems to have passed making very few stops. That said, it's time to make room on the shelf: alongside Virtua Fighter 4 and Soul Calibur 2, Tekken 5 deserves a place in every fan's collection. Pros Balanced and challenging gameplay Sumptuous aesthetic Huge amount of extras to unlock Cons Won't convert the series' detractors Online multiplayer, this unknown Ten years have now passed since, first in the arcade and shortly after on Psone, the Namco of the ~golden age~ pulled that Tekken out of the hat, which quickly became one of the founding fathers of the three-dimensional fighting game genre. The sequels on the 32-bit Sony did nothing but improve the formula from practically every point of view, with the culmination of the third chapter which still remains a true masterpiece of the past generation of consoles. However, the subsequent versions of the series have not been able to maintain and develop the growing qualitative parable, also due to the creative crisis of the softco which coincided with the advent of Ps2. So here is that first Tekken Tag Tournament and then Tekken 4 they proved to be good fighting games for matches, but victims of changes in the mechanics that have not made inroads in the hearts of fans. After a long pause for reflection, Namco has therefore decided to really roll up their sleeves to avoid the decline of such an important name, packaging a fifth chapter that is finally up to par.", "date": "2005-03-22", "grade": null}
