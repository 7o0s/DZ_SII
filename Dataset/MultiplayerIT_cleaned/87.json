{"name": "Bomberman '93", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bomberman-93.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Upon its release, Bomberman '93 was one of the killer applications of an unforgettable console, with little popular fame in Europe but with a huge success in the Rising Sun in its various versions: the PC Engine / Turbographx. Subsequently converted for SuperNES, Bomberman '93 represents for simplicity and cohesion of the game mechanics one of the best episodes of the series. The game mechanics are simple, apparently even trivial, yet simply brilliant, and its few, perfect elements are the arenas, made up of walls and blocks to be destroyed by releasing bombs; the explosions of the bombs left by the players, which occupy ever greater spaces than the passable areas forcing constant taking of cover and ever more careful and tactical use on pain of self-destruction; power-ups, which allow you to enhance explosions, increase the number of bombs launched at the same time, kick them towards enemies, and so on; and, of course, the enemies to obliterate. It almost goes without saying: Bomberman, which is a very pleasant game played alone in the adventure mode, literally explodes in multiplayer mode, generating levels of challenge rarely seen in videogame history. The possibility of simultaneous five-player multiplayer, guaranteed by the use of a multitap peripheral for SuperNES that multiplied the inputs for the console controllers, made Bomberman '93 and other chapters of the series an unforgettable chapter in videogame history. What is it today Bomberman '93 on Wii is a game absolutely unaffected by the passage of time: if some of the later versions have introduced variations on the theme and new power-ups, the simplicity and perfection of this chapter ensure its entry into that rare category of games that they are not affected by technological evolution, and continue to constitute more unique than rare opportunities for entertainment. Furthermore, Bomberman '93 is terribly in line with the spirit of a console like Wii: it is a game capable of gathering five people in front of a screen for challenges with incredibly simple premises and control and, from these, generating tactical and psychological warfare terrifying (the more players, the more arena stress) and potentially endless controller skirmishes. Wiimotes, Classic Controllers and GameCube controllers are just as good for gaming, and the combination of native options and Virtual Console software assigns commands for all players with ease. Strongly recommended: it is among the best multiplayer available for Wii, but also in history. Neither a puzzle, nor an action, nor a party game (ante litteram, given that the series is well beyond its first decade of life): simply, Bomberman. If there are any games destined not to suffer at all with the passage of time, Bomberman '93 is certainly among them. Initially released for the PC Engine, it is a stage in a long series that is still in excellent health today and dates back to the times of Super NES and Amiga (here Bomberman was known as Dynablaster). Today this Hudson Soft classic, considered by many to be one of the best games ever released, is available in the Wii Virtual Console catalogue. For the cost of 600 Wii Points, one of the most extreme and frenetic multiplayer games in history can once again wreak havoc on your console.", "date": "2007-02-16", "grade": null}
