If the latter aimed decisively on a type of terror to be instilled in the players through splatter situations or sudden twists, the type of approach chosen in this sense by the Konami developers was different, especially with the first two episodes. In fact, these focused more on the atmosphere to scare users, ~imposing~ on them that sense of unease, tension and abandonment that an empty city, dark environments or environments covered by thick fog and sinister noises can arouse in anyone. A more subtle horror in some ways. All elements that, by now it is known, are missing in Silent Hill: Book of Memories, exclusive to PlayStation Vita by WayForward Technologies, which however it is good to remember is only a spin-off and not a regular title in the series, clearly inspired by those hack n' slash with RPG elements a la Blizzard's Diablo. There are the dilapidated and corroded settings, there are the classic enemies of the saga, but everything else is inevitably missing, including that type of twisted and mysterious plot that has made the fortune of most of the titles focused on the ~silent hill~ . Here the story, certainly trivial, in fact becomes a mere pretext to be able to access various scenarios in which to fight enemies and collect objects and experience. But let's proceed in order: at the beginning of the adventure, on his birthday, a well-known character who has already appeared in Silent Hill: Downpour gives the protagonist a mysterious book that comes from the foggy city and which apparently contains all the his memories until the delivery of the package itself. Among other things, this tome has a peculiarity, namely the power to drag anyone who has to do with it into an endless series of nightmares that are able to distort reality by rewriting the facts. And this is what happens to the character controlled by the player when he decides to delete and rewrite some passages. PSVita trophies In Silent Hill: Book of Memories there are 58 Trophies available as follows: 48 Bronze, 8 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. The ways to unlock them vary depending on the behavior held in certain circumstances, therefore perhaps reaching Zone 50, or leveling up to 25 with your character, using a Super Move such as the one called Karma Reversal or Push Force to overturn 8 or more enemies at the same time or, again, in relation to the type of ending obtained. Not a survivalist As mentioned at the beginning, what characterizes and distinguishes Silent Hill: Book of Memories from the rest of the titles in the Konami series is the typically action RPG style of play with an isometric view: at the beginning it is possible to create your own avatar and equip it, after having chosen a series of aesthetic characteristics, with weapons, objects and artifacts, many of which the user then finds as they progress through the adventure, scattered throughout the levels. The latter are made up of a series of labyrinthine maps in which players have to get around solving puzzles of a certain complexity, avoiding traps and facing increasingly horrendous and disturbing creatures and bosses, in an attempt to reach the exit. The various areas are in fact formed by a fair number of rooms which are connected to each other by a series of long one-way corridors (and which therefore require the player to do some backtracking) and peppered with a good number of enemies borrowed from the whole saga. From zombie nurses to the now legendary Pyramid Head up to that slimy Valtiel, passing through some brand new nightmare creature, they are all there waiting impatiently for the protagonist of the adventure. Ditto for weapons: also in this case there is a discreet mix of old and new, for which we pass from the familiar pipe-shaped tube to the traditional knife, up to a series of new and particular blunt objects, such as pistols lasers or swords. Of course, there is also the flashlight that can be activated or deactivated by simply pressing the Select key. Most of the weapons tend to wear out after constant use and can be upgraded, moreover you can also equip two at a time, since the square and triangle keys of Life each represent a hand of the protagonist. The fights, not too complex in setting up but sometimes difficult in their unfolding due to the number and hostile nature of certain enemies, obviously take place in real time and in a frenetic way: just press one of the backbones to engage the opponent, a button (or two in sequence for genwere combos) to hit them or the rear touch pad of the console to use special powers against them, the equivalent of spells in RPGs, until they collapse, leaving the typical dungeon crawler loot on the ground, or alternatively a slick of liquid which determines, if touched, the change of the character's moral sense towards Good or Evil. The protagonist's morality is in fact regulated through the so-called Karma system, which is in turn closely related to the types of creatures that the user encounters during his journey and which are mainly linked to Light and Blood. In practice, having a karma of one type rather than another can affect the use of the special abilities described above rather than others, or the behavior of certain opponents themselves: monsters with a similar morality to the one they have at that moment the gamer won't attack it or even defend it from those of enemies with different karma, and so on. The fog on the steep hills Still on the subject of commands, the front touch of the console is limited to managing resources, opening help messages on the screen or removing objects from drawers. For fans of the saga all this may seem like heresy, but the developer claims to have captured the essence of Silent Hill in this context as well. We believe that this is not exactly the case, even if the title from a gameplay point of view is certainly not bad, on the contrary, even the controls are quite reactive. The problem, more than anything else, seems to be in our opinion the format of the game itself: if this approach already sacrifices the survival horror spirit of the franchise, the small screen size of a laptop helps to make situations even less scary than the normal, although WayForward Technologies has tried to draw on the mythology of the series to recreate the typical situations of panic and terror. Going back to gameplay, and to definitively close the discussion relating to the exploratory phase, among the various rooms to visit there are some particular ones such as the one, randomly generated, which is used as a save point (the only one, therefore inconvenient because each time you have to retrace the old ~roads~ to be able to save the game), another as a shop where you can stock up on everything, managed by the character of Downpour mentioned above and whose identity we obviously don't reveal, and others containing challenges . The latter generally consist in breaking particular luminous spheres, in facing and eliminating under certain conditions the enemies that come out immediately after having made this gesture and in recovering, once the battle is won, some puzzle pieces useful for continuing in the adventure . Naturally, the game can be played in multiplayer mode, online or ad-hoc, for up to a maximum of four players, to explore Silent Hill in company and hunt for enemies and objects. Here the game performs quite well and during our test we did not notice any particular problems using the services related to the mode, just a pity that there is no drop-in / drop-out system. To conclude, let's take a quick look at the technical part: visually Silent Hill: Book of Memories is an excellent title, with the general setting that has been reconstructed with a fair fidelity towards the town that many players have loved and explored on several occasions over the past twelve years. In this sense, WayForward Technologies has maintained that damned and rusty look typical of Konami's survival world, doing everything possible to make each new room more and more disturbing in its everyday life, thanks also to a wise use of light sources. Excellent sound, with effects and most of the music taken from the Silent Hill universe.", "date": "2012-11-20", "grade": "7.0"}
