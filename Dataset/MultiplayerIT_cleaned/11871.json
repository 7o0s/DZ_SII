In fact, it is thanks to the surprising Nintendo portable that one of Nintendo's historical series was able to obtain that breath of novelty and innovation that had been singled out as the main - if not the only - defect of the beautiful Twilight Princess. We are obviously talking about The Legend of Zelda, a cornerstone of the N-difference for years and finally settled in the ~kingdom~ of the dual screen and stylus with this highly anticipated Phantom Hourglass. Son of the wind Although the episode for Gamecube, Wind Waker, has been one of the most contested and discussed mainly due to the cartoonish graphic style in cel shading that has aroused feelings of love or hate, it is from this chapter that Phantom Hourglass develops, revealing in fact as a full-fledged direct sequel. In fact, the intro develops by briefly narrating the events of Wind Waker, only to then move on to the present: Link again traveling across the seas with his pirate friends including Dazel, back in her initial guise, in search of treasures and new adventures . Unfortunately, however, the plans soon undergo a drastic change when the crew sight and join the cursed ghost ship; Dazel, heedless of the warnings, decides to get on board disappearing soon with a scream, and the heroic Link in an attempt to save her falls into the sea dragged away by the waves and then wakes up on a beach. This is therefore the incipit of an adventure which at the plot level is roughly outlined on the classic dictates of the series, but which changes several cards on the table as regards mechanics and game structure. Starting from the control system, entirely based on touch screen and stylus; to make the hero move, just keep the tip of the stylus leaning on the direction you want to reach, positioning him near or far from Link respectively if you want him to walk slowly or rather run. Fights in the same way require swiping the stylus on enemies for a blow, tapping for a lunge and making circles around the protagonist to create the classic spinning blow. Finally, making small circles in the running direction allows Link to roll forward. A solution that, after some initial embarrassment, proves to be incredibly effective, intuitive and responsive, even if on occasion it may happen that some unwanted action is performed by mistake. But beyond the simple movements, it is in the use of objects and in the interaction with the environment that Phantom Hourglass offers new emotions and the sensation of rediscovering the series. With the boomerang, for example, you have to trace the trajectory you want it to follow, the bombs reach the point you want by simply touching it, and the hookshot gains new life by revealing itself as a versatile tool for reaching unexplored areas. These are obviously just a few examples, but in general the programmers' ability to create a product that appears to be studied around the hardware in every aspect, and not simply adapted, is astonishing. And there is also the exploitation of the microphone in which to scream or blow, and still the closure of the DS to be used as a tool for solving puzzles. But we said at the beginning that this chapter for the Nintendo portable is a direct successor to Wind Waker, and as such obviously the navigation phases between one island and another could not be missing. Aware of the fact that the latter were not exactly among the most successful aspects of the Gamecube episode, the team responsible for the project has well thought of giving a nice injection of variety and dynamism with a number of really interesting changes. First of all, these sections simply take up much less time, and the boat automatically follows the course drawn with the stylus on the map; secondly, interactivity has been amplified both with naval battles against enemies of various forms through the cannon that will soon be available for purchase, and thanks to the ability to recover treasures with the hook. In the latter case, you move on to a real mini-game in which you control the same hook trying to avoid mines in the phase of reaching and recovering the coveted prize. If we add to this that the same boat can be customized with a series of aesthetic modifications (and not only), it is easy to understand how the navigation sections have become not only better, but also much more fun than Wind Waker. A small world for a big hero But the differences of Phantom Hourglass compared to the previous chapters do not end there, far from it; in this case, in fact, we are faced with a more restricted, simplified universeed but not demeaned, which reduces the times of the epic navigation (or rides) between one place and another, consolidating everything in a convincing way. This also works out in smaller dungeons, taking much less time in most cases than by series standards; an aspect that has been rather discussed in the criticism of this new Zelda, but which frankly seemed perfectly integrated and completely consistent with the spirit of the entire game and more generally with the philosophy of using a portable console. Although reduced in size, the dungeons almost always maintain the grandiose design that has always distinguished the series, and are perfectly capable of conveying the same feeling of authentic gratification and enthusiasm once completed that they have always guaranteed in the past. Furthermore, once again, the qualities of the console have always been held in high consideration by often including puzzles that require you to take ~notes~, or to write or draw information on the map. All this does not mean that there are no defects, which can basically be framed in some passages that denounce slight drops in quality such as the high backtracking required by the Sanctuary of the King Mar, but in general the approximately 15 hours of fun that the Nintendo production guarantees always flow on levels that belong only to the great games. The battles with the bosses deserve a special mention, really creative with regard to the combat methods and -once again- due to the need to exploit the qualities of the laptop. As far as the technical component is concerned, the Japanese programmers have managed to extract from the not too generous DS hardware a fantastic three-dimensional world (with a bit of intelligent 2D and the help of non-rotatable cameras) which turns out to be a real joy for the eyes. The characterization of the characters is also impeccable, as is the diversification of the various islands, and the musical accompaniment always proves to be up to par by offering songs in line with the quality that is typical of the series. To increase the longevity of the product, the programmers have also decided to add a multiplayer mode, mindful of the excellent results received from Four Swords. In reality, in this case the final result cannot be considered of equal quality, proposing a sort of capture the flag in which one player directly controls Link, while the others draw the path that the guardians will have to follow to prevent the hero from recovering the pieces of the triforce. Fun for a few games, and the fact that alongside the possibility of playing it with multicart or single cartridge there is also a wi-fi option complete with statistics, but we certainly cannot say that this mode will be remembered over the years. Comment The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass does not disappoint expectations and the long wait, in all likelihood proving to be the DS game that best represents and exploits the capabilities of the console. But beyond this splendid cohesion with the hardware, Link's latest adventure is also and above all a sublime exponent of the series who courageously moves away from it by proposing substantial changes and innovations, capable of refreshing the concept without betraying any aspect. If at the end of 2007 you have to buy only one game for the Nintendo portable, the choice couldn't be simpler and more obvious. Pros A splendid adventure Makes perfect use of the DS Innova more than you might expect Cons For some too simple Shrine of the Sea King tiring Multiplayer mode not equal to Four Swords", "date": "2007-11-01", "grade": null}
