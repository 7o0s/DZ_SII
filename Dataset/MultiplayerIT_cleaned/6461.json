However, a closer look is enough to realize that Mr Jump here absolutely does not deserve to be dismissed as yet another trivial platform game: let's find out why. 12 shades of jump Mr Jump starts from a simple structure that couldn't be simpler: the stylized character with a square head runs alone, and it's up to the user to touch the touch screen to make him jump with the necessary timing to allow him to avoid the obstacles that arise along the way. The greater the duration of the pressure of the finger on the display, the greater the height of the leap made by the protagonist: an element that is only apparently trivial, but which combined with a truly well-chosen level design actually represents the winning weapon of the 1Button title. This is because in Mr Jump the player is called to jump with millimeter precision in order to avoid contact with any element of the scenario, under penalty of immediate game over and the consequent obligation to start over. It only takes a few seconds of play to understand that 1Button is a product that goes straight to the point, without too many cosmetic or playful frills but which instead focuses entirely on clean and essential gameplay. Therefore, the user must ~only~ commit to jumping with good timing and adequately dosing the power to move from one platform to another, with the aim of reaching the end of the level unscathed. And yes, because Mr Jump does not belong to the much reviled team of endless runners, but instead presents stages (12 to be precise) characterized by well-defined paths and not randomly generated in each game: a choice which, if on the one hand opens the road to a game system in which reaching the finish line inevitably passes through the memorization of the route, on the other hand it allowed the developers to push hard on the level design accelerator. Which in fact is of excellent workmanship, with very well made levels and above all characterized by a dominant theme: only the first stage is of a classic platform matrix, while all the subsequent ones offer modifiers that make the experience always different and keep the level of challenge. Mr Jump brings to fruition a simple but winning idea in the best possible way The considerable average difficulty is precisely one of the most fascinating aspects of Mr Jump, which manages to manage this important factor making it central to the playful experience but without allowing it to lead to frustration: thanks mainly to a very high pace of play, starting over immediately stage after a fatal error becomes an almost automatic action, such is the desire to go even one step beyond the point where you fell in the previous game (indicated on the screen by a dotted line). It also benefits from the fact that the levels are extremely dense with obstacles but not too long, allowing users of any skill level to make progress and be able to aspire to complete them with a little dedication and patience. Wanting to really look for a criticism to move to a ~precise~ title like Mr Jump, it can be said that an additional challenge component is missing for the more hardcore players: the software takes into account the statistics relating to the completion of the levels (time required to complete them term, number of attempts, etc.) and assigns a useful score to compose a ranking on the Game Center, but something more could have been done, perhaps by developing specific objectives or challenges for each stage. However, this is a really minor problem for a title that is above all free and which only uses advertisements (not too invasive) to support itself, leaving aside all those sinister ploys that have contributed to ruining the reputation of free-to-play. And even if we are not dealing with a technical masterpiece, Mr Jump nevertheless remains a pleasant product also from an audiovisual point of view: the graphics show off that minimal and colorful style which is typical of 1Button works, while for the sound sector noteworthy is the fact that each level has its own spot on theme music.", "date": "2015-03-25", "grade": "8.6"}
