{"name": "Mayhem in Single Valley", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mayhem-in-single-valley-recensione.html", "text": "Arrived on Steam a few days ago, Mayhem in Single Valley is a new exploration and puzzle adventure developed by Fluxscopic Ltd., a team working for the first time with a real complete video game. Unfortunately we cannot say the first one is good, as the game fails from almost all points of view. Let's see the details in our review of Mayhem in Single Valley. Random, why yes Mayhem in Single Valley opens up simple to potentially interesting: then it all gets worse Mayhem in Single Valley opens simply. We are Jack, a boy who lives in a small town and who has the opportunity to leave everything and go to study in the city, where he can build a future. Jack's family is poor, his mother too busy keeping the walls standing, and his alcoholic father moves from armchair to bed. Our protagonist is about to leave when he notices a dark figure poisoning the river water, which in turn transforms animals and people into subspecies of poison-spitting zombies. Also, Jack is falsely accused of being the culprit. Thus begins the adventure of this normal provincial boy, who has to clean up his record and save his loved ones. Over the next five hours, however, it will be chaos and we assure you that we by no means mean that in a good way. As always, we prefer not to make any spoilers, even if as you will see we do not advise anyone to embark on this adventure. However, we can say that Mayhem in Single Valley takes us around Jack's hometown, on a goosebumps ride in which each step makes less sense than the previous one. Clearly the development team wanted to give a nonsense touch to what happens, between vagabonds riding ostriches, magical astronauts who appear out of nowhere and a sudden breaking of the fourth wall managed as one of the worst plot twists in history. The problem is that the end result is a meaningless, rhythmless and purposeless set of events that fail to excite or entertain and seem more like a mix of different stories inconclusively merged. There is no shortage of multiple characters that appear out of nowhere without any anticipation and sometimes disappear just as quickly, prompting us at all times to ask ourselves whether it would not have been better to completely avoid including them. Jump, dodge, throw Mayhem in Single Valley: run, boy, run The real problem of Mayhem in Single Valley, however, does not lie in the narrative, but in the entire play structure. All in all, the basics might seem solid initially, but the more you go on the more the work becomes boring and sometimes downright annoying. Jack is not a warrior and the game tells us so clearly. Jack must use his wits to continue, avoiding enemies as much as possible. The boy is able to jump, move furniture and throw small objects. Furthermore, like any normal person, Jack is fragile and a single blow from any enemy will be enough to make him fall to the ground as a stone dead (there are rare garbage can lids, which automatically save us from a single fatal blow). To get by we have to escape and move from one area to another, or we have to distract or cure the infected. Indeed, the idea is that each animal has its own favorite food, to be recovered in the environment and combined with a soothing liqueur: just throw away the right food and the animal will cease to be a threat. Or we can throw anything in his face to stun him for what second. The truth is that, except on very rare occasions, treating animals doesn't make much sense, since they are present in large numbers and we will never have the resources to free an entire area. The enemies are there to make the exploration more complex, forcing us to constantly jump and dodge in environments that are not very intriguing in terms of level design and hurry towards the next area where we will recover some key objects to advance. The throwing and item combination system is not used in any creative way. There is also a system of upgrades - obtainable through objects that act as skill points -: unfortunately, even in this case it is a mechanic that quickly fades into the background and has no great impact on the adventure. You then spend the time running from side to side to retrieve key items related to the story, passing through some structurally too simple platforming sections and some very trivial puzzles. The game also boasts the fact that it includes a physical simulation of objects (in other words, gravity exists and objects that are not too heavy can be pushed): this element is also never exploited in depth, except for movingpry an object so that you have a step to reach a point beyond the character's normal jump range. What Mayhem lacks in Single Valley is an interesting idea, a flash of kidneys that lifts it from flatness. Unfortunately it never arrives: the game does not challenge our manual skills or even our intellectual ones. At least the graphic style is pleasant, even if considering the non-sense narration the development team could have bet everything on the absurd, giving us a much more original series of passages. Instead, we are stuck in everyday environments, from a forest to a canyon to various urban areas that are extremely generic and with a color palette", "date": "2021-05-27", "grade": "4.0"}
