{"name": "Project I.G.I.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-igi.html", "text": "Diary of an infiltrator sitting comfortably in front of the PC I installed the game, I selected the language (Italian, but only for the menus and subtitles), I set the graphics to the maximum possible for my monitor (1024x768x32) and immediately jumped into the action when I saw that the first mission was the one featured in the demo I didn't feel bored at all, on the contrary I carefully followed the briefing in pure Hollywood style and jumped off the speeding train and found myself in the enemy base with not exactly the boldest of goals for a hero of my own caliber: steal a truck You think it was easy? Not a chance. The bad guys on duty fired real lead bullets and finding myself battered is a matter of seconds. When I deactivated the security cameras I realized that I had 2 minutes to get rid of the guards, I went out of the building and I noticed with great joy that I was in front of a perfectly reconstructed base. The graphics are of the highest level and I could not help but take my trusty binoculars to find at a glance the enemy guards who, as attentively as listlessly, walk up and down looking for intruders a pity to have to interrupt this state of tranquility for climb the tower with the water silo and kill the first sniper using my razor sharp knife. After descending from the tower, I went to snoop around the barracks... if it hadn't been for the voices I heard coming from behind a wall of wood and plaster... nothing better to test the new peculiarities of the physical model of the bullets that pierce the thinnest walls. By the time I had to reload it was already too late for them, I stole their ammo (good as hotcakesuse it well!) and walked out taking a look at my satellite system. It takes a strategic maneuver, you can't continue to the target by shooting everything that moves. We start by eliminating CCTV cameras. Someone noticed my presence and sounded the alarm, everyone is looking for me but hidden behind some speakers I was waiting for an idea to come to me, when I lean over to take a look I am seen and hit despite being ~covered~ by the speakers, I try to escape but it's useless, the AI of the enemies is worthy of being called intelligence even if artificial and so I hide in a hangar and wait for things to calm down, the alarm stops ringing but the guards won't give me a break, I'll use the grenades I found but I only have 2, I take off the safety, put a little force and throw perfect minus 2 guards. Diary of an infiltrator sitting comfortably in front of the PC I still have to find a way to reach the goal and I decide to climb over a fence, waiting for other guards, this time they surround me and hide to avoid being hit, one of them is preparing to sound the alarm but the cold one moment before I succeed, by now it's only a few tens of meters and I'll have made it, I hit them aiming at the head with my machine gun and steal the truck... it wasn't easy. This and more is what Project I.G.I. can offer you. Subsequent missions have different objectives ranging from sabotaging a base's air defenses to rescuing hostages, the environments are flawlessly crafted. What is this Project I.G.I. in two words? It's a 3D shooter with one thing that makes it different from the others: tactics combined with a wise use of your resources, be they ammunition or health points. The graphics engine juggles very well both in closed spaces and in the immense expanses of polygons and textures that form the landscape. Moreover, it is the Joint Strike Fighter engine modified for the occasion The visual quality is always of the highest level, the textures are made very well and are not repetitive especially as regards the exteriors I tried to use the cheat to fly and moving towards the horizon I realized that the image you see is not a pre-rendered image but the fabulous engine. The frame rate never drops below 30fps and playing is a feast for the eyes. The effects are normal but don't expect something comparable to Sacrifice the explosions, one of the few things that left me perplexed, could have been made much better and as regards the effects of ~conventional~ weapons, a good job was done, you can see splinters and splatters of blood projected according to the direction of the bullets. The sound is also outstanding, Creative's EAX support with a 4-speaker system makes the gaming emotion even stronger. The msounds that are well made but in a game like this you don't even notice it given the concentration required to play them with some results For the test I used my K7 800 with Geforce2 but I also tried it on a Celeron 500 with a ~old~ Voodoo2 and the fluidity in 800x600x16 is more than good. It's important to remember that there won't be thousands of graphic settings to customize the visual quality to your PC's performance, there will be a more intuitive bar that will decrease detail in favor of performance and vice versa. The positive expectations that arose during the preview phase were confirmed when I was able to touch this new Interloop Studios/Eidos creation by hand. Premise Among the many FPS out there, is there anyone who surprised you? Did it really make you feel inside the game with the adrenaline circulating in your body?
