The play system of the title developed by Red Barrels is actually quite simple, but the ideas put in place immediately prove to be very valid and a punctual direction does the rest, catapulting us into a real first-person nightmare. In the game we take on the role of Miles Upshur, an investigative journalist who decides to visit the Mount Massive Asylum, a recently reopened psychiatric institution, following a report from an anonymous source who denounces the conduct of inhuman experiments within the facility. Armed only with our video camera and a clipboard, we reach the building but find the security booth empty and the entrance doors closed; so we decide to sneak into the asylum by climbing some scaffolding and taking advantage of an open window. Once inside, however, things immediately take a disturbing turn and what seemed like a good idea turns into something decidedly less pleasant. In fact, creatures that have very little human nature roam the rooms of the building, and behind the experiments we wanted to investigate, there seem to be terrible backgrounds. Will we be able to unravel them and stay alive to tell the tale? Outlast is a survival horror capable of making you jump on your seat, well done but with some limitations REC As mentioned at the beginning, it is not the gameplay that makes Outlast a decidedly interesting title, but some of the ideas that characterize it. In the first place, we can say that it is a ~pure~ survival horror, i.e. in the game it is not possible to defend oneself from any attacks except by running away and hiding (as in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, to name one), which creates a state of constant tension; especially when you still don't realize what the ~field of view~ of the mutants that move within the locations is, once this is identified, the stealth phase can be managed in a less traumatic way. However, it is the introduction of the video camera and its night vision function that makes the difference, because it allows us to see in the dark, identify any threats in the distance (there is also the zoom) and further enrich the atmosphere thanks to the typical effect ~dithering~ and the greenish tones that characterize this feature. If our character's vital energy is restored after a few moments, at least where one manages to escape one's assailants and hide somewhere waiting for them to ~forget~ about us, the same cannot be said of the stylus batteries that are used to keep the camera on and that we can collect around the stages. When the batteries run out, fortunately the device continues to function but in a limited way, and this can represent a big problem during a specific phase of the adventure, even if it is certainly possible to implement an ~energy saving~ strategy by limiting recording to when is strictly necessary. Framing places, writing on the walls and characters often translates into the transcription of notes that we can view from the pause menu, together with the documents found in the rooms of the institute and which perform the traditional role of in-depth analysis of a certainly well-told but far from being particularly original. Playstation 4 trophies There are eight Trophies contained in Outlast, and obtaining them is generally simple. In fact, it is enough to complete the game, collect all the documents present in the locations and complete certain tasks which are still part of the campaign. Getting the Trophy for completing the ~Insane~ level is obviously the hardest achievement to unlock. Hide or die There are several things that work really well in Outlast. The aforementioned direction, to name one, which manages to masterfully dose the ~jumps on the chair~ that a good horror title must be able to guarantee, and which obviously are not lacking here. The controls, which are not characterized by the ~wood~ of the first Resident Evil and indeed allow us to have a good mobility, even to jump running on tables and obstacles like the new Faith when we are being chased by an enemy, with the touch of class of being able to turn around during the escape to understand what is the distance that separates us from an almost certain death. By the way, the control layout is the same as the PC version when using the controller. All this is accompanied by a soundtrack capable of creating a great atmosphere, recited (in English, with Italian subtitles) in a masterly manner between screams, sighs, dialogues of great effect, as well as the rumble of the heartbeat of the protagonist, does moreIt is intense when we are hidden inside a locker or under a bed and we see our potential perpetrator looking around for traces to find us. At the same time there are some limitations that prevent the Red Barrels title from really standing out, above all the simplicity of a gameplay which, without the load of tension and all the accompanying implications, turns out to be modest in its mechanics and also fairly repetitive, so much so that the approximately five hours needed to complete the campaign - not many, one could argue - avoid the onset of tiredness compared to the alternation of very similar situations, which do not involve solving puzzles but only play on finding keys or activating devices to move to the next area. Furthermore, the graphics do not make you cry out for a miracle, on the contrary in many ways it presents an ~old gen~ modeling and scenarios that are a little too anonymous. We looked back at the PC version for a direct comparison with the PlayStation 4 version, and in fact they look identical in terms of resolution (1080p) effects and frame rate (60 frames per second). Perhaps on the Sony console the textures are a little less defined, but we are waiting for a proper comparison to express ourselves in this sense. Certainly there is the novelty of the ~Insane~ difficulty level, which does not provide for saves and dispenses batteries very sparingly, offering us a truly hardcore experience and probably more relevant to reality than a journalist who has the (un) happy idea of sneak into a building full of violent psychopaths.", "date": "2014-02-07", "grade": "7.5"}
