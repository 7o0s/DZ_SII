The franchise created by Insomniac Games has marked all Sony platforms across the board, thanks to the successful integration between shooter and platform dynamics. This Ratchet & Clank Trilogy therefore contains the first three episodes released on PlayStation 2 since 2002, namely Ratchet & Clank, Ratchet & Clank: Fire at Will (2003) and Ratchet & Clank 3 released the latter in 2004. All obviously in the glory of 1080p at sixty frames per second or 720p of stereoscopic 3D. Ratchet & Clank (2002) Ratchet & Clank was not the usual 3D platform equal to the many that were coming out taking advantage of the renewed technical potential of the new consoles of the time. The originality of the title, the funniest and most peculiar feature of the game lies in the use of multiple gadgets and the many weapons available to the two protagonists. The purpose of the game (or rather of the games) is essentially to recover infobots, or devices that reveal the position of new planets, corresponding to the various levels. The freedom to explore is relative, fortunately Insomniac has introduced a sort of Metroid/Castlevania backtracking thanks to which some areas that cannot be visited immediately can only be traveled through the use of particular gadgets. Plus solving simple puzzles, tricky puzzles, end-of-level bosses, and hoverboard racing. This choice gives an extra pinch of variety to the linearity of the game. Where the game really won was in the sheer amount of weapons available. Thanks to the exploration and killing of enemies, we will be able to collect bolts which are nothing more than the currency accepted in all the gadgetron points of sale in the game, and which will then be used to buy a whole series of more or less conventional weapons . Starting from the blaster, a classic old-fashioned shooter pistol, Ratchet will have a truly enviable arsenal at his disposal during the game: bazookas, weapons that suck up enemies and then use them as ammunition, flamethrowers and much more, for an arsenal that easily overcomes thirty units. Playstation 3 trophies Ratchet & Clank Trilogy rewards the player with 24 bronze, 9 silver, 5 gold, 1 platinum trophies, plus several secret trophies. They are obtained in principle with the progression in the three titles, even if many involve us in collecting all the hidden objects, in particular timed sections, defeating the bosses with only the wrench and much more. Ratchet & Clank 2: Fire Willing (2003) The following year the winning formula of the first episode is not simply replicated, but rather expanded by the inclusion of a simple one role-playing part that complicates the player's ~tactical~ choices for the better. Obviously we are not talking about complicated mechanics that weigh down the gameplay, but the possibility of enhancing and ~specializing~ the usual dozens of weapons available, without forgetting a basic experience system for Ratchet necessary to maximize his health. Otherwise the same formula as the first episode (and this was the most important criticism that the game received at the time), with bosses, puzzles and mini-games in profusion. The most classic of the more of the same, beautiful to look at, varied and very entertaining, but without a doubt the ~most negligible~ title of this Ratchet & Clank Trilogy. Ratchet & Clank 3 (2004) The best of the first three episodes without a doubt, it being understood that dynamics and gameplay have not changed at all, only refined and improved. Although perhaps this time the feeling of being in a shooter is really strong, also because you have a (cumbersome) first person view available that has little to envy to real FPSs. Much importance is given to returning to explore the previously visited planets, not only to use the gadgets necessary to reach previously inaccessible areas, but also because backtracking is very useful for purely economic purposes, as each completed mission brings us money to spend on weapons and armor. In terms of longevity, as usual settled over ten hours of play (mini games excluded), the inclusion of multiplayer, off line and online, is appreciable, which engages a maximum of eight players on classic game modes such as Capture the Flag and Deathmatches. Speaking of graphics, the work done to rejuvenate Ratchet & Clank Trilogy is certainly commendable, the sixty frames per second and the high resolutionand they still make the games very attractive, even the first chapter, which of the three is certainly the one that most denounces the weight of the years. In this sense, the visual evolution between the various episodes, thanks to the aesthetic revamping, is even more marked, with Ratchet & Clank 3 which is still nice to watch despite eight years having passed, with a substantial work of polygonal construction of the crowded levels and ~special effects~.", "date": "2012-06-19", "grade": "8.0"}
