{"name": "La recensione di Insidia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/195675-insidia-la-recensione-di-insidia.html", "text": "Insidia is basically a turn-based strategy mixed with a MoBA. The goal of each game is to destroy the opposing team's base, and there are basically two ways to do it: being able to penetrate its defensive shield to make it explode from the inside, or depleting its energy supply by eliminating all defenders (destruction in this case it is automatic). Both modes have their pros and cons and are more or less feasible depending on the team you're up against and the opponent's tactics. The game system is very simple and is explained with great accuracy by the integrated tutorial. At the beginning of each game the player must compose his team, selecting four of the ten available heroes (proven at the time of writing this, but hopefully more will arrive soon). Each of them has its own class and peculiar abilities, active and passive, which make it more or less useful depending on the situation. In general, the first games, which we advise you to play against the CPU in practice mode, are used to get to know them and study your own style, which must always be oriented towards team play. Once you have entered a match, you find yourself on a small arena divided into square boxes, with different points of interest placed in symmetrical positions between them. The most important are the spawn platforms, from which to summon characters; the two bases, located on the smaller sides of the arena; and a central cross which, dominated for three consecutive rounds without interruption, causes a cannon to appear which destroys one of the three shields of the opposing base, creating a gap. In addition, the arena contains generators of energy crystals, useful for charging the super abilities of the characters, while the terrain has various roughnesses, such as spurs of rock, which create some visual variety and are useful as covers. The gameplay itself is based on a synchronous turn system: each player can make a single character act per turn, a different character from the one moved during the previous turn, without knowing what the opponent's move will be. The output of the moves of both will be contemporary and will follow a precise hierarchy: first the movements, then the attacks, then the special abilities. This is a necessary trick to make the games more interesting and to force the players to try to anticipate the enemy's moves or, at least, to influence their tactics with a careful management of the forces in the field. Passion and limits Insidia's gameplay is solid and works really well, thanks to light and well-researched mechanics, which never weigh on the action. The sporting ambition of the game is evident: everything is clean and essential, starting from the interface, the latter created with great skill, which allows you to perform all the actions with just a few clicks. The characters are balanced and, if well combined, even those apparently more difficult to manage can lead to really interesting and unexpected game situations, above all thanks to the combo system linked to passive actions. In short, from the point of view of pure game design Insidia is an excellent title. Where it lacks a bit at present is in the amount of content, which we do not hesitate to define as small. A few arenas and a few more characters wouldn't have hurt him, just as a better distribution of classes wouldn't have hurt him. In fact, one tank and one specialist in the face of four assassins does not sound very good. Another problem, certainly not due to the developers but still worth reporting, is the lack of users on the servers. At present, playing online is not very easy and, if you are interested in trying, you should go to the community on Discord. After all, trying it doesn't cost anything, since it's a free-to-play title (don't worry, you can't buy pay-to-win content with real money). The only real flaw we found is in the art direction, too Overwatch-esque. In short, the cartoon style and the characters know they have already been seen and seen again. Nothing dramatic, considering the genre, but it is probable that many crossing the screenshots do not distinguish it from the dozens of similar titles that crowd the various stores. Mind you: the graphics aren't ugly, they just don't stand out in anything and have no distinctive elements. Better to clarify so as not to run into misunderstandings.", "date": "2018-02-27", "grade": "7.8"}
