{"name": "MotoGP 20", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp-20-recensione.html", "text": "We were particularly curious to try our hand at the MotoGP 20 review, for a very simple reason: in the transition to Unreal Engine 4, made starting from the 2018 edition, the racer developed by Milestone was a bit lost, both in terms of content how much, above all, on the technical one, in particular for the inability to offer a frame rate at 60 fps. We were therefore happy to see that the new episode solves the problem, at least on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, making available the same options present in RIDE 3, with the possibility therefore to choose between a higher resolution or better performance. In the latter case, 60 frames per second are reached in a generally stable manner, which allows you to enjoy greater reactivity in terms of bike control, especially at high speeds. However, the improvements compared to MotoGP 19 are not limited to to this specific aspect and indeed embrace the game in its entirety, highlighting a clear awareness linked to the behavior of artificial intelligence, in an attempt to develop a more effective compromise between realism and immediacy, and substantially greater care as regards the animations. The developers have also redesigned the career, introducing many strategic and managerial facets aimed at keeping the interest alive from race to race, and more effectively balanced the options related to the various aesthetic customizations. Mode The MotoGP 20 start screen gives you access to five main items: Fast Mode, which includes the ability to try your hand at a single grand prix, run a time trial or start an entire championship; Career, which undoubtedly represents the fulcrum of the experience in the context of a more or less long and complex path, which can take us from the Moto3 category to the MotoGP between contracts, upgrades (managed in a very interesting way, with the hiring of personnel and the assignment of the various figures to development and research) and hard work on the track; Multiplayer, which also provides various possibilities this year, including the selection of a lobby, the creation of public or private matches, the Race Director mode and the novelty of bots that can fill rooms in the absence of sufficient human players. Then there are the Historical Mode, composed in this case of daily challenges with a variable degree of difficulty that allow you to obtain a currency that can be spent for unlocking classic drivers and teams; and finally Personalization, through which you can access the editors for the aesthetic modification of riders, helmets, numbers, teams and stickers. On the front of the categories, the MotoE and the Red Bull Rookies Class have been replaced (but will return thanks to a free update) in favor of as many variants of the MotoGP, specifically the 500cc two-stroke and the historic four-stroke MotoGP. From a content point of view, therefore, we are faced with a very solid and full-bodied edition, although the classic scenarios have been weakened compared to the past and organized in a different way. Gameplay The MotoGP 20 driving model confirms the historic qualities of the franchise and, in general, Milestone's typical approach to the genre. There are in fact three main adjustments to increase the degree of simulation of the experience, but to these are added a large number of supplementary options that affect not only the control of the bike and the realism of its reactions, but also the attitude of the opponents on the track. These aspects are also assisted by the real-time changes to the electronics, made much clearer by a simplified and easily readable interface, as well as by the progression itself between the categories: get used to the rhythms of Moto3 and then suddenly try your hand at a MotoGP is destabilizing, so even in this situation it is possible to appreciate a very well implemented gradual approach, which accompanies less experienced users by holding them by the back and then slowly disassembling the proverbial wheels of the bike. This path obviously requires a little time and attention, but it can give great satisfaction and produces effective results on the track, even if only considering the delivery in the corners or the management of the manual ratios for a better pick-up. Then there is a whole series of further facets which fall within a purely simulation sphere, and which range from tire consumption to the more banal fuel consumption (watch out for the power setting, you could find yourself dry a few meters from the finish line !). In short, there is really a lot of irons in the fire and it is interesting to note how the developers have managed in such a waythe opponents' artificial intelligence makes more sense, which once again uses machine learning to deal with the different situations but does so in a more humanized context, perhaps less realistic but capable of creating different sequences than usual, such as the opponent going long or crashing into another driver resulting in an accident. Playstation 4 trophies There are 51 Trophies available in MotoGP 20. Most of them can be obtained simply by successfully completing the various grand prix, successfully facing the multiplayer mode and the historical challenges, but also by completing the career and dedicating time to the tests time and performance in general. Technical realization The presence of an option to activate 60 frames per second, as mentioned unfortunately only available on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, was a mandatory requirement in a trend that considers this aspect to be an essential starting point. Beyond this, as mentioned, MotoGP 20 introduces a large number of new animations and appreciable attention to detail, which make the experience substantially more beautiful to see and experience. Some movements of the riders on the track break the monotony of the pre-established positions, but also the gestures of enthusiasm at the finish line and the victory celebrations help to raise the general level, it's just a pity they don't have more variations. For the rest, the greater ~body~ of the graphics in terms of effects is confirmed, especially when it rains, but in clear weather the surfaces continue to appear a little too flat and HDR was better exploited to enhance everything in terms of lighting . The lack of dynamic weather, it was explained to us, also depends on practical issues: the sudden arrival of a storm would imply a stop of the race, therefore proceeding in that direction would mean giving up a further portion of realism and embracing an arcade setting which at the moment is still far from the formula of the game. Finally, as regards the audio sector, music and effects appear completely functional to the action, without acute details, while we would have liked Guido Meda's technical commentary to be more varied, perhaps with some consideration scattered throughout the competition as well as the usual set of introductions and closing sentences.", "date": "2020-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
