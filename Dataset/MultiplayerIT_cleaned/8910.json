{"name": "Leggeri come una balena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96067-whale-trail-leggeri-come-una-balena.html", "text": "Tested version: iPad Simplicity and immediacy, we will never get tired of saying it, are undoubtedly the fundamental ingredients for the success of a game on the iOS platform; by distorting (at least in part) the priorities of normal video games, the Apple universe has in fact proposed real revolutions in terms of gameplay in recent years. A title like Jetpack Joyride for example (but it's just one of many citable ones) has given, and continues to do so, hours of genuine fun with a formula that is as brilliant as it is intuitive. ~Endless Running~, or endless run, is the name that this type of production takes, in which there is no effective end of the various levels but on the contrary a continuous, uninterrupted, run-up to ever higher scores until the inevitable defeat. In Whale Trail the protagonist of this endless race is a nice flying whale, cheerful but, given its size, also exceptionally agile. A flying cetacean! Willow, this is the name of the graceful aquatic mammal around which the events of Whale Trail revolve, has the particular gift of making very high jumps, then gliding in the air thanks to the fast waving of its tail. The secret that allows this movement is the rainbow trail that Willow leaves behind her, caused by contact with numerous color bubbles encountered along the way. The colored spheres therefore feed the spirit of the cetacean and, consequently, the player's task will be to assimilate them for as long as possible through the infinite and tortuous path to be faced. The simplicity of approach, mentioned several times, is also realized on this occasion thanks to the control system chosen: a single tap, in any part of the screen, in fact serves to make the tail perform a small extra thrust, so as to make gain altitude to the young whale; with each release of cons you gradually lose altitude and propulsive force. The only quirk, so to speak, left to Willow's movements is a sort of somersault, which can be performed by pressing the screen longer; a stylistic gesture which, however, in the course of the adventure also takes on a concrete value, allowing the recovery of otherwise unattainable bonuses and spheres. In addition to the fundamental colored balls, crossing the blue expanses it is possible to meet pinwheel-shaped bonuses, useful for going even higher, but also particular larger stars. Once touched, the latter will follow the protagonist for the rest of the race; however, upon reaching the sixth stored star, a sort of super mode will be activated in which Willow will be able to overcome any opponent and collect many more rainbow spheres at the same time. The presence of obstacles on the celestial vault is represented by ugly and gloomy black clouds (the Thunder Bros) in the pay of the villain Baron Von Barry, full of rain and lightning: dodging them, especially moving forward on the journey, gradually becomes an increasingly arduous, so much so as to require almost millimeter calculations in predicting Willow's movements. However, after each more complicated section, generally coinciding with the end of one of the 7 kingdoms into which the world of Rainbow Land is divided, an ~Exit Friend~ will come to your aid, a guide who will give you a straight trail of simple colored spheres along the way to be conquered because they have no enemies nearby. As mentioned in the introduction therefore, in Whale Trail there is no story to finish but, to enter the world rankings, it is necessary to add up a very large amount of points; therefore the multiplication factors become fundamental, obtainable by maintaining a certain constancy in the accumulation of colored circles and never coming into contact with the black clouds (4 lightning bolts in fact will cause Game Over). Consistently with what has been said up to this point, from a technical point of view there is very little or nothing to report: the predominant element, such as to make the Ustwo Studio production pleasant to the eye, is certainly the level design, which gives a sort of setting halfway between the fantastic and the dreamlike; everything is (obviously) very colorful, fresh and pleasant, a definitely successful amalgam. However, the honorable mention goes to the beautiful and inspired soundtrack sung by Gruff Rhys of ~Super Furry Animals~, an artist well known among English independent music lovers even if, up to now, not as famous outside the restricted circle of enthusiasts. It remains to point out the important support for Game Center objectives and, above all, the willingness of the developers to update and maintain interest in their digital creature through regular updates.
