Interactive Entertainment accused by PC gamers of having abandoned them and treated them as second-class users, the American company seems to have decided to run for cover (better late than never) to also offer fans who own a computer an edition of Mortal Kombat finally complete and free from many of the defects that have tormented Mortal Kombat X. In this sense, the American publisher has turned to QLOC, a Polish development team famous for its good console porting to PC, such as Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition and Street Fighter X Tekken. The goal was in fact to optimize certain elements related to the technological part, including the netcode, so as to offer a better conversion than that of the ~old~ Mortal Kombat X. In fact, by applying the patch that recalibrates some aspects of gameplay in general, and by downloading Mortal Kombat XL (or the various possible combinations), PC users can get a practically new and completely different game, with all the extra content previously released within various packs on consoles, including the Medieval Skin Pack , the arena The Pit (La Fossa) and the two Kombat Packs that expand the already vast roster of characters. Mortal Kombat XL finally gives PC users a complete and refined edition of the famous fighting game Blood in the arena In this sense, the various Tremors, Jason Voorhees from the films Friday the 13th, Triborg, Bo'Rai Cho, the Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series and the xenomorphic alien from Alien are added to all the Mortal Kombat X characters. Each of them, like every element of the cast, is present with various alternative costumes, Fatalities, Brutalities and three different fighting styles (four in the case of Triborg) which vary their combos, special moves and style. From the point of view of the mechanics, the title obviously remains anchored to key elements such as a certain spectacularity and speed, even if it does not disdain to give technicalities to those who are willing to dedicate a little more time to it to learn every single move. and that maybe they are willing to play it at more advanced difficulty levels. From this point of view it should be highlighted how the filing work done by the developers on some aspects of gameplay, which has been partly recalibrated, works quite well, making the experience more complete, although obviously it does not overturn or revolutionize it. In fact, the structure remains unchanged, but there have been some interventions performed on general parameters such as air attacks, and on each character on the roster, with changes that have concerned, depending on the case, parameters such as resistance or negative effects or positive aspects of certain hitboxes, the ability of some special techniques to sustain or not a certain number of hits before being interrupted, variations in the number of frames of advantage, disadvantage or recovery of certain moves, and so on. For example, the xenomorphic alien from Alien is less powerful than before, especially in some types of moves that can be performed with the tail, while perhaps a couple of Sub Zero's techniques have a slightly lower stun effect in terms of duration. All in favor of a gameplay that could be a bit different in some situations in the eyes of hardcore gamers who have played the pre-patch version, but which in reality is not too much, overall. Everything is then corroborated by that massive dose of violence tending to caricature that has always characterized the saga, and by a series of other factors that embellish its mechanics. Physics undoubtedly plays an important role among these, definitely capable of restoring the sensation of giving and receiving real blows, as well as controlling now massive, now more agile bodies, depending on the size of the character. Likewise the implementation of running, which has also been recalibrated so that it is more difficult to sprint and recover afterwards, and the possibility of interacting with some elements of the scenario, which can be used to your advantage to try to gain momentum for a attack, escape from a combo or as a melee weapon, give players the opportunity to try new ways in approaching certain phases of the match, and in trying new combinations of moves. These gameplay elements are then joined by all the more traditional ones, from the devastating X-Ray, attacks that can be activated after filling the appropriate indicator with which to reduce the vital energy of a challenger by literally breaking his bones, to the Brutality, to be performed in particular conditions to mutilate the now annihilated adversary, and thus immediately put an end to the fight. Even more violentand they are the Stage Brutalities, to be done by exploiting some elements of the scenario, not to be confused with the Stage Fatalities, which are present in three arenas, namely Il Kovo, The refugee camp and the old, dear Fossa, in addition to the inevitable Fatalities, which in particular cases, at the end of the match, allow the winner to wreak havoc on the opponent's defenseless body, with often out of his mind solutions. Cleaning and filings As we said in the introduction, the work of the developers on PC also concerned the technical part. From this point of view, this version of Mortal Kombat XL rewards the efforts of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment which has managed to eliminate most of the defects that had plagued Mortal Kombat X on computers. Starting with the crashes and framerate problems that occurred not only during certain matches, but also in the story mode, which can now be played without worries. Significant improvements also in the graphics sector, which, however, is not distorted compared to what was seen on the console. In this sense, while being able to count on a few more filters and effects, as well as possibly on higher resolutions (we played it at native 1080p with all the graphic details and post-processing effects at their maximum, without drops in frame rate ), as a whole the graphics do not differ much from the original one. The differences are certainly difficult to notice, especially during frenetic battles, even if it is undeniable that the best PC resources still enhance the details better than on the console, especially in the cutscenes or in less chaotic moments. Apart from some slight artifacts that appear from time to time, mainly when there is a sudden cut and you switch from one shot to another, we have not noticed any particular visual defects such as to compromise the good overview of the product or to create problems for its correct use. For the rest, the characters remain well modeled and aesthetically, some more, some less, well characterized, including the newcomers. Their appearance changes a little depending on the fighting style adopted, or totally in relation to the selected skin. In the same way, the scenarios offer a good level of detail, and here too the visual benefits of the PC version mainly concern the presence of some higher resolution textures, which help to enhance the various arenas from a visual point of view, especially the more suggestive as the Kovo, with its quay lashed by the waves of the stormy sea, with a vessel stranded among the rocks in the background and the corpses that leap out of the water pushed by the violence of the sea motion, or the Dead Forest at night, with the wolves running around in the background against the light, and an almost magical atmosphere which certainly also contributes to the good use of lights, shadows and atmospheric effects. The sound sector is also excellent, boasting some valid audio effects, a good dubbing in Italian for the most part well recited even during the fights, apart from some situations which, like in the original, did not convince us too much in terms of tone and acting, and a column sound characterized by tracks belonging to various musical genres, each of which, however, capable of adequately ~accompanying~ the various encounters and situations in the interlude scenes, especially during the story mode. The latter is one of the most interesting in the game, with its cinematic cut where a logical sense is given to the presence of old and new wrestlers on the roster, and interactive scenes with the classic QTEs. Equally valid are the Factions and Towers modes. In the first, users can choose to be part of one of five groups available in the game, namely Black Dragon, The Brotherhood of Shadow, Lin Kuei, Special Forces and White Lotus, and contribute to its success through a series of weekly performances both offline and online. In the second, the user can fight in different Towers where he can face different types of ~competitions~, including the one called Klassic which refers to the traditional arcade climb, or the inevitable skill tests on strength and luck, complete with random modifiers to condition the trend. Not to mention the online options, such as Living Towers, where the game conditions are dynamic and are periodically and automatically updated via the internet connection, and the classic one-on-one classified, friendly and private matches, or in teams, or the King of the Hill. By the way, the netcode finally seemed stable and therefore worked quite well: evidently the transition to netcode rollback solutions works properly, and rarely during our prova we encountered lag problems, having an all in all positive experience fighting a few matches.", "date": "2016-10-07", "grade": "8.8"}
