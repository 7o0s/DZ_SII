But despite the high-sounding name of the competition, the Arc System Works, the software house that gave birth to the Guilty Gear saga, offers with Battle Fantasia a classic-style fighting game that fits right into the category dominated by the Capcom product. A troubled genesis that of Battle Fantasia which saw its first release in the arcades of Japan even two years ago, then re-proposed a year later in its version for home consoles initially published only in the land of the East and then reached the western markets only in 2009. Fantasy melting pot As per tradition, the Arc System Works designers gave free rein to their creativity for the characterization of the Battle Fantasia fighters. It is clear how he is fully captured by Japanese fantasy all flavored in pop sauce, the characters fully reflect the best known oriental stereotypes: we are dealing with cat-women, gothic lolitas, pink princesses, giant dwarfs, pirates hooked, black knights, warrior children, effeminate clerics and other various amenities, all offered with a taste for excess and the grotesque that Guilty Gear fans will know well. Battle Fantasia is a distinctly Japanese game and seems to want to accentuate this belonging in every aspect starting from the dubbing strictly in the original language and accompanied by subtitles localized in Italian. Lovers of more sober representations close to the western style will probably find it difficult to digest many design choices, but it is clear how the target of this kind of production is first and foremost aimed at oriental users despite the increasingly widespread trend (particularly in coveted jrpg) that wants to wink at the tastes of American and European players. In Battle Fantasia everything is pushed to excess and it is denoted right from the artwork visible in the character selection screen. But beyond personal aesthetic tastes Battle Fantasia offers an unsuspected solidity in the component that makes the real difference between a successful fighting game and a failure, it is with the pad in hand that you can appreciate the work done on such a game. The Arc System Works product looks like a classic faux 3D fighting game where, despite the polygonal rendering of environments and characters, the fight always develops on the usual horizontal axis, the control system gravitates around the four keys of the pad used as per tradition for two weak and two strong attacks here simply called A, B, C, D and the combination of these with the familiar ~crescent~ movements of the analog allows the execution of the peculiar moves for each character (and here one would almost cry ~Hadoken!~) . The move compartment of each character (although not exceeding in quantity) stands on good levels of variety so as to make each fighter unique in his way of facing the clash, there are no twin characters differentiated only in the polygonal model, here we are dealing with an extreme differentiation that goes from agile and fast characters to real tanks as slow in their movements as they are devastating in their attacks (and cumbersome on the screen). The game also betrays a curious affinity with the Japanese role-playing tradition, in fact each character will have a numerical indicator under their energy bar (the capacity of which also varies according to the type of fighter) obviously called HP, they are also visible on the screen the figures of the damage inflicted with each attack, a solution closer to an RPG than to a fighting game. Xbox 360 goals Battle Fantasia offers 20 points for completing the story of each character, other points are intended for completing the arcade mode in the various difficulty levels, obtaining all the secondary costumes and for certain actions to be performed in battle often contextualized to the character used . Gachi, Heat Up, etc To deepen the combat system contributes the use of the back buttons intended for the execution of thrusts / grips or for the use of Gachi, a sort of parry that allows you to avoid the opponent's attack and even to reject him against the end of the stage. The use of the Gachi is certainly not easy to learn and requires a considerable timing of execution but it is certainly essential playing at the highest difficulty levels where the simple parry is not always sufficient to keep us safe from the opposing offensives. Another peculiar feature (nnot too much actually) is the presence of a bar at the bottom of the screen called MP which increases as we inflict damage to the opponent and which can be filled three times, this can be used for the execution of particularly super moves effective whose execution is underlined by a dedicated direction, exactly as it happens in Street Fighter IV. Another way to take advantage of the MP bar is the use of Heat Up, a mode in which the character shines with yellow light which gives him the ability to launch much more powerful attacks than normal or in some cases to resort to real attacks unpublished. We have already talked about how much Battle Fantasia struggled to get to the tray of our consoles, a labor that lasted two years, that is, since the game was released in the arcade version. Since then, water has passed under the bridge so that today the technical sector could only be aged and the direct comparison with the Capcom masterpiece is extremely merciless. Battle Fantasia features modestly made models, very essential both in terms of polygonal load and effects, forget about fluttering drapery or other effects, everything is reduced to the essentials, including scenarios that suffer from a certain static nature. To raise the general impact, the use of cel shading and a palette of warm colors useful for covering the technical gap that a race for realism would have inevitably accentuated helps. However, it should be said that the on-screen action is always fluid and the frame rate never drops. Another aspect that is a direct consequence of the first arcade incarnation of the game is the essentiality of the game modes. There are only the classic Arcade, Versus, Survival and a Story mode that tells the story of the various characters without offering particular narrative cues while offering sporadic elements of typically Japanese hilarity. Being a new brand, it is understandable how the protagonists of the game cannot boast of backgrounds as thick as those of other more illustrious ~colleagues~. The online gaming component relies on a netcode that rarely compromises the gaming experience, but the low presence of players is currently a strong limitation. Without infamy and without praise is also the sound sector that does not come close to the glories achieved by the Guilty Gear series.", "date": "2009-04-14", "grade": "6.5"}
