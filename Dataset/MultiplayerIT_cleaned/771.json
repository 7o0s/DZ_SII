{"name": "Top Spin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-recensione.html", "text": "Tennis elbow In Top Spin you can play sixteen of the most famous champions of world tennis, perfect strangers created by PAMs or characters created ad hoc using the internal editor. Among the truly existing athletes we find truly excellent names, and renewed compared to the past editions: for example the legendary Pete Sampras has given way to the current ATP number one Roger Federer, Michael Chang to Carlos Moya, Anna Kournikova (who really a gamble to call ~tennis player~) to the snooty and spoiled Maria Sharapova and so on. In addition to being able to set the classic options, you can choose Exhibition (single game), Custom Tournament, Career (which we will discuss in detail shortly), Online (Xbox Live! has been replaced by Gamespy servers) and Tennis School (a sort of video - tutorial on the various strokes that can be performed). The atavistic absence of mixed doubles is incomprehensible, a gap that has not been filled even in this PS2 version. The hub of the whole game is, of course, the career mode. The character creation editor has been integrated with the possibility of acquiring the player's face via an Eye-toy camera, but otherwise it seems even worse: if in some respects it puts us in front of a huge amount of available choices , for others he is damned stingy (for example there are only a few haircuts, of which at least a dozen are horrendous and another half dozen very, very similar to each other). Once the digital alter-ego has been created, you will find yourself on the world map (or rather the area of the world that you have chosen as your hometown), from where you can access tournaments, shops, airports, offices of the various sponsors and coaches' houses. In Top Spin, the created character has 20 ~star~ slots, divided into 5 for each of the 4 basic skills: serve, volley, forehand and backhand. Throughout his career your tennis player will only be able to collect 14 stars to be assigned to the 20 slots, therefore, realistically, he will not be able to become a master in all the basic skills (rule also valid for existing tennis players except for Roger Federer and Martina Higins , which have 15 stars each). the character creation editor has been integrated with the ability to capture the player's face via an Eye-toy camera Tennis elbow Added to this are also 16 skills, among which only 4 can be collected and which are obtained by gaining experience in the international circuit. They improve the athlete in certain respects, and serve in particular to compensate for the weaknesses of the skills: at the achievement of a skill you will be asked to choose between four different possibilities, for example speed, accuracy, ability to respond to jokes, ability in the power of the joke. While to achieve the skills you just need to play and gain experience, for the basic skills you need to contact the various coaches around the world and, for a fee, be taught. For each star, the coach on duty will require that you pass it in a test: if you manage to pass it, the star will be ensured, otherwise you can try again later (the lesson, however, will have to be paid for anyway). And at this point comes the first major flaw of Top Spin, once again not corrected in this new version: the trials, despite costing money (a lot of money at high levels), are a little too easy to overcome and allow the player to power up too quickly. Within four or five hours of play you will already be able to have the character pumped to the maximum, which certainly does not help the realism and enjoyment of a career that should develop slowly and with sacrifice. To climb the world rankings you have to win the various tournaments around the globe (divided into Minor Pro, Pro, Major Pro and Grand Slam): also in this case you gain positions a little too quickly, and without too much effort. However, these competitions are quite numerous, and of course they can be repeated several times. The career mode leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, making one regret a precise and more realistic organization of the tournaments and the ~timeline~. Even if not perfect, the old career-mode of Sega Tennis 2k2 is preferable, where it took several hours of play to get to the top and pumping skills cost a certain amount of effort. Loop along the line Generally, Top Spin is quite similar to Virtua Tennis 2. The controls are fairly reactive, precise and immediate: getting a basic mastery of the tennis player will be easy for any neophyte, but it is by continuing to play that you will notice a slightly more marked realism and of the good depth that distinguishes thePAM branded tennis. By making top spins, cut shots or, especially, risky shots, the chances of missing aim rise vertically, especially if the character has no particular skills. Meeting opponents of a certain skill, one realizes that without a minimal game tactic one does not go very far: often one finds oneself forced to adapt to the rival's game, study it during the first games to discover all the weak points and come up with reasoned strategies to get the better of it. Learning to use all the shots in the digital alter-ego's repertoire will be almost necessary in order not to remedy a series of bad impressions, especially if you play against a human opponent. This tactical and reasoned component, which gives a certain depth to the playability of Top Spin, is among those aspects that more than others manage to convince. The spectacular nature of a match played at high levels is remarkable: passers along the line, perfectly dosed short balls, deadly aces, impossible recoveries... this game has all of this and even more. Between one point and another you can cheer, mock your opponent or perform blatant gestures of disappointment thanks to the ~attitude~ buttons. learning to use all the shots in the digital alter-ego's repertoire will be almost necessary in order not to remedy a series of bad impressions Loop along the line Among the most evident defects we find the lob, which sometimes makes the ball leave a little too quickly and makes it go back down as if the earth's gravity had increased, leaving little escape to the unfortunate opponent on duty, and the impossibility of changing type shooting once a key has been pressed: in a nutshell, if you had pressed X and before the ball arrived you changed your mind and wanted to lob with the triangle, this would not be possible. A good game then, but to be honest, two years after its first appearance, gameplay like this is starting to show its side a bit, and not being supported by an adequate career mode, it gives too much of the impression that you have in your hands a title too arcade. Compared to the original on Xbox there is the impression that the physics of the ball and the movements of the players are slightly ~muffled~, however two of the biggest flaws are the slowness of the menus and, above all, of the uploads: if on Xbox one of them could last even more than 10 seconds, on PS2 the situation has considerably worsened, and counting also the addition of accesses to the memory card to save (even these very slow, since the save file is quite large), one can say without fear of denial that those wishing to play Top Spin must prepare themselves for truly exhausting waiting times. Even from the point of view of multiplayer, things get significantly worse. While on the Microsoft console this mode was one of the main reasons that prompted many users to buy the game, thanks to an excellent Live! basically, on PS2 the connections pass through the Gamespy servers (as happened for PC), which do not prove to be adequate for such a title: high latencies and difficulties in finding the game rooms are unfortunately the order of the day. Better a sane local multiplayer with a multitap. Graphics and sound The technical sector, especially from a graphic point of view, cannot keep up with that of the original version: the polygonal complexity has decreased, moreover the textures are less defined and generally quite washed out. The animations have remained the same as we have already admired on Xbox: jokes, dives, speed bumps, jump smashes, ~skid~ on the ground with a dust lift in tow ... all reproduced with a naturalness that we had seen so far, in reduced doses, on the Sega rival. To reinforce the already excellent quality of the animations there are some touches of class, as in the case of serves: the four predefined serving styles, attributable to the male character created with the editor, reflect, if my tennis memory serves me correctly, respectively the movements of Agassi, Edberg, John McEnroe (this is really unmistakable) and Boris Becker. The environments, on the other hand, seem a bit subdued, with poorly defined audiences and sparse buildings. Speaking of the sound, it must be said that the only music present are those in the menus and in the career mode map, rather melodious and catchy. The sound effects are adequate, but many of them are not of excellent quality and seem to be sampled in low frequency. Final comment Despite a worrying shortage of tennis titles, Top Spin arrives on PS2 but fails to dominate. The resemblance to Sega Tennis 2k2 and the obvious defects it carries with it prevent the PAM game from establishing itself, and arouse various perplexities. TOn the end of 2005, a worse version of Top Spin certainly can't collect the same success it had at the time on Xbox and ultimately, those of you who already own Sega Tennis 2k2 might find it wiser to spend your hard-earned savings on other ways.Pros Good arcade gameplay but deep enough Worrying lack of other good tennis titles Cons Exhausting loading and accessing the memory card Graphics under tone Career mode to be completely reviewed In the history of video games we find that inexplicably a rather small number of titles have been dedicated to some particular genres, moreover made with poor quality. In recent times, for example, the discipline of tennis has been rather mistreated by the world of videogames, so much so that the only truly valid games in recent years have been Virtua Tennis 2 on Playstation 2 and Top Spin on Xbox (later converted to PC with unexciting results). When it was still in development on Xbox, I didn't put a lot of faith in the Top Spin project, which seemed to me a title all about technical realization and Live support. Time proved me wrong, and Top Spin turned out to be a sort of must-have for all tennis-loving Uncle Bill box owners. After more than two years after its release on the Microsoft home console, however, PAM's tennis is preparing to conquer the tray of the black monolith, and contrary to what the undoubted quality seen in the original title might suggest, it won't be a walk of health.", "date": "2005-11-02", "grade": null}
