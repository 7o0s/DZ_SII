{"name": "Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-11-aftermath-recensione-espansione.html", "text": "The review of Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath is very different from those normally dedicated to fighting game DLCs, which are reduced to specials on some extra characters, balance tweaks or - in the best case - to the entire combat system, with some modes addition that barely justifies the purchase price. Aftermath, the expansion of Mortal Kombat 11 that has just been released, instead represents a much more difficult beast to tame, in line with the characteristics, to say the least, atypical of the fighting game that is its basis. The latest creature of NetherRealm, on the other hand, is one of the few titles of this genre to have truly triple A production values: a monstrous product from the point of view of the contents and the technical sector, only minimally diminished by some unfortunate choices related to the unlockable elements, and some pieces of the combat system that are rather irritating for some enthusiasts (albeit iconic in part). In line with these characteristics, Aftermath therefore decides to focus on the campaign, often neglected or approached with superficiality by direct competitors, and arises as a direct continuation of the main storyline. However, the novelties of the package are not limited to a few more hours of history: the expansion expands and improves the game in many aspects. Follow us on this magical journey through spinning guts, broken bones, and saxophone players with mechanical arms; there is a lot to talk about. Never trust a sorcerer Let's start right from the story, because although Mortal Kombat 11 seemed in all respects a final chapter, Aftermath makes the courageous choice to start from one of the game's endings to further explore its universe and characters. If you haven't finished the previous title we warn you, here we enter the realm of spoilers, so go ahead to the next paragraph; if, on the other hand, you have already completed the main campaign, know that it starts a few moments after Liu Kang's triumph over Kronika, with ours being stopped before the creation of a new (and more peaceful) universe by three fighters who up to that moment had had very little centrality in the events: Shang Tsung, Nightwolf and the god of wind Fujin. Trapped by Kronika in the void and freed at the time of her defeat, the three arrive at the historical hero of the series after having observed all that has happened, and with a heavy request: immediately stop the reset of the universe, since having destroyed the crown of the evil Titanide Liu cannot control the sands of the great hourglass of time. So a mission into the past under the orders of Shang Tsung, the only man able to recover the crown without too many problems, and equipped with the cunning necessary to defeat the goddess in any case. There's just one small problem... Shang Tsung is one of the most dangerous villains ever seen in Mortal Kombat, and his betrayal is a practical certainty. This premise, unsurprisingly, has just the right mix of crap and absurdity that we've come to love in more recent Mortal Kombats, and indeed we liked the Aftermath campaign, despite being shorter and slightly less exciting than that of the base game. Pass over the inconsistencies and the almost total lack of refined writing: everything here is designed to mess up and arrive with a bang at the inevitable final conflict, with the charismatic Shang Tsung by Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa (the same as the first film dedicated to the saga, for who does not know) to support a good part of the barrack. Truly an addition worthy of praise, in short, which perhaps retraces events already seen a little too much, but undoubtedly manages to do what it has to without a hitch. The general quality of movies, dubbing (also in Italian) and technical sector, moreover, is of the same level (if not better at times) than that seen previously, demonstrating the fact that we are not faced with a rushed job, but with a extra created with all the trappings. Los tres caballeros Aftermath rightly takes advantage during the campaign of characters that only appeared later in the game through the Kombat Packs, also allowing you to take on the role of a couple of notable new entries such as Fujin and Sheeva. The completely new characters offered, however, are even three, with Robocop closing the circle as a ~guest~. After the various DLCs, these choices make the Mortal Kombat 11 roster one of the most complete around (especially considering the possibility of customizing the fighters and the presence of three competitive combinations for each warrior), but we must say that they have partly disappointed, because where Sheeva and Fujin are very well done, in our opinion Robocop has not been able to respect the hype that has accrued itaccompanied since the reveal. Let's explain: Fujin is one of the most interesting additions seen in the game so far, thanks to atypical movement skills that allow him to perform lightning-fast sudden attacks during combos, or directly interrupt moves with air walks, area tornadoes and a sort of levitation. It's a tough fighter to use compared to many others, yet it's so diverse and malleable that we have no doubt it will put up a show in the hands of skilled players. Sheeva, for her part, is much more basic, maintains her classic unstoppable stomp, and has two variations out of three that are easy to use but remarkably effective. Her more complex variation offers her a tough enough stance to exploit properly, capable of completely transforming her offensive making it much more unpredictable than normal. In general? He's a very suitable character for any type of player, who especially in the hands of those who don't like moves with monstrously complicated execution has a good chance of shining. Robocop, on the other hand, bored us very quickly due to its almost totally zoning-oriented nature. All his specializations are effective from a distance, with basic combinations and a lot of focus on space control, and that in itself wouldn't even be a problem... if it weren't for the fact that most of his moves are recycled from other characters (even the his most original instruments are direct references to Cyrax and Sektor). A pity, because ours is particularly cared for from an aesthetic point of view, and undoubtedly deserved greater customization in styles (not to mention that online it will plausibly be annoying at rare levels). The power of friendship If the additional story is a discreet center and the new characters only a partial success, however, it is difficult to complain about the rest of the additions, given that this work by NetherRealm reinserts some goodies loudly requested by the fans into the game (which can also be used in part by those who do not own Aftermath) such as Friendships and environmental Fatalities. They are references to the past that can only please us, absolutely hilarious at times, and always painstakingly cared for. A nice rapprochement with the roots, which demonstrates NetherRealm's will to make Mortal Kombat 11 a sort of almost definitive modern chapter. For those who love competitive online - and it is always good to remember how this fighting game has one of the best netcodes around - Aftermath also arrives in conjunction with a remarkable balancing patch, which has changed many game balances. If we talk about tweaks to the characters, most of the choices made are extremely logical, with sacrosanct buffs and very justified rehashes to too dominant warriors. The most striking change, however, is linked to the addition of the ~armor break~ moves, attacks capable of damaging the opponent during the (fundamental) interruptions of the combos, or other invulnerable maneuvers. These moves tremendously change the balance during matches, making the use of running away from enemy strikes much more risky, but at the same time their inclusion in the system has not been the most brilliant, since while it is true that practically all the characters have obtained at least one move of this type, some of them have found it in practically unused specializations. Since this is a novelty, we imagine that things will be further tweaked in the future, yet certain solutions are objectively difficult to explain from the outside. Of course, at the moment it is impossible to predict the real impact on the competitive scene (also because this is practically paralyzed due to the coronavirus) so we save ourselves future forecasts until the tournaments restart.", "date": "2020-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
